<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/10, the Human Rights Council decided to appoint an 
Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a 
safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. In March 2013, the Independent Expert 
submitted a scoping report to the Council that described the evolution of the relationship 
between human rights and the environment (A/HRC/22/43). The report explained that the 
principal goal of the Independent Expert in the second year of his mandate would be to map 
human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable 
environment.  
</p>
<p>2. To that end, the Independent Expert carried out extensive research and held four 
regional consultations, in Nairobi, Geneva, Panama City and Copenhagen. (The 
Copenhagen consultation was with individuals from countries in Asia and Europe.) The 
consultations enabled the Independent Expert to hear the views of interested stakeholders, 
including Governments, international bodies, national human rights institutions, civil 
society organizations, the private sector and academic institutions. Each of the consultations 
addressed a particular theme: procedural rights and duties, substantive rights and duties, 
members of groups in vulnerable situations, and the integration of human rights and the 
environment into international institutions.  
</p>
<p>3. Section II of the present document describes the mapping process in more detail, 
section III identifies human rights threatened by environmental harm, and section IV 
describes human rights obligations relating to the environment.  
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert also addressed the other aspects of the mandate in 2013. 
He worked with the United Nations Environment Programme and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) as they developed an inter-
agency programme to identify and disseminate information about good practices in the use 
of human rights obligations relating to environmental protection.1 The four regional 
consultations all discussed good practices as well as obligations. A country visit to Costa 
Rica in September 2013 also identified good practices, which are described in the separate 
report on that visit. Further consultations on good practices are planned for 2014 in South 
Africa, Thailand and the United States of America.2 Good practices will also be identified 
through other methods, such as sending a questionnaire to interested stakeholders. The goal 
is to prepare a compendium of good practices by March 2015.  
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert has contributed a human rights perspective to follow-up 
processes to the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and has 
made recommendations towards realization of the Millennium Development Goals, by 
participating in the post-2015 global thematic consultation on environmental sustainability, 
and in a side-event on human rights and the environment held on 12 December 2013 at the 
sixth session of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. He has 
recommended that the Sustainable Development Goals incorporate a human rights-based 
approach to environmental protection. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The inter-agency programme prefers the term &#8220;good practice&#8221; to &#8220;best practice&#8221;, recognizing that in 
</p>
<p>many situations it will not be possible to identify a single &#8220;best&#8221; approach. In order for a practice to 
be considered &#8220;good&#8221;, it must integrate human rights and environmental standards in an exemplary 
manner.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 The consultation in the United States will be held at Yale University, in conjunction the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Institute for Training and Research.  </p>


<p>6. The Independent Expert has also supported the efforts of others working to integrate 
human rights and environmental considerations. He participated in the Asia-Europe 
Meeting seminar on human rights and the environment, addressed the International Bar 
Association and met with its working group on human rights and climate change, and spoke 
to a meeting of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean considering a regional 
agreement on implementation of principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development. He has worked with the Harvard Human Rights Center as it develops a 
&#8220;knowledge platform&#8221; to describe cases in which human rights were brought to bear on 
environmental issues, and with the Universal Rights Group to develop a programme of 
meetings and reports highlighting the issues facing environmental human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Mapping human rights obligations relating  
to the environment 
</b></p>
<p>7. In order to fulfil the request made by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 
19/10 that the Independent Expert &#8220;study the human rights obligations, including non-
discrimination obligations, relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and 
sustainable environment,&#8221; he reviewed a wide range of sources of human rights law. 
Scholars had previously examined some, but not all, of these sources. While recognizing 
the importance of the previous scholarly work, the Independent Expert undertook a fresh 
examination of the primary materials. To ensure that the study was as thorough as possible, 
he sought and received substantial pro bono assistance from academics and international 
law firms. With their help, thousands of pages of materials were reviewed, including texts 
of agreements, declarations and resolutions; statements by international organizations and 
States; and interpretations by tribunals and treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>8. The relevant statements are described in 14 reports, each devoted to a particular 
source or set of sources. Before being finalized, the reports were edited in light of the 
regional consultations and were reviewed by outside experts. The reports are available both 
at the OHCHR website3 and the Independent Expert&#8217;s personal website.<footnote name="4">0

</p>
<p>9. The reports fall into four major categories: (a) United Nations human rights bodies 
and mechanisms; (b) global human rights treaties; (c) regional human rights systems; and 
(d) international environmental instruments. 
10. Under the category of United Nations human rights bodies and mechanisms, three 
reports were prepared. The first report examines statements made by States through General 
Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions and through the universal periodic review 
process.5 A second report reviews statements and reports by 11 special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council whose mandates are particularly relevant to the nexus of human 
rights and the environment.6 They are:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context

and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and the Working 
Group on this issue, and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>11. The third report in this category examines the work of the Special Rapporteur on the 
rights of indigenous peoples, including his application of the two most important 
international instruments on the rights of indigenous peoples &#8212; the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the International Labour 
Organization&#8217;s convention No. 169 (Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989).7 <b> 
</b>12. The second category of sources comprises global human rights treaties. The five 
reports in this category examine the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.8 In addition to the text of the agreements, the reports examine relevant 
interpretations of the treaty bodies via the general comments, country reports and views on 
communications. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. The third category &#8212; regional human rights systems &#8212; includes three reports. One 
report examines the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights applying the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms to 
environmental issues.9 Another describes the relevant decisions of the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 
interpreting the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the American 
Convention on Human Rights.10 The third report includes the other major regional human 
rights systems, based on the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Arab

International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities were also reviewed, but 
the review did not produce enough relevant information to justify separate reports.

Global Studies Institute, University of Geneva. Another important source of information is the 
<i>Manual on Human Rights and the Environment,</i> second edition (2012), published by the Council of 
Europe.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>Charter on Human Rights, the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, and the European Social 
Charter.11  
</p>
<p>14. The fourth category covers international environmental instruments. It includes a 
report on global and regional environmental agreements, a report on non-binding 
environmental declarations, and a report on the Convention on Access to Information, 
Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters 
(Aarhus Convention). These instruments include duties owed to individuals that sometimes 
correspond to, and reveal practice consistent with, human rights obligations.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>15. Each of the 14 individual reports follows the same template. After an introduction 
that describes its scope, the report sets out the human rights threatened by environmental 
harm, and the human rights obligations identified by the source relating to environmental 
protection. The obligations are organized into three sections: procedural obligations, 
substantive obligations, and obligations relating to members of groups in vulnerable 
situations. Finally, the report examines cross-cutting issues, such as transboundary 
environmental harm and the role of non-State actors. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. The following sections summarize the findings of the subsidiary reports. Section III 
describes human rights threatened by environmental harm and section IV sets out human 
rights obligations relating to environmental protection, as identified by the sources 
reviewed.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights threatened by environmental harm 
</b></p>
<p>17. In his first report, the Independent Expert stated that one &#8220;firmly established&#8221; aspect 
of the relationship between human rights and the environment is that &#8220;environmental 
degradation can and does adversely affect the enjoyment of a broad range of human rights&#8221; 
(A/HRC/22/43, para. 34). As the Human Rights Council itself has stated, &#8220;environmental 
damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective 
enjoyment of human rights&#8221; (resolution 16/11). The mapping project provides 
overwhelming support for this statement. Virtually every source reviewed identifies rights 
whose enjoyment is infringed or threatened by environmental harm. 
18. For example, in the universal periodic review process, 45 States discussed the right 
to a healthy environment as recognized in their constitutions, and several identified threats 
to the enjoyment of this right, including climate change, desertification, and particular 
mining operations.12 In addition, African tribunals have held that large-scale oil 
development infringed the right to a satisfactory environment as protected by the African 
Charter.13  
</p>
<p>19. The Human Rights Committee has asked States to describe measures they have 
taken to protect the right to life from the risk of nuclear disaster and other environmental 
pollution.14 This right, like others, can be affected by natural causes as well as by human 
actions: the European Court of Human Rights has decided cases involving infringement of

<p>the right to life that occurred as a result of natural disasters and also as a result of improper 
maintenance of a municipal rubbish tip that caused a massive explosion.15 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. Many sources, including the Human Rights Council, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the special rapporteurs, the African Commission and the 
European Committee of Social Rights have identified environmental threats to the right to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Examples 
include the improper disposal of toxic wastes (Human Rights Council resolution 9/1; 
E/CN.4/2004/46, para. 79), exposure to radiation and harmful chemicals (Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 14 (2000), para. 15), oil 
pollution (African Commission, <i>Ogoniland</i> case, para. 54), and large-scale water 
pollution.16<b> 
</b></p>
<p>21. In addition, many sources have identified environmental threats to the right to an 
adequate standard of living and its components. For example, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights has identified the improper use of pesticides as a threat to the 
right to food,17 while the Special Rapporteur on the right to food has found that right to be 
threatened by pollution and habitat loss (A/67/268, paras. 17&#8211;19). The Special Rapporteur 
on hazardous substances and wastes has indicated that waste from extractive industries can 
infringe the right to water (A/HRC/21/48, para. 39), and the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
right to non-discrimination in this context has described how that right is threatened by 
climate change (A/64/255).  
22. Indeed, special rapporteurs have explained how climate change threatens a wide 
range of rights, including the rights to health, water and food.18<b> </b>An OHCHR report 
describes the implications of climate change for those rights and others, including the right 
of self-determination for peoples living in small island States (A/HRC/10/61). The Human 
Rights Council took note of the report and expressed its concern that &#8220;climate change poses 
an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has 
adverse implications for the full enjoyment of human rights&#8221; (resolution 18/22).  
23. The Human Rights Council has recognized that &#8220;environmental damage is felt most 
acutely by those segments of the population already in vulnerable situations&#8221; 
(resolution 16/11).<b> </b>The sources reviewed provide examples of environmental harm that 
particularly affects such groups. For example, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women has identified many types of environmental harm, including 
natural disasters, climate change, nuclear contamination and water pollution, that can 
adversely affect rights protected under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women.19<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur on hazardous substances and 
wastes<b> </b>has highlighted the particular dangers that exposure to mercury through artisanal 
mining poses to women in respect of their right to health (A/HRC/21/48, paras. 32, 33).  
24. The rights of children, too, may be particularly affected by environmental 
degradation. The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that environmental pollution

In its concluding observations on country reports, the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
regularly addresses environmental hazards as barriers to the realization of the right to health 
and other rights.20 The Special Rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes has 
emphasized the harm to children&#8217;s rights to health caused by exposure to mercury and other 
hazardous substances in extractive industries (A/HRC/21/48, paras. 28&#8211;30). 
25. Because of the close relationship that indigenous peoples have with nature, they can 
be uniquely vulnerable to environmental degradation. The Special Rapporteur on the rights 
of indigenous peoples has emphasized that &#8220;extractive industry activities generate effects 
that often infringe upon indigenous peoples&#8217; rights&#8221; (A/HRC/18/35, para. 26), and has 
detailed many examples of such infringement, including on their rights to life, health and 
property.21  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights obligations relating to the environment 
</b></p>
<p>26. This section sets out human rights obligations relating to the environment as they 
have been described by international agreements and the bodies charged with interpreting 
them. Although only some of these agreements explicitly refer to the environment, human 
rights bodies have increasingly applied them to environmental issues in recent years as our 
knowledge of the dangers of environmental degradation has increased. The result is a large 
and growing number of legal statements that together create a body of human rights norms 
relating to the environment.  
</p>
<p>27. The Independent Expert understands that not all States have formally accepted all of 
these norms. While some of the statements cited are from treaties, or from tribunals that 
have the authority to issue decisions that bind the States subject to their jurisdiction, other 
statements are interpretations by experts that do not in themselves have binding effect.  
Despite the diversity of the sources from which they arise, however, the statements are 
remarkably coherent. Taken together, they provide strong evidence of converging trends 
towards greater uniformity and certainty in the human rights obligations relating to the 
environment. These trends are further supported by State practice reflected in the universal 
periodic review process and international environmental instruments.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. In this light, the Independent Expert encourages States to accept these statements as 
evidence of actual or emerging international law. At a minimum, they should be seen as 
best practices that States should move to adopt as expeditiously as possible.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Procedural obligations 
</b></p>
<p>29. One of the most striking results of the mapping exercise is the agreement among the 
sources reviewed that human rights law imposes certain procedural obligations on States in 
relation to environmental protection. They include duties (a) to assess environmental 
impacts and make environmental information public; (b) to facilitate public participation in 
environmental decision-making, including by protecting the rights of expression and 
association; and (c) to provide access to remedies for harm. These obligations have bases in 
civil and political rights, but they have been clarified and extended in the environmental 
context on the basis of the entire range of human rights at risk from environmental harm.

<p><b> 1. Duties to assess environmental impacts and make information public 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 19) and the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (art. 19) state that the right to freedom of expression includes 
the freedom &#8220;to seek, receive and impart information&#8221;. The right to information is also 
critical to the exercise of other rights, including rights of participation. In the words of the 
then Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic 
and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights, the rights to 
information and participation are &#8220;both rights in themselves and essential tools for the 
exercise of other rights, such as the right to life, the right to the highest attainable standard 
of health, the right to adequate housing and others&#8221; (A/HRC/7/21, p. 2).<b> </b> 
31. Human rights bodies have repeatedly stated that in order to protect human rights 
from infringement through environmental harm, States should provide access to 
environmental information and provide for the assessment of environmental impacts that 
may interfere with the enjoyment of human rights.  
32. For example, in its general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated that individuals should be given 
full and equal access to information concerning water and the environment (para. 48), and 
in its responses to country reports, it has urged States to assess the impacts of actions that 
may have adverse environmental effects on the right to health and other rights within its 
purview.22 Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders has 
stated that information relating to large-scale development projects should be publicly 
available and accessible (A/68/262, para. 62), and the Special Rapporteur on the human 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation has stated that States need to conduct impact 
assessments &#8220;in line with human rights standards&#8221; when they plan projects that may have 
an impact on water quality (A/68/264, para. 73).23 <b> 
</b>33. Regional bodies have also concluded that States must provide environmental 
information and provide for assessments of environmental impacts on human rights. For 
example, on the basis of the right to respect for private and family life as set out in the 
European Convention on Human Rights (art. 8), the European Court has stated:  
</p>
<p>Where a State must determine complex issues of environmental and economic 
policy, the decision-making process must firstly involve appropriate investigations 
and studies in order to allow them to predict and evaluate in advance the effects of 
those activities which might damage the environment and infringe individuals&#8217; 
rights and to enable them to strike a fair balance between the various conflicting 
interests at stake. The importance of public access to the conclusions of such studies 
and to information which would enable members of the public to assess the danger 
to which they are exposed is beyond question.24  
</p>
<p>34. International instruments illustrate the importance of providing environmental 
information to the public. Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration states: &#8220;At the national level, 
each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment

<p>that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and 
activities in their communities&#8230; States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and 
participation by making information widely available.&#8221;25 Many environmental treaties, 
including the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain 
Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (art. 15), the Stockholm 
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (art. 10), and the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (art. 6(a)), require environmental information to be 
provided to the public. The Aarhus Convention includes particularly detailed obligations.26<b> 
</b>Illustrating the link between its obligations and those of human rights law, many Aarhus 
parties have discussed their compliance with that agreement in their reports under the 
universal periodic review process.27 
</p>
<p>35. Most States have adopted environmental impact assessment laws, in accordance 
with principle 17 of the Rio Declaration, which states that &#8220;environmental impact 
assessment, as a national instrument, shall be undertaken for proposed activities that are 
likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and are subject to a decision 
of a competent national authority.&#8221; The World Bank requires environmental assessment of 
all Bank-financed projects to &#8220;ensure that they are environmentally sound and 
sustainable&#8221;.28<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Duties to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making  
</b></p>
<p>36. The baseline rights of everyone to take part in the government of their country and 
in the conduct of public affairs are recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (art. 21) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 25), 
respectively. Again, human rights bodies have built on this baseline in the environmental 
context, elaborating a duty to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-
making in order to safeguard a wide spectrum of rights from environmental harm.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders have stated that governments must 
facilitate the right to participation in environmental decision-making (see A/HRC/7/21 and 
A/68/262).29 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has encouraged 
States to consult with stakeholders in the course of environmental impact assessments, and 
has underlined that before any action is taken that interferes with the right to water, the 
relevant authorities must provide an opportunity for &#8220;genuine consultation with those 
affected&#8221; (general comment No. 15 (2002), para. 56). Regional human rights tribunals 
agree that individuals should have meaningful opportunities to participate in decisions 
concerning their environment.30 
</p>
<p>38. The need for public participation is reflected in many international environmental 
instruments. Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration states: &#8220;Environmental issues are best

<p>handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level&#8230; Each individual 
shall have&#8230; the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes.&#8221; In 2012, in <i>The 
Future We Want</i>, the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development (Rio+20 Conference), States recognized that &#8220;opportunities for people to 
influence their lives and future, participate in decision-making and voice their concerns are 
fundamental for sustainable development&#8221; (A/CONF.216/16, para. 13). Environmental 
treaties that provide for public participation include the Stockholm Convention on 
Persistent Organic Pollutants (art. 10), the Convention on Biological Diversity (art. 14(1)), 
the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (arts. 3 and 5), and the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (art. 6(a)). The Aarhus Convention has 
particularly detailed requirements (arts. 6&#8211;8).31  
39. The rights of freedom of expression and association are of special importance in 
relation to public participation in environmental decision-making. The Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders has said that those working on land rights and 
natural resources are the second-largest group of defenders at risk of being killed 
(A/HRC/4/37), and that their situation appears to have worsened since 2007 (A/68/262, 
para. 18). Her last report described the extraordinary risks, including threats, harassment, 
and physical violence, faced by those defending the rights of local communities when they 
oppose projects that have a direct impact on natural resources, the land or the environment 
(A/68/262, para. 15).  
40. States have obligations not only to refrain from violating the rights of free 
expression and association directly, but also to protect the life, liberty and security of 
individuals exercising those rights.32 There can be no doubt that these obligations apply to 
those exercising their rights in connection with environmental concerns. The Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders has underlined these obligations in 
that context (A/68/262, paras. 16 and 30), as has the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples (A/HRC/24/41, para. 21), the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights,33 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights,34 and the Commission on 
Human Rights, which called upon States &#8220;to take all necessary measures to protect the 
legitimate exercise of everyone&#8217;s human rights when promoting environmental protection 
and sustainable development&#8221; (resolution 2003/71). <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Duty to provide access to legal remedies  
</b></p>
<p>41. From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights onward, human rights agreements 
have established the principle that States should provide for an &#8220;effective remedy&#8221; for 
violations of their protected rights. Human rights bodies have applied that principle to 
human rights infringed by environmental harm. For example, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights has urged States to provide for &#8220;adequate compensation and/or 
alternative accommodation and land for cultivation&#8221; to indigenous communities and local 
farmers whose land is flooded by large infrastructure projects, and &#8220;just compensation [to] 
and resettlement&#8221; of indigenous peoples displaced by forestation.35 The Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders has stated that States must implement

<p>mechanisms that allow defenders to communicate their grievances, claim responsibilities, 
and obtain effective redress for violations, without fear of intimidation (A/68/262, 
paras. 70&#8211;73). Other special rapporteurs, including those for housing, education, and 
hazardous substances and wastes, have also emphasized the importance of access to 
remedies within the scope of their mandates.36<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>42. At the regional level, the European Court has stated that individuals must &#8220;be able to 
appeal to the courts against any decision, act or omission where they consider that their 
interests or their comments have not been given sufficient weight in the decision-making 
process.&#8221;37 More generally, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights have stated that the American Convention on 
Human Rights requires States to provide access to judicial recourse for claims alleging the 
violation of their rights as a result of environmental harm.38 The Court of Justice of the 
Economic Community of West African States has stressed the need for the State to hold 
accountable actors who infringe human rights through oil pollution, and to ensure adequate 
reparation for victims.39 
</p>
<p>43. International environmental instruments support an obligation to provide for 
effective remedies. Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration states: &#8220;Effective access to judicial 
and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.&#8221; Many 
environmental treaties establish obligations for States to provide for remedies in specific 
areas. For instance, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea requires States to 
ensure that recourse is available within their legal systems to natural or juridical persons for 
prompt and adequate compensation or other relief for damage caused by pollution of the 
marine environment (art. 235). Some agreements establish detailed liability regimes; a 
leading example is the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution 
Damage.40 
</p>
<p><b> B. Substantive obligations 
</b></p>
<p>44. States have obligations to protect against environmental harm that interferes with the 
enjoyment of human rights. As section II explains, environmental harm may threaten a very 
broad spectrum of human rights, including the rights to life and health. The content of 
States&#8217; specific obligations to protect against environmental harm therefore depends on the 
content of their duties with respect to the particular rights threatened by the harm.  
</p>
<p>45. Those duties may vary from right to right. For example, States have general 
obligations to respect and ensure rights under the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (art. 2, para. 1), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 2, para. 1) 
and the American Convention on Human Rights (art. 1), to take steps towards the full 
realization of the rights recognized in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, to secure the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (art. 1), 
and to recognize and give effect to the rights in the African Charter (art. 1). When 
environmental harm threatens or infringes the enjoyment of a right protected by one or 
more of these agreements, States&#8217; general obligations relating to the right (e.g. to respect 
and ensure it, or to take steps towards its full realization) apply with respect to the 
environmental threat or infringement.

</p>

<p>46. Despite differences in the language setting out the general obligations, however, 
they have given rise to remarkably similar interpretations when applied to environmental 
issues. Although the contours of the specific environmental obligations are still evolving, 
some of their principal characteristics have become clear. In particular, States have 
obligations (a) to adopt and implement legal frameworks to protect against environmental 
harm that may infringe on enjoyment of human rights; and (b) to regulate private actors to 
protect against such environmental harm.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Obligation to adopt and implement legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>47. States have obligations to adopt legal and institutional frameworks that protect 
against, and respond to, environmental harm that may or does interfere with the enjoyment 
of human rights. These obligations have been derived from a number of human rights, 
including the rights to life and health.  
</p>
<p>48. The Human Rights Committee has long held the view that the right to life protected 
by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &#8220;cannot properly be understood 
in a restrictive manner, and the protection of this right requires that States adopt positive 
measures&#8221; (general comment No. 6 (1982) on the right to life, para. 5).<b> </b>Although the 
Committee has not described in detail the steps required to protect the right to life from 
environmental harm, other human rights bodies have. In particular, the European Court has 
held that States have a primary duty to put in place a legislative and administrative 
framework that protects against and responds to infringements of the right to life as a result 
of natural disasters and of dangerous activities, including the operation of chemical 
factories and waste-collection sites.41 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
has also urged States to adopt environmental protection measures in order to comply with 
their obligations to protect rights, including the rights to life and health.42  
</p>
<p>49. With respect to the right to health, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (art. 12, para. 2(b)) provides that the steps to be taken by States to 
achieve the full realization of that right &#8220;shall include those necessary for&#8230; the 
improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene&#8221;. Interpreting this 
language in its general comment No. 14 (2000), the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has stated that &#8220;the right to health embraces a wide range of socioeconomic 
factors that promote conditions in which people can lead a healthy life, and extends to the 
underlying determinants of health, such as&#8230; a healthy environment&#8221; (para. 4). The 
Committee has interpreted the phrase &#8220;the improvement of all aspects of environmental and 
industrial hygiene&#8221; in article 12.2(b) to include &#8220;the prevention and reduction of the 
population&#8217;s exposure to harmful substances such as radiation and harmful chemicals or 
other detrimental environmental conditions that directly or indirectly impact upon human 
health&#8221; (para. 15). To that end, States are required to adopt measures against environmental 
health hazards, including by formulating and implementing policies &#8220;aimed at reducing and 
eliminating pollution of air, water and soil&#8221; (para. 36). Where environmental harm to 
human rights occurs, including from natural disasters, States are obliged to respond by 
assisting the victims.43

</p>
<p>November 2004; and <i>Budayeva and others v. Russia</i>, No. 15339/02, 20 March 2008. The European 
Court has also derived such an obligation from the right to private and family life; see <i>Tatar v. 
Romania, </i>No. 67021/01, 6 July 2009, para. 88.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42
 See Inter-American report, sect. III.B.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>50. Similarly, special rapporteurs have addressed the obligations of States in relation to 
environmental harm to human rights.44 The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, for example, has stated (A/68/264, para. 48):  
</p>
<p>To curb water pollution effectively, regulation must target all sectors and cover the 
whole country, giving priority to the elimination of the most urgent and serious 
challenges, which vary from country to country and within countries. They might 
stem from the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture in rural areas, the non-
confinement and non-treatment of sludge and septage in densely populated urban 
areas, or from industrial wastewater in areas that experience sudden economic 
growth. States have to assess the situation at the micro level and prioritize 
addressing the most urgent challenges.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes has issued a series of 
reports identifying obligations of States in relation to such substances. To take one 
example, a 2006 report on the human rights impact of the widespread exposure of 
individuals and communities to toxic chemicals in food and household goods 
(E/CN.4/2006/42, para. 45) states:  
</p>
<p>The duties of States in this regard translate into obligations to take steps to regulate 
carefully the production, storage and use of hazardous chemicals in a way that 
prevents a level of exposure to hazardous chemicals which may result in human 
rights violations. States must also provide effective remedies and restitution to 
victims of those violations occurring as a result of exposure to hazardous chemicals. 
In other words, States must regulate the production and use of chemicals in a way 
which is consistent with the full spectrum of their obligations under international 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p>52. States have recognized the importance of incorporating human rights considerations 
into environmental laws. The Human Rights Council has affirmed that &#8220;human rights 
obligations and commitments have the potential to inform and strengthen international, 
regional and national policymaking in the area of environmental protection&#8221; and urged 
States &#8220;to take human rights into consideration when developing their environmental 
policies&#8221; (resolution 16/11). The Council,  as well as the parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, has stated that States should, in all climate 
change-related actions, fully respect human rights (resolution 18/22; and 
FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, decision 1/CP.16). In the universal periodic review process, many 
States have described the steps they have taken to create institutions and adopt policies and 
laws to address environmental protection.45  
</p>
<p>53. The obligation to protect human rights from environmental harm does not require 
the cessation of all activities that may cause any environmental degradation. The African 
Commission, for example, has made it clear that the African Charter does not require States 
to forego all oil development.46 The European Court has held that States have discretion to 
strike a balance between environmental protection and other issues of societal importance, 
such as economic development and the rights of others.47 But the balance cannot be 
unreasonable, or result in unjustified, foreseeable infringements of human rights. In the 
<i>Ogoniland </i>case, the African Commission cited the enormous environmental harm to the

<p>rights of those in the Niger delta region in finding that &#8220;the care that should have been 
taken&#8221;, including by taking reasonable measures to prevent pollution and ecological 
degradation from oil production, &#8220;was not taken.&#8221;48 Similarly, the European Court has 
decided cases in which it held that States failed to strike a fair balance between protecting 
rights from environmental harm and protecting other interests.49 
</p>
<p>54. In this respect, national and international health standards may be particularly 
relevant. For example, in deciding whether a State had failed to comply with its obligations 
under the European Social Charter with respect to the right to health, the European 
Committee of Social Rights evaluated the danger posed by water pollution in light of water 
safety standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public bodies.50 
The European Court has also considered national and WHO health and safety standards in 
deciding whether States have reached a fair balance between environmental protection and 
other interests.51  
</p>
<p>55. Another relevant factor in deciding whether an environmental law meets human 
rights obligations is whether it is retrogressive. The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has strongly discouraged retrogressive actions with respect to fulfilment of 
the rights protected by the International Covenant, in light of the obligation in the Covenant 
to move as expeditiously as possible towards full realization of the rights. The Committee 
stated in its general comment on the right to the highest attainable standard of health that 
&#8220;as with all other rights in the Covenant, there is a strong presumption that retrogressive 
measures taken in relation to the right to health are not permissible.&#8221; If States do take 
deliberately retrogressive measures, then they have the burden of proving that they first 
carefully considered all alternatives, and that the measures &#8220;are duly justified by reference 
to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant in the context of the full use of the 
State party&#8217;s maximum available resources&#8221; (para. 32).52  
56. Finally, after a State has adopted environmental standards into its law, it must 
implement and comply with those standards. As the European Court has stated: 
&#8220;Regulations to protect guaranteed rights serve little purpose if they are not duly 
enforced.&#8221;53 Interpreting the African Charter, the Court of Justice of the Economic 
Community of West African States has held that it is not enough to adopt measures &#8220;if 
these measures just remain on paper and are not accompanied by additional and concrete 
measures aimed at preventing the occurrence of damage or ensuring accountability, with 
the effective reparation of the environmental damage suffered.&#8221;54 In addition, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made clear that the Covenant 
obliges States to refrain from &#8220;unlawfully polluting air, water and soil, e.g. through 
industrial waste from State-owned facilities&#8221; (general comment No. 14, para. 34) and to 
refrain from &#8220;unlawfully diminishing or polluting water&#8221; (general comment No. 15, 
para. 21).<b> </b>

<p>57. Again, special rapporteurs have taken equivalent positions with respect to rights 
within the scope of their mandates.55 For example, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation has emphasized that &#8220;successful regulation 
depends not only on standard-setting, but also on strong independent regulators&#8230; 
Regulators need to have the capacity, in terms of human resources, skills, funding and 
independence from interference, to monitor whether regulations are being complied with, 
carry out on-site inspections, and impose fines and penalties in the case of breaches&#8221; 
(A/68/264, para. 52). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Obligations to protect against environmental harm from private actors  
</b></p>
<p>58. As the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on business and human 
rights explained, &#8220;the State duty to protect against non-State abuses is part of the very 
foundation of the international human rights regime. The duty requires States to play a key 
role in regulating and adjudicating abuse by business enterprises, or risk breaching their 
international obligations&#8221; (A/HRC/4/35, para. 18). Such abuses can include environmental 
harm that infringes human rights. The Special Representative reviewed 320 cases of alleged 
corporate-related human rights abuses and found that nearly one third of the cases alleged 
environmental harm that affected human rights, including the rights to life, health, food and 
housing. Most of the cases of direct harm to communities involved environmental impacts 
(A/HRC/8/5/Add.2, para. 67).  
59. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights endorsed by the Human 
Rights Council in 2011 state that States are required, inter alia, to &#8220;protect against human 
rights abuse within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business 
enterprises,&#8221; including by &#8220;taking appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish and 
redress such abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations and adjudication&#8221; 
(A/HRC/17/31, principle 1). The Guiding Principles also make it clear that States have an 
obligation to provide for remedies for human rights abuses caused by corporations, and that 
corporations themselves have a responsibility to respect human rights. These three pillars of 
the normative framework all apply to environmental human rights abuses such as those 
described in the earlier report of the Special Representative.  
</p>
<p>60. Many other human rights bodies have explicitly connected States&#8217; duty to protect 
against human rights abuses by non-State actors to such abuses caused by pollution or other 
environmental harm. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated 
that &#8220;corporate activities can adversely affect the enjoyment of Covenant rights&#8221;, including 
through harmful impacts on the natural environment, and reiterated the &#8220;obligation of States 
Parties to ensure that all economic, social and cultural rights laid down in the Covenant are 
fully respected and rights holders adequately protected in the context of corporate 
activities&#8221; (E/C.12/2011/1, para. 1). In the context of the right to water, the Committee has 
made it clear that the duty to protect extends to adopting and enforcing effective measures 
to restrain third parties from infringing the right through pollution of water sources (general 
comment No. 15 (2002), paras. 23 and 44(b)).56  
61. The African Commission has stated that &#8220;Governments have a duty to protect their 
citizens, not only through appropriate legislation and effective enforcement but also by 
protecting them from damaging acts that may be perpetrated by private parties&#8221;, and has 
held that by allowing oil companies &#8220;to devastatingly affect the well-being of the Ogonis&#8221;,

<p>the State had &#8220;fallen short of the minimum conduct expected of governments.&#8221;57 The Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights has stated that &#8220;effective enforcement of the 
environmental protection measures in relation to private parties, particularly extractive 
companies and industries&#8230; is essential to avoid the State&#8217;s international responsibility for 
violating the human rights of the communities affected by activities detrimental to the 
environment.&#8221;58 And the European Court has held that States are obligated to take positive 
steps to protect against environmental harm to the right to private and family life, whether 
the pollution was caused by governmental or private action. In either case, &#8220;the applicable 
principles are broadly similar.&#8221;59 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Obligations relating to transboundary environmental harm 
</b></p>
<p>62. Many grave threats to the enjoyment of human rights are due to transboundary 
environmental harm, including problems of global scope such as ozone depletion and 
climate change. This raises the question of whether States have obligations to protect 
human rights against the extraterritorial environmental effects of actions taken within their 
territory.  
</p>
<p>63. There is no obvious reason why a State should not bear responsibility for actions 
that otherwise would violate its human rights obligations, merely because the harm was felt 
beyond its borders. Nevertheless, the application of human rights obligations to 
transboundary environmental harm is not always clear. One difficulty is that human rights 
instruments address jurisdiction in different ways. Some, such as the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the African Charter, contain no explicit jurisdictional limitations, and 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights may even provide an 
explicit basis for extraterritorial obligations (art. 2, para. 1). But other treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the European Convention on Human Rights and the American Convention on 
Human Rights, limit at least some of their protections to individuals subject to or within the 
jurisdiction of the State, leaving it unclear how far their protections extend beyond the 
State&#8217;s territory. Another problem is that many human rights bodies have not addressed 
extraterritoriality in the context of environmental harm.60  
</p>
<p>64. Nevertheless, most of the sources reviewed that have addressed the issue do indicate 
that States have obligations to protect human rights, particularly economic, social and 
cultural rights, from the extraterritorial environmental effects of actions taken within their 
territory. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has interpreted the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as requiring its parties &#8220;to 
refrain from actions that interfere, directly or indirectly, with the enjoyment of the right to 
water in other countries&#8221; (general comment No. 15, para. 31), and has stated that parties 
should also take steps to prevent third parties within their jurisdiction, such as their own 
citizens and companies, from violating the rights to water and health in other countries 
(general comment No. 15, para. 33; and general comment No. 14, para. 39). Several special 
rapporteurs have adopted similar interpretations. In 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to food and the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights joined with

<p>scholars and activists to adopt the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of 
States in the area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.61 The Special Rapporteur on the 
human right to safe drinking water and sanitation recently cited those Principles as 
underscoring &#8220;the obligation of States to avoid causing harm extraterritorially&#8221; and 
affirming &#8220;the obligation of States to protect human rights extraterritorially, i.e., to take 
necessary measures to ensure that non-State actors do not nullify or impair the enjoyment 
of economic, social and cultural rights. This translates into an obligation to avoid 
contamination of watercourses in other jurisdictions and to regulate non-State actors 
accordingly&#8221; (A/68/264, para. 46).  
65. Such interpretations are in accord with the fundamental obligation of States to carry 
out their treaty commitments in good faith,62 which requires them to avoid taking actions 
calculated to frustrate the object and purpose of the treaty.63 The International Court of 
Justice has read this principle of <i>pacta sunt servanda </i>as requiring the parties to a treaty to 
apply it &#8220;in a reasonable way and in such a manner that its purpose can be realized&#8221;.64 This 
suggests that parties to a human rights treaty should not engage in conduct that makes it 
harder for other parties to fulfil their own obligations under the treaty.65   
</p>
<p>66. Other sources, such as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
business and human rights, have taken a more restrictive view of the scope of 
extraterritorial human rights obligations. The Special Representative also stated, however, 
that &#8220;there is increasing encouragement at the international level&#8230; for home States to take 
regulatory action to prevent abuse by their companies overseas&#8221; (A/HRC/8/5, para. 19), and 
urged States to do more to prevent corporations from abusing human rights abroad 
(A/HRC/14/27).    
67. Although work remains to be done to clarify the content of extraterritorial human 
rights obligations pertaining to the environment, the lack of complete clarity should not 
obscure a basic point: States have an obligation of international cooperation with respect to 
human rights, which is contained not only in treaties such as the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2, para. 1), but also in the Charter of the United 
Nations itself (arts. 55 and 56). This obligation is of particular relevance to global 
environmental threats to human rights, such as climate change (A/HRC/10/61, para. 99). As 
the Human Rights Council noted in its resolution 16/11, principle 7 of the Rio Declaration 
states that &#8220;States shall cooperate in a spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and 
restore the health and integrity of the Earth&#8217;s ecosystem.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>68. Indeed, much of international environmental law reflects efforts by States to 
cooperate in the face of transboundary and global challenges. Further work to clarify 
extraterritorial obligations in respect of environmental harm to human rights can receive 
guidance from international environmental instruments, many of which include specific 
provisions designed to identify and protect the rights of those affected by such harm.66

<p><b> C. Obligations relating to members of groups in vulnerable situations 
</b></p>
<p>69. The human rights obligations relating to the environment include a general 
obligation of non-discrimination in their application. In particular, the right to equal 
protection under the law, which is protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(art. 7) and many human rights agreements, includes equal protection under environmental 
law.67 States have additional obligations with respect to groups particularly vulnerable to 
environmental harm. The following sections describe obligations specific to three groups in 
particular: women, children and indigenous peoples.68 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Women 
</b></p>
<p>70. In construing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has 
emphasized that States should ensure that public participation in environmental decision-
making, including with respect to climate policy, includes the concerns and participation of 
women.69 Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health has stated that &#8220;even 
though women bear a disproportionate burden in the collection of water and disposal of 
family wastewater, they are often excluded from relevant decision-making processes. States 
should therefore take measures to ensure that women are not excluded from decision-
making processes concerning water and sanitation management&#8221; (A/62/214, para. 84). <b> 
</b>71. With respect to substantive obligations to develop and implement policies to protect 
human rights from environmental harm, the Committee has called on States to ensure that 
the policies are aimed at protecting the rights of women to health, to property and to 
development. Moreover, it has urged States to conduct research on the adverse effects of 
environmental contamination of women, and to provide sex-disaggregated data on the 
effects.70 Where environmental harm has disproportionate effects on women, States are 
obliged to adopt and implement programmes accordingly. The Special Rapporteur on 
hazardous substances and wastes, for example, has stated that &#8220;due to the harmful effects of 
mercury on the female reproduction function, international human rights law requires States 
parties to put in place preventive measures and programmes to protect women of 
childbearing age from mercury exposure&#8221; (A/HRC/21/48, para. 33, citing the Convention, 
art. 11, para. 1 (f)). 
72. Some groups of women are particularly vulnerable for various reasons, including 
because they are poor, older, disabled and/or of minority status, which may give rise to the 
need for additional protection. For example, in its general recommendation No. 27 (2010) 
on older women and protection of their human rights, the Committee found that they are 
particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change (para. 25), and stated that 
therefore &#8220;States parties should ensure that climate change and disaster risk-reduction 
measures are gender-responsive and sensitive to the needs and vulnerabilities of older 
women. States parties should also facilitate the participation of older women in decision-
making for climate change mitigation and adaptation&#8221; (para. 35). <b>

</p>
<p>68
 This should not be taken as an exhaustive list of groups in vulnerable situations; on the contrary, other 
</p>
<p>such groups could include minorities, those in extreme poverty and displaced persons. However, these 
groups have been the subject of the most detailed attention from the sources reviewed.

<p><b> 2. Children 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that in all actions concerning 
children, including those taken by administrative authorities and legislative bodies, &#8220;the 
best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration&#8221; (art. 3, para. 1). In its general 
comment No. 14 (2013), the Committee on the Rights of the Child has made it clear that 
this provision applies to actions, such as environmental regulation, that affect children as 
well as other population groups, and it has stated that where decisions &#8220;will have a major 
impact&#8221; on children, &#8220;a greater level of protection and detailed procedures to consider their 
best interests is appropriate&#8221; (paras. 19, 20).  
74. More specifically, article 24.2(c) of the Convention provides that States Parties shall 
pursue full implementation of the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of health and, in particular, shall take appropriate measures &#8220;to combat 
disease and malnutrition&#8230; through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean 
drinking water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution.&#8221; 
In its general comment No. 15 (2013), the Committee stated that under article 24.2(c), 
&#8220;States should take measures to address the dangers and risks that local environmental 
pollution poses to children&#8217;s health,&#8221; should &#8220;regulate and monitor the environmental 
impact of business activities that may compromise children&#8217;s right to health, food security 
and access to safe drinking water and to sanitation,&#8221; and should &#8220;put children&#8217;s health 
concerns at the centre of their climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies&#8221; 
(paras. 49, 50). The Committee has emphasized elsewhere as well the importance of 
regulation of business in order to protect children&#8217;s rights, including from the effects of 
environmental harm (e.g. general comment No. 16 (2013), para. 31).  
75. In its general comment No. 9 (2006) on the rights of children with disabilities, the 
Committee stated that &#8220;countries should establish and implement policies to prevent 
dumping of hazardous materials and other means of polluting the environment. 
Furthermore, strict guidelines and safeguards should also be established to prevent radiation 
accidents&#8221; (para. 54). The Committee has also urged States to collect and submit 
information on the possible effects of environmental pollution on children&#8217;s health, and to 
address particular environmental problems, in its concluding observations on country 
reports.71 Finally, the Convention states that the States Parties agree that the education of 
the child shall be directed, inter alia, to &#8220;the development of respect for the natural 
environment&#8221; (art. 29, para. 1(e)).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>76. Because of their close relationship with the environment, indigenous peoples are 
particularly vulnerable to impairment of their rights through environmental harm. As the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has stated, &#8220;the implementation of 
natural resource extraction and other development projects on or near indigenous territories 
has become one of the foremost concerns of indigenous peoples worldwide, and possibly 
also the most pervasive source of the challenges to the full exercise of their rights&#8221; 
(A/HRC/18/35, para. 57).  
77. International Labour Organization convention 169 and the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are designed to protect the rights of 
indigenous peoples, but human rights bodies have also interpreted other human rights 
agreements to protect those rights. The interpretations have reached generally congruent 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>71
 The Committee has also based such recommendations on other rights under the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, including the rights to an adequate standard of living (art. 27) and to rest, leisure 
and play (art. 31). See CRC report, sect. III.  </p>


<p>conclusions about the obligations of States to protect against environmental harm to the 
rights of indigenous peoples. In his reports, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples has described in detail the duties of States to protect those rights.72 This 
section therefore only outlines certain main points.73  
</p>
<p>78. Firstly, States have a duty to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples with respect 
to the territory that they have traditionally occupied, including the natural resources on 
which they rely. Secondly, States are obliged to facilitate the participation of indigenous 
peoples in decisions that concern them. The Special Rapporteur has stated that the general 
rule is that &#8220;extractive activities should not take place within the territories of indigenous 
peoples without their free, prior and informed consent,&#8221; subject only to narrowly defined 
exceptions (A/HRC/24/41, para. 27). Thirdly, before development activities on indigenous 
lands are allowed to proceed, States must provide for an assessment of the activities&#8217; 
environmental impacts. Fourthly, States must guarantee that the indigenous community 
affected receives a reasonable benefit from any such development. Finally, States must 
provide access to remedies, including compensation, for harm caused by the activities. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>79. <b>Human rights law includes obligations relating to the environment. Those 
obligations include procedural obligations of States to assess environmental impacts 
on human rights and to make environmental information public, to facilitate 
participation in environmental decision-making, and to provide access to remedies. 
The obligation to facilitate public participation includes obligations to safeguard the 
rights of freedom of expression and association against threats, harassment and 
violence. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The human rights obligations relating to the environment also include 
substantive obligations to adopt legal and institutional frameworks that protect 
against environmental harm that interferes with the enjoyment of human rights, 
including harm caused by private actors. The obligation to protect human rights from 
environmental harm does not require States to prohibit all activities that may cause 
any environmental degradation; States have discretion to strike a balance between 
environmental protection and other legitimate societal interests. But the balance 
cannot be unreasonable, or result in unjustified, foreseeable infringements of human 
rights. In assessing whether a balance is reasonable, national and international health 
standards may be particularly relevant. In addition, there is a strong presumption 
against retrogressive measures. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>In addition to a general requirement of non-discrimination in the application of 
environmental laws, States may have additional obligations to members of groups 
particularly vulnerable to environmental harm. Such obligations have been developed 
in some detail with respect to women, children and indigenous peoples, but work 
remains to be done to clarify the obligations pertaining to other groups. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Other issues deserve greater attention as well. Although it is clear that States 
have an obligation of international cooperation, which is of obvious relevance to 
global environmental problems such as climate change, clarification of the content of 
extraterritorial human rights obligations pertaining to the environment is still needed.

<p>83. <b>In other areas, the obligations are clear but there are failures to meet them. 
In particular, the Independent Expert is troubled by the many reports of failures to 
protect environmental human rights defenders. He intends to examine good practices 
in this area in the hope of identifying exemplary models of effective protection.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Human rights obligations relating to the environment are continuing to be 
developed in many forums, and the Independent Expert urges States to support their 
further development and clarification. But the obligations are already clear enough to 
provide guidance to States and all those interested in promoting and protecting 
human rights and environmental protection. His main recommendation, therefore, is 
that States and others take these human rights obligations into account in the 
development and implementation of their environmental policies.
