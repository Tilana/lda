</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the United Arab Emirates delegation noted that the UPR process 
represented a beacon for the cause of human rights worldwide and an unparalleled 
opportunity for the United Arab Emirates to promote a transparent and inclusive approach 
to human rights. He described steps undertaken since the 2008 UPR in order to implement 
the outcomes of that review, noting that, in 2010, a committee comprised of Government 
bodies and advisers from civil society had been set up to ensure follow-up to commitments 
made. The committee now acted as a permanent forum for the consultative process with 
civil society and had conducted a wide consultation with stakeholders in preparing the 
national report for the 2013 UPR. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation recalled that at the 2008 UPR, the United Arab Emirates had 
accepted 36 recommendations and made 9 additional voluntary pledges, of which more 
than 90 per cent were implemented. The report of the United Arab Emirates for the 2013 
UPR demonstrated the efforts made to act on the findings of the review, and the continuous 
progress achieved. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation explained that the United Arab Emirates had a stable political system 
characterized by a consultative relationship between its citizens and its Government, the </p>


<p>application of the rule of law and good governance. Although the United Arab Emirates 
took pride in its achievements, it was never satisfied with the status quo and was strongly 
committed to further improving the situation. The Government took concerns of any 
possible violation of human rights very seriously and was constantly working to strengthen 
its capacity to respond to these. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation then outlined measures taken since 2008 to enhance the legislative 
and institutional frameworks for the promotion of human rights, noting that the 
Constitution had been amended in 2009, and that the tenure of the Federal National Council 
members had been extended to four years. 
</p>
<p>9. He explained that the United Arab Emirates had implemented diverse legislative 
initiatives, including measures to strengthen the rights of workers and of persons with 
disabilities, and that it was in the process of adopting a federal law concerning children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation highlighted that several governmental entities concerned with human 
rights had been established, and that studies had been carried out on national human rights 
institutions with a view to informing decisions about the institutional framework in the 
United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>11. Noting that the engagement of the United Arab Emirates with the international 
community in the field of human rights needed to be multifaceted, the United Arab 
Emirates noted that it was studying the accession to international conventions, in addition 
to further cooperation with treaty bodies and special procedures, the UPR and the activities 
of the Human Rights Council. In this vein, the United Arab Emirates had already acceded 
to various international conventions, including, most recently, the Convention against 
Torture. The United Arab Emirates would continue to review and actively consider 
ratification of other international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>12. Furthermore, the United Arab Emirates welcomed visits by United Nations Special 
Rapporteurs and had received visits by the Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, 
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on Racism and 
Racial Discrimination in 2009, and by the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons in 
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p>13. On labour rights, the delegation explained that the United Arab Emirates had an 
extensive strategy for safeguarding the rights of workers and improving their work and 
living conditions, and that it was fully committed to strengthening the rights of workers so 
that they could enjoy opportunity in the United Arab Emirates, free of any form of abuse or 
exploitation. Measures to protect labour rights included (a) the conclusion of memoranda of 
understanding with major labour-exporting countries; (b) regulations protecting the rights 
of workers in case of disputes with employers; (c) a new wage protection system introduced 
in 2009; (d) measures guaranteeing decent and safe accommodation for workers; (e) 
provisions regarding medical care; and (f) rights for workers to move from one job to 
another without time limitations. In addition, the Government had recently approved a new 
law to protect domestic workers, which would be issued this year and would afford far 
greater protection. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation further emphasized that the right to practice religion freely was a 
firmly protected right. 
</p>
<p>15. Regarding women&#8217;s rights, the delegation highlighted the strong record of the 
United Arab Emirates, noting that women participated meaningfully in every facet of civic 
and political life, and that in December 2012, the Cabinet had made it compulsory for 
corporations and Government agencies to include women on their boards of directors. 
Women also played an important role in the Federal National Council and occupied </p>


<p>leadership positions in different institutions. For example, there were four women in the 
Federal Cabinet and there were a number of female federal judges. Furthermore, women 
were major contributors to the United Arab Emirates economy. Thus, the Council of 
Businesswomen in the United Arab Emirates had more than 12,000 members, who ran 
more than 11,000 ventures, with an estimated value of $3.4 billion. 
</p>
<p>16. In 2011 the United Arab Emirates had taken another important step in cementing the 
rights of women when the United Arab Emirates President issued a decree according 
citizenship rights to children born to Emirati women but whose father is not Emirati. It 
accords them citizenship rights, and at the age of 18 they have the choice of taking United 
Arab Emirates nationality or retaining the father&#8217;s nationality. The Government was taking 
the implementation of recommendations on women&#8217;s rights very seriously and was in the 
process of adopting a National Strategy for the Advancement of Women for 2013 to 2017. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding human trafficking, the delegation noted that the United Arab Emirates 
was committed to the global effort to combat this phenomenon and was taking a lead on 
this issue regionally. It was the first country in the Arab region to enact a comprehensive 
anti-trafficking law, and remarkable progress had been made since 2007 on the United Arab 
Emirates&#8217; anti-trafficking strategy. Related initiatives had included (a) training courses and 
workshops; (b) a media campaign to enhance public awareness; (c) a strategy to combat all 
forms of forced labour; and (d) an expansion in the number of shelters for women and 
children victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding the United Arab Emirates&#8217; international commitments, the delegation 
noted that in 2011 the United Arab Emirates had disbursed a total of $2.1 billion in grants 
and loans to development, humanitarian and charity programmes worldwide. 
</p>
<p>19. The United Arab Emirates also highlighted its attention to organizing workshops 
focused on spreading human rights principles among law enforcement authorities in charge 
of combating terrorism, and the allocation of significant resources to infrastructure 
development in remote areas. 
</p>
<p>20. The progress achieved in the United Arab Emirates was also evidenced by its 
ranking in the United Nations&#8217; Human Development Index, which indicated that the United 
Arab Emirates had the highest level of human development in the Arab world. 
</p>
<p>21. Referring to challenges in connection with the turbulence in the Arab world over the 
previous two years, the delegation stated that the United Arab Emirates had worked to 
maintain its stability and security, protect the progressive nature of its society and prevent 
extremism from gaining a foothold. Noting that every country had to find the right balance 
between preserving civil liberties and maintaining national security, the delegation stated 
that the United Arab Emirates had not shied away from its responsibility to protect national 
security, but would continue to exercise this responsibility strictly within the framework of 
its constitution, laws and judicial practices, with due respect for international human rights 
principles. 
</p>
<p>22. In this vein, the head of delegation reaffirmed the United Arab Emirates&#8217; 
commitment to the promotion of human rights and to multilateral engagement, including 
through the UPR process.
