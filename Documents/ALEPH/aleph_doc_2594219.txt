ARTICLE II
REGISTRATION RIGHTS
Section 2.01 Shelf Registration.
(a) Shelf Registration. The Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prepare and file
within 90 days after the Closing Date an initial registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the
public resale of Registrable Securities from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 (or any similar provision
adopted by the Commission then in effect) of the Securities Act (a “Registration Statement”) and (ii) cause
such initial Registration Statement to become effective no later than 180 days after the Closing Date (the
“Target Effective Date”).
4
The Partnership will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such initial Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) to be continuously effective under the Securities Act, with respect to any
Holder, until the expiration of the Effectiveness Period. A Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
Section 2.01(a) shall be on such appropriate registration form of the Commission as shall be selected by the
Partnership; provided that, if the Partnership is then eligible, it shall file such Registration Statement on Form
S-3, provided further, that if the Partnership files a Registration Statement on Form S-1 and it is declared
effective, the Partnership shall maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement then in effect until
such time as a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Registrable Securities has been declared
effective by the Commission. A Registration Statement when declared effective (including the documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and such Registration Statement (and, in the case
of any prospectus contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which a
statement is made) will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Registration
Statement shall contain (except if otherwise directed by the Required Holders) the “Selling Holders” and
“Plan of Distribution” sections in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Date, but in any event within two (2) Trading Days of such date, the Partnership shall
provide the Holders with written notice of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement. By 9:30 a.m. New
York time on the Business Day following the Effective Date of any Registration Statement required to be filed
pursuant to this Agreement, the Partnership shall file with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424
under the Securities Act the final prospectus to be used in connection with sales pursuant to such
Registration Statement.
(b) Effect of Failures. If (A) a Registration Statement required by Section 2.01(a) covering all Registrable
Securities does not become or is not declared effective by the Target Effective Date, (B) on any date after the
Target Effective Date sales of all of the Registrable Securities cannot be made (other than during an
Allowable Grace Period) pursuant to such Registration Statement (including, without limitation, because of a
failure to keep such Registration Statement effective, a failure to disclose such information as is necessary
for sales to be made pursuant to such Registration Statement or a failure to register a sufficient number of
Common Units) or (C) at any time during the period commencing from the six (6) month anniversary of the
Closing Date and ending at such time that all of the Registrable Securities, if a Registration Statement is not
available for the resale of all of the Registrable Securities, may be sold without restriction or limitation
pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1), if the Partnership
shall (i) fail for any reason to satisfy the requirements of Rule 144(c)(1), including, without limitation, the
failure to satisfy the current public information requirements under Rule 144(c) or (ii) if the Partnership has
ever been an issuer described in Rule 144(i)(1)(i) or becomes such an issuer in the future, and the
Partnership shall fail to satisfy any condition set forth in Rule 144(i)(2) (collectively, the “Obligation
Failures”), then each Holder shall be entitled to a payment (with respect to each of the Holder’s Registrable
Securities), as sole monetary remedy for the damages to any Holder by reason of any such delay in or
reduction of its ability to sell the Registrable Securities (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other
remedies available in equity, including, without limitation, specific performance), as liquidated damages and
not as a penalty, (i) for each non-overlapping 30-day
5
period for the first 60 days following the Target Effective Date, an amount equal to 0.25% per annum of the
Liquidated Damages Multiplier, which shall accrue daily, and (ii) for each non-overlapping 30-day period
beginning on the 61st day following the Target Effective Date, an amount equal to the amount set forth in
clause (i) plus an additional 0.25% per annum of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier for each subsequent 60
days (i.e., 0.5% for 61-120 days, 0.75% for 121-180 days, and 1.0% thereafter), which shall accrue daily, up
to a maximum amount equal to 1.0% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per non-overlapping 30 day
period (the “Liquidated Damages”), until such time as such Obligation Failure has been cured in full, and
any payment of Liquidated Damages shall be prorated for any period of less than 30 days in which the
payment of Liquidated Damages ceases. The Liquidated Damages shall be payable within 10 Business
Days after the end of each such 30 day period in immediately available funds to the account or accounts
specified by the applicable Holders in writing. Any amount of Liquidated Damages shall be prorated for any
period of less than 30 days accruing during any period for which a Holder is entitled to Liquidated Damages
hereunder. In the event the Partnership fails to pay any Liquidated Damages in a timely manner, such
Liquidated Damages shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (prorated for
partial months) until paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Partnership certifies that it is unable to
pay Liquidated Damages (including, without limitation, any accrued interest thereon) in cash because such
payment would result in a breach under the Partnership’s Compressco Credit Facility (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) as existing on the date hereof (without any amendment, change or modification thereof
on or after the date hereof), then the Partnership may pay the Liquidated Damages in kind in the form of the
issuance of additional PIK Units, which amount of Liquidated Damages (including, without limitation, any
accrued interest thereon) due pursuant to this Section 2.01(b) shall increase the dollar amount underlying the
Series A Preferred Units held by such Holder.
(c) Waiver of Liquidated Damages. If the Partnership is unable to cause a Registration Statement to
become effective on or before the Target Effective Date, then the Partnership may request a waiver of the
Liquidated Damages, which may be granted by the consent of the Holders of at least 75% of the Registrable
Securities and shall include the Lead Investor so long as the Lead Investor or any of its Affiliates holds any
Registrable Securities, in their sole discretion, and which such waiver shall apply to all Holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement.
(d) Delay Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at any time after the Effective
Date, the Partnership may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable Securities are
included in a Registration Statement (a “Delay Notice”), suspend such Selling Holder’s use of any
prospectus which is a part of such Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall suspend
sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) if (i) the Partnership is pursuing
an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and the Partnership
determines in good faith and on the advice of counsel that the Partnership’s ability to pursue or consummate
such a transaction would be materially and adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction
in such Registration Statement or (ii) the Partnership has experienced some other material non-public event,
the disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the Partnership and its counsel, would
materially and adversely affect the Partnership (each, a “Grace Period”); provided, however, that in no event
shall any Grace Period exceed thirty (30)
6
consecutive Trading Days, or an aggregate of sixty (60) Trading Days during any three hundred sixty five
(365) day period and the first day of any Grace Period must be at least five (5) Trading Days after the last day
of any prior Grace Period (each, an “Allowable Grace Period”). Each Delay Notice shall notify the Holders of
the existence of material, non-public information giving rise to the delay rights being exercised pursuant to
this Section 2.01(d) (provided that in each Delay Notice the Partnership will not disclose the content of such
material, non-public information to the Purchasers), and notify the Holders the dates on which the Grace
Period begins. Upon disclosure of such information or the termination of the condition described above, the
Partnership shall provide prompt written notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are
included in such Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into
effect and shall take such other actions necessary or appropriate to permit registered sales of Registrable
Securities as contemplated in this Agreement. For purposes of determining the length of a Grace Period
above, the Grace Period shall begin on and include the date the Holders receive the Delay Notice and shall
end on and include the later of the date the Holders receive a written notice of the end of such Grace Period
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and the date referred to in such notice. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the Partnership shall cause its transfer agent to deliver unlegended Common Units
to a transferee of a Holder in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities with respect to which a
Holder has entered into a contract for sale, prior to such Holder’s receipt of the Delay Notice and for which
such Purchaser has not yet settled, unless the Partnership and its counsel determine that such sale may
violate the Securities Act.
(e) Legal Counsel. The Required Holders shall have the right to select one legal counsel to review and
oversee any registration pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (“Legal Counsel”), which shall be Schulte Roth & Zabel
LLP or such other counsel as thereafter designated by the Required Holders. The Partnership and Legal
Counsel shall reasonably cooperate with each other in performing the Partnership’s obligations under this
Agreement.
Section 2.02 Further Obligations. In connection with its obligations under this Article II, the Partnership will:
(a) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments)
and supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such Registration
Statement, which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the Securities Act, as
may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective at all times during the Effectiveness Period,
and, during such period, comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. In the case of amendments and supplements
to a Registration Statement which are required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to
this Section 2.02(a)) by reason of the Partnership filing a report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K or any
analogous report under the Exchange Act, the Partnership shall have incorporated such report by reference
into such Registration Statement, if applicable, or shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file such
amendments or supplements with the Commission on the same day on which the Exchange Act report is
filed which created the requirement for the Partnership to amend or supplement such Registration Statement;
7
(b) furnish to each Selling Holder and Legal Counsel (i) as far in advance as reasonably practicable, but in
any event at least five (5) Business Days, before filing a Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or amendment thereto, upon request, copies
of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each
document incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and regulations of the
Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder and Legal Counsel the opportunity to object to any
information pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is contained therein and, to the
extent timely received, make the corrections reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to
such information prior to filing such Registration Statement or such other registration statement and the
prospectus included therein or any supplement or amendment thereto, (ii) promptly after the same is
prepared and filed with the Commission, such number of copies of such Registration Statement or such other
registration statement and the prospectus included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as
such Persons may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or other registration statement and (iii) upon
the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, one copy of the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto;
(c) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by any Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders shall reasonably
request; provided, however, that the Partnership will not be required to qualify generally to transact business
in any jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would subject it to
general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;
(d) promptly notify each Selling Holder in writing (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any
material, nonpublic information), at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered by
any of them under the Securities Act, of (i) the filing of a Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement to be used in
connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement thereto, and, with respect to a Registration
Statement or any other registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has
become effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written comments from the Commission with respect to any filing
referred to in clause (i) and any written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to any
such Registration Statement or any other registration statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement
thereto;
(e) promptly notify each Selling Holder in writing (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any
material, nonpublic information), at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered by
any of them under the Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus or
prospectus supplement contained in a Registration Statement or any other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (in the case of any prospectus contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which a
8
statement is made); (ii) the issuance or threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Partnership of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the
applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, the
Partnership agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus
supplement or take other appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and
to take such other action as is reasonably necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or
proceedings related thereto. By 9:30 a.m. New York City time on the Business Day following the date any
post-effective amendment has become effective, the Partnership shall file with the Commission in
accordance with Rule 424 under the Securities Act the final prospectus to be used in connection with sales
pursuant to such Registration Statement;
(f) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations, furnish to each Selling Holder copies
of any and all transmittal letters or other correspondence with the Commission, the staff of the Commission or
any other governmental agency or self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any
domestic or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable Securities;
(g) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of
the Commission;
(h) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized quotation system on which
similar securities issued by the Partnership are then listed;
(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved
by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Partnership to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities;
(j) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement
not later than the Effective Date of such Registration Statement;
(k) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are reasonably requested by the Selling
Holders or the underwriters, if any, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities
(including making appropriate officers of the General Partner available to participate in customary marketing
activities);
(l) if reasonably requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment such information as such Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included therein relating to
the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including information with respect to the number of
Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of
the offering of the Registrable
9
Securities to be sold in such offering; and (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendment after being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment;
(m) if reasonably required by the Partnership’s transfer agent, the Partnership shall promptly deliver any
authorizations, certificates and directions required by the transfer agent which authorize and direct the
transfer agent to transfer such Registrable Securities without legend upon sale by the Holder of such
Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement;
(n) use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of
such order or suspension as soon as reasonably practicable and to notify Legal Counsel and each Holder
who holds Registrable Securities being sold of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its
receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose;
(o) make generally available to its security holders as soon as practical, but not later than ninety (90) days
after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with, and in the
manner provided by, the provisions of Rule 158 under the securities Act) covering a twelve-month period
beginning not later than the first day of the Partnership’s fiscal quarter next following the applicable Effective
Date of a Registration Statement; and
(p) if any Holder could reasonably be deemed to be an “underwriter,” as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act, in connection with the Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereof (a
“Holder Underwriter Registration Statement”), then the Partnership will reasonably cooperate with such
Holder in allowing such Holder to conduct customary “underwriter’s due diligence” with respect to the
Partnership and satisfy its obligations in respect thereof. In addition, at any Holder’s request, the Partnership
will furnish to such Holder, on the date of the effectiveness of the Holder Underwriter Registration Statement
and thereafter from time to time on such dates as such Holder may reasonably request (provided that such
request shall not be more frequently than on an annual basis unless such Holder is offering Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Holder Underwriter Registration Statement), (i) a “comfort” letter, dated such date,
from the Partnership’s independent certified public accountants in form and substance as has been
customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in underwritten public offerings
of securities by the Partnership, addressed to such Holder, (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel
representing the Partnership for purposes of the Holder Underwriter Registration Statement, in form, scope
and substance as has been customarily given in underwritten public offerings of securities by the
Partnership, including standard “10b-5” negative assurance for such offerings, addressed to such Holder and
(iii) a standard officer’s certificate from the chief executive officer or chief financial officer, or other officers
serving such functions, of the General Partner addressed to the Holder, as has been customarily given by
such officers in underwritten public offerings of securities by the Partnership. The Partnership will also use its
reasonable efforts to provide Legal Counsel to such Holder with an opportunity to review and comment upon
any such Holder Underwriter Registration Statement, and any amendments and supplements thereto, prior to
its filing with the Commission.
10
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.02, the Partnership will not name a Holder as an
underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act) in any public disclosure or filing with the
Commission or any Eligible Market (provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Partnership
from including the disclosure found in the “Plan of Distribution” section attached hereto as Exhibit A in a
Registration statement), without such Holder’s express prior written consent. If the staff of the Commission
requires the Partnership to name any Holder as an underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act), and such Holder does not give its express prior written consent thereto, then such Holder’s
Registrable Securities shall not be included on the applicable Registration Statement and the Partnership
shall have no further obligations hereunder with respect to Registrable Securities held by such Holder,
unless such Holder has not had an opportunity to conduct customary underwriter’s due diligence as set forth
in subsection (p) of this Section 2.02 with respect to the Partnership at the time such Holder’s consent is
sought.
Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the happening of any event of the kind
described in subsection (g) of this Section 2.02, shall promptly discontinue offers and sales of the
Registrable Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such Selling Holder’s
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subsection (g) of this
Section 2.02 or until it is advised in writing by the Partnership that the use of the prospectus may be resumed
and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by reference in the
prospectus, and, if so directed by the Partnership, such Selling Holder will deliver to the Partnership (at the
Partnership’s expense) all copies in their possession or control, other than permanent file copies then in
such Selling Holder’s possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time
of receipt of such notice.
Section 2.03 Cooperation by Holders. The Partnership shall have no obligation to include Registrable
Securities of a Holder in a Registration Statement who has failed to timely furnish such information that the
Partnership determines, after consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in order for any registration
statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to comply with the Securities Act. To the extent the
Partnership requires any information from any Holder for inclusion in a Registration statement, it shall deliver
a written notice to such Holder requesting such Holder to deliver such information within five (5) Business
Days of the receipt by such Holder of such written notice.
Section 2.04 Expenses.
(a) Certain Definitions. “Registration Expenses” shall not include Selling Expenses but otherwise means
all expenses incident to the Partnership’s performance under or compliance with this Agreement to effect the
registration of Registrable Securities on a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.01, and the
disposition of such Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, all registration, filing, securities
exchange listing and NASDAQ fees (or fees of any other principal trading market on which the Common
Units then trade), all registration, filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying with
11
securities or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fees of transfer agents and
registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, and the fees and disbursements of
counsel and independent public accountants for the Partnership, including the expenses of any special
audits or “cold comfort” letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance. “Selling
Expenses” means all underwriting fees, discounts and selling commissions and transfer taxes allocable to
the sale of the Registrable Securities.
(b) Expenses. The Partnership will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses, as determined in good faith,
in connection with a shelf Registration, whether or not any sale is made pursuant to such shelf
Registration. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all Selling Expenses in connection with any
sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder. In addition, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.05, the
Partnership shall not be responsible for professional fees (including legal fees) incurred by Holders in
connection with the exercise of such Holders’ rights hereunder.
Section 2.05 Indemnification.
By the Partnership. In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act
pursuant to this Agreement, the Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder
thereunder, its directors, officers, managers, partners, employees, members, representatives and agents and
each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and their respective directors, officers, managers, partners, employees, members,
representatives or agents (collectively, the “Selling Holder Indemnified Persons”), against any losses,
claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (collectively,
“Losses”), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder Indemnified Person may become subject under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact (in the case of any prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which such statement is made) contained in (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes documents
incorporated by reference in) the applicable Registration Statement or other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or any free writing prospectus relating thereto,
or any filing made in connection with the qualification of the offering under the securities or other “blue sky”
laws of any jurisdiction in which Registrable Securities are offered, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading or (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the Partnership of this Agreement, the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder Indemnified Person for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them, as incurred, in connection with investigating, defending
or resolving any such Loss or actions or proceedings; provided, however, that the Partnership will not be
liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based solely upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with
information furnished by such Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in the
applicable Registration Statement or other registration statement, or prospectus supplement, as applicable.
12
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
such Selling Holder Indemnified Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling
Holder.
(a) By Each Selling Holder. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold
harmless the Partnership, the Partnership Entities, the General Partner’s directors, officers, employees and
agents and each Person, who, directly or indirectly, controls the Partnership within the meaning of the
Securities Act or of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to
the Selling Holders, but only with respect to Losses incurred solely and to the extent of information regarding
such Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in a
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary
prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereto or any free writing prospectus relating thereto; provided, however, that the liability of each Selling
Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses)
received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
indemnification.
(b) Notice. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any
action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party
shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this Section
2.05(c) except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure. In any action
brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof.
The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and
undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after
notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the
defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 2.05
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; provided,
however, that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified
party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict
with the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate
counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with
the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable expenses related to such
participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall settle any action brought against any indemnified party with
respect to which such indemnified party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, includes
a complete and unconditional release from liability of, and does not contain any admission of wrongdoing by,
the indemnified party.
13
(c) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.05 is held by a court or government
agency of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them
harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of
such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that
in no event shall any Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar
amount of net proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party in writing, and the parties’
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this
paragraph were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a
result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal
and other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating,
defending or resolving any Loss that is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(d) Other Indemnification. The provisions of this Section 2.05 shall be in addition to any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that an indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or
otherwise.
Section 2.06 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the Commission that may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without
registration, the Partnership agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:
(a) make and keep public information regarding the Partnership available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any similar provision then in effect), at all times from and
after the date hereof;
(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Partnership
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and
(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the extent accurate, forthwith upon
request, a written statement of the Partnership that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule
144 under the Securities Act (or any similar provision then in effect), the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, and (ii) unless otherwise available via the
14
Commission’s EDGAR filing system, to such Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual
or quarterly report of the Partnership, and such other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may
reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to sell
any such securities without registration.
Section 2.07 Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Partnership to
register Registrable Securities under this Article II may be transferred or assigned by each Holder to one or
more transferees or assignees of Registrable Securities or securities convertible into Registrable Securities;
provided, however, that (a) unless any such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of, and after such transfer or
assignment continues to be an Affiliate of, such Holder, the amount of Registrable Securities or securities
convertible into Registrable Securities, as applicable, transferred or assigned to such transferee or assignee
shall represent at least $5 million of Registrable Securities (determined by multiplying the number of
Registrable Securities (on an as-converted basis without regard to any limitations on conversions and/or
redemptions of the Series A Preferred units) owned by the average of the closing price on the NASDAQ (or
any other principal trading market on which the Common Units then trade) for the Common Units for the ten
(10) Trading Days preceding the date of such transfer or assignment), (b) the Partnership is given written
notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of each such transferee or
assignee and identifying the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or
assigned and (c) each such transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of the
obligations of such transferring Holder under this Agreement.

equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all defenses it may

parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall
be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the

negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement), will
be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws. Any action against any party relating to the foregoing shall be brought in any
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located within the State of New York, and the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the
State of New York over any such action. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted

Section 3.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the other agreements and
documents referred to herein are intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and
intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto

or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein or in the Purchase Agreement with respect to
the rights granted by the Partnership or any of its Affiliates or the Purchasers or any of their respective
Affiliates set forth herein or therein. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the other agreements and
documents referred to herein or therein supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to such subject matter.
Section 3.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written amendment signed
by the Partnership and the Required Holders. Any amendment, supplement or modification of or to any
provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and any consent to any departure
by the Partnership or any Purchaser from the terms of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which such amendment, supplement, modification,
waiver or consent has been made or given.
Section 3.12 No Presumption. This Agreement has been reviewed and negotiated by sophisticated parties
with access to legal counsel and shall not be construed against the drafter.
Section 3.13 Obligations Limited to Parties to Agreement. Each of the parties hereto covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that, other than as set forth herein, no Person other than the Purchasers, the Selling
Holders, their respective permitted assignees and the Partnership shall have any obligation hereunder and
that, notwithstanding that one or more of such Persons may be a corporation, partnership or limited liability
company, no recourse under this Agreement or under any documents or instruments delivered in connection
herewith shall be had against any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of such Persons or their respective
permitted assignees, or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise
be incurred by any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner,
manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of such Persons or any of their respective assignees, or any
former, current or future director, officer,
18
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing, as such, for any obligations of such Persons or their respective permitted assignees under this
Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith or for any claim based on, in
respect of or by reason of such obligation or its creation, except, in each case, for any assignee of any
Purchaser or a Selling Holder hereunder.
Section 3.14 Interpretation. Article, Section and Schedule references in this Agreement are references to
the corresponding Article, Section or Schedule to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All Schedules
to this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof as if set forth in full herein and are an
integral part of this Agreement. All references to instruments, documents, contracts and agreements are
references to such instruments, documents, contracts and agreements as the same may be amended,
supplemented and otherwise modified from time to time, unless otherwise specified. The word “including”
shall mean “including but not limited to” and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it
follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it. Whenever the Partnership has an
obligation under this Agreement, the expense of complying with that obligation shall be an expense of the
Partnership unless otherwise specified. Any reference in this Agreement to “$” shall mean U.S. dollars.
Whenever any determination, consent or approval is to be made or given by a Purchaser, such action shall
be in such Purchaser’s sole discretion, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement. If any provision in this
Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, not binding or unenforceable, (a) such provision shall be fully
severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, not binding or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall
remain in full force and effect, and (b) the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be
done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on
the next succeeding Business Day. Any words imparting the singular number only shall include the plural
and vice versa. The words such as “herein,” “hereinafter,” “hereof” and “hereunder” refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.
The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other
subdivisions and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement.
Section 3.15 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to
be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be
prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would
be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of
the remaining provisions of this Agreement so long as this Agreement as so modified continues to express,
without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the
prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair
the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of
19
the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties. The parties will endeavor in good faith
negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s) with a valid provision(s), the
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s).

Schedule A-1
Exhibit A
Selling Holders
The Common Units being offered by the selling holders are those issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Units. We are registering the Common Units in order to permit the selling holders to offer the
Common Units for resale from time to time. Except for the ownership of the Series A Preferred Units and
                , the selling holders have not had any material relationship with us within the past three years.
The table below lists the selling holders and other information regarding the beneficial ownership of the
Common Units. The second column lists the number of Common Units beneficially owned by each selling
holder, based on its ownership of the Series A Preferred Units, as of             , 2016, assuming conversion of
all Series A Preferred Units held by the selling holders on that date, without regard to any limitations on
conversions and/or redemptions of the Series A Preferred Units.
The third column lists the Common Units being offered by this prospectus by the selling holders.
In accordance with the terms of a registration rights agreement with the holders of the Series A Preferred
Units, this prospectus generally covers the resale of all of 130% of the maximum of the sum of (i) the
Common Units issued and issuable pursuant to the Series A Preferred Units and (ii) the Common Units
issued and issuable pursuant to the PIK Units, each as of the Trading Day immediately preceding the date
the registration statement is initially filed with the Commission, subject to adjustment as provided in the
registration rights agreement and in each case without regard to any limitations on the issuance of Common
Units pursuant to the terms of the Series A Preferred Units. Because the conversion price of the Series A
Preferred Units may be adjusted, the number of Common Units that will actually be issued may be more or
less than the number of Common Units being offered by this prospectus. The fourth column assumes the
sale of all of the Common Units offered by the selling holders pursuant to this prospectus.
Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Units, a selling shareholder may not convert the Series A Preferred
Units, to the extent such conversion would cause such selling shareholder, together with its affiliates, to
beneficially own a number of Common Units which would exceed 9.99% of our then outstanding Common
Units following such conversion, excluding for purposes of such determination Common Units issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Units which have not been converted. The number of Common Units in
the second column does not reflect this limitation. The selling shareholders may sell all, some or none of
their Common Units in this offering. See “Plan of Distribution.”
The selling holders may sell all, some or none of their Common Units in this offering. See “Plan of
Distribution.”

Plan of Distribution
We are registering the Common Units issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Units to permit the
resale of Common Units by the holders of the Series A Preferred Units from time to time after the date of this
prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling holders of the Common
Units. We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the Common Units.
The selling holders may sell all or a portion of the Common Units beneficially owned by them and offered
hereby from time to time directly or through one or more underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. If the
Common Units are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers, the selling holders will be responsible for
underwriting discounts or commissions or agent’s commissions. The Common Units may be sold in one or
more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices
determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which
may involve crosses or block transactions,

•
•
•

or quoted at the time of sale;

in ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;
in block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the Common Units as agent but may
position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;
in purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;
in exchange distributions in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;
privately negotiated transactions;
as short sales;
as sales pursuant to Rule 144;
as broker-dealers may agree with the selling holders to sell a specified number of such Common
Units at a stipulated price per unit;
in a combination of any such methods of sale; and
in any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.
If the selling holders effect such transactions by selling Common Units to or through underwriters, broker-
dealers or agents, such underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may receive commissions in the form of
discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling holders or commissions from purchasers of the
Common Units for whom they may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal (which discounts,
concessions or commissions as to particular underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may be in excess of
those customary in the types of
Exhibit A
transactions involved). In connection with sales of the Common Units or otherwise, the selling holders may
enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the Common
Units in the course of hedging in positions they assume. The selling holders may also sell Common Units
short and deliver Common Units covered by this prospectus to close out short positions and to return
borrowed Common Units in connection with such short sales. The selling holders may also loan or pledge
Common Units to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such units.
The selling holders may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the Series A Preferred Units or
Common Units owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the
pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the Common Units from time to time pursuant to this
prospectus or any amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(7) or other applicable provision of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, amending, if necessary, the list of selling holders to include the pledgee,
transferee or other successors in interest as selling holders under this prospectus. The selling holders also
may transfer and donate the Common Units in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees,
pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.
The selling holders and any broker-dealer participating in the distribution of the Common Units may be
deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any commission paid, or any
discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting
commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. At the time a particular offering of the Common Units is
made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed which will set forth the aggregate amount of
Common Units being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-
dealers or agents, any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the selling
holders and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to broker-dealers.
Under the securities laws of some states, the Common Units may be sold in such states only through
registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the Common Units may not be sold
unless such units have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or
qualification is available and is complied with.
There can be no assurance that any selling holder will sell any or all of the Common Units registered
pursuant to the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part.
The selling holders and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
including, without limitation, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and
sales of any of the Common Units by the selling holders and any other participating person. Regulation M
may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the Common Units to engage in
market-making activities with respect to the Common Units. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of
the Common Units and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect
to the Common Units.
Exhibit A
We will pay all expenses of the registration of the Common Units pursuant to the registration rights
agreement, estimated to be $         in total, including, without limitation, Securities and Exchange Commission
filing fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or “blue sky” laws; provided, however, that a
selling holder will pay all underwriting discounts and selling commissions, if any. We will indemnify the
selling holders against liabilities, including some liabilities under the Securities Act, in accordance with the
registration rights agreements, or the selling holders will be entitled to contribution. We may be indemnified
by the selling holders against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, that may arise from
any written information furnished to us by the selling holder specifically for use in this prospectus, in
accordance with the related registration rights agreement, or we may be entitled to contribution.
Once sold under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, the Common Units will be
freely tradable in the hands of persons other than our affiliates.
