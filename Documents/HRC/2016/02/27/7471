<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Spanish Civil War and the 40 years of dictatorship that followed left a colossal 
aftermath in terms of victims of serious human rights and humanitarian law violations, 
including executions, torture, arbitrary detentions, disappearances, forced labour for 
prisoners and exile. 
</p>
<p> The consolidation of democracy constitutes one of the outstanding achievements of 
the Spanish transition. The avoidance of risk of an institutional breakdown originating with 
the Armed Forces &#8212; one of the greatest challenges of transitions &#8212; was achieved through 
the reform and democratization of those same institutions. These reforms have lessons to 
offer which may be useful to other countries. 
</p>
<p> The efforts to cope with the legacies of the Civil War and dictatorship in practically 
all the spheres of the mandate have been mostly fragmented. The measures adopted have 
not corresponded to a consistent, comprehensive and overall State policy in favour of truth, 
justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence. 
 The most serious shortcomings are to be found in the spheres of truth and justice. 
No State policy was ever established with respect to truth; there is no official information 
and no mechanisms for elucidating the truth. The current scheme for the &#8220;privatization&#8221; of 
exhumations, which leaves this responsibility to victims and associations, aggravates the 
indifference of State institutions and raises difficulties with regard to the methodology,

<p>homologation and officialization of truth. The families&#8217; need to give their loved ones a 
proper burial is urgent. In the area of justice, excessive formalism and restrictive 
interpretations of the Amnesty Act and the principle of legality not only deny access to 
justice but they also impede any sort of investigation. 
 As a result of the still apparent shortcomings in institutional response, the theme of 
the legacy of the Civil War and the dictatorship continues to give rise to differences that are 
deeper than expected. In view of the strength of the State, the maturity of civil society, and 
the relevant lessons that have been learned both inside and outside Spain, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the State institutions and civil society to focus their discussions on how 
to deal with outstanding tasks related to the notion of rights, which concerns everyone, 
regardless of any political consideration. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur points out that the strength of democratic institutions lies 
not in their power to silence or ignore certain matters, especially those related to 
fundamental rights, but in their ability to manage them effectively, however complex and 
awkward they may be.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with resolution 18/7 of the Human Rights Council, and at the 
invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, 
reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, paid an official visit to Spain 
from 21 January to 3 February 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. The aim of his visit was to get to know and evaluate the measures adopted by the 
Spanish authorities regarding the four aspects of his mandate, namely truth, justice, 
reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, in relation to the serious violations of human 
rights and humanitarian law committed during the Civil War and Franco&#8217;s dictatorship, 
seeking to achieve a broad perspective regarding the initiatives adopted, to identify good 
practices and to put forward recommendations on how to approach the outstanding 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the State and 
civil society, both at central level and in the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, 
Catalonia and Galicia. In Madrid, he met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, 
Jos&#233; Manuel Garc&#237;a-Margallo, as well as the Secretary of the Office of the President, the 
Secretary of State for Justice, the Secretary of State for Security, the Office of the Under-
Secretary for Defence, the Deputy Director-General for International Cooperation of the 
Ministry of Education and the Deputy Director of State Archives, among other high 
representatives of the Government. He also met representatives of the General Council of 
the Judiciary and with the Attorney-General and representatives of the Public Prosecution 
Service. He held a meeting with the spokespersons of the Justice Commission of the Senate 
and the National Office of the Ombudsman. In Andalusia, Catalonia and Galicia, the 
Special Rapporteur met with senior representatives of the Regional Council (Junta) de 
Andalusia, the Catalan Provincial Government (Generalitat de Catalu&#241;a) and the Xunta de 
Galicia, as well as representatives of the legislative and judicial powers of the Autonomous 
Communities. He further held meetings with the Ombudsman of Andalusia, the S&#237;ndic de 
Greuges of Catalonia and the Valedor do Pobo Galego. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur held joint working meetings with representatives of the 
public institutions that are currently engaged in historical memory work. These included the 
Divisi&#243;n de Gracia y Otros Derechos, Memoria Democr&#225;tica de Andaluc&#237;a, Memorial 
Democr&#224;tic de Catalu&#241;a, the University of Extremadura, the University of Santiago de 
Compostela, the Department of the Office of the President, Justice and Interior Affairs of 
the Government of Navarra and the Office of the Secretary General for Peace and 
Coexistence of the Basque Government. He also held a joint working meeting with the 
National Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and the Ombudsmen&#8217;s Offices of the Autonomous 
Communities of Andalusia, Castilla y Le&#243;n, Catalonia, Galicia, Valencia, Navarra1 and the 
Basque Country. These meetings allowed the Special Rapporteur to gather information and 
contributed to the dialogue between these institutions. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of civil society, including 
victims, families, associations, academics, physicians, forensic archaeologists and 
anthropologists, historians, lawyers and the Secretary General of the Episcopal Conference. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur visited some well-known memorial sites in Madrid (such as 
the Valle de los Ca&#237;dos and the Cemetery of Paracuellos, Jarama), Andalusia (Canal de los 
Presos/Canal del Bajo Guadalquivir, remains of the concentration camp of Los Merinales

<p>and the mausoleum of the cemetery of Cazalla de la Sierra), Barcelona (Fossar de la 
Pedrera and Castillo de Montjuic) and Galicia (Isla de San Sim&#243;n).  
</p><p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for its invitation and 
cooperation throughout the visit. He also wishes to thank the victims and their families for 
sharing their memories and testimonies. He is lastly grateful to the Office of the High 
Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights for its support. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General considerations  
</b>8. The implementation of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence 
measures in Spain has taken place in a particularly complex context. It involves challenges 
which are characteristic of post-authoritarian as well as post-conflict transitions, such as 
broad variations over time and geographical factors in the patterns of violence, during the 
Civil War (1936&#8211;1939) and the dictatorship (1939&#8211;1975), a long dictatorship following a 
conflict, and major developments in the national and international legal contexts since the 
initial violations occurred. 
</p>
<p>9. Nevertheless, the prevailing attitudes have tended to mask these complexities and to 
treat all violations as an amalgam of violent events that occurred as part of a situation of 
struggle and tension between opposing sides, and they start from a position deliberately 
publicized by the Franco regime, which for decades prevented any open or direct 
confrontation with the past. This attempt to suggest symmetries in the behaviour of the 
different sides, juxtaposed with what must be recognized as undoubtedly, still today, an 
asymmetrical treatment of the victims, has politicized the debate and has tended to 
assimilate victims&#8217; complaints with political and party affiliations, to the detriment of a 
concern for rights. The definition of what constitutes a victim is generally detached from 
the notion of human rights and from the basic notions of beneficiaries and State 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that matters related to truth, justice, reparation and 
guarantees of non-recurrence do not fall within the sphere of party politics or individual 
political programmes, but must be seen as general principles and rights which concern the 
whole of society. Whence the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s keenness to receive information, visit 
sites and establish dialogue with all the victims of human rights violations, regardless of the 
side they represented or political affiliation, and relating to the perpetrators. Whence also 
the importance of analysing State policies and measures which are not subject to successive 
governments. The Special Rapporteur insists on the importance of initiatives by the State 
and by civil society that cover the claims of <i>all</i> human rights and humanitarian law victims, 
regardless of their political affiliation, or that of the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Guarantees of non-recurrence 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Democratic consolidation and reform of the Armed Forces 
</b></p>
<p>11. The consolidation of a robust and stable democracy in itself constitutes a tool with 
which to guarantee non-recurrence and one of the outstanding achievements of Spain&#8217;s 
transition. In fact, Spanish democracy is in no danger of an institutional breakdown 
originating with the Armed Forces, which are firmly committed to the principles of the 
Constitution and the law, including all aspects of civil control, and which enjoy a high 
degree of legitimacy and a reputation for reliability, as reflected in public opinion surveys. 
The democratization of the armed forces is one of the greatest challenges of transitions and 
the Spanish example offers valuable lessons that could prove useful to other countries. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.14-09052 
</p>
<p>12. The fact that the process of military reform, as part of a &#8220;seamless&#8221; transition, has 
been so successful is particularly significant, considering the role that the Armed Forces 
played during the Civil War and the dictatorship. 
</p>
<p>13. The process of change that led to these results was gradual; it lasted more than a 
decade and did not pass without some resistance. The attempted military coup of 23 
February 1981 was not the only manifestation of that opposition to the changes that were 
occurring within and outside the army, including some that had started before 1975. Other 
reactions included: the resignations of high-ranking officers in reaction to the legalization 
of trade unions and the Communist Party; objections to individual promotions or changes in 
the criteria applied to promotions; and resistance to changes in the relations between the 
Ministry of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff. They also included various acts of 
insurrection, the occupation of government offices and the reluctance on the part of 
&#8220;military senators&#8221; to vote in favour of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>14. Countries setting out on the task of transforming their armed forces would do well 
not only to bear in mind the extended duration of these processes, but also the fact that they 
require systematic efforts of different kinds. Some are part of the structural reforms of State 
powers, while others focus more on the reform of the armed forces and their 
professionalization. All those changes were aimed ultimately at transforming the relation 
between the military and civil powers, with the result that the former ended up under civil 
control in accordance with the democratic Constitution.2 
</p>
<p>15. There are several factors that help explain the success of these reforms, starting with 
the great legitimacy of the democratization process. The initial period of the transition 
enjoyed broad social support, which was reflected in the strong citizen participation in the 
democratic elections of 1977, and in the high degree of consensus expressed in the public 
referendum for the 1978 Constitution, all of which encouraged the elected government to 
undertake structural reforms, including among the military. 
</p>
<p>16. The success of the reform of the Armed Forces was also to a great extent due &#8212; and 
this is another lesson that politicians in other countries might well pay heed to &#8212; to the 
conduct of the political parties, which maintained a high degree of consensus with respect 
to the necessary reforms that opened the way for the launch of a State policy in this respect. 
This meant that the Armed Forces received a coherent message from all the political actors. 
</p>
<p>17. Further factors that help explain the success of the reforms were the accession of 
Spain both to the European Economic Community (EEC) and to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. Apart from the various requirements arising from the need for conformity 
and modernization, integration exposed the Spanish Armed Forces to other modes of 
operation in keeping with democratic regimes. Subsequently, the participation in 
international peace operations helped to consolidate a change of attitude towards the role of 
the Armed Forces and to strengthen their popular support. 
</p>
<p>18. From the point of view of the guarantees of non-recurrence, the measures taken to 
increase the effectiveness of civil control over the Armed Forces played a crucial part, and 
included the establishment of a Ministry of Defence (1977) with strong attributes, legally 
defined in the case of the Minister (as civil representative of the President of the 
Government since 1979) and with a growing civil component among its members. The 
establishment of such a ministry helped to unify previously isolated chains of command and 
responsibilities, without which effective control by the civil authorities would have been 
impossible.

<p><b>A/HRC/27/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09052 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>19. The reforms also brought with them the transformation of collegiate bodies of the 
Armed Forces with (de jure and de facto) decision-making powers into mere consultative 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>20. Similarly, an effort was made, also gradually, to increase civil control over the 
intelligence services, to ensure that they were answerable to the civil authorities, and 
ultimately to the President of the Government, instead of to the requirements of the Armed 
Forces. 
</p>
<p>21. The steps taken to make the army more professional and to reduce the military&#8217;s 
presence in the civil sector also had the effect of establishing clearer dividing lines between 
civil and military. These included legal reforms that prevented military personnel from 
exercising political or trade union activities or from occupying other positions 
simultaneously. The publication of articles and public views by members of the Armed 
Forces was also regulated and made to require prior approval (measures which were 
gradually made more flexible). 
</p><p>22. Other significant measures were those that separated security and defence 
responsibilities. The new Constitution marked a turning point, placing the activities of the 
security forces under the civil executive power, with the mission of protecting the free 
exercise of rights and liberties and guaranteeing public security, thereby laying the 
foundations for meeting one of the greatest challenges of many transitions.  
</p>
<p>23. The reform of the Armed Forces also entailed redefining its objectives, previously 
geared to &#8220;national unity&#8221; and &#8220;internal defence&#8221;, through successive Directives (especially 
in 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1990), which placed the emphasis on their contribution to the 
collective defence of Spain and its allies and to the maintenance of peace between nations. 
</p>
<p>24. In Spain there were no formal trials to clean up the Armed Forces. In view of the 
violations committed during the period of the Civil War and the dictatorship, this is a 
notable shortcoming. Alongside the reform process, however, an effort was made to 
promote generational renewal and the gradual change of attitudes less in tune with the 
values of the transition. Examples include the lowering of the retirement age from 70 to 65, 
reforms in the career and promotion system, and steps to encourage voluntary retirement, 
opening up opportunities and powerful incentives to bring about the rejuvenation of the top 
command. 
</p>
<p>25. At the same time as the numbers of armed forces staff were reduced, especially 
among the top echelons, and entries to military academies were curtailed, changes were 
initiated in military training and education, including curricular alterations, as well as 
renovation, rotation and improvements in the conditions of employment of teachers and a 
closer integration of military courses with other disciplines and with the regular educational 
system. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to justice and the guarantees of non-recurrence, it is worth mentioning 
the reforms that took place in military justice. The 1978 Constitution marked the first step 
towards establishing the &#8220;principle of jurisdictional unity&#8221; and restricting military justice to 
the strictly military sphere and to the requirements of states of emergency. In 1980, through 
a series of key reforms of the Military Criminal Code, the possibility of applying military 
justice to civilians was practically completely removed from the powers of military courts, 
while judicial guarantees were strengthened, with the addition of defending counsel and the 
right of appeal before military courts, but also before the Supreme Court, thereby annulling 
the principle of due obedience and distancing the military command from a system in 
which the army was at the same time party, judge and prosecutor.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Removal of symbols or monuments exalting the military uprising, the 
Civil War and Franco&#8217;s dictatorship 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the provisions of Act No. 52/2007, which 
introduces measures to combat the exaltation of the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, the Civil War and the 
repression of the Franco dictatorship, including through the removal of symbols and 
monuments. As confirmed in the 2011 report of the Technical Committee of Experts, the 
Government reported that the majority of inventoried symbols and monuments had been 
removed, and that the remaining symbols and monuments either required a lengthy 
administrative procedure or considerable expense, or were subject to protection rules for 
their historic or artistic value. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur received information 
recently giving lists of names of streets and buildings, commemorative plaques and 
emblems, which apparently commemorated the senior posts and officials of the Franco 
regime in different parts of the country which had been preserved, despite the submission of 
formal complaints to the authorities and the Offices of the Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work done in Catalonia, such as the 
availability of the map of symbols of the Franco era on the Internet and the report of the 
advisory commission of the Memorial Democr&#224;tic. He particularly appreciated the latter&#8217;s 
recommendations regarding the need for differentiated approaches. 
</p>
<p>29. Some objects cannot actually be removed, while others can and must be maintained 
subject to the necessary contextualization and &#8220;reinterpretation&#8221;, in order that they may lose 
whatever divisive character they might retain and may contribute instead to public 
awareness and past remembrance.3 The Valle de los Ca&#237;dos provides a good example. 
</p>
<p>30. The Valle de los Ca&#237;dos appears very clearly in the opinions expressed by 
associations as a place which in itself represents an exaltation of Francoism. Act No. 
52/2007 only refers in general terms to the rules that will govern the site and the objectives 
of the managing foundation. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work and the report of the Committee of 
Experts for the Future of the Valle de los Ca&#237;dos (2011), in particular the emphasis it placed 
on the importance of reinterpreting the site and explaining to all visitors the origin of this 
monument and its sociopolitical context. 
</p>
<p>32. As it stands at present, the site does not offer any form of information or sign that 
explains the predominance of Francoist and fascist symbolism and the exaltation of the 
&#8220;winning&#8221; side in the Civil War. Nothing explains the ambiguous character or the belated 
idea of giving the place a sense of &#8220;reconciliation&#8221;. There is no account of the fact that it 
was built with the forced labour of thousands of political prisoners under inhuman 
conditions. Nor does it offer any information about the bodies of the almost 34,000 persons 
who are buried there, or about the fact that many of the remains were transferred there 
without the consent and/or the knowledge of their families. There is no explanation of who 
Jos&#233; Antonio Primo de Rivera was, nor of why he was buried in the centre of the Basilica, 
or why General Francisco Franco was buried there without having been a Civil War victim. 
</p>
<p>33. The site can be put to good use and &#8220;reinterpreted&#8221;, with suitable techniques and 
pedagogy, in favour of the promotion of truth and memory, and given an educational and 
preventive purpose. It can hardly be construed as a place devoted to peace and 
reconciliation, so long as silence is maintained about the facts relevant to the context and 
origin of the site, and especially while the flower-covered tomb of the dictator remains in 
the centre of the monument. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09052 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Education 
</b></p>
<p>34. Education is a powerful tool for non-recurrence. In particular the teaching of history, 
if approached as a system of investigation rather than a mechanism for simply preserving 
data, can train citizens in habits of analysis and critical reasoning.4 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur recalls the repression suffered by teachers right from the 
start of the Civil War, including summary executions of republican teachers and staff 
cleansing, which affected both public and private education, including religious teaching, 
from primary school up to university. Various studies have shown how the authorities in 
Spain during the dictatorship supervised the content of history teaching as a means of 
guaranteeing political and social consensus, by monopolizing public utterances concerning 
the country&#8217;s identity and history. Beyond the use of the curriculum as an instrument of 
social control, schools became places where control could take on humiliating and 
stigmatizing forms. The children of parents who had been shot told how, in addition to that 
loss, at school they were obliged to wear uniforms that identified them as such.  
</p>
<p>36. Official documents and research on the subject show how study programmes and 
textbooks gradually slanted the analysis and expanded the explanation of the Civil War and 
Francoism. From 1938 to the 1950s, although the textbooks largely ignored these subjects, 
whatever mention they contained of the war tended to justify the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, laying the 
blame on the republican side, and to legitimate the dictatorship. After 1953 they 
incorporated an image of shared responsibilities in a &#8220;fratricide struggle&#8221; between two rival 
factions. From 1975 until the reforms of 1990 &#8212; although not always consistently &#8212; 
textbooks generally continued to represent the Civil War as a conflict between two Spains 
and, while some writings raised the issue of the political and economic cost of the 
dictatorship, the regime&#8217;s violence against the opposition did not attract much notice. By 
maintaining the notion that &#8220;we were all guilty&#8221;, the textbooks thus underpinned the policy 
of &#8220;wipe the slate clean and start again&#8221; which accompanied the transition.5 
</p>
<p>37. The reforms of the General Organic Act on the Educational System introduced in 
1990 and 2006 helped to establish a new form of interpretation, including references to the 
Franco regime&#8217;s repression and mentioning certain categories of victims which did not 
appear earlier. Some textbooks, however, still referred to those data in general terms, 
perpetuating the idea of symmetrical responsibility. 
</p>
<p>38. Generally speaking, the present programmes and textbooks have given priority to 
building a historical viewpoint, to academic analysis, and to argumentation based on recent 
historical research. While the information at the disposal of the Special Rapporteur did not 
allow him to analyse their application, he found contradictory indications with regard to the 
implementation of the programmes and possible inconsistencies between public and 
private, including religious, educational establishments. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to emphasize the fundamental value of human 
rights teaching as a tool for strengthening guarantees of non-recurrence. In this respect, he 
welcomes the provisions of Act No. 8/2013, as well as the efforts made to disseminate them 
in the country as a whole and in the autonomous communities. The Special Rapporteur 
insists on the importance of associating the study of the Civil War and Francoism with 
programmes for human rights training and the promotion of human rights.

</p>
<p><b> D. Civil service training 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the training programmes of the 
Police and the Guardia Civil include specific modules dedicated to human rights. However, 
they do not appear to cover any study of the Civil War and the Franco dictatorship, or of the 
serious human rights violations that occurred in this period and the responsibility of the 
security forces and the Armed Forces for their perpetration. While some Guardia Civil 
training modules refer to institutions of the Franco era, they appear to offer outdated 
interpretations, which are not in line with the current national educational programme. 
</p>
<p>41. The Judiciary is the branch of the State which has undergone the least structural 
reforms since the transition (with the exception of military justice, as mentioned earlier). 
The training of judges and prosecutors represents a key tool for guaranteeing the non-
recurrence of violations and changes of attitude within the institution. However, the Special 
Rapporteur notes with concern that the training programmes of judges in terms of human 
rights not only omit to mention the responsibilities of the Judiciary, particularly those of 
special courts, during the Civil War and the Franco dictatorship, but they also omit any 
specific human rights subjects that go beyond those related to judicial management and the 
guarantees of due process. It is surprising that they make no reference to the State&#8217;s 
obligations with regard to the criminal prosecution of international crimes, such as 
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur received ambiguous information regarding the Judiciary&#8217;s 
commitment to incorporate human rights programmes in the training of judges. According 
to a number of sources, initial training is considered insufficient and unsuited to providing 
quality training in human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Truth 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Institutional mechanisms for elucidating the truth 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur notes that a considerable amount of information is available 
concerning the violence that occurred in Spain, especially during the Civil War. With few 
exceptions, the research was done by academics, historians or journalists. This information, 
however, is extremely widely dispersed, uses a variety of methodologies and requires 
checking. 
</p>
<p>44. The &#8220;Causa General&#8221; (General Cause) and the trials that arose from it, even though 
they were strongly influenced by a biased interpretation of the facts as seen from the point 
of view of the &#8220;winners&#8221; and might have lacked impartiality, represent what was perhaps 
the only attempt, in the post-war period, to throw light on the acts of violence that occurred 
in the Civil War, with the aim of building an official account and attributing 
responsibilities. The Special Rapporteur regrets that these efforts to compile, digitize and 
publish documents were not systematically applied to other cases and institutions, such as 
other courts and security forces. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur notes that there are no official censuses of victims, or data 
or official estimates of the total number of victims of the Civil War and the dictatorship. 
Furthermore, several subjects are still under-explored, such as the forced labour of 
prisoners, bombing deaths, stolen children, the consequences of war and different forms of 
repression, including that directed at women, and the responsibilities of private companies 
for their active participation or complicity in the perpetration of human rights violations. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09052 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that there never was any State policy 
established to seek the truth and that Act No. 52/2007 does not in any way resolve the 
problem. Even if there were official data, there is no special mechanism for clarifying the 
facts that could centralize and analyse them. Such mechanisms, in addition to providing 
information and promoting a knowledge of the facts, do allow their official <i>recognition</i>. 
</p>
<p>47. Several associations are calling for the establishment of a truth commission. The 
Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to launch serious discussions concerning the 
establishment of an independent, but official, mechanism or body, whose aim would consist 
in achieving an exhaustive understanding of the human rights and humanitarian law 
violations that occurred during the Civil War and the Franco era. He emphasizes that such a 
mechanism could adopt different working arrangements and formats, including the form of 
a truth commission. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention to valuable initiatives in this 
search for truth, which, although they do not replace the need for a State policy or official 
truth mechanisms, could deserve the label of &#8220;good practices&#8221;, for their methodological 
quality, the quantity and variety of their documentary funds and their accessibility by the 
public. The project &#8220;Nomes e Voces&#8221;6 (Names and Voices), headed by the University of 
Santiago de Compostela, has made public on the Internet an extensive documentary base on 
the repression and victims of the Civil War in Galicia, with direct testimonies and 
catalogued and digitized archives. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the extensive 
audiovisual bank, which includes testimonies and educational videos of the Memorial 
Democr&#224;tic de Catalunya.7 The Special Rapporteur is concerned that there are no similar 
projects at State level. The lack of any public policy on truth and memory limits the 
possibilities for coordination and the exchange of experience and knowledge and hampers 
the maximization of the impact and resources. It also restricts the possibility of extending 
the historic clarification schemes to eventually cover all victims (and even the testimony of 
the perpetrators). 
</p><p>49. A compilation of the oral testimonies of victims and direct witnesses is particularly 
important and urgent in view of the advanced age of the persons involved and the danger 
that their voices and the invaluable information they might offer may be lost forever. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Archives 
</b></p>
<p>50. Archives play a central role in the promotion and implementation of the right to 
truth.8 The Special Rapporteur welcomes Royal Decree No. 1708/2011 and the creation of 
the Documentary Centre of Historic Memory of Salamanca, as well as the efforts to further 
the centralization of selected archives and to allow researchers and private individuals to 
access them. While practically all the autonomous communities have adopted archive laws, 
the main documentary sources concerning the Civil War and the Franco regime are located 
in the national archives. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the provisions of Act No. 52/2007 that guarantee 
the right of access to documentary collections deposited in the national archives and to 
obtain any copies required. It is worth noting that the Salamanca Centre has included 
documentary sources of particular relevance, thus allowing access to documents that had 
previously been closed to consultation.

</p>
<p>52. Nonetheless, although a considerable quantity of documents is in theory available, in 
practice access is limited by persisting difficulties and restrictions. Various sources have 
pointed to disparities in practices and possibilities of access according to the particular 
archives concerned or the officials in charge, the extensive scattering of information and the 
lack of technical and staffing resources to ensure the registration of all documents for 
proper access. They also report that generally speaking free access to archives is not 
permitted, which restricts the scope of investigations. There are no mechanisms for dealing 
with complaints or lodging appeals in the event that access is denied. They also report 
impediments to the localization of some collections, such as the intelligence archive of the 
Central Documentation Service of the Office of the President of the Government. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the improved access to some funds of military 
judicial archives, such as the Military Archive of La Coru&#241;a and the General Historical 
Army Archive in Madrid. However, access to the other military justice archives is said to 
be inconsistent. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, on the grounds of national security and 
the Official Secrets Act, historical documents and major military and police archive 
collections remain classified, with no clear criteria for their release. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur welcomes improvements made in terms of access to some 
collections of military judicial archives, such as those deposited by the Fourth Military 
Territorial Court in the North-Western Intermediate Military Archive, in Ferrol, and those 
deposited by the First Military Territorial Court in the General and Historical Defence 
Archive in Madrid. However, access to the other military justice archives is said to be 
inconsistent. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur points out that the current legislation and regulations do not 
resolve the above-mentioned difficulties of access, which could be tackled by means of a 
State policy and an archive law that would update all the criteria that are applied in terms of 
privacy and confidentiality, in line with international standards, including the right to truth. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the recent Act No. 19/2013 on transparency, 
access to public information and good governance has not provided an opportunity to 
address the legal gaps in access regulations. He regrets also that recent legislative proposals 
seeking to deal with this situation have not been followed up. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutions of historical memory 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Government reported that the closure of the Office for Victims of the Civil War 
and the Dictatorship in 2012 and the transfer of its functions to the Division for the Right to 
Pardon and Other Rights was due to the fact that the latter had already carried out the same 
functions under the terms of Act No. 52/2007 and that the number of applications had 
decreased. Some victims and associations, however, complained that their needs were not 
being met by State bodies, including the aforementioned Division. It had been left to 
associations and individuals to make up for the State&#8217;s inaction, when it came to the 
location of remains, for instance, or access to documentation and archives, rendering the 
State services even more obsolete. 
</p>
<p>59. Several autonomous communities run public agencies dedicated to the recovery of 
memory, like those instituted by the autonomous governments of Andalusia, Catalonia and 
the Basque Country, as well as a new one to be created in Navarra.9 Other programmes are

</b></p>
<p>headed by public universities, as in Santiago de Compostela and Extremadura. The Special 
Rapporteur was interested to learn about the very valuable projects launched by these 
institutions, but was also told that many had suffered major budget cuts and that a number 
of programmes had been halted owing to political decisions and/or a lack of funding, such 
as in Arag&#243;n, Asturias, Cantabria and the Balearic Islands. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention to the potential offered by the 
Offices of the Ombudsmen, at both national and autonomous community level, for the 
purpose of defending the rights of victims and their families, in the four aspects of the 
mandate, but also of putting forward recommendations to the Government and to the 
legislative and judicial authorities, according to their mandates and the State&#8217;s international 
obligations. He urges them to further coordinate actions in this respect. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Exhumations  
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts accomplished on the basis of Act No. 
52/2007, which led to the establishment of the Map of Graves, available on the Internet, 
with records of 2,382 graves across the country, which are believed to contain more than 
45,000 remains of persons and in some cases offer data concerning the victims.10 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur received many testimonies and complaints from families, 
sometimes from persons of a very advanced age, who expressed with very deep feeling the 
wish to be able to offer their loved ones a decent burial place. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that the State has not done more to deal with exhumations and the identification 
of remains, especially in cases where this is technically and materially feasible. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur points out that at no stage of his discussions with the 
authorities did the latter deny the legitimacy of this request. Nevertheless, with few 
exceptions, most of their responses were limited to references to Act No. 52/2007, the Map 
of Graves and the budgets allocated to exhumations. Apart from noting that since 2011 the 
budget for the implementation of the Act, including exhumations, has been cancelled, the 
Special Rapporteur makes it clear that the above measures in no way represent adequate 
reparation. 
</p>
<p>64. Act No. 52/2007 does not establish a State policy in this respect, but leaves families 
and organizations the responsibility of dealing with exhumation projects themselves. The 
families of victims and the associations concerned have thus stepped in to replace the State, 
but without always receiving adequate support. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work 
and commitment of victims, families, associations and forensic experts, among others, 
without whom no progress would have been possible. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur points out that, while the adoption of technical protocols is a 
positive factor, the overall cut in subsidies and the State&#8217;s reluctance to undertake 
responsibility for exhumations result in major inconveniences in terms of coordination and 
methodology. 
</p>
<p>66. The &#8220;privatization&#8221; of exhumations also has the effect of encouraging the 
indifference of State bodies, including the courts. The latter tend not to show up when the 
discovery of a new grave is reported, so that there are no official records of the 
exhumations. This produces a perverse effect in that it obliges families to choose between 
their right to inter their loved ones and the possibility that one day they might be able to 
establish the &#8220;official&#8221; truth about the circumstances of the loved ones&#8217; deaths.

</p>
<p><b> V. Justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Impediments to victims&#8217; access to justice 
</b>67. It is in the field of justice that the greatest shortcomings are apparent in the way the 
legacies of human rights violations committed during the Civil War and the Franco era are 
dealt with. The connection between this fact and the absence of reforms in the Judiciary 
after transition, similar to the reforms carried out in the Armed Forces, is a moot point.11 
</p>
<p>68. Act No. 46/1977 (Amnesty Act) has been put forward by the authorities, referring to 
decisions of the Supreme Court, as the main obstacle in the way of opening investigations 
and criminal proceedings with respect to serious human rights and humanitarian law 
violations. Other arguments, such as the principle of non-retroactivity, the application of the 
most favourable rule, the time limitation for offences and the principle of legal security, 
interpreted restrictively, have also been reiterated by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>69. Act No. 46/1977 was adopted by a democratically elected parliament, essentially in 
order to extinguish criminal liability and to release from prison persons detained for 
offences related to acts of political intention, without excluding blood crimes, and offences 
of rebellion and sedition or conscientious objection. This part of the Act reflects the 
requirements of all the opposition parties and consensuses which marked the first stage of 
the transition. The Act also extinguished criminal responsibility for offences committed by 
public servants and law enforcement officials against the rights of persons (art. 2 (f)). The 
Special Rapporteur notes that, while the former set of offences raised public reactions even 
before the end of the dictatorship and lively debates in the legislature, article 2 (f) never 
gave rise to any equivalent discussion.12 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur will not go into the social and political aspects that led to the 
Amnesty Act. He hopes to contribute to discussion and analysis relating to the 
compatibility of the Act&#8217;s provisions, especially article 2 (f), with the State&#8217;s international 
obligations in terms of human rights. 
</p>
<p>71. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendations put forward 
by several human rights mechanisms regarding the incompatibility of the effects of the 
Amnesty Act with the international obligations taken on by Spain, including article 2, 
paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.13 The Special 
Rapporteur points out that these commitments were undertaken prior to the adoption of the 
Amnesty Act. In fact the Act was adopted on 15 October 1977 and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was ratified on 27 April 1977. 
</p>
<p>72. Apart from international standards that establish the inapplicability of the statute of 
limitations to crimes against humanity, international law establishes that, in the case of 
forced disappearances, limitations must apply from the moment the forced disappearance 
ceases, that is, when the person reappears alive or his or her remains are found. The Special 
Rapporteur notes with concern that, during his visit, the authorities consistently denied the 
continuing nature of forced disappearance, alleging that such a principle did not make sense 
legally. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09052 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur observes excessive formalism in the interpretation of law 
that inhibits any reflection regarding possible alternatives to guarantee the right of victims 
to truth and justice. However, in other types of cases, Spain was able to take account of the 
relevant considerations, without infringing the principle of legality, as in the cases of 
<i>Scilingo</i> and <i>Pinochet</i>, where the Spanish courts displayed legal dexterity in favour of the 
rights of victims. In accordance with the principles of due process, they rejected Chile&#8217;s 
Decree-Law on Amnesty and found legal ways of overcoming the problem of the 
applicability of legal categories compatible with international law and questions of 
limitation. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur points out that there would be no impediments in the 
Spanish legal system to revising or annulling any provisions of Act No. 46/1977 that were 
incompatible with the State&#8217;s international obligations. The Constitutional Court would be 
the ideal venue to discuss and decide on the interpretation of Act No. 46/1977, in the light 
of international human rights standards and obligations. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his entire willingness to assist the authorities in 
this process and to facilitate the exchange of experience regarding responses to similar 
challenges furnished by other regional or national courts, in compliance with international 
standards and full respect for the principle of legality and procedural guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of investigations as an obstacle to the right to truth 
</b></p>
<p>76. On the basis of Act No. 46/1977, in practically all cases brought before Spanish 
justice for serious crimes committed during the Civil War and the dictatorship, either no 
investigations are opened, or the cases are shelved without the judges even gaining 
knowledge of the facts. This not only contravenes international obligations with respect to 
the right to justice, but also breaches the right to truth. 
</p><p>77. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the content of the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling of 
27 February 2012 acquitting the incumbent of Criminal Investigation Court No. 5 for 
having initiated investigations into forced disappearances which had occurred during the 
Civil War and the dictatorship, and its decision to transfer the jurisdiction to regional 
courts. Despite the acquittal in this particular case, this ruling would have confirmed the 
tendency of judges to shelve any similar cases that come before them. 
78. During the visit, the great majority of the authorities, practically unanimously, 
argued that criminal proceedings were not the right approach to pursue the right to truth; 
that the aim of criminal proceedings was to impose a penalty on guilty persons and that if it 
were impossible to identify a suspect or arrive at the presumption of his or her decease, the 
whole purpose of a judicial investigation would be lost. 
79. The Special Rapporteur draws attention to some contradictions inherent in these 
arguments and the interpretation of Act No. 46/1977. 
</p>
<p>80. Even in countries that have not repealed amnesty laws, some courts have come up 
with interpretations both of the laws themselves and of the related principles (such as 
legality or non-retroactivity) that have not prevented the investigation and prosecution of 
persons suspected of human rights violations. The reasoning is, for example, that while 
many amnesties suspend criminal responsibility, the decision requires a court ruling (as 
stated in Act No. 46/1977, art. 9). That is to say, allowing the benefits of the amnesty 
requires at least an investigation of the facts, since otherwise there can be no responsibility 
to either suspend or extinguish. 
</p>
<p>81. There is nothing in the existing law that would expressly prevent the initiation of 
investigations. On the contrary, article 6 of Act No. 46/1977 establishes that: &#8220;the amnesty </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.14-09052 
</p>
<p>will generally determine the extinction of the criminal responsibility arising from primary 
or accessory penalties that either have been handed down or may be handed down&#8221;. The 
ruling extinguishing criminal responsibility may only be issued once the facts, 
responsibilities and penalties have been decided, within the context of a judicial 
investigation. Or at least there is nothing in the text of the law that can invalidate such a 
conclusion. 
</p>
<p>82. Secondly, Act No. 46/1977 grants amnesties for a series of offences and article 2, in 
subparagraphs (e) and (f), refers specifically to offences committed by &#8220;public servants or 
law enforcement officials&#8221; and &#8220;for the purpose of or on the occasion of the investigation 
and prosecution of deeds referred to in this Act&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that 
amnesty may be applied only after the judicial authorities have first determined whether or 
not the suspects were public servants or law enforcement officials, and whether the 
offences were committed in the circumstances described. This cannot be presupposed; it 
can only be established through investigations, even preliminary, which follow the official 
nature, rigour and methodology of judicial investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Application of universal jurisdiction 
</b>83. The Spanish courts have been recognized as pioneers in the application of universal 
jurisdiction by various human rights mechanisms. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates his concern for the successive reforms of 2009 and 2014 of Organic Act No. 
6/1985, which significantly limit the Spanish courts&#8217; chances of exercising their jurisdiction 
over serious international crimes, such a genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
The Special Rapporteur is following closely developments related to the closure of some 
current trials, and the reluctance on the part of some judges to close cases, on the grounds 
of international standards. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur is also closely following developments related to the 
requests submitted by the Argentine justice system for the extradition of two persons 
suspected of acts of torture committed during the final years of the Franco regime, which 
might constitute crimes against humanity. He also recalls the State&#8217;s international 
obligation to either extradite or judge and that the extradition of the accused can only be 
denied if the Spanish courts themselves initiate investigations and judge those responsible. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Reparation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definition of victim 
</b></p>
<p>85. In transitions, it is essential for the consolidation of democracy and reconciliation to 
advocate a broad concept of victim, covering all possible aspects of victims, regardless of 
their political affiliation, or faction, or that of their perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>86. While Spain has made noteworthy efforts to overcome initial forms of 
discrimination, pertaining to the Franco regime, in practice many organizations and victims 
have expressed the view that they still have the impression that they are &#8220;second-class 
victims&#8221;. This feeling is believed to originate in a series of more ambitious measures 
seeking recognition and reparation for other categories of victims of serious crimes such as 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p>87. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur suggests that advantage should be taken of 
current discussions around and plans to revise the Preliminary Bill for an Organic Act on 
the Status of Victim of the Offence to incorporate all categories of victims in the new law, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09052 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>including those of the Civil War and the dictatorship, while encouraging the participation of 
victims in the drafting of the Act. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Programme of reparations 
</b></p>
<p>88. Of the four aspects of the mandate, reparation is the one that has been most 
developed in Spain. In this respect, most of the action has taken the form of assistance and 
economic measures. 
</p>
<p>89. After the end of the Civil War, starting in 1937, the Franco regime launched a 
system of reparations which established pensions and benefits, among others, for widows 
and injured survivors belonging to the national side, thereby perpetuating the idea of a 
society divided into winners and losers. The first provisions establishing pensions for war 
victims on the republican side were adopted only in 1978, and these were followed in 1980 
by pensions for periods spent in prison during the Franco regime (and compensations in 
1990), with benefits for exiles. The parliamentary bill of 2002 (161/001512) is one of the 
first pieces of legislation to promote recognition for those who underwent the repression of 
the Franco regime, while Act No. 52/2007 advocates the idea of equality between all 
victims. 
</p>
<p>90. Act No. 52/2007 extends some of the existing provisions, concerning amounts and 
delays, and includes reparations for new categories of victims. Some gaps still remain, 
however, which autonomous community legislation did its best to fill. Many victims and 
families have complained that the current scheme still excludes whole groups of victims, as 
well as some categories of persons who had been detained under special conditions, such as 
in concentration camps or labour camps, and persons detained under the 1933 Anti-
Vagrancy and Delinquency Act (Ley sobre vagos y maleantes), which was replaced in 1970 
by the Social Dangerousness Act (Ley de peligrosidad social), both of which, it was 
alleged, had been used to apply a form of social control and repression by the Franco 
regime. The persons involved were reportedly excluded from measures of reparation, such 
as the calculation of social security contributions, nor were they considered as &#8220;former 
social prisoners&#8221;, since Act No. 2/2008 restricted this category to persons detained on 
account of their sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>91. The legislation on restitution and compensation for the confiscation of property 
belonging to political parties and groups14 does not contemplate any form of reparation in 
the case of private persons. 
</p>
<p>92. The Declarations of compensation and personal recognition, established under Act 
No. 52/2007, have been portrayed by many official commentators as the greatest gesture of 
recognition for victims of the Civil War and the dictatorship. The Declarations, however, 
met with only a lukewarm reception on the part of the victims, many of whom took the 
view that the document did not constitute adequate redress. If a careful assessment is made 
of the reasons for these feelings, it could reveal the content of the victims&#8217; complaints. The 
Special Rapporteur emphasizes the essential value of the recognition of the facts and 
responsibilities and the presentation of an official apology, which extends beyond a mere 
generic recognition. 
</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned at the impact of violations 
perpetrated against women, whether direct or indirect victims, and the little attention 
generally given to them in present measures of reparation.

<p><b> C. Annulment of sentences handed down by courts during the Civil War 
and the Franco regime</b>15<b> 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the provisions of Act No. 52/2007 that recognize 
and declare the &#8220;radically unjust&#8221; nature and illegality of the convictions and sanctions 
handed down for political or ideological reasons or beliefs by special courts during the 
Civil War and by all criminal or administrative courts or authorities during the dictatorship. 
The Act also establishes that the victims of these injustices may request the issue of 
Declarations of reparation and personal recognition. Despite these measures, victims and 
their families continue to claim effective reparation for these violations, and for such 
sentences to be declared null and void. Annulment would represent not only symbolic 
redress, but it would also terminate the legal effects of the sentences. 
</p>
<p>95. Some sources suggested that annulment should also apply to sanctions passed under 
the Anti-Vagrancy and Delinquency Act, which were handed down arbitrarily by courts to 
punish and condemn persons for their political opinions or affiliations. 
</p>
<p>96. The first note by the State lawyers, of 3 November 2004, on the possible review-
annulment of sentences during the Civil War and the Franco regime, offers an analysis of 
precedents and comparative law, with reference to the German case. In its conclusions, 
while it mentions the principles of legal certainty, res judicata and non-retroactivity as a 
major difficulty, it does not discard the possibilities of the annulment of sentences, and on 
the contrary sets out alternatives which should be considered in detail. 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the only review of a conviction by the 
Supreme Court in 2007, in the case of the execution of Ricardo Puente Rodr&#237;guez, on the 
grounds of a flagrant formal flaw. The Special Rapporteur regrets that other appeals lodged 
in similar cases were unsuccessful and that the judicial authorities give precedence to the 
principle of legal certainty over the rights of the victims, the right to justice and the 
principles of due process. He regrets that the Government and the Legislature have still not 
paid sufficient attention to this matter and that concerns of an economic order may have 
prevailed when the decision was taken. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the legislative proposals calling for the annulment 
of the sentences that led to the summary executions of well-known political figures (such as 
Lluis Companys, Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera and Alexandre B&#243;veda). He insists, 
however, that it is important to establish measures that benefit all victims without 
distinction. In this sense he welcomes the provisions of the Community Act No. 33/2013 of 
Navarra, which requires that the Spanish State annul all judgements passed by military 
and/or civil courts on political grounds, including all sentences by special courts. The draft 
Bill on Democratic Memory of Andalusia establishes similar provisions. 
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur encourages the State to return as soon as possible to this 
question and reiterates his readiness to assist within the framework of his mandate. He 
recalls that comparative studies of other experiences of countries that have faced similar 
challenges, including in the European context, such as Germany, could prove extremely 
useful.

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes a considerable discrepancy between the positions 
adopted by the majority of State institutions on the one hand and on the other the 
victims and associations with whom he was in contact. The authorities appear to 
maintain that, as far as possible, the claims of the victims and associations have mostly 
been met, but many of the latter feel insufficiently recognized and compensated. This 
gap is particularly worrying considering that the expectations expressed by many 
victims cannot, generally speaking, be considered &#8220;excessive&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Initiatives in favour of promoting truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of 
non-recurrence have to a great extent been pursued by civil society, in particular 
associations of victims and families, mainly the grandchildren&#8217;s generation. This is 
due to the deep-felt commitment on the part of victims, families and associations to 
keep the voice and claims of victims alive, as well as to the vacuum left by the State in 
respect of responding to the claims. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that several government representatives, in the 
course of the meetings he had with them, tended to base discussions on the following 
proposition: &#8220;either we all agree that we are fully reconciled, or the only alternative is 
the resurgence of underlying hatreds, which would entail too high a risk&#8221;. In the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this position does not do justice to the progress achieved 
with the process of democratization in Spain. He emphasizes that, considering the 
strength of the institutions and the absence of risk for the stability of the democratic 
order, it is especially surprising to note that not more has been done for the rights of 
so many victims. The Special Rapporteur points out that the strength of democratic 
institutions must be measured not by their ability to ignore certain issues, especially 
those that refer to fundamental rights, but rather by their ability to manage them 
effectively, however complex and awkward they may be. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call for trust among citizens, but 
especially trust in State institutions, as the objective of implementing the measures 
related to the mandate.</b>16 <b>Both the institutions and Spanish society are capable of 
debating and implementing these measures more decisively, which would offer the 
possibility of increasing and strengthening the trust that exists among citizens and 
between them and their institutions. Reconciliation devoid of attempts to give full 
effect to the rights to truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence is 
invariably only an empty name that is given to a temporary stage in a process which 
allows the claims to live on. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Special Rapporteur lists below his main recommendations and reiterates 
his full willingness to assist the authorities with implementation. He calls on the 
Government and the State bodies concerned to: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Show a firm commitment on the part of the State to fully implement, as a 
matter of priority, the rights to truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-
recurrence. The Special Rapporteur insists that the shortage of resources, though they 
might curtail the State&#8217;s capacities, cannot justify inaction with respect to such 
measures; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) Rigorously assess the implementation of the Historical Memory Act and 
its use by victims with a view to adapting models and measures to victim&#8217;s claims, and

</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Increase and promote contact and coordination among the various 
public institutions of historical memory, and allocate the necessary resources for their 
proper functioning; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) Promote actions in this respect and coordination between existing 
Ombudsmen&#8217;s offices at national and autonomous community level; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) Avoid glaring discrepancies between autonomous community and 
national levels in related laws, ensuring equal and uniform protection for all victims 
alike. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the competence of the autonomous 
communities and the development of legislation and measures that offer greater 
recognition and protection to victims than at national level; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f) Support the initiatives of the State and civil society that coordinate and 
respond to the claims of all the victims of human rights and humanitarian law 
violations, regardless of their political affiliation or that of the perpetrators. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Truth 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Urgently deal with the demands of victims in terms of truth, establish 
some mechanism to &#8220;make truth official&#8221; and resolve the excessive fragmentation to 
which memory-building in Spain has been subject. Restore, if not increase, the 
resources devoted to this purpose. An official mechanism for clarifying the truth 
should perform at least the following functions: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Systematize existing information; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Resolve the fragmentation and dispersion of information and efforts;

dissemination of its conclusions such as to offer official recognition to the

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Facilitate the participation of victims and their families in the process and be 
governed by the notion of rights, regardless of the identity or political 
affiliation of either victims or perpetrators; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(h) In consultation with victims and associations, review the current system 
whereby the State delegates responsibility for exhumations. Allocate the necessary 
resources and ensure the participation of judicial authorities, among others, in all 
cases; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(i) Establish a State archive policy that guarantees access to all 
documentary funds, reviewing the criteria applicable to privacy and confidentiality, in 
order to bring them into line with applicable international standards, introducing 
clear regulations, for example through the adoption of an Archive Act. </b></p>

contextualization and the &#8220;reinterpretation&#8221; of symbols and monuments, failing a 
recommendation in favour of their simple removal; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Implement the recommendations put forward by the Committee of 
Experts on the Future of the Valle de los Ca&#237;dos in its 2011 report, in particular with 
respect to the &#8220;reinterpretation&#8221; of the site, and research, dissemination, restoration 
and conservation programmes, including ensuring the dignity of the cemetery and the 
respectful conservation of the remains of all the persons buried there. Bring greater 
clarity to the legislation on the legal conditions governing different parts of the site, 
and on the competencies and responsibilities of the State and the Church. Receive the 
requests of those who wish to recover the remains of family members buried there 
without their consent. When it is not materially possible, devise and implement, in 
consultation with family members, suitable measures of reparation, including 
symbolic or honorific measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Continue consolidating the efforts made in terms of historical and 
human rights education and establish mechanisms for assessing the implementation of 
these programmes, with a view to ensuring consistency and effective implementation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Strengthen the programmes for the human rights training of civil 
servants, including the Judiciary and security forces, and incorporate subjects related 
to the Civil War and the Franco era, in line with national study programmes, 
including the study of the responsibilities incurred by State institutions in the serious 
human rights and humanitarian law violations that occurred during this period, as a 
means of promoting education and awareness as well as non-recurrence. Focus this 
study on the rights of all victims. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reparation 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Extend the recognition and coverage of reparation programmes to 
include all the categories of victims who have been excluded from existing

symbolic reparation measures;

<p><b> (o) Extend existing studies concerning violations to the rights of women and 
develop measures of reparation and special recognition of the harm they suffered as a 
consequence of the Civil War and the Franco regime, including sexual violence, 
assaults, humiliations and discrimination in reprisal for their real or suspected

handed down in violation of the fundamental principles of law and due process during 
the Civil War and the Franco regime. Comparative studies of other experiences

the European context, may prove extremely useful. </b></p>
