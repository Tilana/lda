<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 
17/119, in which the secretariat was requested to provide an annual written update on the 
operations of the Voluntary Fund for financial and technical assistance in the 
implementation of the universal periodic review (the Voluntary Fund for UPR 
Implementation) and on the resources available to it. The present report provides an 
overview of contributions and expenditure as at 31 December 2013, together with a 
description of action taken since the submission of the previous report (A/HRC/24/56) to 
operationalize the Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation. It also provides a description 
of the activities to be funded by the Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation during the 
course of 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/17, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
establish a new financial mechanism called the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical 
Assistance in order to provide, in conjunction with multilateral funding mechanisms, a 
source of financial and technical assistance to help countries implement recommendations 
emanating from the universal periodic review in consultation with, and with the consent of, 
the country concerned. In its resolution 16/21, the Human Rights Council requested that the 
Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation be strengthened and operationalized in order to 
provide a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries, in particular least 
developed countries and small island developing States (SIDSs), to implement the 
recommendations emanating from their review. The Human Rights Council also requested 
that a board of trustees be established in accordance with the rules of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>3. The Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation was established in 2009 and States 
have commenced making contributions to it. The Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) has begun operationalizing the Fund by providing financial and 
technical assistance to States which have requested support. Support has been provided in 
the spirit of the universal periodic review, in the founding resolution for which it is 
provided that the objectives are the improvement of the human rights situation on the 
ground (Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, annex, para. 4 (a)), the fulfilment of the 
State&#8217;s human rights obligations and commitments (ibid., para. 4 (b)) and the enhancement 
of the State&#8217;s capacity and of technical assistance, in consultation with, and with the 
consent of, the State concerned (ibid., para. 4 (c)). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Operationalization of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Board of Trustees of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 30 May 2013, the Secretary-General appointed the members of the Board of 
Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation, who will also serve as the Board 
of Trustees for the Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation. They are tasked with 
overseeing the management of the latter Fund. </p>


<p>5. In close consultation with the various sections of OHCHR, the Board of Trustees 
focuses its attention on broadly guiding the operationalization of the Fund by providing 
policy advice. 
</p>
<p>6. The Board of Trustees held its first session in Geneva in November 2013 and was 
briefed on the OHCHR approach to UPR follow-up as well as on the support provided to a 
number of States which had been funded by the Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation. 
</p>
<p>7. The Board of Trustees held its second session in Mexico City in February 2014, 
during which it reviewed the projects to be funded from the Voluntary Fund for UPR 
Implementation in 2014. The Board of Trustees noted with satisfaction that a number of 
projects to be implemented during 2014 were geared towards bringing about tangible 
results on the ground. The Board of Trustees emphasized the importance of ensuring the 
sustainability of the impact, and of active civil society involvement in UPR follow-up. 
</p>
<p>8. The Board of Trustees also held discussions with OHCHR on the newly revitalized 
OHCHR strategic vision for more integrated, proactive and systematic UPR follow-up. The 
Board of Trustees welcomed the ongoing efforts of OHCHR to design such a strategy, and 
provided OHCHR with advice and guidance thereon. 
</p>
<p><b> B. OHCHR strategic vision for UPR follow-up and the Fund: 
going forward 
</b></p>
<p>9. Over the past two years, OHCHR has been developing the capacity to provide 
increased support to States in their efforts to implement the outcome of the UPR, including 
through the operationalization of the Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation. This effort 
has included an integrated approach to supporting implementation of recommendations 
emanating from all the international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>10. Building on lessons learned, OHCHR is in the process of revitalizing a strategic 
vision for UPR follow-up that is more proactive, systematic and results-oriented. This 
newly revitalized strategy for UPR follow-up will seek to enable OHCHR to provide more 
effective support to States on the ground, whether directly or through ensuring the 
integration of support in United Nations Country Team programming on UPR follow-up, to 
enable States to achieve concrete results for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
In the strategic vision, the role of OHCHR will be defined as &#8220;a clearing house&#8221; as 
requested by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 16/21. 
</p>
<p>11. The documentation of best practices is also an important priority in this new 
strategy. It is vital that good practices on follow-up should be made available as widely as 
possible. The Fund for UPR Implementation will therefore continue to fund the 
documentation of good practices emerging from the implementation of technical assistance 
projects and which could be replicated in other countries. Systematic documentation of 
good practices on follow-up to the projects and of effective project management 
methodologies by recipients of moneys from the Fund will constitute an important 
precondition for support. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities to be supported by the Fund during 2014 
</b>12. A project to strengthen the capacity of the national authorities in the Republic of 
Moldova to combat discrimination will be supported by the Voluntary Fund for UPR 
Implementation, in particular concerning the National Council to Prevent and Combat 
Discrimination, judges and prosecutors, and other stakeholders, including lawyers, health 
service providers, civil society organizations, and, especially, men and women from </p>


<p>vulnerable groups such as lesbian, gay bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The 
project is aimed at: reducing impunity for discriminatory acts in service provision; 
enhancing the work of free legal aid lawyers on discrimination cases; increasing the number 
of investigations undertaken by relevant State authorities; and empowering vulnerable 
groups to seek protection against discrimination and to receive effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>13. Lack of birth registration has far-reaching negative implications on the enjoyment of 
a wide range of human rights for the children concerned. In a project in Niger on birth 
registration for children in remote nomadic areas, a local non-governmental organization 
(NGO) will register children at birth in cooperation with the authorities, including local 
magistrates. A similar project in Panama will be implemented by the OHCHR Regional 
Office in Central America, based in Panama, in cooperation with the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). This project will assist the National Directorate of the Civil 
Registry of the Electoral Tribunal in reaching out to the indigenous Ngabe-Bugle 
communities which follow the Mama Tata religion, in view of the specific 
recommendations made to Panama during its 2010 UPR to step up its efforts to guarantee 
the right of all children to birth registration. 
</p>
<p>14. The United Nations country teams in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, 
with expert advice and support from the OHCHR Regional Office for South America, 
based in Chile, and on a cost-sharing basis, have been providing support to the 
Governments and civil society in these countries in analysing and reviewing key UPR 
recommendations, defining road maps and identifying needs for capacity-building and 
technical assistance, which have been integrated into the respective United Nations 
common country programming documents, such as the United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework (UNDAF). In addition, the United Nations country teams have been 
promoting the documenting and sharing of good practices on cooperation among countries 
with United Nations human rights mechanisms, as well as of strategies and policies to 
address key thematic human rights issues of concern. 
</p>
<p>15. A project in Bosnia and Herzegovina is intended to advocate the establishment of an 
effective mechanism for integrated reporting and follow-up to the recommendations of 
international human rights mechanisms by helping the Government&#8217;s UPR Working Group 
to build the capacity for analysing and prioritizing the UPR recommendations. Thematic 
clustering of the recommendations of United Nations human rights mechanisms for the 
purpose of implementation will be undertaken. As part of monitoring the implementation of 
prioritized UPR recommendations, the OHCHR guide, &#8220;Human rights indicators: A guide 
to measurement and implementation&#8221;, will be translated into local languages and put to use 
as a monitoring tool. The capacity of civil society organizations and the media in their 
monitoring role for UPR follow-up will be strengthened. 
</p>

<p>19. A project in Uganda is intended to provide support for the development of a national 
human rights action plan. An online database/search engine containing all the 
recommendations from international human rights mechanisms to Uganda will be 
developed, to serve as a monitoring tool for implementation of those recommendations, as 
well as of the National Human Rights Action Plan. This database/online search engine will 
be administered and maintained by the Human Rights Commission of Uganda, which will 
help centralize control of information by ensuring the accuracy of the monitoring 
information to be fed into the database. 
</p>
<p>20. A project in the Democratic Republic of Congo seeks to: provide logistical and 
technical support for the establishment of a new National Human Rights Commission; 
provide support for the adoption of the law aimed at protecting human rights defenders; and 
strengthen the capacity of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Human Rights tasked with 
drafting reports and providing follow-up to international human rights mechanisms as part 
of its international obligation. 
</p>
<p>21. A project in Guinea Conakry seeks to provide support to the Government to 
establish an independent human rights commission in conformity with the Paris Principles. 
A draft law on the establishment of such a commission was prepared in 2011, but the 
promulgation of the law has been delayed. Support will be provided to ensure that the draft 
law is in full conformity with the Paris Principles. The primary objective of the project is to 
ensure that rights-holders are empowered to benefit from the establishment of such a 
commission. 
</p>
<p>22. During 2014, the Fund will continue to support civil society organizations in playing 
an active role in the implementation of UPR recommendations, including in monitoring. A 
follow-up meeting for civil society in north-east Asia is planned, to examine how civil 
society organizations can contribute to more effective follow-up to the recommendations at 
the country level.

<p>23. Table 1 shows the detailed financial situation of the Fund as at 31 December 2013 
(statement of income and expenditure). In addition, disbursements totalling US$ 259,470 
have been made for the period 1 January&#8211;14 March 2014. 
</p>
<p>24. Since the establishment of the Trust Fund for UPR Implementation in 2009, seven 
countries have made financial contributions: Australia, Colombia, Germany, Morocco, 
Norway, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland. Since the previous report (A/HRC/24/56), Kazakhstan has also made further 
financial contributions. Table 2 provides an overview of all contributions received for the 
reporting period, from the establishment of the Fund to 31 December 2013. No additional 
financial contributions have been received during the period January&#8211;March 2014. 
</p>
<p>25. As noted above, with the newly revitalized OHCHR strategic vision for UPR 
follow-up, it is expected that the rate of disbursement of moneys from the Trust Fund for 
UPR Implementation will be increased. It would therefore be advisable to expand the donor 
base of the Fund, so that all interested Member States, including developing countries, 
make contributions. OHCHR could thereby gradually ensure the universal application of 
the new strategic vision for follow-up to all Member States, in line with the universality 
principle of the universal periodic review mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>26. <b>Efforts to follow up the UPR recommendations should be built around securing 
the political will and ability of States to bring about tangible results with a view to 
improving the human rights situation on the ground. The Voluntary Fund for 
financial and technical assistance for the implementation of the universal periodic 
review continues to serve as a valuable source of support for countries in the 
implementation of their UPR recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>It is hoped that a revitalized OHCHR strategic vision for UPR follow-up that is 
more proactive, systematic and results-oriented, coupled with financial support from 
the Voluntary Fund, will support States in fulfilling their primary responsibility to 
implement the recommendations of UPR. It is also hoped that an integrated approach 
to follow-up the recommendations of international human rights mechanisms, 
including treaty bodies, special procedures and UPR, will be applied as broadly and 
systematically as possible. 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>Moreover, with a newly revitalized OHCHR strategic vision for UPR follow-up 
with financial support from the Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation, OHCHR 
should be in a position to meet its responsibility to act as a &#8220;clearing house&#8221;, as 
proposed by the Human Rights Council.</b> 
</p>
<p>29. <b>The support to be provided by the Trust Fund for UPR Implementation will 
allow a growing body of good practices on UPR follow-up to be generated and 
documented. OHCHR is therefore paying priority attention to the need to document 
such good practices in a more systematic way and will make every effort to ensure 
that good practices both in effective project management methodologies and in follow-
up to common global thematic human rights issues, including mainstreamed themes 
on gender and migrant workers, are documented and shared to enable other States to 
replicate them, tailoring them to their own specific needs. It will further provide an 
enhanced level of sustainability of support to States for UPR follow-up. 
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>It should be re-emphasized that the primary responsibility for the 
implementation of UPR recommendations rests with States themselves and, as 
appropriate, with other relevant stakeholders. Hence, it is critical that the active </b></p>


<p><b>participation of other stakeholders in the follow-up process be secured and 
encouraged.
