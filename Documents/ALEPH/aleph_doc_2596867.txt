1.  Performance overview 
 
Financial Year 2016 proved to be another challenging year for the oil and gas industry globally with continuing low oil 
prices. Like other organisations in the sector, AWE was impacted by these external market conditions, with lower oil 
prices leading to lower revenue, operating cash flow and profit for the year. 
 
In the context of the decline in global oil prices and continuing volatility, the Company undertook a review which 
resulted in a number of key initiatives designed to respond to the challenges of the external environment. These 
included:
  Ensuring certainty of cash flow - successful implementation of a hedging program which added $11.8m in
revenues for the period (FY2015 $nil);
cost savings;
  Reducing discretionary spending – reduced overheads by 30% and implemented procurement and operating
  Optimising operating structure – closed Jakarta office, exited USA, reduced staffing levels by 30%; 
 
  Reducing total capital spend – reduced total capital spend by more than 50% from $242.5 million in FY2015
Focusing in the near term on Australian gas assets - particularly west coast and east coast Australia;
  Maintain flexible balance sheet – through a prioritising of investment spend and recycling of capital from
to $120.3 million in FY2016; and
asset sales to debt reduction.
Despite the challenges presented by these external conditions, the Company delivered a solid operating performance, 
with a number of important achievements:
  HSE - No reportable environmental incidents recorded and no safety incidents during the period. The
Company continues to prioritise the health and safety of employees and contractors at AWE sites;
  Community and stakeholder engagement - continued open engagement with landowners, local communities,
regulators and governments particularly in Western Australia and New Zealand where we operate;
  Production - Total production of 5.0 mmboe, in line with market guidance and the previous year with 60:40
ratio of gas / NGL’s and liquids production;
  Development - Successfully completed Stage 1A construction and commencement of gas production
subsequent to the end of the period at the AWE operated Waitsia gas project;
  Reserves -  While reserves reduced overall due to the sale of Sugarloaf, a 93% increase in 2P Reserves to 
344Bcf of gas (AWE share 172 Bcf of gas or 30.4 mmboe) and a 30% increase in 2C Contingent Resources 
to 630 Bcf (AWE share 315 Bcf or 55.7 mmboe) was recognised in respect of Waitsia gas project;
  Completion of asset sales including Sugarloaf and Cliff Head enabling the recycling of capital to AWE’s
Australian gas assets;
  Reduced exposure to oil price - The near term exposure to oil price volatility has been significantly reduced; 
  Successful completion of an appraisal well for the Ande Ande Lumut project, which provides the opportunity to
benefit from future improvements in the oil price;
  Debt reduction - net debt repayment of $153.8 million during the period and net cash of $17.8 million held at
30 June 2016.

AWE's Financial Report complies with Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The underlying (non-IFRS) profit / (loss) 
is unaudited but is derived from the audited accounts by removing the impact of non-recurring items from the reported (IFRS) audited profit.  AWE believes the non-IFRS 
profit / (loss) reflects a more meaningful measure of the consolidated entity's underlying performance

1.1 
 
The consolidated entity reported a net loss after tax of $363.0 million for the year compared to a net loss after tax of 
$230.2 million for the previous financial year. The result includes a net impairment charge of $242.5 million ($291.8 
million pre-tax, $49.3 million tax effect) reflecting the further decline in global oil prices and a reduction in BassGas 2P 
Reserves. 
 
After adjusting for non-recurring items of $295.6 million, an underlying loss of $67.4 million was recognised for the 
period. This compared to an underlying loss $52.3 million for the corresponding period. 
 
AWE recorded sales revenue for 2016 of $202.4 million, including $11.8 million of hedging gains. This was 29% lower 
than the previous year (2015: $283.7 million) due to further declines in global oil prices and the sale of Sugarloaf in 
March 2016. The average realised oil and condensate price for the period was 27% lower at A$57 per barrel, 
compared to A$79 per barrel in the previous year. Approximately 34% of total revenue was derived from long term 
fixed price gas contracts. AWE held inventory of 198,400 barrels at year end in respect of the Tui oil project. 
 
Operating costs were $110.4 million for the year, 21% lower than the previous financial year (2015: $140.5 million). 
The lower operating costs reflect cash savings across the portfolio and the sale of Sugarloaf. 
 
Field EBITDAX of $92.0 million was lower than the previous year (2015: $143.2 million) also reflecting lower realised 
oil and condensate prices and the sale of Sugarloaf. Net cash from operating activities was $70.3 million, 13% higher 
than the previous financial year of $62.2 million.   
 
In accordance with AWE’s successful efforts accounting policy the Company expensed $18.2 million of exploration and 
evaluation costs during the period, down 52% compared to the prior year.  Exploration and evaluation costs expensed 
during the year included drilling costs incurred in Block 09/05 in Bohai Bay, China, and costs relating to the acquisition 
and interpretation of seismic data in the North Carnarvon Basin. 
 
A taxation expense is recognised for the period of $36.7 million compared to a net taxation benefit of $79.3 million for 
the prior year, which included a taxation benefit of $88.7 million relating to the impairment of the BassGas, Cliff Head 
and Tui projects recognised during the prior period. Taxation expense includes the tax effect of Petroleum Resource 
Rent Tax (PRRT) in Australia and Accounting Profits Royalty (APR) in New Zealand. 
 
 
1.2 
 
A key initiative in the period was for the company to strengthen its balance sheet by recycling capital from asset sales. 
At 30 June 2016, the Company had a net cash position of $17.8 million, with cash of $32.6 million, drawn debt of $14.8 
million, and undrawn facilities of $385.2 million.  
 
During the period, the sale of the Company’s 10% interest in the Sugarloaf AMI for US$190 million (A$271 million) 
enabled the repayment of $153.8 million of debt from the proceeds of the sale. 
 
Subsequent to the end of the period, the Company reduced its debt facility by $100 million from $400 million to $300 
million, which reflects AWE’s significantly lower capex commitments post the sale of Sugarloaf.

Total oil and gas production of 5.0 mmboe was in line with the previous financial year, with increased production at 
BassGas following completion of the drilling phase of the Mid-Life Enhancement (MLE) project, offset by reduced 
production from Casino and Cliff Head. 
 
An overall decrease in 2P Reserves of 38.4 mmboe and 2C Contingent Resources of 19.7 mmboe was recorded for 
the period mainly due to the sale of Sugarloaf in March 2016. This was partly offset by an increase in 2P Reserves and 
2C Contingent Resources in respect of the Waitsia gas project.  
 
At BassGas, a reduction in net 2P Reserves of 2 mmboe to 7.4 mmboe after production was recognised at 30 June 
2016, based on a reassessment of the 2P Reserves by the Operator, Origin Energy, announced subsequent to year 
end. This was in addition to an earlier reduction in net 2P Reserves of 2.5 mmboe recognised at 31 December 2015. A 
detailed review of the reserves will be carried out during the second half of calendar year 2016.  
 
 
2.1 
 
BassGass Project (offshore Bass Basin, AWE 35%) 
The BassGas project achieved gross gas production of 18.2 PJ, 612,000 barrels of condensate and 55,000 tonnes of 
LPG. AWE’s share of production was 6.4 PJ of gas, 214,000 barrels of condensate and 19,000 tonnes of LPG. This 
represented an increase of 37% in AWE’s share of production for the full year compared to the previous financial year, 
with the completion of the drilling phase for the MLE project during the period. 
 
During the period, work was also being carried out on the final stage of the MLE project involving the hook-up and 
commissioning of the gas compression and condensate pumping modules, with start up expected in the first half of 
calendar year 2017. 
 
The Company recognised total impairments of $131.3 million after tax ($169.2 million pre-tax, $37.9 million tax effect) 
in the carrying value of the BassGas project. An impairment of $42.8 million after tax was recognised at 30 June 2016 
in connection with a reduction to net 2P Reserves, based on reserves information provided by the Operator. This is in 
addition to an impairment recognised at 31 December 2015 of $88.5 million after tax, relating to reductions to net 2P 
Reserves and lower forecast oil and gas prices. 
 
Casino Gas Project (offshore Otway Basin, AWE 25%) 
The Casino gas project, including the Casino, Henry and Netherby gas fields, achieved gross production of 19.3 PJ of 
gas and 10,500 barrels of condensate. AWE’s share of production for the year was 4.8 PJ of gas and 2,600 barrels of 
condensate. This represented a 25% decrease compared to the previous year due to scheduled maintenance and 
natural field decline.

2.2  Western Australia 
 
Waitsia Gas Project (L1/L2, onshore Perth Basin, AWE 50%, Operator) 
The AWE operated joint venture made significant progress on the Waitsia gas project during the period. Construction 
of Stage 1A was completed and gas production commenced subsequent to the end of the period. Stage 1A involves 
production from the Waitsia-1 and Senecio-3 wells being produced through the upgraded Xyris Production Facility. 
 
During the period, the Company recognised a significant increase in 2P Reserves and 2C Contingent Resources, 
comprising a 93% increase in 2P Reserves to 344Bcf of gas (AWE share 172 Bcf of gas or 30.4 mmboe) and a 30% 
increase in 2C Contingent Resources to 630 Bcf (AWE share 315 Bcf or 55.7 mmboe). 
 
The Company achieved excellent flow test results at Waitsia-1 where independent flow tests from the Kingia and High 
Cliff Sandstone reservoirs delivered a total combined flow rate in excess of 50 mmscf/d, constrained by production 
tubing diameter. 
 
At the end of the period, the Company was evaluating development options for the Stage 2 development, with 
production of up to 100 TJ/day and gas marketing was underway. The Company is targeting final investment decision 
(FID) for Stage 2 in calendar year 2017.  
 
Onshore Perth Basin (AWE 33.0% to 100%) 
The Onshore Perth Basin operations contributed 0.36 mmboe to AWE’s gas and oil production for the year, with 
AWE’s share totalling 2.1 PJ of natural gas, with approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate. The majority of production 
was delivered from the Beharra Springs gas project.  
 
Work continued in relation to decommissioning of legacy infrastructure in the Perth Basin. 
 
Cliff Head Oil Project (offshore Perth Basin, AWE 57.5%) 
The Cliff Head oil project contributed gross production of 0.48 million barrels of oil. AWE’s net share of production was 
approximately 0.28 million barrels for the year, a reduction of 23% due to natural field decline. 
 
The Company recognised an impairment of $14.6 million after tax at 31 December 2015 due to lower long term oil 
price forecasts.  
 
In June 2016, AWE sold its 57.5% interest in the Cliff Head oil project to Triangle Energy (Global) Limited for 
consideration of $3.2 million which resulted in a net gain of $16.4 million (post tax $6.7 million) following write back of 
net liabilities. 
 
 
2.3 
 
Tui Oil Project (offshore Taranaki Basin, AWE 57.5%) 
The Tui oil project recorded gross oil production of 1.37 million barrels (AWE share 0.79 million barrels), down 6% on 
the previous year.  
 
Inventory at the end of the period was 345,000 barrels (AWE share 198,400 barrels).  
 
The Company recognised an impairment of $53.6 million after tax in the carrying value of the Tui oil project at 31 
December 2015 due to lower long term oil price forecasts. 
 
The contract for the “Umuroa” FPSO was renegotiated and extended by one year to 31 December 2017. 
 
 
2.4 
 
Sugarloaf AMI (onshore Texas, AWE share 10%, net ~7.5% after landowner royalties) 
During the period, the Company’s interest in the Sugarloaf AMI contributed approximately 629,000 barrels of 
condensate, 2.2 PJ of gas and 25,700 tonnes of LPG, net of landowner royalties. 
 
In March 2016, the Company sold its interest in the Sugarloaf AMI to Carrier Energy Partners II for USD190 million, 
before purchase price adjustments. This asset has been included as a discontinued operation in the financial 
statements.

Ande Ande Lumut Oil Project (Northwest Natuna PSC, offshore Indonesia, AWE 50%) 
The AAL-4XST1 appraisal well was successfully drilled during the period and operations were completed subsequent 
to the end of the period. The primary target was the G Sand reservoir, estimated to contain 289 mmbbls gross oil in 
place and 36 mmbbls gross recoverable oil (net 8.4 mmbbls 2C Contingent Resources to AWE). The G Sand is located 
below the K Sand reservoir (101 mmbbls gross recoverable oil, net 24.3 mmbbls of 2P Reserves and 1.7 mmbbls 2C 
Contingent Resources). 
 
Procurement processes for the wellhead platform and FPSO continued during the period. The Operator has extended 
the FID to the second half of calendar year 2017, and first oil is scheduled for 2020. 
 
Lengo Gas Project (Bulu PSC, offshore Indonesia, AWE 42.5%) 
The Lengo gas project is located in the Bulu PSC, offshore East Java. Development activities progressed during the 
period, with FEED work for the offshore facilities and pipeline and surveys for the well head platform site, pipeline route 
and the offshore receiving terminal being completed.  
 
In May 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its 42.5% interest in the Bulu PSC 
to a subsidiary of HyOil Pte Ltd for up to A$27.5 million cash consideration. The sale is subject to the approval of the 
Indonesian Government. This asset is disclosed as an Asset held for sale in the financial statements. 
 
 
3.  Exploration activities 
 
In view of the low oil price environment and the need to preserve capital, there was a significant reduction in 
exploration activity and expenditure during the period.

Business strategy
Business strategy & opportunities
5. 
 
5.1 
 
AWE’s goal is to be a leading energy company in Australia by building a sustainable business that delivers superior 
returns to shareholders.  
 
The Company has implemented a strategy that is focused on pursuing opportunities in oil and high value gas in the 
geographic areas comprising Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. 
 
AWE has a suite of established and valuable producing assets that deliver stable operating cash flows and which 
underpins the ability of the Company to reinvest in key development projects to drive growth. In the near term, AWE is 
prioritising the development of its high value gas assets in the Perth Basin, while the Ande Ande Lumut oil project in 
Indonesia provides exposure to the potential upside in oil prices in the medium term. 
 
AWE is committed to these goals while preserving our commitment of zero harm to our people, minimising our impact 
on the environment, supporting the communities in which we operate and building a motivated and engaged team.

Opportunities
5.2 
 
During the period, the Company has implemented strategic initiatives in response to the low oil price environment, 
including a comprehensive review of the asset portfolio which has resulted in the successful divestment of a number of 
non-core assets and has significantly reduced ongoing exploration and development capital commitments, while also 
reducing debt by $153.8 million during the period. 
 
The focus and objective of the Company is to generate sustainable returns to shareholders whilst maintaining a 
prudent and disciplined approach to financial management, including a continued focus on achieving cost savings 
across the business. AWE will pursue growth initiatives from its existing portfolio of exploration and development 
assets as well as new opportunities where it is value accretive and where we have the balance sheet capacity to 
support future development expenditure. 
 
Key projects and opportunities being pursued during the next financial year include:
  Development of the Waitsia gas project, which achieved the commencement of Stage 1A gas production after
the end of the period. A key focus during FY2017 will be progressing towards achieving a final investment 
decision for the Stage 2 development, following further appraisal drilling planned for calendar year 2017.
  At BassGas, the completion of the hook-up and commissioning of the gas compression and condensate
pumping modules and development concept studies for the Trefoil field, adjacent to the existing Yolla field in 
the Bass Basin. 
 
In the Otway Basin, the Casino joint venture will assess a range of options for the next phase of development 
for the project. 
 
The AAL oil field development in Indonesia, where it is planned to progress the project through important 
milestones including the tendering for the FPSO and wellhead platform. FID is targeted for late 2017 calendar 
year and first oil in 2020.


AWE will continue to review a range of exploration and new business opportunities in conventional and unconventional 
oil and gas, but only where the business and economic case continues to be positive at low oil prices.   
 
 
5.3 
 
The following material business risks have been identified as key issues that have the potential to impact the 
Company’s performance:
Material business risks
  Commodity price risk, which directly impacts AWE through the realised price received from the sale of
hydrocarbons – gas, crude oil, condensate and LPG with the exception of Australian gas sales which are 
made under long-term contracts where the price is denominated in Australian dollars. The risk relating to oil 
prices has been mitigated in the near term by the sale of the Company’s interest in the Sugarloaf AMI and the 
implementation of an oil price hedging program during 2016 financial year.
  Reserves and production risks, where future performance of individual assets may not meet current estimates
and forecasts.
  Execution of development and operating projects, including meeting schedule and budget, which could be

subject to changes in future industry and economic conditions.   
 
Sovereign risk relating to the expected fiscal, tax and regulatory environment in jurisdictions that AWE does 
business.
  Health, Safety and Environmental risks which are recognised by AWE as being of critical importance in
ensuring AWE continues to build and operate a sustainable business and which remain a key priority for the 
Company.
  Maintaining the Company’s social licence to operate by pursuing operational excellence and proactively
engaging with the communities, regulators and other key stakeholders, particularly in relation to onshore oil 
and gas exploration, development and production activities.

Under the Company’s Constitution, and to the extent permitted by law, every person who is, or has been, a director or 
officer of the Company is indemnified against: 
 
1.  a liability incurred by that person, in his or her capacity as a director or secretary, to another person (other than the 
Company or a related body  corporate  of the Company) provided that the liability does not arise out  of conduct 
involving a lack of good faith; and
2.  a liability for costs and expenses incurred by that person:
(i)
(ii)
in  defending  any  proceedings  in  which  judgement  is  given  in  that  person’s  favour,  or  in  which  that 
person is acquitted, or
in connection with an application in relation to any proceedings in which the Court grants relief to that 
person under the Corporations Act.
During the financial year, the Company paid premiums based on normal commercial terms and conditions to insure all 
directors, officers and employees of the Company against the costs and expenses in defending claims brought against 
the individual while performing services for the consolidated entity. The premium paid has not been disclosed as it is

provision  of  those  non-audit  services  during  the  year  by  the  auditor  is  compatible  with  the  auditor  independence 
requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:


All non–audit services do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and  
 
The non-audit services do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in

auditor’s own work, in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for 
the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards.

4.  Executive remuneration arrangements
4.1.  Principles and strategy
Objectives 
The key objectives of AWE’s remuneration practices are to:
Align the interests of senior executives, employees and shareholders; 
Attract and retain suitably qualified senior executives and employees; and
 
 
  Motivate senior executives and employees to achieve superior performance.
Mix of remuneration 
To achieve these objectives remuneration packages consist of:
 
 

Fixed remuneration; 
Short term performance benefits; and 
Long term performance benefits.
The remuneration structures are designed to align the interests of shareholders with remuneration outcomes by taking into 
account:

 
 

The performance of the consolidated entity including:
The results of exploration, development and production activities;
The growth in total returns to shareholders; 
The consolidated entity’s financial results;
 
 
  Delivery of base business; 
 
  Business growth; 
  Delivery of strategic objectives; 
  Adherence to health, safety and environment policies and targets; and 
  Compliance with regulations.
The capability and experience of senior executives; 
The ability of senior executives to control the performance of their relevant area of responsibility; and 
Current economic and industry circumstances.
Market comparatives 
In order to attract and retain suitably qualified senior executives and technical personnel and to ensure that salary packages are 
reasonable and competitive, fixed remuneration levels and at “risk” remuneration structures in the form of short and long term 
incentive benefits are benchmarked against independently provided data on Australian upstream oil and gas companies.  
 
To ensure that long term incentive structures are appropriately aligned to the long term interests of shareholders, the vesting of 
share rights (“rights”) are conditional on performance conditions which are tied to the three year total shareholder return of the 
Company and to the three year total shareholder returns of comparator group upstream oil and gas companies in the ASX 300 
Energy Index.

Deferral and Clawback of Performance – Based Remuneration
Scope 
A deferral and clawback policy has been adopted for performance-based remuneration and applies to the Managing Director 
and senior executives. The policy applies on a prospective basis for STI and LTI awards granted from July 2014. The Board (or 
delegated committee of the Board) has discretion and authority to make determinations under this policy.  
 
Application 
Clawback can include reduction, clawback or cancellation of awards and applies to both vested awards which have been 
deferred and awards granted but not yet vested. Once an STI or LTI award is vested, 50% of that award will be deferred for a 
period of 12 months and will be subject to clawback. 
 
Clawback Circumstances 
 
Serious misconduct; 
  Material misstatement in AWE’s financial statements; or 
  Material error or miscalculation that results in the award of performance based remuneration that would not have otherwise
been awarded.
Changes to remuneration structures
Changes to remuneration arrangements that were implemented with effect for financial year commencing 1 July 2016 include: 
 
 
 

Removal of the retention component of the Company’s LTI Plan; 
Agreement not to put in place any retention based arrangements for the Managing Director or senior executives; and 
Removal of the distinction between base and stretch targets in determining the Company’s KPI performance for STI 
calculation purposes.
4.2.  Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration consists of base salary calculated on a total cost basis, including fringe benefits tax and superannuation 
contributions (or equivalent).  
 
Remuneration levels are reviewed at least annually by the People Committee through a process that considers independent 
externally provided remuneration data and also taking into account the overall performance of the consolidated entity to ensure 
that remuneration is appropriate and competitive in the market place. 
 
In recognition of the current low oil price environment the board has determined that for the June 2017 financial year, there will 
be no increases to non-executive director fees or the salaries of the Managing Director or senior executive salaries. Further, no 
Company employee will receive an increase in salary, other than to allow for promotions. 
 
For details of fixed remuneration paid to senior executives and directors refer to section 6 and 7.
4.3.  Short term incentives
Short term performance benefits are awarded in the form of cash bonuses. These benefits are “at risk” and are paid for 
performance during the financial year and are designed to reward senior executives for meeting or exceeding Company and 
individual Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).
Managing Director KPIs 
Each year, the Board sets corporate KPIs for the Managing Director based on overall corporate performance targets.  
 
The Board reviews the KPI’s for the Managing Director annually and will amend the KPIs to reflect the strategic objectives of the 
Company, changing circumstances in the upstream oil and gas sector as well as other operational and financial factors.  The 
Board believes that the KPI’s should be set at robust and challenging levels and be aligned to activities that will achieve both 
short and long term sustainable shareholder returns. 
 
June 2016 Financial Year – Current Managing Director: Mr Biggs 
The Board determined the current Managing Director, who commenced employment in May 2016 is entitled to nil short term 
incentives for the year ended 30 June 2016 (refer to section 6.2) 
 
June 2016 Financial Year – Former Managing Director: Mr Clement 
For the June 2016 financial year the corporate KPIs for the former Managing Director were based on a balanced scorecard 
approach which are designed to deliver sustainable shareholder returns both in the short term and long term. These 
performance measures included:
  Delivery of base business (45%) 
  Strategy and growth (35%) 
  Board discretion (20%)
Delivery of Base Business KPI’s includes delivery at or in excess of specific board agreed performance measures in the 
following areas of operation:
AWE LIMITED | FINANCIAL REPORT | 30 JUNE 2016
21
  Safety and environment performance statistics; 
  Production within or better than market guidance;  
  Operating costs lower than or within budget; 
  Development projects on schedule and within budget; 
  Exploration program on schedule and within budget; 
  Balance sheet management and debt funding position; 
  People related activities including implementation of revised organisation structures in response to the low oil price
environment, development of senior executive succession plans and improved staff engagement; and
  Stakeholder management activities including shareholders, regulators, business partners and local communities and
impacts on associated project schedules.
Strategy and Growth KPIs includes delivery at or in excess of specific board agreed performance measures in the following 
areas of operation:
  Share price to net asset value discount; 
  Portfolio management including asset divestments and exploration farmouts; 
  Conversion of 2C resources to 2P reserves and 2C/2P additions from exploration activities; and 
  Development of long-term strategy for onshore Perth Basin gas development.
Board discretion KPI’s includes an allowance to cover the potential and inevitable changing company and industry 
circumstances during the financial year. 
 
On an assessment of actual performance for the June 2016 financial year the board has assessed KPI performance at 40% as 
follows:
  Delivery of base business (20%) 
  Strategy and growth (20%) 
  Board discretion (nil%) 
 
However, in recognition of the continued current low oil price environment the board has determined that there will be no STI 
payable for the June 2016 financial year notwithstanding company KPI performance for determining STIs was assessed at 40%  
 
For further details refer to section 6.2.
Senior Executives KPIs 
Corporate KPIs for senior executives are based on the same corporate KPIs as the Managing Director. In addition, the 
Managing Director sets individual KPIs for the senior executives. These KPIs take into account individual and departmental 
performance over which the senior executive has responsibility. The board believes that the attainment of these individual and 
departmental KPIs is essential in delivering overall corporate objectives. 
 
The structure of these short term incentive (“STI”) benefits as a percentage of fixed remuneration is as follows:
Maximum Short Term Incentive Benefits as a percentage of fixed remuneration  
Managing Director(1) 
Senior Executives(2) 
1. 
2.
100% of Managing Director KPIs are based on achieving corporate performance measures.  
50% of senior executive KPIs are based on the same corporate KPIs as the Managing Director and 50% are subject to individual and departmental KPIs over 
which the individual senior executive has responsibility.
50% 
40%
With effect from the June 2017 financial year the distinction between base and stretch targets in setting and measuring these 
KPI’s has been removed. 
 
The maximum STI is only payable if both the Company and individual performance has met or exceeded expectation.  In 
exceptional circumstances where all of the Company performance targets have not been met but an individual has 
demonstrated outstanding performance, the Board may use its discretion award up to 100% of that individual’s short term 
performance benefit.  
 
4.4.  Long term incentive plans
Long term incentive (“LTI”) “at risk” performance benefits are awarded in the form of share rights with vesting conditions tied to 
retention, absolute Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) and relative TSR. 
 
The rationale for the choice of these criteria includes: 
 
  To align employees with the commonly shared goals of delivering high returns for shareholders over the medium to long
term;
  To encourage and assist employees to become shareholders of AWE; 
  To provide a long term component of remuneration to enable AWE to compete effectively for the calibre of talent required for
the Company to be successful; and
  To help retain talented personnel and to minimise employee turnover.
AWE LIMITED | FINANCIAL REPORT | 30 JUNE 2016

Share Rights Plan 
The Company has a Share Rights Plan in place for the award of long term performance benefits. The Plan is designed to 
generate performance-based awards that may be converted, at the Board’s discretion, into AWE shares or cash. 
 
The key elements of the Plan include: 
 
  Rights are granted each year with the number of rights granted being determined by the employee’s level in the Company,
fixed remuneration at the time of grant and taking into account both the Company and employee’s performance in the 
previous financial year;
  There are three tranches of rights with separate vesting criteria:
 
 

Retention (1); 
Absolute TSR; and 
Relative TSR.

are no longer granted to senior executives.
  The vesting period is for three years with rights lapsing after three years if not vested and there will be no retesting; and 
  Rights granted in any particular financial year are tested for vesting over the three year period commencing 1 July of the
1.  Retention rights are not granted to the Managing Director and with effect from the 3 year cycle commencing 1 July 2016, Retention Rights
The Plan defines TSR as “the percentage change over a period in shareholder value due to share price movement and 
dividends paid assuming dividends are reinvested into AWE shares”. 
 
Unvested rights do not entitle the holder to receive dividends. 
 
The following table indicates the treatment of rights on termination of employment under the Plan:
Termination Circumstance
Treatment of Right
Dismissal/termination for fraud, cause, or gross misconduct
Resignation (other than as set out below)
Resignation (including 'retirement') after 10 years of service 
with the consent of the Board.
Company initiated termination without cause e.g. 
retrenchment and redundancy
Death or Total Permanent Disablement
Forfeit entitlements. 
Any and all opportunities in relation to the Cycle will be forfeited unless 
and to the extent otherwise determined by the Board. To the extent not 
forfeited, participation in the Cycle in respect of the Absolute TSR and 
Relative TSR Performance Measures, will continue on a pro rata basis as 
if the employee had remained an employee.
If the date of termination falls after the end of the first year of the 
Measurement Period for the Cycle then participation in the Cycle in 
respect of the Absolute TSR and Relative TSR Performance Measures, 
continues on a pro rata basis as if the employee had remained an 
employee.
If the date of termination falls within the first year of the Measurement 
Period for the Cycle then any and all entitlements in relation to the Cycle 
will be forfeited unless and to the extent otherwise determined by the 
Board. To the extent not forfeited, participation in the Cycle in respect of 
the Absolute TSR and Relative TSR Performance Measures, will 
continue on a pro rata basis as if the employee had remained an 
employee. 
 
Participation in the Cycle continues in full until expiry.
Early vesting of rights is not permitted other than at the time of change in control of the Company where the extent of any 
vesting is to be determined at the discretion of the Board.  
 
The maximum number of rights that can be granted as a percentage of fixed remuneration at the time of grant and converted to 
a number of rights using the June volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the AWE share price immediately preceding the 
grant is as follows:

AWE LIMITED | FINANCIAL REPORT | 30 JUNE 2016
The above table represents the maximum percentage of fixed remuneration on which the number of rights to be awarded are 
calculated. These rights will vest only if all performance conditions are satisfied to 100% (and then only if the maximum number 
of initial rights were granted based on past Company and individual performance). 
 
Vested rights will entitle the senior executive to an award which will vary with the AWE share price at the time of vesting. The 
board may decide in its absolute discretion the form of payment (cash or issue of shares) to satisfy these vested rights. 
 
Retention grants 
  Number of rights calculated using the June VWAP of the AWE share price immediately preceding the grant; and 
  Vest after three years if the employee remains employed by AWE.
Retention grants are only applicable for rights issued prior to July 2016 and vesting up to June 2018. For rights issued for 
periods commencing from July 2016, retention rights will not be granted. 
 
Absolute TSR grants 
  Number of rights calculated using the 30-day VWAP of the AWE share price in June of grant year 
  Vest after three years according to the Company’s Absolute TSR for that three year period. 
  The vesting scales to apply for Absolute TSR grants are as follows:

period.  For the grant of rights for all three year cycles since July 2014 the nominated relative comparator group is upstream 
oil and gas companies in the ASX 300 Energy Index at the end of the applicable three year measurement period. Refer to 
section 4.1 for discussion on current comparator group.

6.2.  Analysis of short term performance benefits included in remuneration 
 
Award of short term performance benefits 
Section 4.3 of this report details the consolidated entity’s approach to the granting and vesting of short term 
performance benefits. 
 
In recognition of the continued current low oil price environment the board has determined that there will be no STI 
payable for the June 2016 financial year even though company KPI performance for determining STIs was assessed at 
40%. Accordingly Nil% of potential short-term incentives in the form of cash bonuses vested and 100% of potential 
short-term incentives were forfeited during the year and no amounts were deferred and subject to clawback.  
 
In accordance with the Company’s deferral and clawback policy the Board has determined that deferred bonuses in 
respect of the June 2015 financial year be paid to executives as there was no circumstances that warranted such a 
clawback (refer section 4.1).
Analysis of long term performance benefits included in remuneration
6.3. 
 
Section 4.4 of this report details the consolidated entity’s approach to the granting and vesting of long term 
performance benefits.

grant of rights both in the current financial year and previous financial years.

7.  Non-executive director remuneration  
 
Total remuneration for all non-executive directors, last voted upon by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting of the Company, is not to exceed $1,200,000 per annum, inclusive of superannuation.  
 
This total pool enables the Company in the future, if required, to provide for:
•  Adequate financial incentives commensurate with the market to attract and retain suitably qualified and
experienced directors to replace existing non-executive directors;
•  Appropriate arrangements to be put in place to ensure a smooth transition on replacement of directors,
including a period of overlap if required; and 
Increases in the number of non-executive directors in the future should it be considered appropriate.
•
Total remuneration paid to non-executive directors in the financial year was $806,290 (2015: $872,424). Fees are set 
based on review of externally provided remuneration data with reference to fees paid to other non-executive directors 
of comparable companies and to current economic and industry conditions.  
 
In recognition of the current low oil price environment the board has determined that for both financial years ended 30 
June 2016 and 30 June 2017 there is to be no increase in fees payable to non-executive directors.   
 
Non-executive directors’ fees (including superannuation) for the 2016 financial year were as follows:

People Committee

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
1.  Statement of significant accounting policies 
 
AWE Limited (the “Company”) is a for profit company domiciled in 
Australia.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company 
for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 comprises the Company 
and its controlled entities (together referred to as the “consolidated 
entity”). 
 
(a)  Basis of preparation 
(i) 
Statement of compliance 
The  consolidated 
financial  statements  are  general  purpose 
financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with 
Australian  Accounting  Standards  (“AASBs”)  (including  Australian 
Interpretations)  adopted  by  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards 
Board (“AASB”) and the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated 
financial  statements  also  comply  with  International  Financial 
Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as  issued  by  the  International 
Accounting Standards Board.   
 
The  accounting  policies  set  out  in  this  note  have  been  applied 
consistently 
these  consolidated 
financial  statements.  Certain  comparative  amounts  have  been 
reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.  
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  were  authorised  for  issue 
by the directors on 25 August 2016. 
 
(ii) 
The  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Australian  Dollars, 
which  is  the  Company’s  functional  currency  and  the  functional 
currency  of 
the 
consolidated entity. 
 
The  Company  is  of  a  kind  referred  to  in  Class  Order  2016/191, 
issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission 
(“ASIC”), relating to the “rounding off” of amounts in the financial 
statements.  Amounts  in  the  financial  statements  have  been 
rounded  off  in  accordance  with  that  Class  Order  to  the  nearest 
thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar. 
 
(iii) 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis 
except that derivative financial instruments and available for sale 
financial assets are stated at their fair value. 
 
(iv) 
The  preparation  of 
in  conformity  with 
Australian  Accounting  Standards  requires  management  to  make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income 
and  expenses.  The  estimates  and  associated  assumptions  are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which  form  the  basis  of  making  the  judgements  about  carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
  
The  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  a 
regular basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the  period  in  which  the  estimate  is  revised  if  the  revision  affects 
only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 
The  most  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a 
significant  risk  of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying 
amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial  year 
relate to: 
 
Exploration and evaluation assets 
The  consolidated  entity’s  accounting  policy  for  exploration  and 
evaluation expenditure is set out at Note 1 (l). The application of 
this  policy  necessarily  requires  management  to  make  certain 
estimates  and  assumptions  as 
future  events  and
circumstances, in particular, the assessment of whether economic 
quantities of reserves have been found. Any such estimates and 
assumptions may change as new information becomes available. 
If,  after  having  capitalised  expenditure  under 
this  policy, 
management concludes that the capitalised expenditure is unlikely 
to  be  recovered  by  future  exploitation  or  sale,  then  the  relevant 
capitalised  amount  will  be  written  off  to  the  income  statement. 
Changes  in  assumptions  may  result  in  a  material  adjustment  to 
the carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets. 
 
Restoration obligations 
The  consolidated  entity  estimates  the  future  removal  costs  of 
production  facilities  and  wells  at  the  time  of  installation  of  the 
assets.  In  most  instances,  removal  of  assets  occurs  many  years 
into  the  future.  This  requires  judgemental  assumptions  regarding 
removal  date,  future  environmental  legislation,  the  extent  of 
reclamation  activities  required,  the  engineering  methodology  for 
estimating  cost,  future  removal  technologies  in  determining  the 
removal  cost,  and  asset  specific  discount  rates  to  determine  the 
present  value  of  these  cash  flows.  The  consolidated  entity’s 
accounting policy for restoration obligations is set out at Note 1(q).

flows. 
It  also  requires 
interpretation  of  geological  and  geophysical  models  in  order  to 
make  an  assessment  of  the  size,  shape,  depth  and  quality  of 
reservoirs  and 
their  anticipated  recoveries.  The  economic, 
geological  and  technical  factors  used  to  estimate  reserves  may 
change from period to period. Changes in reported reserves can 
impact asset carrying values, the provision for restoration and the 
recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets,  due  to  changes  in  expected 
future  cash  flows.  Reserves  are  integral  to  the  calculation  of 
depreciation and amortisation charged to the income statement. 
 
Oil and gas price forecast  
Future oil and gas price forecasts are a combination of contracted 
gas prices, forward market prices at 30 June 2016 and longer term 
observable price forecasts.   
 
Impairment of oil and gas assets 
The consolidated entity assesses whether oil and gas assets are 
impaired  when  preparing 
financial 
statements.  Estimates  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  oil  and  gas 
assets are made based on the present value of future cash flows.   
 
Income taxes 
The consolidated entity is subject to income taxes in Australia and 
jurisdictions  where 
  Significant 
judgement  is  required  in  determining  the  worldwide  provision  for 
income  taxes.    There  are  certain  transactions  and  calculations 
undertaken  during  the  ordinary  course  of  business  for  which  the 
ultimate  tax  determination  is  uncertain.    The  consolidated  entity 
estimates its tax liabilities based on the application of the relevant 
tax law.  Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different 
from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in 
the period in which such determination is made.   
 
Share-based payment transactions 
The  consolidated  entity  measures  the  cost  of  equity-settled 
transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the 
equity investments at the date on which they are granted.

Controlled entities
(b)  Basis of consolidation   
(i) 
Controlled entities are entities controlled by the Company. Control 
exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern  the  financial  and  operating  policies  of  an  entity  so  as  to 
obtain  benefits  from  its  activities.  In  assessing  control,  potential 
voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken 
into  account.  The  financial  statements  of  controlled  entities  are 
included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  from  the  date 
that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
 
(ii) 
The  Group  has  interests  in  joint  operations.    For  the  purpose  of 
this financial report the joint operations have been denominated as 
“Joint  Ventures”  in  accordance  with  Oil  and  Gas  companies 
market practice.  
 
Interests  in  unincorporated  joint  ventures  and  jointly  controlled 
assets  are  brought  to  account  by  recognising  in  the  financial 
statements the proportionate share of the assets they control, the 
liabilities and expenses they incur, and their share of the income 
that  they  earn  from  the  sale  of  goods  or  services  by  the  joint 
venture.

Foreign currency  
Foreign currency transactions
(iii) 
Intragroup  balances  and  any  unrealised  gains  and  losses  or 
income  and  expenses  arising  from  intragroup  transactions,  are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
 
(iv) 
The  consolidated  entity  treats  transactions  with  non-controlling 
interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with 
equity  owners  of  the  consolidated  entity.  A  change  in  ownership 
interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of 
the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative 
interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of 
the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration 
paid or received is recognised in a separate reserve within equity 
attributable to owners of AWE Limited. 
 
When the consolidated entity ceases to have control, joint control 
or  significant  influence,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is 
adjusted  to  fair  value  with  the  change  in  carrying  amount 
recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  The  fair  value  is  the  initial  carrying 
amount  for  the  purposes  of  subsequently  accounting  for  the 
retained  interest  as  an  associate,  jointly  controlled  entity  or 
financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in 
other  comprehensive 
that  entity  are 
accounted for as if the consolidated entity had directly disposed of 
the  related  assets  or  liabilities.  This  may  mean  that  amounts 
previously  recognised 
income  are 
reclassified to the income statement. 
 
If  the  ownership  interest  in  a  jointly-controlled  entity  or  an 
associate  is  reduced  but  joint  control  or  significant  influence  is 
retained,  only  a  proportionate  share  of  the  amounts  previously 
recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  reclassified  to  the 
income statement where appropriate. 
 
(c) 
(i) 
Transactions  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the  foreign 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  at  the  end  of  the 
reporting period are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling 
at  that  date.  Foreign  exchange  differences  arising  on  translation 
are  recognised  in  the  income  statement.  Non-monetary  assets 
and  liabilities  that  are  measured  in  terms  of  historical  cost  in  a 
foreign  currency  are  translated  using  the  exchange  rate  at  the 
date  of  the  transaction.  Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are 
translated  at  foreign  exchange  rates  ruling  at  the  dates  the  fair 
value was determined. 
 
(ii) 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill 
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
to  Australian  dollars  at  foreign  exchange  rates  at  the  end  of  the 
foreign 
reporting  period.  The 
operations  are 
rates 
approximating  the  foreign  exchange  rates  at  the  dates  of  the 
transactions.  Foreign 
on 
retranslation  are  recognised  directly  in  a  separate  component  of 
equity.  
 
(iii)  
the income statement 
The  consolidated  entity  presents  its  foreign  exchange  gains  and 
losses  within  net 
income 
statement.  
 
(d) 
The  carrying  amounts  of  the  Company’s  and  the  consolidated 
entity’s  assets,  other  than  inventories  (refer  note  1(g))  and 
deferred tax assets (refer note 1(t)), are reviewed at the end of the 
reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  is  any  indication  of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated.  
 
An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  whenever  the  carrying  amount 
of  an  asset  or  its  cash-generating  unit  exceeds  its  recoverable 
amount.

Trade and other receivables
Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value 
less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using  a  post-tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. For an asset that does not generate independent cash 
inflows,  the  recoverable  amount  is  determined  for  the  cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
Reversals of impairment 
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. 
 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have  been  determined,  net  of  depreciation  or  amortisation,  if  no 
impairment loss had been recognised.   
 
(e)  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  comprise  cash  balances  and  call 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the consolidated entity’s cash management are 
included  as  a  component  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  for  the 
purpose of the statement of cash flows.  
 
(f) 
Trade  receivables  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and 
subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. Trade receivables 
are generally due for settlement between 14 and 30 days. 
 
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Debts  which  are  known  to  be  uncollectable  are  written  off  by 
reducing  the  carrying  amount  directly.  An  allowance  account 
(provision for impairment of trade receivables) is used when there 
is objective evidence that the consolidated entity will not be able to 
collect  all  amounts  due  according  to  the  original  terms  of  the 
receivables.  Significant 
the  debtor, 
probability  that  the  debtor  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  financial 
reorganisation,  and  default  or  delinquency  in  payments  are 
considered  indicators  that  the  trade  receivable  is  impaired.  The 
amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash 
flows  relating  to  short-term  receivables  are  not  discounted  if  the 
effect of discounting is immaterial. 
 
The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss 
within  other  expenses.  When  a  trade  receivable  for  which  an 
impairment 
becomes 
uncollectable  in  a  subsequent  period,  it  is  written  off  against  the 
allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against other expenses in profit or loss. 
 
(g) 
Oil  inventory  is  recorded  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable 
value.  Cost  is  determined  on  an  average  basis  and  includes 
production costs and amortisation of producing oil and gas assets. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course  of  business,  less  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.   
 
Other  inventories  are  recorded  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net 
realisable  value.  The  cost  of  inventories  is  based  on  the  first-in 
first-out  principle  and  includes  expenditure  incurred  in  acquiring 
the  inventories  and  bringing  them  to  their  existing  location  and 
condition. 
 
(h)  Derivative financial instruments 
Background 
During  the  year  the  Group  has  entered  into  forward  commodity 
hedge  transactions  related  to  highly  probable  forecast  sales 
transactions and have designated these derivatives as cash flow 
hedges.  The relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged  item  is  documented  at  the  inception  of  the  hedging 
transaction as well as the risk management objective and strategy
financial  difficulties  of

flow  hedges  have  been
for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The process includes 
linking  the  derivative  financial  instruments  designated  to  specific 
firm commitments or forecast transactions.  In addition the Group 
assesses hedge effectiveness at inception and at regular intervals 
to  ensure  that  the  derivatives  used  in  hedging  transactions  have 
been  and  will  continue  to  be  highly  effective  in  offsetting  cash 
flows of hedged items.    
 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently 
  On  subsequent 
revaluation,  the  derivatives  are  carried  as  assets  when  their  fair 
value is positive and liabilities when their fair value is negative.  
 
In respect of cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in 
the fair value of derivatives that have been designated and qualify 
as  cash 
in  Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the hedging reserve.  The gain or 
loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
profit and loss within other income or other expense.   
 
Amounts  accumulated  in  the  hedging  reserve  in  equity  are 
transferred  to  the  profit  and  loss  when  the  hedged  transaction 
affects profit and loss, such as when the forecast sale occurs. The 
gain  or  loss  related  to  the  effective  portion  is  recognised  within 
‘sales’.    The  gain  or  loss  related  to  the  ineffective  portion  is 
recognised  immediately  in  profit  and  loss  within  other  income  or 
other expense. 
 
Certain  derivative  instruments  which  do  not  qualify  for  hedge 
accounting are recognised immediately in profit and loss and are 
included in other income or other expense.  
 
If  the  hedging  instrument  is  terminated  or  is  sold,  or  if  its 
designation as a hedge is revoked or when the hedge no longer 
meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting,  any  cumulative  gain  or 
loss previously recognised in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss.  
 
Fair value measurement 
When  the  fair  values  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities 
recorded 
financial  position  cannot  be 
measured  based  on  quoted  prices  in  active  markets,  their  fair 
value 
including 
discounted  cash  flow  models.    The  inputs  to  these  models  are 
taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is 
not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair 
values.    Judgements  include  considerations  of  inputs  such  as 
liquidity  risk,  credit  risk  and  volatility.    Changes  in  assumptions 
relating  to  these  factors  could  affect  the  reported  fair  value  of 
financial instruments. 
 
(i) 
(i) 
The  consolidated  entity  classifies  its  financial  assets  in  the 
following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held-to-maturity  investments  and 
available-for-sale  financial  assets.  The  classification  depends  on  
the  purpose 
investments  were  acquired. 
Management  determines  the  classification  of  its  investments  at 
initial recognition and, in the case of assets classified as held-to-
maturity, re-evaluates this designation at the end of each reporting 
period. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
A financial asset is classified as fair value through profit or loss if it 
is  classified  as  held  for  trading  or  is  designated  as  such  upon 
initial recognition. A financial asset is classified in this category if 
acquired  principally  for  the  purpose  of  selling  in  the  short  term. 
Derivatives  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are 
designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this  category  are  classified  as 
current assets. 
 
Loans and receivables 
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with 
fixed  or  determinable  payments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an  active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for those with 
maturities  greater  than  12  months  which  are  classified  as  non-
current  assets.  Loans  and  receivables  are  included  in  trade  and 
other receivables in the statement of financial position.

Subsequent measurement
(ii) 
Loans  and  receivables  and  held-to-maturity  investments  are 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.  
 
Gains  or  losses  arising  from  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the 
“financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss”  category  are 
presented in profit or loss within other income or other expenses in 
the  period  in  which  they  arise.  Dividend  income  from  financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss  as  part  of  revenue  from  continuing  operations  when  the 
consolidated entity’s right to receive payments is established.  
 
Details on how the fair value of financial instruments is determined 
are disclosed in note 31. 
 
(iii) 
The  consolidated  entity  assesses  at  the  end  of  each  reporting 
period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is 
impaired.  In  the  case  of  equity  securities  classified  as  available-
for-sale,  a  significant  or  prolonged  decline  in  the  fair  value  of  a 
security  below  its  cost  is  considered  as  an  indicator  that  the 
securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-
for-sale  financial  assets,  the  cumulative  loss  -  measured  as  the 
difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, 
less  any  impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously 
recognised  in  the  income  statement  -  is  reclassified  from  equity 
and  recognised  in  the  income  statement  as  a  reclassification 
adjustment.  Impairment  losses  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  on 
equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not reversed 
through the income statement. 
 
If  there  is  evidence  of  impairment  for  any  of  the  consolidated 
entity’s  financial  assets  carried  at  amortised  cost,  the  loss  is 
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows,  excluding 
future  credit  losses  that  have  not  been  incurred.  The  cash  flows 
are  discounted  at  an  appropriate  rate.  The  loss  is  recognised  in 
the income statement. 
 
(j)
Discontinued operations and held for sale  
assets
The Company will classify a segment or operation as discontinued 
if  it  has  been  disposed  of  and  it  represents  a  major  line  of 
business or a geographical area or operations.   
 
The Company classifies non-current assets as held for sale if the 
carrying  amounts  will  be  recovered  principally  through  a  sale 
rather than through continuing use. Such assets are measured at 
the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.  
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met when 
the  sale  is  highly  probable  and  the  asset  or  disposal  group  is 
available for immediate sale and management must be sufficiently 
committed to the sale such that it will occur within 1 year.  
 
Refer to notes 11 and 12 for further details.  
 
(k)  Property, plant and equipment 
(i) 
The  cost  of  oil  and  gas  producing  assets  and  capitalised 
expenditure  on  oil  and  gas  assets  under  development  are 
accounted for separately and are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation  and  impairment  losses.  Costs  include  expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the 
item as well as past exploration and evaluation costs. In addition, 
costs include:
Oil and gas assets
(i) the initial estimate at the time of installation and during the 
period of use, when relevant, of the costs of dismantling and 
removing the items and restoring the site on which they are 
located, and  
(ii) changes in the measurement of existing liabilities recognised 
for these costs resulting from changes in the timing or outflow of 
resources required to settle the obligation or from changes in the 
discount rate.
Land and buildings
Exploration and evaluation
When an oil and gas asset commences production, costs carried 
forward will be amortised on a units of production basis over the 
life of the economically recoverable reserves. Changes in factors 
such as estimates of economically recoverable reserves that affect 
amortisation calculations do not give rise to prior financial period 
adjustments and are dealt with on a prospective basis. 
 
Expenditure  on  major  maintenance  refits  or  overhauls  comprises 
the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs 
and overhaul costs.  Where an asset or part of an asset that was 
separately depreciated and is now written off is replaced and it is 
probable  that  future  economic  benefits  associated  will  result,  the 
expenditure  is  capitalised.  Where  part  of  the  asset  was  not 
separately considered as a component, the replacement value is 
used to estimate the carrying amount of the replaced assets which 
is  immediately  written  off.  All  other  maintenance  costs  are 
expensed as incurred. 
 
(ii) 
Land  and  Buildings  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated 
depreciation on buildings and impairment losses recognised at the 
date of acquisition. 
 
(l) 
Exploration  and  evaluation  costs  are  accumulated  in  respect  of 
each  separate  area  of  interest  and  are  accounted  for  using  the 
successful  efforts  method  of  accounting.  An  area  of  interest  is 
usually represented by an individual oil or gas field.  
 
The cost of acquisition of joint venture interests, successful drilling 
costs  and  costs  incurred  in  relation  to  feasibility  studies  and  the 
technical evaluation of a potential development are carried forward 
where right to tenure of the area of interest is current and they are 
expected to be recouped through sale or successful development 
and exploitation of the area of interest, or where the assessment 
to  determine  the  existence  of  economically  recoverable  reserves 
for  a  potential  development  in  an  area  of  interest  is  not  yet 
complete.    Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  reviewed  for 
impairment  indicators  annually.    When  an  indicator  is  identified, 
assessment  is  performed  for  each  area  of  interest  to  which  the 
exploration and evaluation expenditure is attributed. To the extent 
that  capitalised expenditure  is  not  expected  to  be  recovered  it  is 
charged to the income statement. 
 
All  other  exploration  and  evaluation  costs,  including  pre-licence 
costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
(m)  Capitalised borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs relating to oil and gas assets under development 
up to the date of commencement of operations are capitalised as 
a cost of the development. Where funds are borrowed specifically 
for  qualifying  projects  the  actual  borrowing  costs  incurred  are 
capitalised.  Where  the  projects  are  funded  through  general 
borrowings  the  borrowing  costs  are  capitalised  based  on  the 
weighted  average  borrowing  rate.  Other  borrowing  costs  are 
expensed. 
 
(n) 
These  amounts  represent  liabilities  for  goods  and  services 
provided to the consolidated entity prior to the end of the financial 
year  which  are  unpaid.  The  amounts  are  unsecured  and  are 
usually paid within 14 days of recognition. 
 
(o) 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised at fair value.  
 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are treated as a 
prepayment  and  are  recognised  as  such  to  the  extent  that  it  is 
probable  that  the  facility  will  be  drawn  down.    These  fees  are 
recognised  as  transaction  costs  relating  to  the  loan  and  are 
amortised over the period of the facility. 
 
(p)  Employee benefits 
(i) 
The provisions for employee  entitlements to  wages, salaries and 
annual leave represents the amount which the consolidated entity 
has a present obligation to pay resulting from employees’ services 
provided up to the end of each reporting period.  The provisions

Share-based payment transactions
have  been  calculated  at  undiscounted  amounts  based  on  wage 
and  salary  rates  that  the  consolidated  entity  expects  to  pay  and 
include related on-costs. 
 
(ii) 
Long service leave represents the present value of the estimated 
future  cash  outflows  to  be  made  resulting  from  an  employee’s 
services  provided  to  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  The 
provision  is  calculated  using  estimated  future  increases  in  wage 
and  salary  rates 
including  related  on-costs  and  expected 
settlement  dates  based  on  turnover  history  and  is  discounted 
using  the  rates  attaching  to  national  government  securities  at 
balance  date  which  most  closely  match  the  terms  of  maturity  of 
the related liabilities. 
 
(iii) 
Share-based  compensation  benefits  are  provided  to  employees 
via  the  long-term  Employee  Share  Rights  Plan.  Information 
relating to these schemes is set out in the remuneration report as 
well note 21 of this report. 
 
The fair value of the rights granted is measured using the Black-
Scholes  Option  Pricing  model.  In  valuing  the  equity  settled 
transactions  no  account  is  taken  of  any  performance  conditions 
other than conditions linked to market performance.  The fair value 
of  rights  granted  is  recognised  as  an  employee  expense  with  a 
corresponding increase in equity or to the extent the share rights 
are expected to be cash settled, with a corresponding increase in 
liabilities.    The  Board  has  discretion  regarding  the  settlement  of 
share rights into either AWE shares or cash.  
 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is 
the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to 
be  satisfied.  At  the  end  of  each  period,  the  entity  revises  its 
estimates of the number of rights and options that are expected to 
vest  based  on  the  non-market  and  service  related  vesting 
conditions.  It  recognises  the  impact  of  the  revision  to  original 
estimates,  if  any,  in  the  income  statement,  with  a  corresponding 
adjustment to equity. 
 
(iv) 
Obligations for contributions to accumulation type superannuation 
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred.  
 
(q)  Provisions   
A  provision  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  financial  position 
when  the  consolidated  entity  has  a  present  legal  or  constructive 
obligation  as  a  result  of  a  past  event,  and  it  is  probable  that  an 
outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the 
obligation.  If  the  effect  is  material,  provisions  are  determined  by 
discounting  the  expected  future  cash  flows  at  a  pre-tax  rate  that 
reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money 
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
 
Site restoration 
Provisions  made 
restoration  and 
environmental  rehabilitation  are  recognised  where  there  is  a 
present  obligation  as  a  result  of  exploration,  development  or 
production  activities  having  been  undertaken,  and  it  is  probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation.  The  estimated  future  obligations  include  the  costs  of 
removing  facilities,  abandoning  wells  and  restoring  the  affected 
areas.  The  provision  for  future  restoration  costs  is  the  best 
estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle 
the  obligation  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  based  on 
current legal requirements and technology. The ultimate costs are 
uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors 
including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence 
of new techniques or experience at other production sites. Future 
restoration  costs  are  reviewed  annually  and  any  changes  are 
reflected  in  the  present  value  of  the  restoration  provision  at  the 
end of the reporting period. The amount of the provision for future 
restoration costs relating to exploration and development activities 
is capitalised as a cost of those activities. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash 
flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money, and where appropriate the risks specific
Superannuation plans

Other revenues

Sales revenue
to  the  liability.  The  unwinding  of  discounting  on  the  provision  is 
recognised as a finance cost. 
 
(r) 
(i) 
Revenue from the sale of oil and gas is recognised in the income 
statement  when  the  significant  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership 
have been transferred to the buyer.  Revenue received during the 
commissioning phase of oil and gas assets is recorded, together 
with  the  related  costs  of  production,  against  the  capitalised 
carrying value of the asset. 
Revenues received under take or pay sales contracts in respect of 
undelivered volumes are accounted for as deferred revenue. 
 
(ii) 
Other  revenues  are  recognised  on  an  accrual  basis  and  include 
royalty receipts and equipment rental income.  
 
(s) 
Leases of property,  plant and equipment  where the consolidated 
entity,  as  lessee,  has  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of 
ownership  are  classified  as  finance  leases.  Finance  leases  are 
capitalised at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased 
property  or,  if  lower,  the  present  value  of  the  minimum  lease 
payments.  The  corresponding  rental  obligations,  net  of  finance 
charges, are included in other short-term and long-term payables. 
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance 
cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease 
period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining  balance  of  the  liability  for  each  period.  The  property, 
plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated 
over the asset's useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful 
life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the 
consolidated  entity  will  obtain  ownership  at  the  end  of  the  lease 
term 
 
Leases  in  which  a  significant  portion  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of 
ownership are not transferred to the consolidated entity as lessee 
are classified as operating leases and are not recognised on the 
consolidated  entity’s  statement  of  financial  position.  Payments 
made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from 
the  lessor)  are  charged  to  profit  or  loss  on  a  straight-line  basis 
over the period of the lease. 
 
(t) 
(i) 
Income  tax  on  the  income  statement  comprises  current  and 
deferred  tax.  Income  tax  is  recognised  in  the  income  statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.   
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for 
the  year,  using  tax  rates  enacted  or  substantially  enacted  at  the 
end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in 
respect of previous years. 
 
Deferred  tax  is  provided  using  the  balance  sheet  method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the 
amounts  used  for  taxation  purposes.  The  following  temporary 
differences  are  not  provided  for  goodwill  not  deductible  for  tax 
purposes,  the  initial  recognition  of  assets  or  liabilities  that  affect 
neither  accounting  nor  taxable  profit,  and  differences  relating  to 
investments  in  controlled  entities  to  the  extent  that  they  will 
probably  not  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future.  The  amount  of 
deferred  tax  provided  is  based  on  the  expected  manner  of 
realisation  or  settlement  of  the  carrying  amount  of  assets  and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
end of the reporting period. 
 
A  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognised  only  to  the  extent  that  it  is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will 
be realised.

Additional  income  taxes  that  arise  from  the  distribution  of 
dividends are recognised at the  same time as the liability to pay 
the related dividend. 
 
(ii)
Petroleum  Resource  Rent  Tax  (“PRRT”)  and  other 
government royalties
Tax consolidation
tax-consolidated  group  are  recognised
In  addition  to  corporate  income  taxes,  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  also  include  and  disclose  certain  taxes  determined 
from oil and gas production and levied on net income.  
 
Resource  rent  taxes  and  government  royalties  are  treated  as 
taxation arrangements when they are imposed under Government 
authority  and  when  the  calculation  of  the  amount  payable  falls 
within  the  definition  of  “taxable  profit”  for  the  purposes  of  AASB 
112. Current and deferred tax is then provided on the same basis 
as described in (i) above.  
 
Royalty  arrangements  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  treatment 
as a tax are recognised on an accruals basis. 
 
The  Australian  Government  enacted  legislation  to  extend  the 
PRRT regime to all onshore oil and gas projects, from 1 July 2012.  
PRRT is applied to onshore and offshore oil and gas projects at a 
rate  of  40%.    State  petroleum  royalties  will  continue  to  apply  to 
projects within state jurisdictions; however these royalties are fully 
creditable against PRRT liabilities.  The extended PRRT applies to 
AWE’s onshore Perth basin operations. 
 
Disclosures in relation to PRRT for the year ended 30 June 2016 
in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  in  relation  to  both 
onshore and offshore oil and gas projects. 
 
(iii) 
The  Company  and  its  wholly-owned  Australian  resident  entities 
have formed a tax consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2003 
and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. The head 
entity within the tax-consolidated group is AWE Limited. 
 
Current  tax  expense/income,  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  deferred 
tax  assets  arising  from  temporary  differences  of  the  members  of 
the 
the  separate 
financial statements of the members of the tax-consolidated group 
using a modified stand-alone tax allocation methodology. 
 
Any  current  tax  liabilities  (or  assets)  and  deferred  tax  assets 
arising  from  unused  tax  losses  of  the  controlled  entities  are 
assumed by the head entity in the tax-consolidated group and are 
recognised  as  amounts  payable  (receivable)  to  (from)  other 
entities  in  the  tax-consolidated  group  in  conjunction  with  any  tax 
funding arrangements. 
 
The Company recognises deferred tax assets arising from unused 
tax  losses  of  the  tax-consolidated  group  to  the  extent  that  it  is 
probable  that  future  taxable  profits  of  the  tax-consolidated  group 
will  be  available  against  which  the  asset  can  be  utilised.  Any 
subsequent period adjustments to deferred tax assets arising from 
unused  tax  losses  as  a  result  of  revised  assessments  of  the  
probability  of  recoverability  is  recognised  by  the  head  company 
only. 
 
(iv) 
The  head  entity,  in  conjunction  with  other  members  of  the  tax-
consolidated  group,  has  entered  into  a  tax  funding  arrangement 
which  sets  out  the  funding  obligations  of  members  of  the  tax-
consolidated  group  in  respect  of  tax  amounts.  The  tax  funding 
arrangements  require  payments  to/from  the  head  entity  equal  to 
the current tax liability (asset) assumed by the head entity and any 
tax-loss deferred tax asset assumed by the head entity, resulting 
in the head entity recognising an inter-entity receivable (payable) 
equal  in  amount  to  the  tax  liability  (asset)  assumed.  The  inter-
entity receivable (payable) is at call. 
 
(u)  Goods and services tax 
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount 
of  goods  and  services  tax  (“GST”),  except  where  the  amount  of
Nature of tax funding and tax sharing arrangements
for  which  discrete
its  performance,  and
GST  incurred  is  not  recoverable  from  the  taxation  authority.  In 
these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. 
 
Receivables  and  payables  are  stated  with  the  amount  of  GST 
included.  The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, 
the  Australian  Taxation  Office  (“ATO”)  is  included  as  a  current 
asset or liability in the statement of financial position. 
 
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross 
basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing 
and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, 
the ATO are classified as operating cash flows. 
 
(v)  Segment reporting 
An  operating  segment  is  a  component  of  the  consolidated  entity 
that  engages  in  business  activities  from  which  it  may  earn 
revenues  and  incur  expenses,  including  revenues  and  expenses 
that  relate  to  transactions  with  any  of  the  consolidated  entity’s 
other  components.  An  operating  segment’s  operating  results  are 
reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to make 
decisions  about  resources  to  be  allocated  to  the  segment  and 
assess 
financial 
information is available.  
 
Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision 
maker include items directly attributable to a segment as well as 
those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.  
 
Segment  assets  include  both  oil  and  gas  assets,  exploration 
assets and other assets, such as cash, receivables and inventory, 
which are directly attributable to the segment.  
 
Unallocated  items  comprise  mainly  head  office  income  and 
expenses,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  and  corporate 
assets.  
 
(w)  Contributed equity 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares, share rights or options are 
shown  in  equity  as  a  deduction,  net  of  tax,  from  the  proceeds. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, 
share  rights  or  options  for  the  acquisition  of  a  business  are  not 
included  in  the  cost  of  the  acquisition  as  part  of  the  purchase 
consideration. 
 
If the entity reacquires its own equity instruments, for example, as 
the  result  of  a  share  buy-back,  those  instruments  are  deducted 
from equity and the associated shares are cancelled. No gain or 
loss  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  and  the  consideration  paid 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income 
taxes) is recognised directly in equity. 
 
(x)  Dividends  
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being 
appropriately  authorised  and  no  longer  at  the  discretion  of  the 
entity,  on  or  before  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  but  not 
distributed at the end of the reporting period. 
 
(y)  Earnings per share 
 
(i) Basic earnings per share 
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  profit 
attributable  to  owners  of  the  Company  by  the  weighted  average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year. 
 
(ii) Diluted earnings per share 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the 
determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the 
weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would 
have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.

On 30 June 2016, AWE completed the sale of its 57.5% interest in the Cliff Head oil project for consideration of $3.2 million.  Following the 
write back of net liabilities ($15.6 million), and close out of cash flow hedges (loss $1.5 million) this resulted in a net gain before tax of 
$16.4 million (post tax $6.7 million). An additional royalty will be receivable by AWE for oil sales in excess of US$70/bbls.  The benefit of 
this receivable has not been recognised due to uncertainty with respect to its recoverability. 
 
During the year ended 30 June 2015 AWE completed the sale of an 11.25 % interest in the BassGas project including a 9.75% interest in 
the exploration permit T/18P.  At 30 June 2014 the assets were treated as held for sale because the negotiated sale terms were subject to 
a number of conditions precedent.  The completion of the sale generated a gain on completion of $0.6 million (pre-tax gain $2 million, 
taxation expense $1.4 million) for the 2015 financial year.

(1)  As a producer of oil and gas in Australia and New Zealand, the consolidated entity is subject to, government taxes in the form of PRRT in Australia and APR in New 
Zealand. PRRT is levied on Australian oil and gas production operations at a rate of 40% of project profits after allowing for the recoupment of past deductible 
project  costs  and  after  appropriate  compounding  of  these  past  costs.    Further,  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  certain  tests,  exploration  costs  incurred  by  the 
consolidated entity in Australia can be transferred to PRRT payable projects thereby reducing the liability to PRRT.  Similarly, APR is levied on the Tui production 
operation in New Zealand at a rate of 20% of project profits after allowing for the recoupment of past deductible project costs. These past project costs are not 
compounded  and  exploration  costs  incurred  outside  of  the  Tui  project  cannot  be  transferred  to  the  Tui  project.  PRRT  and  APR  are  deductible  for  income  tax 
purposes in Australia and New Zealand respectively.

10.  Segment reporting 
Description of segments
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the chief operating decision maker that are used 
to make strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker considers the business from both a product and a geographic perspective 
and on this basis has identified six reportable segments. For each reportable segment, the chief operating decision maker reviews internal 
management reports on at least a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the consolidated entity’s 
reportable segments:

11.  Discontinued operation 
 
During March 2016, AWE sold its entire 10% interest in the Sugarloaf Area of Mutual Interest to Carrier Energy Partners II, LLC.  The 
Sugarloaf Area of Mutual Interest previously represented the entire USA segment (refer note 10). 
 
The sale was completed for consideration of US$207.5 million (A$284.7 million) and generated a pre-tax gain of $18.8 million (post-tax 
$25.2 million).  This gain is inclusive of foreign currency gains of $21.5 million previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
which have been recycled through current year profit and loss and a gain of $2.2 million in respect of the close out of cash flow hedges. 
The post-tax gain is disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a discontinued operation. 
 
The Sugarloaf Area of Mutual Interest was not previously classified as held for sale or as a discontinued operation.  The comparative 
consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of other comprehensive income have been restated to show the 
discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.

The  recoverability  of  the  carrying  amounts  of  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  is  dependent  on  the  successful  development  and 
commercial exploitation or sale of the respective area of interest. 
 
During the year ended 30 June 2016 impairment expense was recognised in respect of exploration assets in the Perth Basin, further 
details of total impairment expense are provided in note 17, Oil and gas assets.  
 
During the year ended 30 June 2015, the Government of Indonesia approved the Plan of Development (POD) in connection with the 
Lengo gas project, and as a consequence $22 million of previously capitalised exploration costs was transferred to oil and gas assets.  
In addition, following the successful appraisal of the Waitsia gas field and subsequent recognition of 2P Reserves of 16 mmboe, $49 
million of previously capitalised exploration costs was transferred to oil and gas assets (refer note 17).

Impairment 
Individual oil and gas producing assets are considered as separate cash-generating units. Recoverable amounts are determined based 
on the higher of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. 
 
Impairment testing in connection with oil and gas assets is performed to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. Each 
year  the  consolidated  entity  performs  an  internal  review  of  asset  values  using  cash  flow  projections.  Where  there  are  indicators  of 
impairment these asset values are then tested for impairment. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the 
asset.  
 
The asset valuations are based on a proved and probable (2P) reserve production profile against various estimates and assumptions. 
The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections as at 30 June 2016 include the following:
(a)  Oil prices – forecast prices comprise the Brent 3 year forward curve (to end 30 June 2019) and subsequently, an independent
long term observable price forecast;
(b)  Gas prices – contracted gas prices and observable long term price forecasts for uncontracted gas; 
(c)  Exchange rates – a combination of current spot AUD/USD exchange rate prevailing at 30 June 2016 and long term observable
forecasts, including analysis of broker estimates.  The future AUD / USD rate ranges from 0.74 to 0.71;
(d)  Discount rates – the post-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10%.
For the year ended 30 June 2016 the following oil and gas projects have been impaired to their estimated recoverable amount, based 
on value in use.  For the Tui and Cliff Head oil projects, the recoverable amount is reduced due to a decline in observable oil prices and 
changes in exchange rate forecasts impacting cash flow projections over the life of the assets.  For BassGas, the recoverable amount is 
reduced due to a reassessment of the remaining 2P Reserves impacting cash flow projections over the life of the asset. The impairment 
charged to the income statement is set out in the following table.

(i)    The divestment of Cliff Head completed on 30 June 2016 (refer note 4).  The impairment in respect of this asset was recognised in the half year
period ended 31 December 2015.
(ii)  The Bulu PSC is subject to the completion of a sale and purchase agreement and has been reclassified as a current asset held for sale (refer
note 12.)  The impairment in respect of this asset was recognised in the half year period ended 31 December 2015.
Sensitivity analysis 
Asset valuations, based on cash flow projections rely on a range of assumptions that are subject to change.  Accordingly, asset values 
are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.  The impairment that would arise from a possible change in key assumptions (all other 
assumptions remaining the same) is shown below: 
 
 
 
 

A 10% decrease in oil prices would result in additional impairment of $11.7 million;  
A 10% decrease in the gas price would result in additional impairment of $6.6 million; 
A 10% increase in exchange rate would result in additional impairment of $9.0 million; and  
A 1% increase in the post-tax discount rate would result in additional impairment of $1.2 million.

d.  Share-based payments – Share Rights Plan 
 
The  employee  Share  Rights  Plan  is  designed  to  generate  performance-based  cash  awards  that  may  be  converted,  at  the  Board’s 
discretion, into AWE shares or cash.  The key elements of the plan include:
  Rights are granted each year and the number of rights granted will be determined by the employee’s level in the Company, fixed
remuneration at the time of grant and both the Company and employee’s performance in the previous financial year;
  There are three tranches of rights with separate vesting criteria:
Retention(1); 
Absolute TSR(2); and 
Relative TSR.
 
 

(1) 
(2)
  The vesting period is for three years, the rights will lapse after three years and there will be no retesting. 
  Rights granted in any particular financial year are tested for vesting over the three year period commencing 1 July of grant year.
Retention rights are not granted to the Managing Director and with effect from 1 July 2016, Retention rights are no longer granted to any employee. 
TSR refers to ‘Total Shareholder Return’ and is defined as the percentage change over a period in shareholder value due to share price movement and dividends 
paid assuming dividends are reinvested into AWE shares.
The conditions for the award of rights and the criteria for vesting are: 
 
Retention Grants
  Number of rights calculated using the 30-day VWAP of the AWE share price in June of grant year. 
  Vest after three years if the employee remains employed by AWE.
Absolute TSR Grants
  Number of rights calculated using the 30-day VWAP of the AWE share price in June of grant year. 
  Vest after three years according to the Company’s Absolute TSR for that three year period. 
  The vesting scales to apply for Absolute TSR grants are as follows:

For grants of rights, the fair value has been calculated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes Pricing Model and assuming a vesting 
probability of 43.5% for performance related awards and a 10% staff turnover rate for retention awards. 
 
The fair value of rights has been calculated at the grant date and allocated to each reporting period evenly over the period from grant 
date  to  vesting  date.  The  value  disclosed  is  the  portion  of  the  fair  value  of  the  rights  allocated  to  this  reporting  period.  The  value 
disclosed does not therefore represent cash received.  
 
The  share  rights  outstanding  at  30  June  2016  have  fair  value  in  the  range  of  $0.36  to  $1.86,  and  a  weighted  average  remaining 
contractual life of 1.1 years (2015: 1.3 years).  
 
The fair value of services rendered in return for share rights granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share rights granted. 
The inputs into the model are shown in the following table:

Provisions made for environmental rehabilitation are recognised where there is a present obligation as a result of exploration, 
development or production activities having been undertaken and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation. The estimated future obligations include the costs of removing facilities, abandoning wells and restoring the 
affected areas.  Due to the long-term nature of the liability, there is some uncertainty in estimating the provision of the costs that will be 
incurred. In particular, the consolidated entity has assumed that restoration will use technology and materials that are available 
currently. The basis for accounting is set out in note 1(q).

Total deferred tax asset / (liability) 
 
 
Australian Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) and New Zealand Accounting Profits Royalty (APR) 
The consolidated entity applies tax effect accounting to both PRRT and APR for all of the consolidated entity’s onshore and offshore 
Australian and offshore New Zealand producing operations. Applying tax effect accounting principles to both PRRT and APR causes the 
tax effect of the difference between the PRRT/APR tax base and the accounting base of these assets to be recognised as a deferred 
tax asset or deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. The PRRT/APR tax base represents the remaining deductible project costs of the 
relevant projects. The accounting base represents the written down net balance sheet value of the project which is amortised over the 
life  of  reserves.  Where  the  remaining  deductible  project  costs  for  a  project  exceed  the  accounting  base  and  the  excess  cannot  be 
transferred to a PRRT payable project then no deferred tax asset is recorded. The application of tax effect accounting to both PRRT and 
APR may impact the reported income tax expense whether or not a current tax liability to pay PRRT or APR arises. 
 
 
Deferred tax assets in relation to carried forward losses 
Total Australian income tax losses incurred prior to forming a tax consolidated group amount to $29.4 million calculated at 30% are not 
recognised as a deferred tax asset.  Australian income tax losses incurred after 30 June 2008 which have been recognised as a DTA 
total $29.6 million.  Tax losses of approximately $76.4 million at 30% are unrecognised due to the uncertainty of utilisation.  For tax 
purposes all tax losses remain available for use. 
 
All US income tax losses as at 30 June 2016 have been utilised including tax losses totalling A$1.5 million that were not recognised as a 
DTA, offsetting the gain realised on the disposal of Sugarloaf assets.  
 
Tax  losses  on  Production  Sharing  Contract’s  (PSC’s)  unrecovered  costs  incurred  in  other  jurisdictions  have  been  treated  as 
permanently not deductible due to uncertainty of future usage.

28.  Contingencies 
 
In accordance with normal industry practice, the consolidated entity has entered into joint venture operations with other parties for the 
purpose of exploring and developing its permit interests. If a party to a joint venture operation defaults and does not contribute its share 
of joint venture operation obligations, then the other joint venturers are liable to meet those obligations. In this event, the permit interest 
held by the defaulting party may be redistributed to the remaining joint venturers.  
 
In accordance with normal industry practice and under the terms of various joint venture operating and product sales agreements, the 
consolidated entity may have provided performance guarantees to third parties on behalf of wholly-owned controlled entities to fulfil its 
permit obligations in various jurisdictions where it conducts its operations. 
 
As described in note 27(c) the Company as operator of the Tui Area oil project (PMP 38158, offshore Taranaki Basin, New Zealand) 
has  entered  into  a  charter  contract  for  the  provision  of  an  FPSO  for  the  Tui  Field  development.  The  Charter  Contractor  own  and 
operates the FPSO as part of the charter arrangement. In prior years the Group had provided a letter of credit in favour of the Charter 
Contractor (2015: US$3.2 million); this has now been released.  
 
The Company is responsible for taxes payable in respect of earlier years by entities acquired from Genting (Oil and Gas) in connection 
with the acquisition of a participating interest in the Northwest Natuna and Anambas PSC’s.  The entities are subject to claims by the 
Indonesian  Tax  Office  in  respect  of  VAT  and  withholding  taxes  in  respect  of  the  2005  to  2011  years  totalling  US$1.4  million.    The 
potential liability to earlier years’ taxes is also the subject of arbitration proceedings against Genting that are in progress at the report 
date.  
 
The consolidated entity has made an accounting provision for all known environmental liabilities. There can be no assurance that as a 
result of new information or regulatory requirements with respect to the consolidated entity’s assets that provisions will not be increased 
at a future date. 
 
The  Native  Title  Act  (“NTA”)  may  impact  on  the  consolidated  entity's  ability  to  gain  access  to  new  prospective  exploration  areas  or 
obtain  production  titles.    Some  of  the  consolidated  entity's  onshore  petroleum  tenements  now  include  land  which  may  become  the 
subject of a Native Title claim under the NTA.

31.  Financial risk management 
 
The Group is involved in activities that expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, fair value risk, interest rate risk and 
commodity  pricing  risk.    In  accordance  with  Board  approved  policies  financial  instruments  may  be  used  to  hedge  the  exposure  to 
fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.   
 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the financial risk management framework of the 
consolidated entity. The Board has delegated to the Audit and Governance Committee the responsibility for developing and monitoring 
financial risk management policies across the Company.  The Audit and Governance Committee’s primary role is to advise and assist 
the Board of Directors in assessing the management of key financial risks of the Company.  The financial risk management policies and 
systems  are  reviewed  annually  by  the  Audit  and  Governance  Committee  to  reflect  changes  in  market  conditions  and  the  entity’s 
business activities.  
 
Management  of  financial  risks  is  carried  out  by  a  centralised  treasury  function  which  operates  under  Board  approved  policies.    The 
Board approved Treasury and Risk Management Guidelines provide clear guidelines to management in respect of the management of 
financial risks of the Company and are designed to ensure that it adequately reflects the strategic risk management objectives of the 
Board.    
 
The objective of AWE’s financial risk management strategy is to minimise the impact of volatility in financial markets on the financial 
performance, cash flows and shareholder returns of AWE.  This includes the need to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to fund 
its strategic business plans. Identification and analysis of relevant financial risks and its impact on the achievement of the Company’s 
objectives forms the basis for determining how such risks should be managed.  The forecast financial position of the consolidated entity 
is regularly monitored and financial instruments may be used within approved guidelines to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest 
rates, exchange rates and commodity prices.
(a) 
 
(i)
Market risk
Commodity price risk 
The consolidated entity is exposed to commodity price risk through its revenue from the sale of hydrocarbons – gas, crude oil, 
condensate and LPG. Australian gas sales are not subject to commodity price risk as the product is sold in Australian Dollars 
under  long-term  contracts  with  CPI  escalators  in  place.  However,  crude  oil,  condensate  and  LPG  are  priced  against  world 
benchmark commodity prices and the consolidated entity is therefore subject to commodity price risk for these products. 
 
Subject to approval of the Board, the consolidated entity may enter into certain derivative instruments to manage its commodity 
price risk. As at the end of the financial year, the consolidated entity has derivative financial instruments in place (commodity 
forward contracts) which have been valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.  Further details are set 
out in Note 31 (d), Fair values of financial instruments.
Interest rate risk 
As at 30 June 2016 the Company had available a secured multi-currency syndicated bank loan facility of A$400 million; this was 
reduced to A$300 million during July 2016.  The facility utilised at 30 June 2016 was $14.8 million (2014: $169.8 million) (refer 
note 20). When drawn, the Australian Dollar portion of the facility bears interest at the bank bill swap rate plus a margin, the 
United States Dollar portion of the facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin and the New Zealand portion of the facility 
bears interest at BKBM plus a margin.  Borrowings under the facility are at floating rates and  when the facility is drawn the 
consolidated entity would be subject to interest rate risk from movements in the Australian dollar bank bill swap rate, United 
States dollar LIBOR and New Zealand BKBM. Similarly, the consolidated entity is subject to interest rate risk from movements 
in the Australian, United States and New Zealand cash deposits. 
 
In accordance with Board approved policies, the consolidated entity may enter into certain derivative instruments to manage its 
interest rate risk.  As at the end of the financial year, the consolidated entity has no interest rate hedging or derivatives in place.
Foreign exchange risk 
The  consolidated  entity  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various  currency 
exposures,  primarily  with  respect  to  United  States  and  New  Zealand  dollars.    The  consolidated  entity  is  subject  to  foreign 
exchange  risk  through  the  sale  of  products  denominated  is  US  dollars,  borrowings  denominated  in  US  and  NZ  dollars  and 
foreign currency capital and operating expenditure. 
 
The Company manages its foreign exchange exposures on a net basis and may use forward foreign exchange contracts or 
cross  currency  swaps  to  manage  its  exposures.    As  at  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  the  consolidated  entity  has  no  foreign 
exchange hedging or derivatives in place.

31.   Financial risk management (continued) 
 
(b)  Credit risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk of sustaining a financial loss as a result of the default by a counterparty to make full and timely payments on 
transactions which have been executed, after allowing for set-offs which are legally enforceable.  The credit risk on financial assets of 
the consolidated entity which have been recognised on the statement of financial position is the carrying amount, net of any provision 
for doubtful debts. 
 
Credit risk arises from investments in cash and cash equivalents with bank, derivative financial instruments and credit exposure to 
customers and/or suppliers.  Credit risk also arises from bank facilities which offer committed lines of credit, overdraft facilities, 
transaction banking services and financial guarantees, which may not be honoured when relied upon. The Board approved Treasury 
Risk Management Guidelines outline how credit risk exposure will be managed by Treasury.  
 
Receivables and cash and cash equivalents represent the Company’s and the consolidated entity’s maximum exposure to credit risk:

The consolidated entity does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit exposure. With the exception of the capital 
expenditure carry of A$100.8 million due from Santos in connection with the sale of a 50% interest in the Northwest Natuna PSC 
there is no concentration of credit risk to a single party.
The ageing of trade receivables at the end of each reporting period was as follows:   
   Less than 1 month 
   1 month to 3 months 
   Greater than 3 months
6,359 
- 
-

43,576 
- 
- 
43,576
There are no trade receivables past due or impaired at the end of the reporting period (2015: Nil).
Liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will not have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  
 
The Board approved Treasury Risk Management Guidelines provide an appropriate framework for the management of the consolidated 
entity’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.  
 
The consolidated entity manages liquidity risk by continually monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities. Short and long-term cash flow projections are prepared periodically and submitted to the Board at each 
board meeting of the Company.  In addition the corporate debt facility is required to be refinanced well in advance of its maturity date.

31.   Financial risk management (continued) 
 
(d)  Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
Fair value measurement 
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities of the Group approximate their fair value.  
 
The Group measures and recognises in the statement of financial position on a recurring basis certain assets and liabilities at fair value 
in accordance with AASB 13 Fair value measurement.  The fair value must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for 
disclosure purposes in accordance with the following hierarchy: 
 
Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or
indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3:  Inputs for the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
 
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at 30 June 2016.
Valuation techniques used to derive fair values 
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments (commodity forward contracts) with various financial institutions with 
investment grade credit ratings.  Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.  The most frequently 
applied valuation techniques include present value calculations.  The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of 
counterparties and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.  All derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby 
mitigating both the counterparty and the groups non-performance risk.   
 
As at 30 June 2016, the fair value of derivative assets positions is net of a credit value adjustment attributable to derivative counterparty 
default risk.  The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives 
designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.  
 
(e)  Capital management
The consolidated entity maintains an ongoing review of its capital management strategy to ensure it maintains an appropriate capital 
structure.  
 
The overriding objective of the Company’s capital management strategy is to increase shareholder returns whilst maintaining the 
flexibility to pursue the strategic initiatives of the Company within a prudent capital structure. 
 
The ability of the Company to pay future dividends or conduct any form of capital return to shareholders is regularly reviewed by the 
Board.  This is considered against the Company’s future funding requirements and ability to access capital and where there is surplus 
capital available for distribution. The Board will endeavour to optimise the return to AWE shareholders via capital management 
initiatives where it can do so.

Independent auditor's report to the members of AWE Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of AWE Limited, which comprises the consolidated 
statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the 
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from 
time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a 
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of 
the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 1, 
the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial 
Statements, that the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity's internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a 
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
