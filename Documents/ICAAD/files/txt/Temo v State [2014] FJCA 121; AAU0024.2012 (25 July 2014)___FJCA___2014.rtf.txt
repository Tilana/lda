RULING

[1]     
The appellant was charged with two counts of rape in the High Court at Suva. He was refused bail pending trial by the High Court. He appealed against the refusal of bail to this Court. 

[2]     
While this appeal was pending, the appellant was tried and acquitted of the charges. The question of bail in these circumstances is now academic. The appeal cannot possibly succeed and is frivolous.

[3]     
The appeal is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act.
