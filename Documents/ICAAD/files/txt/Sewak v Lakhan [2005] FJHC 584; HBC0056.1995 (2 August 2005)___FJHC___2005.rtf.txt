ORAL JUDGMENT OF FINNIGAN J

This was a hearing to assess quantum of damages for the 1st Defendant on his counter-claim, judgment in liability having been entered previously by default. There was no appearance for the Plaintiff or for 2nd and 3rd Defendant. The 4th Defendant was struck out of the action on 7 April 2005.

After hearing the evidence of the 1st Defendant I have found all the allegations of fact in his statement of defence and counter-claim which are relevant to his claim for damages and injunction have been made out. Despite the lapse in time since commencement of the counter-claim for injunction I am satisfied that the need for it has continued until the present day. Previously there were physical incursions by the Plaintiff which seem to have ceased after his conviction and imprisonment for assault. Incursions by animals grazing on the Defendants land still occur from time to time. 

The Defendant seeks damages of $3,000.00 based on his crop losses, and that claim is made out. I give judgment for the Defendant on the counter-claim in the sum of $3,000.00 as general damages. Interest is allowed on that sum at 6% per annum simple from the date of the counter claim 6 April 1995 until the date of judgment 02 August 2005. I grant an injunction in the terms of the counter claim.

I summarily assess costs for the Defendant $1,500.00.
