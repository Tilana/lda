<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context and definition of human rights education 
</b></p>
<p>1. The international community has increasingly expressed consensus on the 
fundamental contribution of human rights education to the realization of human rights. 
Human rights education aims at developing an understanding of our common responsibility 
to make human rights a reality in every community and in society at large. In this sense, it 
contributes to the long-term prevention of human rights abuses and violent conflicts, the 
promotion of equality and sustainable development and the enhancement of participation in 
decision-making processes within a democratic system.1
</p>
<p>2. Provisions on human rights education have been incorporated into many 
international instruments and documents including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, 1948 (art. 26); the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, 1965 (art. 7); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, 1966 (art. 13); the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1984 (art. 10); the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 1979 (art. 10); the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, 1989 (art. 29); the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 1990 (art. 33); the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2006 (art. 4 and 8); the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action (Part I, paras. 33-34 and Part II, paras. 78-82); the 
Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 2001 (Declaration, paras. 95-97 and 
Programme of Action, paras. 129-139); the Outcome Document of the Durban Review 
Conference, 2009 (paras. 22 and 107); and the 2005 World Summit Outcome (para. 131). 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with these instruments, which provide elements of a definition of 
human rights education as agreed upon by the international community, human rights 
education can be defined as any learning, education, training and information efforts aimed 
at building a universal culture of human rights, including:  
</p>
<p> (a) The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (b) The full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity; 
</p>
<p> (c) The promotion of understanding, tolerance, gender equality and friendship among all 
nations, indigenous peoples and minorities; 
</p>
<p> (d) The enabling of all persons to participate effectively in a free and democratic society 
governed by the rule of law; 
</p>
<p> (e) The building and maintenance of peace; 
</p>
<p> (f) The promotion of people-centred sustainable development and social justice. 
</p>
<p>4. Human rights education encompasses: 
</p>
<p> (a) Knowledge and skills &#8212; learning about human rights and mechanisms, as 
well as acquiring skills to apply them in a practical way in daily life; 
</p>
<p> (b) Values, attitudes and behaviour &#8212; developing values and reinforcing 
attitudes and behaviour which uphold human rights; 
</p>
<p>  
  1  Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/71 (21 April 2004), preambular paragraph 4. 
</p>
<p><b>4</b>  </p>


<p> (c) Action &#8212; taking action to defend and promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>5. With a view to encouraging human rights education initiatives, Member States have 
adopted various specific international frameworks for action, such as the World Public 
Information Campaign on Human Rights (1988-ongoing), focusing on the development and 
dissemination of human rights information materials, the United Nations Decade for 
Human Rights Education (1995-2004) and its plan of action, encouraging the elaboration 
and implementation of comprehensive, effective and sustainable strategies for human rights 
education at the national level, the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-
Violence for the Children of the World (2001-2010), the United Nations Decade of 
Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014), the International Year for Human 
Rights Learning (2008-2009) as well as the International Year for the Rapprochement of 
Cultures (2010).2
</p>
<p>6. The Platform for Human Rights Education and Training, an informal cross-regional 
grouping of States within the framework of the Human Rights Council which supports 
related international activities, is promoting the development of a United Nations 
declaration on human rights education and training. A first draft, prepared by the Human 
Rights Council Advisory Committee, was presented to the Council in March 2010. In its 
resolution 13/15 of 25 March 2010, the Council decided to establish an open-ended 
intergovernmental working group with the mandate of negotiating, finalizing and 
submitting to the Council the draft declaration by March 2011. 
</p>
<p>7. On 10 December 2004, upon the recommendation of the Commission on Human 
Rights and the Economic and Social Council, the General Assembly proclaimed the World 
Programme for Human Rights Education scheduled to begin on 1 January 2005, in order to 
advance the implementation of human rights education programmes in all sectors.3 The 
World Programme is structured in consecutive phases, in order to further focus national 
human rights education efforts on specific sectors/issues.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Objectives of the World Programme for Human Rights Education 
</b></p>
<p>8. The objectives of the World Programme for Human Rights Education are: 
</p>
<p> (a) To promote the development of a culture of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) To promote a common understanding, based on international instruments, of 
basic principles and methodologies for human rights education; 
</p>
<p> (c) To ensure a focus on human rights education at the national, regional and 
international levels; 
</p>
<p> (d) To provide a common collective framework for action by all relevant actors; 
</p>
<p> (e) To enhance partnership and cooperation at all levels; 
</p>
<p> (f) To survey, evaluate and support existing human rights education 
programmes, to highlight successful practices, and to provide an incentive to continue 
and/or expand them and to develop new ones.

<p><b> C. Principles for human rights education activities 
</b></p>
<p>9. Educational activities within the World Programme shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Promote the interdependence, interrelatedness, indivisibility and universality 
of human rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and the right 
to development; 
</p>
<p> (b) Foster respect for and appreciation of differences, and opposition to 
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national, ethnic or social origin, physical or mental condition, sexual orientation and  other 
bases; 
</p>
<p> (c) Encourage analysis of chronic and emerging human rights problems 
(including poverty, violent conflicts and discrimination), also in view of rapidly changing 
developments in the political, social, economic, technological and ecological fields, which 
would lead to responses and solutions consistent with human rights standards; 
</p>
<p> (d) Empower communities and individuals to identify their human rights needs 
and to claim them effectively; 
</p>
<p> (e) Develop the capacity of duty-bearers (in particular, governmental officials), 
who have an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of those under  their 
jurisdiction, to meet such obligation; 
</p>
<p> (f) Build on the human rights principles embedded within the different cultural 
contexts and take into account historical and social developments in each country; 
</p>
<p> (g) Foster knowledge of and skills to use local, national, regional and 
international human rights instruments and mechanisms for the protection of human  rights; 
</p>
<p> (h) Make use of participatory pedagogies that include knowledge, critical 
analysis and skills for action furthering human rights; 
</p>
<p> (i) Foster teaching and learning environments free from want and fear that 
encourage participation, enjoyment of human rights and the full development of the human 
personality; 
</p>
<p> (j) Be relevant to the daily life of the learners, engaging them in a dialogue about 
ways and means of transforming human rights from the expression of abstract norms to the 
reality of their social, economic, cultural and political conditions.

<p><b> II. The second phase (2010-2014) of the World Programme for 
Human Rights Education: a plan of action for human rights 
education in higher education and for human rights training 
for civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military
  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope 
</b></p>
<p>10. The first phase (2005-2009) of the World Programme was dedicated to the 
integration of human rights education in the primary and secondary school systems. A 
related plan of action was adopted by the General Assembly in July 2005.4  
</p>
<p>11. According to Human Rights Council resolution 12/4, the second phase of the World 
Programme (2010-2014) will focus &#8220;on human rights education for higher education and on 
human rights training programmes for teachers and educators, civil servants, law 
enforcement officials and military personnel at all levels&#8221; and &#8220;Member States should also 
continue the implementation of human rights education in primary and secondary school 
systems&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>12. The plan of action focuses on human rights education in two broadly-defined 
sectors, i.e. higher education and training for civil servants, law enforcement officials and 
the military. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to training for teachers,5 strategies to address primary and secondary 
school teachers are already covered in the plan of action for the first phase of the World 
Programme. Higher education teaching personnel,6 sometimes also defined as teachers, are 
dealt with in the higher education section of this plan of action. 
</p>
<p>14. &#8220;Educators&#8221; is a broad definition used to refer to people who design, develop, 
implement and evaluate human rights education activities and programmes in formal, 
informal and non-formal education settings. Whilst the plan of action does not have a 
specific section on human rights training for such a wide range of educators, principles and 
strategies related to the higher-education teaching personnel would also be applicable by 
analogy. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific objectives 
</b></p>
<p>15. In view of the overall objectives of the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education (see section I.B above), the present plan of action aims to achieve the following 
specific objectives: 
</p>

</p>
<p>World Programme for Human Rights Education , available at: 
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/planaction.htm . 
</p>
<p> 5  &#8220;The word &#8216;teachers&#8217; covers all those persons in schools who are responsible for the education of 
pupils&#8221;, UNESCO recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers (1966), section I, definitions, 
para. 1 (a). 
</p>
<p> 6  &#8220;&#8216;Higher-education teaching personnel&#8217; means all those persons in institutions or programmes of 
higher education who are engaged to teach and/or to undertake scholarship and/or to undertake 
research and/or to provide educational services to students or to the community at large&#8221;, UNESCO 
recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel, 1997, section I, 
definitions, para. 1 (f).
</p>
<p> <b>7 </b></p>


<p> (a) To promote the inclusion of human rights education in higher education and 
in training programmes for civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military; 
</p>
<p> (b) To support the development, adoption and implementation of relevant 
sustainable national strategies; 
</p>
<p> (c) To provide guidelines on key components of human rights education in 
higher education and in training programmes for civil servants, law enforcement officials 
and the military; 
</p>
<p> (d) To facilitate the provision of support to higher education institutions and 
Member States by international, regional, national and local organizations; 
</p>
<p> (e) To support networking and cooperation among local, national, regional and 
international governmental and non-governmental institutions and organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Action promoting human rights education in higher education  
</b></p>
<p>16.  &#8220;Higher education&#8221; is defined as &#8220;all types of studies, training or training for 
research at the post-secondary level, provided by universities or other educational 
establishments that are approved as institutions of higher education by the competent State 
authorities&#8221;.7 Included in the higher education sector can be institutions for the training and 
certification of teachers at all levels, social workers as well as medical and legal 
professionals.  
</p>
<p>17. Section C draws heavily from the plan of action for the first phase of the World 
Programme, as the integration of human rights education in the formal education system 
has common principles and strategies whether it concerns primary, secondary or higher 
education, and all these sectors fall within the scope of the right to education.  
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>18.  In relation to higher education, this plan of action draws on the principles and 
frameworks set by several international human rights and education instruments and 
documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and related guidelines adopted by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child (in particular, general comment No. 1 (2001) on the aims of education); the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and related guidelines 
adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (in particular, general 
comment No. 13 (1999) on the right to education); the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
of Action; the UNESCO Recommendation concerning Education for International 
Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms; the UNESCO Declaration and Integrated Framework of Action on 
Education for Peace, Human Rights and Democracy; the UNESCO Convention against 
Discrimination in Education; the UNESCO recommendation on the Recognition of Studies 
and Qualifications in Higher Education and the related regional conventions; the UNESCO 
recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel; the 
UNESCO World Declaration on Higher Education for the Twenty-First Century: Vision 
and Action, and the final document of the 2009 UNESCO World Conference on Higher

<p>Education &#8220;The New Dynamics of Higher Education and Research For Societal Change 
and Development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>19. The Dakar Framework for Action on Education For All: Meeting Our Collective 
Commitments, adopted at the World Education Forum in 2000,8 the major international 
platform for and collective commitment to the achievement of the goals and targets of 
Education For All (EFA), reaffirmed a vision of education supported by the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and geared towards learning to live together. In the Dakar 
Framework, education is considered key &#8220;to sustainable development and peace and 
stability&#8221; (para. 6), by fostering social cohesion and empowering people to become active 
participants in social transformation. Goal 6 of the Dakar Framework is to improve all 
aspects of the quality of education, ensuring their excellence so that recognized and 
measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all, especially in literacy, numeracy and 
essential life skills.9 It provides the basis for a concept of quality education that goes 
beyond reading, writing and arithmetic, and which entails competences for democratic 
citizenship and attitudes promoting solidarity as important outcomes. 
</p>
<p>20. In the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development,10 
education is seen as a process providing learners with knowledge, skills and attitudes 
enabling them to address important questions such as rural development, health care, 
community involvement, HIV/AIDS, the environment, traditional and indigenous 
knowledge, as well as human rights. It is further stated that successful sustainable 
development requires an approach to education that strengthens &#8220;our engagement in support 
of other values &#8212; especially justice and fairness &#8212; and the awareness that we share a 
common destiny with others&#8221;.11 Accordingly, the World Programme creates synergies with 
the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014), 
coupling efforts to address issues of common concern.12
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Strategies 
</b></p>
<p>21. While the enjoyment of academic freedom requires the autonomy of higher 
education institutions, higher education, as a public good, must be a matter of responsibility 
and economic support of all governments.13 Higher education institutions, through their 
core functions (research, teaching and service to the community), not only have the social 
responsibility to educate ethical citizens committed to the construction of peace, the 
defence of human rights and the values of democracy, but also to generate global 
knowledge to meet current human rights challenges, such as eradication of poverty and

 9 According to general comment No. 1 (2001) of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the aims 
</p>
<p>of education, life skills include &#8220;the ability to make well-balanced decisions; to resolve conflicts in a 
non-violent manner; and to develop a healthy lifestyle, good social relationships and responsibility, 
critical thinking, creative talents, and other abilities which give children the tools needed to pursue 
their options in life&#8221; (para. 9).

<p>discrimination, post-conflict rebuilding, sustainable development and multicultural 
understanding.14  
</p>
<p>22. Accordingly, the role of human rights education in higher education is fundamental. 
As education concerns &#8220;not only the content of the curriculum but also the educational 
processes, the pedagogical methods and the environment within which education takes 
place&#8221;15, human rights education in higher education should be understood as a process that 
includes: 
</p>
<p> (a) &#8220;Human rights through education&#8221;: ensuring that all the components and 
processes of learning, including curricula, materials, methods and training are conducive to 
the learning of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) &#8220;Human rights in education&#8221;: ensuring respect for the human rights of all 
actors, and the practice of rights, within the higher education system. 
</p>
<p>23. Although many factors may contribute, the integration of this approach in higher 
education would include action in at least the following five areas. 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Policies and related implementation measures16
</b></p>
<p>24. The development, adoption and implementation of human rights education policies, 
as well as the infusion of human rights in educational policies, needs to be consistent with 
institutional autonomy and academic freedom, and sharing of rights and responsibilities in 
accordance with each State&#8217;s educational system.  
</p>
<p>25. Policy development should be participatory, involving associations of teaching 
personnel and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>26. Key features for human rights education policymaking in the higher education 
system may include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Developing policies and legislation for ensuring the inclusion of human 
rights, and in particular human rights education, in the higher education system: 
</p>
<p>  (i) Including human rights education in education laws or adopting specific 
legislation on human rights education; 
</p>
<p>  (ii) Ensuring that all legislation is aligned with the principles of human rights 
 education and monitoring inconsistency in legislation; 
</p>
<p>  (iii) Ensuring that policies are based on relevant research in human rights 
 education; 
</p>
<p>  (iv) Developing policies and regulations with regard to university governance and 
management, including all those affecting the university culture and student life, 
which are consistent with human rights principles; 
</p>
<p>  
 14  See final document of the 2009 UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education, preamble and 
</p>
<p>paras. 2-4.  
 15  Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 1 (2001) on the aims of education, para 
</p>
<p>8.  
 16  Policies may be defined as clear and coherent statements of commitments. Prepared at different 
</p>
<p>levels of government, in cooperation with all stakeholders, they include principles, definitions and 
objectives and serve as a normative reference throughout the higher education system and for all 
actors.  
</p>
<p><b>10</b>  </p>


<p>  (v) Establishing policies and practices for the recruitment, appraisal, 
 compensation, discipline and promotion of teaching personnel which respect the 
 human rights principles of equality, non-discrimination, respect, dignity, 
 fairness and transparency; 
</p>
<p> (vi) Adopting policies prohibiting sexual discrimination and harassment 
 including on the basis of pregnancy or maternity. Reviewing recruitment, hiring, 
 training and promotion policies to remove gender bias; 
</p>
<p> (vii) Developing policies to ensure that higher education is made equally 
 accessible to all, on the basis of capacity,17 ensuring access for vulnerable groups 
 including persons with disabilities18 and avoiding discrimination;19
</p>
<p> (viii) Making human rights training a criterion for state licensing or certification 
for relevant professions. 
</p>
<p> (b) Ensuring coherence, links and synergies with related policies: 
</p>
<p> (i) Integrating human rights education in national sectoral plans for higher 
 education; in national plans for Education for All (EFA); in national policy 
 frameworks as part of the Decade on Education for Sustainable Development (2005-
2014); and in inclusive education policies; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Including human rights education in national human rights plans; in national 
action plans against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
 intolerance; in national poverty reduction strategies; and in other development 
 frameworks. 
</p>
<p> (c) Adopting a comprehensive human rights training policy for teaching 
personnel including: 
</p>
<p> (i) The training of trainers, pre-service and in-service training of teaching 
 personnel; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Information on the rights, responsibilities and participation of students 
 and teaching personnel in all pre- and in-service teacher-training policies and 
 programmes; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Recognizing, accrediting and supporting non-governmental organizations and 
 other sectors of civil society carrying out training activities in human rights 
 education; 
</p>
<p> (iv) Considering human rights education as a criterion for the qualification, 
 accreditation and career development of educational staff and the accreditation of 
 training activities of non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (v) Developing criteria and standards to evaluate human rights training 
 programmes and their implementation. 
</p>
<p> (d)  Fulfilling international obligations on human rights education: 
</p>
<p>  
 17  Art. 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; art. 28 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
 18  Art. 9 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
 19  For instance, different standards of treatment being applied to non-citizens on grounds of race, colour, 
</p>
<p>descent, and national or ethnic origin &#8211; see Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, 
general recommendation no. 30 (2004) on discrimination against non-citizens, para. 31. 
</p>
<p> <b>11 </b></p>


<p> (i) Promoting the ratification of international instruments concerning the right to 
 education and human rights education; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Including information on human rights education in the national reports to 
the relevant international monitoring mechanisms, including United Nations treaty 
 bodies (especially the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), United Nations special procedures 
(especially the Special Rapporteur on the right to education) and the universal 
periodic review; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Cooperating with non-governmental organizations, other sectors of civil 
 society and human rights education specialists in preparing the above-mentioned 
national reports; 
</p>
<p> (iv) Publicizing and implement the recommendations made by the international 
 monitoring mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> (v) Developing and adopting relevant policy implementation measures. Effective 
 educational policy development and reform requires not only explicit policy 
 statements but also a consistent implementation strategy, including clearly 
 defined measures, mechanisms, responsibilities and resources. Such an 
 implementation strategy involving all stakeholders can ensure coherence, monitoring 
 and accountability of policies.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Teaching and learning processes and tools 
</b></p>
<p>27. Introducing or improving human rights education in the higher education system 
requires adopting a holistic approach to teaching and learning, by integrating programme 
objectives and content, resources, methodologies, assessment and evaluation; by looking 
beyond the classroom and the higher-education institution to society; and by building 
partnerships between different members of the academic community and beyond. 
</p>
<p>28. The following aspects are necessary for achieving quality human rights teaching and 
learning. They are addressed to policymakers at national and higher education institution 
levels as well as, in some instances, to teaching personnel: 
</p>
<p> (a) Concerning teaching and learning programmes and courses: 
</p>
<p>  (i) Develop strategies for infusing human rights as a cross-cutting issue into 
 all higher-education disciplines - not only law, social studies or history but also 
 disciplines in the technical and scientific fields (for instance architecture and 
 engineering as they relate to development, environment, housing; medicine as it 
 relates to child care, public health, women&#8217;s reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS, 
 disability; biotechnology and architecture as they relate to food, housing and 
 environment, etc.); 
</p>
<p>  (ii) Consider offering introductory courses on human rights for students of all 
disciplines; 
</p>
<p>  (iii) Consider introducing advanced courses addressing human rights issues 
 specifically relevant for each course of study; 
</p>
<p>  (iv) Develop specialized Master and PhD programmes in human rights in a 
 variety of disciplines and subject areas;  
</p>
<p><b>12</b>  </p>


<p>  (v) Develop multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary human rights academic 
 programmes.20  
</p>
<p> (b) Concerning teaching and learning materials: 
</p>
<p>  (i) Review and revise textbooks and manuals to conform to human rights 
 principles and support the development of balanced and relevant human rights 
 education and training materials that encourage active participation in teaching and 
 learning processes;  
</p>
<p> (ii) Make sure that human rights education materials stem from human  rights 
principles as embedded in the relevant cultural contexts, as well as  historical and 
social developments; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Encourage the collection, sharing, translation and adaptation of human 
 rights education materials; 
</p>
<p> (iv) Utilize human rights/human rights education materials issued by United 
 Nations entities in the country or region as teaching and learning materials, as well 
as research documents. 
</p>
<p> (c) Concerning teaching and learning practices and methodologies: 
</p>
<p> (i) Adopt a teaching style that is coherent with human rights, i.e. which 
 respects human rights, the dignity and self-esteem of each learner, taking also 
 into account cultural considerations; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Adopt learner-centred methods and approaches that empower students, 
 encourage their interactive participation, and activities that encourage the 
 exploration of alternative perspectives and critical reflection; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Employ experiential learning methodologies that enable learners to 
 understand and apply human rights concepts to their lives and experiences, 
 including community research and/or service;  
</p>
<p> (iv) In planning human rights teaching, define the human rights skills and 
 competencies to be acquired and give equal importance to cognitive (knowledge and 
 skills) and social/affective (values, attitudes, behaviours) learning outcomes; 
</p>
<p> (v) Establish a quality-assurance system for higher education which is 
 consistent with human rights principles and create specific quality assurance 
 mechanisms for human rights education. 
</p>
<p> (d) Concerning teaching and learning support and resources: 
</p>
<p> (i) Establish and develop, within higher education institutions, human rights 
 training and resource centres to promote the establishment or enhancement of 
 sustainable human rights training programmes and courses and ensure their quality, 
 as well as to provide facilities for human rights studies and research; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Facilitate access to new information technologies for networking, 
 exchange of human rights information and discussion. Develop website resources, 
</p>
<p>  
 20  Multidisciplinary programmes would include the study, research and engagement with human rights 
</p>
<p>from different disciplinary perspectives, such as philosophy, sociology, languages, international and 
domestic law, etc. Interdisciplinary programmes would entail the crossing of boundaries between 
disciplines and the pooling of approaches and methodologies to study, research and engage with 
human rights with a new integrated perspective.  
</p>
<p> <b>13 </b></p>


<p> develop and facilitate e-learning, online learning programmes, e-forums, web 
 conferencing and distance learning programmes; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Encourage scholarships as a means to promote human rights education 
 and training. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Research  
</b></p>
<p>29. The role of higher education in developing new knowledge and advancing critical 
reflection in the area of human rights is fundamental. Higher education should inform, by 
means of research, human rights education policies and practice, through inter alia the 
following strategies:  
</p>
<p> (a) Encouraging and investing in research contributing to the development of 
innovative and effective methodologies and tools for human rights education based also on 
the analysis and assessment of existing practices, lesson-learning and evaluation exercises, 
and widely disseminate research results; 
</p>
<p> (b) Encouraging and investing in research on ways of translating human rights 
principles and specific human rights instruments into concrete forms (e.g. government 
policy and programmes, business practices, community initiatives, socio-cultural norms) as 
a general research agenda; 
</p>
<p> (c) Assessing, collecting and disseminating examples of good practices in human 
rights education at the higher education and other levels; 
</p>
<p> (d) Establishing links, partnerships and networks to facilitate collaboration and 
information exchanges between researchers of different higher education institutions, non-
governmental and other civil society organizations, national human rights institutions and 
international organizations, and the collaborative development of human rights education 
research projects; 
</p>
<p> (e) Establishing and developing human rights resource centres and libraries 
which play a capacity-building role, providing facilities for human rights studies and 
research and ascertain how these can be better supported; 
</p>
<p> (f) Encouraging scholarships and fellowships as a means to promote human-
rights related research; 
</p>
<p> (g) Participating in international surveys and comparative studies. 
</p>
<p><b> (d) The learning environment  
</b></p>
<p>30. In the context of higher education, it is important to stress that members of the 
academic community, individually or collectively, are free to pursue, develop and transmit 
knowledge and ideas, through research, teaching, study, discussion, documentation, 
production, creation or writing. Academic freedom includes the liberty of individuals to 
freely express opinions about the institution or system in which they work, to fulfil their 
functions without discrimination or fear of repression by the State or any other actor, to 
participate in professional or representative academic bodies, and to enjoy all the 
internationally recognized human rights applicable to other individuals in the same 
jurisdiction.21
</p>

</p>
<p><b>14</b>  </p>


<p>31. Introducing human rights education in higher education institutions implies that they 
strive to be places where human rights are lived and practised. To this end, it is essential to 
ensure that educational objectives, practices and the organization of higher education 
institutions are consistent with human rights principles, through, inter alia, the following 
strategies: 
</p>
<p> (a) Developing explicit and shared policy statements, such as charters on the 
rights and responsibilities of students and teaching personnel; codes of conduct for higher 
education institutions free of violence, sexual abuse, harassment and corporal punishment, 
including procedures for resolving conflicts and dealing with violence; non-discrimination 
policies including admissions, scholarships, advancement, promotion, special programmes, 
eligibility and opportunities; 
</p>
<p> (b) For teaching personnel, ensuring that they not only have an explicit mandate 
from the leadership concerning human rights education, but also opportunities for 
developing and implementing innovative good practices in human rights education; 
</p>
<p> (c) Adopting policies that protect and respect the human rights of all who teach 
in institutions of higher learning as well as support staff of these institutions (e.g. librarians, 
archivists, research assistants, administrators); 
</p>
<p> (d) Ensuring that students enjoy freedom of expression and participation in 
decision-making, organizing their own activities and representing, mediating and 
advocating their interests; 
</p>
<p> (e) Strengthening the more general role of higher education institutions in public 
awareness-raising about human rights, also through the organization of special events such 
as festivals, conferences, exhibitions as a collaborative effort with youth groups, civil 
society and local government etc.; 
</p>
<p> (f) Facilitating the implementation of extra-curricular student projects and 
service in the community on human rights issues, such as for example the establishment of 
clinics providing free legal advice or the performance of internships with human rights non-
governmental organizations or other civil society actors. 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Education and professional development of higher education teaching 
personnel  
</b></p>
<p>32. Teaching personnel have a major responsibility to transmit human rights values, 
skills, attitudes, motivation and practices, both in the performance of their professional 
responsibilities and in their function as role-models. To this end, the recognition of and 
respect for their professional status, as well as the provision of adequate human rights 
training, are essential. 
</p>
<p>33. Strategies to address human rights education in the education and professional 
development of higher education teaching personnel include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Developing pre-service and in-service training curricula on human rights 
education, including the following elements: 
</p>
<p> (i) Knowledge and understanding of human rights, their universality, 
 indivisibility and interdependence and of protection mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary human rights perspectives; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Educational theories underlying human rights education, including links 
 between formal, non-formal and informal education; 
</p>
<p> <b>15 </b></p>


<p> (iv) Teaching and learning methodologies for human rights education and the 
 role of teaching personnel; 
</p>
<p> (v) Social skills and leadership styles of teaching personnel that are 
 democratic and coherent with human rights principles;  
</p>
<p> (vi) Rights and responsibilities of teaching personnel and students, including 
 in addressing human rights issues in the institution; 
</p>
<p> (vii) Information on existing educational materials for human rights education, 
 building the capacity of higher-education teaching personnel to review and choose 
 from among them as well as to develop new materials. 
</p>
<p> (b) Developing and using appropriate training methodologies: 
</p>
<p> (i) Appropriate training methods for the adult learner, in particular learner-
 centred approaches, and addressing motivation, self-esteem and emotional 
 development leading to awareness-raising on values and behaviour; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Appropriate methods for training in human rights education such as using 
 participatory, interactive, cooperative and experience and practice-based 
 methods, taking also into account cultural considerations; linking theory to practice; 
 testing learned techniques in the work situation, particularly the classroom. 
</p>
<p> (c) Developing and disseminating appropriate training resources and materials: 
</p>
<p> (i) Collection, dissemination and exchange of good practices in training in 
 human rights education; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Stocktaking and dissemination of training methodologies developed by 
 non-governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Development of materials as part of in-service training activities; 
</p>
<p> (iv) Development of online materials and resources. 
</p>
<p> (d) Networking and cooperation among different education and training 
 providers; 
</p>
<p> (e) Promotion and participation in international education and training activities 
 and exchanges; 
</p>
<p> (f) Evaluation of training activities including self-evaluation and perceptions of 
 trainees on the relevance, utility and impact of training activities. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Actors 
</b></p>
<p>34. Main responsibility for the implementation of this section of the plan of action rests 
with ministries of education or higher education, working in cooperation with other relevant 
departments of the government (for instance, finance ministries) as well as higher education 
institutions and relevant training colleges, with varying levels of responsibility, depending 
upon the degree of institutional autonomy.  
</p>
<p>35. The above-mentioned actors will need to work closely with numerous national 
institutions and organizations including: 
</p>
<p> (a) Unions of higher education teaching personnel; 
</p>
<p> (b) Student unions and associations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Legislative bodies, including education, development and human 
rights/education parliamentary committees and advisory groups; 
</p>
<p><b>16</b>  </p>


<p> (d) National human rights institutions, such as ombudsmen and human rights 
commissions; 
</p>
<p> (e) Relevant institutions of higher education which participate in the UNITWIN 
Networks and UNESCO Chairs programme;22
</p>
<p> (f) National college and university networks; 
</p>
<p> (g) National Commissions for UNESCO; 
</p>
<p> (h) Education research institutes; 
</p>
<p> (i) National and local human rights training and resource centres or institutes, 
 including those within higher education institutions; 
</p>
<p> (j) Training colleges, where they exist, for higher education teaching personnel; 
</p>
<p> (k) Non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>36. Other stakeholders to be involved would include: 
</p>
<p> (a) The media; 
</p>
<p> (b) Religious institutions; 
</p>
<p> (c) Community leaders and local community institutions; 
</p>
<p> (d) Indigenous peoples and minorities; 
</p>
<p> (e) The corporate sector. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Action promoting human rights training for civil servants, law 
enforcement officials and the military 
</b></p>
<p>37. Section D of the present plan of action focuses on human rights training for a broad 
range of adult professionals who have specific responsibility, as state actors, to respect, 
protect and fulfil the human rights of those under their jurisdiction. They include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Civil servants23 who, depending on national laws and governmental 
structures, may include officials and policymakers from government ministries and 
</p>
<p>  
 22 UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs projects deal with training and research activities and cover all major 
</p>
<p>fields of knowledge within UNESCO competence such as education, human rights, cultural 
development, environment, etc. The principal beneficiaries of this programme are institutions of 
higher learning in developing countries and countries in transition. 
</p>
<p> 23 There is no internationally-agreed definition of what constitutes &#8220;civil service&#8221; (see World Bank 
article &#8220;Civil Service Law &amp; Employment Regimes&#8221;, 26 April 2001, available at 
http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/civilservice/civilservicelaw.htm). The concept and definition 
of &#8220;civil service&#8221; and &#8220;civil servant&#8221; differs widely from country to country, in accordance with 
national laws and governmental structures. See for instance the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Thesaurus, 6th edition, 2008 (available at http://www.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ILO-
Thesaurus/english/index.htm): &#8220;civil service&#8221; is referred to as &#8220;the permanent, professional branches 
of state administration, excluding military and judicial branches and elected politicians&#8221; and &#8220;civil 
servant&#8221; as &#8220;public administration employee&#8221;. In current usage, the term most commonly refers to 
officials within civilian central government or subnational government (see the World Bank as cited 
above). Research shows that they may include officials from government ministries, departments, 
executive agencies, diplomatic service, local government and city councils or municipalities, fiscal 
and economic agencies, revenue collection agencies; in some cases, also teachers employed in public 
education systems and employees of public hospitals (non-exhaustive list). 
</p>
<p> <b>17 </b></p>


<p>departments, diplomats, employees of local government and municipalities, as well as fiscal 
and economic agencies, teachers, public health professionals and social workers; 
</p>
<p> (b) Law enforcement officials,24 i.e. police, prison personnel and border patrols, 
as well as security forces and the military, when they are given police powers; 
</p>
<p> (c) The military.  
</p>
<p>38. The above-mentioned professional groups have very different roles and 
responsibilities, institutional and organizational cultures and specific international human 
rights standards applicable to them. Given its broad scope, this section will only present 
some general strategies for addressing these professions, while occasionally providing 
specific examples. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>39. With regard to civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military, the plan of 
action draws on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as major international 
human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child; the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>40. In addition, the United Nations has developed a series of other international 
instruments, such as recommendations, basic principles, codes of conduct etc., which 
provide more detailed guidance to certain professional groups for the performance of their 
duties in line with human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>41. For instance, in the case of law enforcement officials, those instruments include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of 
Power 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (the 
Tokyo Rules) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Instruments concerning the treatment of detainees and prisoners (Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; Basic Principles for the Treatment 
</p>
<p>  
24 For a definition of law enforcement officials, see art. 1 (a) and (b) of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement 
</p>
<p>Officials, available at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/codeofconduct.htm. 
</p>
<p><b>18</b>  </p>


<p>of Prisoners; Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form 
of Detention or Imprisonment) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Instruments concerning juvenile justice (United Nations Guidelines for the 
Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines); United Nations 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing 
Rules); United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of Their 
Liberty; Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System). 
</p>
<p>42. Similarly, specific international human rights standards would be applicable to the 
civil service or the military.<b> </b></p>
<p><b> 2.  Strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Training policies and other related policies 
</b></p>
<p>43. If training is to produce the desired impact on behaviour and professional 
performance, it must be clearly supported by and linked to corresponding policies and rules 
in the trainees&#8217; organization or institution. With regard to civil servants, law enforcement 
officials and the military, the following strategies could be adopted: 
</p>
<p> (a) Reviewing pre-service and in-service training policies to make sure that they 
include human rights training,25 and make audience-specific human rights courses 
compulsory for pre-service training; 
</p>
<p> (b) Encouraging the adoption of a comprehensive human rights training policy 
relating to pre-service and in-service training, with such training as a mandatory criterion 
for professional qualification and promotion; 
</p>
<p> (c) Adopting policies to recruit and especially train officials appropriately suited 
for dealing with vulnerable groups which may be dealt with by the professions, such as 
children, women, minorities, people with disabilities, indigenous peoples etc. 
</p>
<p> (d) With regard to the institutionalization of human rights training: 
</p>
<p> (i) Commitment to human rights training for civil servants, law enforcement 
officials and the military should not translate into just one-off training courses for 
selected officials but should encourage the establishment of a sound national training 
structure, involving both the sector in question and those sectors of society it is 
supposed to serve; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Reviewing all existing pre-service and in-service training curricula to 
explicitly integrate human rights principles and standards in all relevant subjects, 
and in addition develop specific human rights training courses as appropriate; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Encouraging the creation of a fully integrated human rights centre in civil 
service training colleges, schools of government, and police and military training 
colleges; 
</p>
<p> (iv) When possible, giving priority to the training of trainers, i.e. those who are 
charged with conducting human rights training and material or knowledge 
dissemination efforts after returning to their institutions, organizations or duty 
</p>
<p>  
 25 See, for instance para. 3 of general recommendation No. 13 (1993) on the training of law 
enforcement officials in the protection of human rights of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination.  
</p>
<p> <b>19 </b></p>


<p>stations. In proceeding this way, the impact of a training programme is multiplied. In 
the case of training of trainers, training programmes should also include sessions on 
training methodology (see above) and design (both lessons and materials); 
</p>
<p> (v) Considering the introduction of incentives for the different professional 
groups to encourage their participation in human rights training programmes; 
</p>
<p> (vi)  Setting up a mechanism for evaluation and impact assessment with regard to 
 institutionalized human rights training, in accordance with each State&#8217;s system. 
</p>
<p>(e) As training should not be an isolated effort but rather part of a human rights 
capacity-building strategy, it is important that policies and regulations with regard to the 
profession be also reviewed to make sure that they are not inconsistent with human rights 
standards and that they specifically promote the contribution of the profession to human 
rights. Those policies could include the establishment of a vetting system to exclude from 
the civil service, law enforcement and the military candidates who do not commit to human 
rights principles; policies for the recruitment, appraisal, compensation and discipline of 
civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military which are in line with human 
rights principles of equality, non-discrimination, respect, dignity, fairness and transparency; 
policies prohibiting sexual discrimination and harassment; and regulations for specific 
professional tasks which may particularly affect human rights (such as, in respect of law 
enforcement, standing orders which may cover the use of force and firearms or the prompt 
and effective response to cases of violence against women). 
</p>
<p><b>  (b)  Training processes and tools 
</b></p>
<p>44. Strategies to ensure the effectiveness of human rights training for adult audiences, 
such as civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military, include:  
</p>
<p> (a) With regard to training methodology and practices, developing human rights 
training, based on certain methodological principles,26 as shown by adult learning studies 
and experience, including: 
</p>
<p> (i) Audience specificity 
</p>
<p> Training must be directly targeted and appropriately addressed to the particular 
 audience, be they police, health-care workers, diplomats, military, development 
 professionals etc. A consultative training needs assessment, involving the target 
 institution or group to be trained, should be organized in order to undertake an 
 analysis of the professional duties, experiences, expectations, personal backgrounds 
 and aspirations of training participants, as well as their level of human  rights 
knowledge and skills; to set up specific learning objectives (desired post-
 training changes in participant knowledge, attitude, behaviour and skills); to design 
 an evaluation strategy, and in particular how the achievement of the learning 
 objectives will be measured; and to assess other activities that should be 
 implemented;  
</p>
<p> (ii) Relevant and practical content 
</p>
<p> It follows from the previous principle that the training content should focus on 
 human rights standards and practices that are directly relevant to the daily lives of 
</p>
<p>  
 26 See Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), <i>Human Rights 
Training &#8211; A Manual on Human Rights Training Methodology</i> (United Nations Publications, no Sales 
No.). 
</p>
<p><b>20</b>  </p>


<p> trainees. Professional groups need to know not just what human rights are, but also 
 how to apply them in real life situations. Training content should, therefore, be 
designed around the functions of the professional group and how to apply human 
 rights in the performance of them, also focusing on human rights issues which 
would more likely be encountered by the specific profession;27  
</p>
<p> (iii) Participatory and sensitizing training techniques 
</p>
<p> Training programmes should feature a variety of creative and participatory adult 
 training techniques to secure active involvement by the learners, including 
 brainstorming, role playing, group work, case studies, panel discussions and field 
 trips, possibly with the use of audiovisuals. Well-designed exercises could sensitize 
 trainees to their own potential for both contributing to behaviour that violates human 
 rights (e.g. strengthening trainee awareness of gender28 or racial bias in their own 
 attitudes or behaviour) and promoting and defending human rights;  
</p>
<p> (iv) Peer learning 
</p>
<p> Much more can be accomplished through a peer-learning approach that features, for 
 example, the police and the military being trained by their peers as opposed to a 
 professor-student training model. This approach ensures trainers&#8217; access to the 
 distinctive professional culture that surrounds each audience. Simultaneously, 
 practitioner trainers should be accompanied and supported by human rights experts, 
 thus ensuring that human rights standards are fully and consistently reflected 
 through the training process. Similarly, international training activities and 
 exchanges could be promoted among individuals belonging to the same professional 
 group; 
</p>
<p> (v) The role of self-esteem 
</p>
<p> Adult trainees will bring to the training their own professional expertise and 
 practical experience that should be both acknowledged and drawn on for the benefit 
 of training. Trainers should thus seek to establish an atmosphere in which the 
 exchange of expertise and experience is facilitated, the professional knowledge of 
 trainees is recognized and professional pride which reflects human rights principles 
 is encouraged.  
</p>
<p> (b) With regard to training content, developing distinct content for civil servants, 
law enforcement officials and the military, reflecting their different roles and 
responsibilities and institutional/organizational cultures, e.g: 
</p>
<p>(i) With regard to civil servants, who may include a broad variety of 
professionals (see para. 37 (a) above), human rights training content within this 
category would differ substantially. For instance, human rights training for social 
</p>
<p>  
 27 For instance, States are encouraged to formulate and implement training programmes for law 
enforcement, immigration and border officials, prosecutors and service providers, with a view to 
sensitizing them to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (see outcome 
document of the Durban Review Conference, para. 75). Officials who work on migration issues or are 
in contact with migrant workers and members of their families will need to get acquainted with the 
content of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
 28 It is important to note that in para. 24 (b) of its general recommendation No. 19 (1992) on violence 
against women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women stated that 
gender-sensitive training of law enforcement officers and other public officials is essential for the 
effective implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. 
</p>
<p> <b>21 </b></p>


<p>workers29 would be oriented to the protection of vulnerable groups such as children, 
women, elderly persons, disabled persons, prisoners, refugees, and migrants, as 
social workers need to guarantee protection when State action for the public good 
threatens the human rights of those particular persons or groups. Human rights 
training for local government officials may focus on human rights standards in the 
context of good governance,30 i.e. the exercise of authority through political and 
institutional processes that are transparent and accountable and encourage public 
participation. Human rights training for diplomats may focus, inter alia, on 
international human rights instruments and mechanisms, as diplomats may be called 
upon to ensure their countries&#8217; input into the international human rights machinery;  
</p>
<p> (ii) In the case of the police,31 human rights training would cover human rights 
 standards touching upon various police functions, such as methods of police 
 investigation; search and seizure; arrest and pretrial detention; use of force and 
 firearms; policing in civil disorder, states of emergency and internal conflicts; legal 
 crowd control measures, etc. It would also focus on groups requiring special 
protection such as juveniles, women, migrants, refugees and persons with 
 disabilities. Depending on the audience, it could include the infusion of a human 
 rights perspective into matters of police command, management and control, 
 including the issuing of standing orders, development of codes of conduct, entry and 
 in-service training, fair and non-discriminatory recruitment processes, screening 
 processes for new recruits, community policing strategies, the establishment of 
 complaints mechanisms, and the obligation to launch prompt and impartial 
 investigations in the case of human rights violations; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Human rights training for prison officials32 would familiarize trainees with 
 international human rights standards in the operation of penitentiaries, facilitate 
 examination of humane and effective techniques for the performance of prison 
 officials and of legal and judicial functions in a democratic society, and prepare 
 trainees to include this information in their daily work. It could include human rights 
 standards regarding facilities for prisoners and detainees; prisoners&#8217; physical and 
 mental health, including HIV/AIDS; treatment of special categories of prisoners and 
 detainees, including juveniles, women, persons with disabilities, remand prisoners; 
 prison records; prison administration, discipline and complaints procedures; use of 
 force; punishment and recourse procedures; due process and complaints; contacts

<p> with the outside world, including family, legal counsel and medical personnel; 
 freedom of belief and worship; prison labour (e.g. work conditions, remuneration); 
 and education and recreation;  
</p>
<p> (iv) The military would need to be trained in international human rights norms 
and standards as relevant to their conflict-related tasks, as well as to those duties of 
modern professional soldiers that go beyond the waging of war. These increasingly 
include civil policing duties, the maintenance of order and public safety under states 
of emergency, and assignment to international peacekeeping operations. The 
effective, professional and humane performance of these duties requires knowledge 
of and sensitization to human rights standards, as well as the skills to apply them in 
the daily work of the military. Traditional military training has, however, in many 
cases included only reference to the international law of armed conflicts (or 
humanitarian law), including the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their additional 
protocols. Human rights training per se, however, has been conspicuously absent.  
</p>
<p> (c) With regard to training tools, developing training materials that reflect the 
above-mentioned methodology. Existing textbooks and manuals should be reviewed and 
revised to ensure that they conform to human rights principles and are audience specific. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) The learning and working environment  
</b></p>
<p>45. Human rights training can only take place in an environment where human rights are 
practised. To this end, the following strategies could be implemented:  
</p>
<p> (a) Developing and adopting clear and shared policy statements such as codes of 
conduct and professional ethics for staff and officials, codes of practice for employers 
explicitly incorporating human rights standards in all areas of work, and charters on rights 
and responsibilities for employees; 
</p>
<p> (b) Encouraging the recognition and celebration of human rights achievements 
through human rights events, competitions, awards, scholarships and prizes; 
</p>
<p> (c) Encouraging interaction between law enforcement officials, local government 
and military and the wider community, including the formal adoption of plans of action (for 
instance, to combat racism, discrimination, gender violence, etc.).  
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Actors 
</b></p>
<p>46. Main responsibility for the implementation of this section of the plan of action rests 
with the ministries responsible for the civil service, law enforcement officials and the 
military (for instance, depending on arrangements in specific countries, these may be the 
ministry of public administration, ministry of interior, ministry of justice or ministry of 
defence), working in cooperation with other relevant departments of the government (for 
instance, finance ministries) as well as local government.  
</p>
<p>47. The above-mentioned actors will need to work closely with numerous national 
institutions and organizations including: 
</p>
<p> (a) Civil service training colleges, schools of government, and police and 
military training colleges, where they exist; 
</p>
<p> (b) Unions of civil servants and law enforcement officials; 
</p>
<p> (c) Relevant legislative bodies, including for instance interior, defence and 
human rights parliamentary committees and advisory groups; 
</p>
<p> <b>23 </b></p>


<p> (d) Municipalities, in particular those belonging to national and regional 
networks and associations, such as the UNESCO Coalition of Cities against Racism  and 
Discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (e) National human rights institutions, such as ombudsmen and human rights 
commissions; 
</p>
<p> (f) National and local human rights training and resource centres; 
</p>
<p> (g) Non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>48. Other stakeholders to be involved would include: 
</p>
<p> (a) The media; 
</p>
<p> (b) Religious institutions; 
</p>
<p> (c) Community leaders and local community institutions; 
</p>
<p> (d) Indigenous peoples and minorities; 
</p>
<p> (e) The corporate sector. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Process for national implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Steps for implementation 
</b></p>
<p>49. In the implementation of the present plan of action, Member States should establish 
realistic goals and means for action in accordance with the country&#8217;s context, priorities and 
capacity, and based on previous national efforts. 
</p>
<p>50. Four steps are outlined below to facilitate the process of national planning, 
implementation and evaluation of human rights education in higher education and human 
rights training for civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military. Such processes 
should be carried out with the involvement of all possible relevant national actors (see 
sections C.3 and D.3 above). 
</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Analysis of the current situation of human rights education in higher education and 
of human rights training for civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military. </p>
<p><b>  Actions 
</b></p>
<p>Keeping in mind the strategies mentioned in sections C and D above: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Collect information on and analyse the following, aimed at preparing a national 
baseline study for each of the areas concerned (higher education; civil servants, 
possibly by category; law enforcement officials and the military):33 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Current situation of human rights education in higher education and human 
rights training for civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military, 
including initiatives already undertaken and their shortcomings and obstacles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Existing policies and legislation. 
</p>
<p>  
 33  Given the number of the target areas and the diversity of actors involved in each of them, the baseline 
</p>
<p>study could either be conducted by the governmental coordinating department, or separate studies 
could be undertaken in each target area by the most relevant actor/s.  
</p>
<p><b>24</b>  </p>


<p>&#8226; Good practices and resources and tools existing at local, national and regional 
levels. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Historical and cultural context that may influence human rights education and 
training in those areas. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Actors currently involved (governmental institutions, national human rights 
institutions, research institutes, non-governmental organizations and other 
civil society actors). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Complementary efforts (such as university programmes with regard to peace 
education, global education, intercultural education, education for 
international understanding, democratic citizenship and values education; 
ethics programmes for professionals, etc.). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Determine which human rights education initiatives exist already and identify 
effective practices and programmes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identify key features and areas by analysing and determining advantages and 
disadvantages, as well as opportunities for and limitations in the above areas. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Arrive at conclusions on the level of implementation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consider how to build on advantages and lessons learned, and how to use 
opportunities, considering also measures that are necessary to deal with 
disadvantages and limitations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Outputs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Preparation of the national baseline studies and wide dissemination of the results 
nationally to facilitate work on a national implementation strategy 
</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Setting priorities and developing a national implementation strategy, identifying 
objectives and priorities and foreseeing implementation activities (at least for the period 
2010-2014). </p>
<p><b>  Actions 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Define the basic goals for implementation in each of the target areas. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Fix objectives using this plan of action as a reference. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Set priorities on the basis of the findings of the national baseline studies, taking into 
account the most pressing needs and/or available opportunities. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Focus on interventions leading to impact, giving priority to measures that will secure 
sustainable change vis-&#224;-vis ad-hoc activities. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Encourage the building of alliances and synergies among different actors. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identify the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Inputs - allocation of available resources (human, financial, time) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Activities (tasks, responsibilities, time frame and milestones) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mechanisms for coordination of the national implementation strategy 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Outputs - concrete products, such as legislation, codes of conduct, 
educational materials (new or revised manuals), training programmes, non-
discriminatory policies, etc. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Outcomes - results to be achieved 
</p>
<p> <b>25 </b></p>


<p><b>  Outputs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; A national implementation strategy. 
</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>Implementing and monitoring </p>
<p><b>  Actions 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Disseminate the national implementation strategy among concerned services and 
stakeholders and implement the planned activities in cooperation with them. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Monitor implementation with regard to the identified milestones. 
</p>
<p><b>Outputs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Progress report(s) with regard to the national implementation strategy. 
</p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b>Evaluation 
</p>
<p><b>  Actions 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Adopt self-evaluation and independent evaluation methods to review 
implementation, and as a means to improve and strengthen activities. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Acknowledge, disseminate, and note the achievement of results. 
</p>
<p><b>  Outputs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; National report(s) on the outcomes of the national implementation strategy. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Recommendations for future actions based on lessons learned. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Coordination 
</b></p>
<p>51. The main responsibility for implementation rests with the government, which should 
identify a relevant department as a focal point responsible for coordinating the elaboration, 
implementation and monitoring of the national implementation strategy. The coordinating 
department would engage with relevant units, ministries and other concerned national 
actors. It would also cooperate with national agencies responsible for the elaboration of 
country reports to the United Nations human rights mechanisms (treaty bodies,34 special 
rapporteurs and the universal periodic review), in order to ensure that progress in human 
rights education and training under this plan of action is included in those reports. 
</p>
<p>52. The coordinating department would liaise with OHCHR by sharing information on 
progress and by ensuring preparation and submission of the government&#8217;s final national 
evaluation report at the conclusion of the second phase.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. International cooperation and support 
</b></p>
<p>53. International cooperation and assistance is to be directed at strengthening national 
capacities for human rights education and training in support of the national 
implementation strategy. It may be provided by: 
</p>
<p>  
 34  See the &#8220;Harmonized guidelines on reporting under the international human rights treaties, including 
</p>
<p>guidelines on a common core document and treaty-specific targeted documents&#8221; (HRI/GEN/2/Rev.6), 
para. 43, available at  
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/icm-mc/docs/9th/HRI-GE-2-Rev6.doc.  
</p>
<p><b>26</b>  </p>


<p> (a) The United Nations system,35 including its specialized agencies and the 
United Nations University; 
</p>
<p> (b) Professional training institutions affiliated to the United Nations, such as 
those involved in social welfare; medical and health services; drugs and trafficking 
prevention; refugees, migration and border security; and criminal procedure;   
</p>
<p> (c) The United Nations-mandated University of Peace (UPEACE); 
</p>
<p> (d) Other international intergovernmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (e) Regional intergovernmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (f) Relevant international and regional professional networks; 
</p>
<p> (g) International and regional networks of higher education institutions; 
</p>
<p> (h) International and regional non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (i) International and regional human rights resource and documentation centres; 
</p>
<p> (j) International and regional financial institutions (World Bank, regional 
development banks, etc.), as well as bilateral funding agencies; 
</p>
<p> (k) Multilateral and bilateral development agencies. 
</p>
<p>54. It is essential that these actors collaborate closely in order to maximize resources, 
avoid duplication and ensure coherence for the implementation of this plan of action. 
</p>
<p>55. The above-mentioned organizations and institutions may: <b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Support governments in the elaboration, implementation and monitoring of 
the national implementation strategy; 
</p>
<p> (b) Provide support to other national actors involved, in particular national and 
local non-governmental organizations, professional associations, higher education 
institutions, national human rights institutions, and other civil society organizations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Facilitate information-sharing at all levels by identifying, collecting and 
disseminating information on good practices, for example through the awarding of prizes, 
as well as on available materials, institutions and programmes;  
</p>
<p> (d) Support existing networks among human rights education and training actors 
and promote the creation of new ones at all levels. 
</p>
<p>  
 35  It is important to keep in mind that United Nations human rights mechanisms regularly raise with 
</p>
<p>Member States human rights education and training issues. For instance, the treaty bodies, when 
examining reports of States parties, may place emphasis on the obligation of States parties to 
implement human rights education and training, and may reflect that emphasis in their concluding 
observations; thematic and country mechanisms of the Human Rights Council (including the special 
procedures, as well as working groups) may include in their reports progress in human rights 
education and training; and human rights education and training is also raised in the context of the 
universal periodic review. In addition, a specific UNESCO mechanism addresses the monitoring of 
the implementation of the 1974 UNESCO Recommendation Concerning Education for International 
Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms.  
</p>
<p> <b>27 </b></p>


<p><b> G. Coordination and evaluation  
</b></p>
<p>56. OHCHR will ensure international coordination of the second phase of the World 
Programme, in cooperation with relevant entities of the United Nations system, in particular 
UNESCO with regard to higher education, and other actors; it will also promote related 
awareness-raising initiatives. 
</p>
<p>57. At the conclusion of the second phase, in early 2015, each country will undertake an 
evaluation of actions implemented under this plan of action, taking as reference in 
particular sections C, D and E. Member States will be called upon to provide their final 
national evaluation report to OHCHR. OHCHR will prepare a global report based on those 
national evaluation reports, and will submit it to the Human Rights Council in 2015.
