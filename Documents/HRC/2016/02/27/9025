<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action submits the present report pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolution 1/5 and decision 3/103. The recommendations and conclusions were adopted 
by consensus<b>1</b> as contributions to the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference, 
in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 3/2 and decision PC.1/10 of the 
Preparatory Committee.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Intergovernmental Working Group held the first part of its sixth session 
from 21 January to 1 February 2008. Following the opening of the session and election of 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur, the session was postponed to the following week. The Working 
Group held the second part of its sixth session on 18 December 2008. During the first part, it 
held a total of seven meetings; for the second part, the Working Group held one meeting. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>3. Both parts of the session were attended by representatives of Member States, non-Member 
States represented by observers, other observers, intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations (see annex I). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>4. At the first part of the session, the Coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Unit opened the 
first meeting on behalf of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. At the 
second part, the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Working Group opened the meeting. 
</p>
<p>5. In the opening of the first meeting of the sixth session, the Coordinator of the 
Anti-Discrimination Unit welcomed Member States to the meeting on behalf of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Director of Research and Right to Development 
Division. The Coordinator stressed that this Working Group was facing its most important 
challenge, its contribution to the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference as 
requested by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 3/2. The Coordinator of the 
Anti-Discrimination Unit addressed item 2 of the provisional agenda, regarding the election of a 
new Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group, and requested that delegations submit their 
nominations for candidates to serve in this capacity. 
</p>
<p>6. At the opening of the second part of the sixth session, the Chairman of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group recalled that it was not able to hold the second part of its 
sixth session, which had been scheduled for 3 November to 7 November 2008, due to lack of 
availability of full conference services. The Chairman expressed his gratitude to the Chairman of  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  See A/CONF.211/PC.2/CRP.4. The document is available on request from the Secretariat. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Ad Hoc Committee on Complementary Standards for organizing the work of the 
Committee in a way that enabled the Intergovernmental Working Group to hold a meeting 
on 18 December 2008 in order to conclude its sixth session and adopt the report. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. Speaking on behalf of the Group of Asian States, the representative of China expressed his 
appreciation to the outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur, Juan Martabit, Permanent Representative 
of Chile to the United Nations Office at Geneva, for his outstanding leadership and personal 
contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group. The Chinese delegate 
thereafter submitted as a candidate for nomination Dayan Jayatilleka, Permanent Representative 
of Sri Lanka to the United Nations Office at Geneva. He stressed the appropriateness of 
Mr. Jayatilleka to serve as Chairperson-Rapporteur in light of his strong academic background, 
rich experience and personal integrity. The Chinese delegate referred to the expertise of 
Mr. Jayatilleka in the field of policymaking and his experience at the International Labour 
Organization. The delegate reiterated his confidence that the election of Mr. Jayatilleka would 
contribute to the effective implementation of the mandate of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>8. Speaking on behalf of the Group of African States, the representative of Egypt supported 
the nomination of Dayan Jayatilleka for the post, stressing the ambassador&#8217;s relevant experience 
and appropriate expertise in the field. Like the representative of China, the representative of 
Egypt stated that, as Chairperson-Rapporteur, Mr. Jayatilleka would contribute to the effective 
implementation of the mandate of the Working Group. Considering that there was no objection 
to the nomination of Mr. Jayatilleka, the ambassador was declared elected by acclamation as 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Intergovernmental Working Group. 
</p>
<p>9. In his opening address, the Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed his appreciation to his 
predecessor, Juan Martabit. In so doing, he paid tribute to the work achieved by Mr. Martabit in 
shouldering the onerous task of the Working Group. The Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked the 
delegates and representatives of regional groups for nominating him and acknowledged the 
responsibility and importance of the mandate and work of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>10. The Chairperson-Rapporteur asserted that it would have been morally impossible for him 
not to heed to the invitations of the African and Asian Groups to chair this very important 
Working Group. He referred to both specific and broad examples of the struggle of people of 
African descent towards freedom and emancipation. The Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that 
everyone had a responsibility to engage in the struggle against racism and its related ills, as they 
affect all people. 
</p>
<p>11. The Chairperson-Rapporteur elaborated further on the importance of the Intergovernmental 
Working Group in fulfilling its mandate and encouraged Member States to debate the issues 
before the Working Group extensively in order to develop appropriate and relevant contributions 
and recommendations to the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference. The 
Chairperson-Rapporteur stressed the need to identify the real and concrete issues embedded in 
the struggle against racism and stressed his commitment to ensuring that the goals established  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>under its mandate are realized effectively. The Chairperson-Rapporteur encouraged the Working 
Group to aim at achieving consensus through proper dialogue and discourse on the important 
issues relevant to accomplishing its mandate. This would constitute an important foundation for 
the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the first part of the session, the Working Group adopted the agenda for 
its sixth session (A/HRC/7/WG.3/1, see annex II).  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>13. During the first part of the session, the Intergovernmental Working Group approved its 
programme of work (annex III). The Chairperson-Rapporteur brought the attention of the 
Working Group to Human Rights Council decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006, in which the 
Council amended the mandate of the Working Group as follows: &#8220;(f) To request that the 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action convene the second part of its fifth session in September 2007 and that 
this session mark the conclusion and closure of the Working Group&#8217;s debates and deliberations 
on the question of complementary standards&#8221;; and &#8220;(h) To request that the Intergovernmental 
Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action continue its important work of ensuring the effective implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action as mandated by the Commission on Human Rights in its 
resolution 2002/68 of 25 April 2002 by focusing on other critical segments of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action that require immediate attention.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>14. Pursuant to the aforementioned decision, the Chairperson-Rapporteur highlighted the need 
to discuss the programme of work of the Working Group in light of its amended mandate. In this 
regard, he stressed that it was imperative to meet with all the coordinators of all of the regional 
groups of States as well as individual delegations in order to collect their opinions regarding the 
contents of the programme of work. 
</p>
<p>15. The Chairperson-Rapporteur adjourned the meeting for one week during which he held the 
consultations. These revealed the general trend as to the interests and preoccupations of 
regional groups and delegates. Following the consultations, the session, which reconvened 
on 28 January 2008, began with a discussion on the draft programme of work. 
</p>
<p><b>III. GENERAL STATEMENTS ON THE DRAFT PROGRAMME  
OF WORK DURING THE FIRST PART 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed his satisfaction regarding the consultations held 
with coordinators of regional groups of States and delegates concerning the programme of work. 
He also expressed his wish that delegations would reach agreement promptly on the content of 
the programme of work. 
</p>
<p>17. Speaking on behalf of the European Union, the representative of Slovenia stressed her 
group&#8217;s reservations with regard to certain aspects of the draft programme of work. The delegate 
held the position that the Intergovernmental Working Group should adjourn its session until the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>conclusion of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference. She 
asserted that the work being conducted within the session of the Working Group overlapped with 
that which is under way in the preparatory process leading to the Durban Review Conference. 
While expressing her appreciation to the Secretariat for the draft programme of work, she 
communicated her reservations regarding its contents and said that in order for the programme of 
work to be suitable it would need to undergo several changes. 
</p>
<p>18. The Chairperson-Rapporteur stressed that the programme of work could be adjusted once 
consensus was reached on its contents. However, regarding the Working Group adjourning its 
work until the conclusion of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review 
Conference in April, the Chairperson-Rapporteur asserted that it would be very difficult to do so 
since, in amending the mandate of the Working Group, the Human Rights Council did not 
provide for a postponement of its sessions. As such, the Working Group had to carry on with its 
work as mandated. 
</p>
<p>19. Speaking on behalf of the African Group, the representative of Egypt stressed that the 
suggestion concerning the adjournment by the Working Group of its session until after the April 
session of the Preparatory Committee gave the impression that the Working Group was not 
endowed with its own mandate, which was not the case. The representative stressed that even 
though the programme of work did not meet his group&#8217;s expectations, it was nonetheless willing 
to work with this programme. He added that the Working Group had work ahead of it as there 
remained many issues under the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action which the 
Working Group had yet to consider. 
</p>
<p>20. The Chairperson-Rapporteur cautioned that the Working Group should not dwell on 
contentious issues that would take up its already limited time. Instead, he stated, the 
Working Group should examine and adjust recommendations agreed upon by consensus at 
previous sessions with a view to compiling a contribution to the Preparatory Committee for the 
Durban Review Conference. 
</p>
<p>21. Speaking on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, the 
representative of Brazil stressed that the work of the Working Group should concentrate on the 
elaboration of its contribution to the Preparatory Committee. The delegate pressed the need to 
highlight the prior recommendations of the Working Group as a necessary part of the 
Working Group&#8217;s contribution to the Preparatory Committee. The delegate stressed that it would 
be unwise to set aside the prior conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group as 
ignoring them could heighten the already tense political tension surrounding the Durban Review 
Conference. 
</p>
<p>22. Several delegates expressed the opinions that a renegotiation of issues already dealt with in 
previous sessions of the Working Group would be counterproductive to the body of consensus 
already achieved and seconded the calls for the Working Group to focus on issues which have 
achieved the widest level of consensus. 
</p>
<p>23. One representative stressed his delegation&#8217;s willingness to review the work already 
completed by the Working Group, not in order to alter it but to ensure that the recommendations 
adopted and conclusions reached are still valid. Other delegates expressed their agreement that  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the work of this specific session of the Working Group would serve to contribute to the 
substantive session of the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference in 
April 2008. 
</p>
<p>24. Another delegate stressed the relevance she attached to achieving consensus and stressed 
the importance of carrying on with the important work of the Working Group consistent with the 
scope of its mandate. She also mentioned her delegation&#8217;s willingness to move forward with the 
work, regardless of its reservations to the draft programme of work. 
</p>
<p>25. Another delegate specified that it would be advisable to follow a more pragmatic approach. 
She acknowledged the necessity of updating certain recommendations. In so doing, the Working 
Group would go through the conclusions and recommendations of previous sessions and identify 
which of those were most essential to be included in the contribution to the Durban Review 
Conference. Such a strategy would enable a more focused approach, which would be essential 
and very helpful towards compiling a contribution.  
</p>
<p>26. The delegate also stressed that it would be useful to conduct a thorough analysis of 
previous conclusions and recommendations in order to distil those that are the most appropriate 
to be included in the contribution. The delegate invited other Member States to adopt such an 
approach when dealing with item 3 of the draft programme of work, entitled &#8220;Overview of 
recommendations as contributions to the Durban Review Conference&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>27. Comments were made by several delegates regarding item 6 of the draft programme of 
work, entitled &#8220;Adoption of the report&#8221;. The delegates expressed concerns since at this juncture 
it would be premature to believe that consensus could be reached regarding the adoption of the 
report at the end of the first part of the session. 
</p>
<p>28. The amended programme of work was adopted by the Working Group on the basis of 
consensus. The Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed satisfaction and encouraged the Working 
Group to move forward in the same spirit of consensus, particularly in light of the work that lay 
ahead in the second part of the session.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS AS CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE OF THE DURBAN  
REVIEW CONFERENCE 
</b></p>
<p>29. Consistent with its agenda and programme of work, the Intergovernmental Working Group 
proceeded to examine item 3 entitled &#8220;Overview of recommendations as part of contribution to 
the Durban Review Conference&#8221;. This item of the agenda and programme of work was in 
accordance with decision PC.1/10 of the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review 
Conference contained in the report of the Preparatory Committee on its first session (A/62/375) 
and with Human Rights Council resolution 3/2 of 8 December 2006, in which the Council 
requested that the Working Group and other mechanisms to &#8220;assist the Preparatory Committee 
by undertaking review and submitting recommendations, through the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, as contributions to the outcome of the Review 
Conference&#8221;. The preparation of the contribution of the Working Group was undertaken on the  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>basis of a document entitled &#8220;Compilations of conclusions and recommendations&#8221; containing the 
recommendations and conclusions adopted by consensus through the five sessions of the 
Working Group.  
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group agreed not to engage in a process of renegotiation of the conclusions 
and recommendations, but instead decided that some of the recommendations adopted at its 
previous sessions might need to be omitted from the contribution to the Preparatory Committee. 
To facilitate the work, the Secretariat italicized some of the recommendations which have 
become obsolete and/or would not be relevant for the work of the Preparatory Committee.  
</p>
<p>31. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the discussion on the review of previous 
recommendations starting with the recommendations adopted at the first session of the Working 
Group (2003) through those adopted at its fifth session (2007). The Working Group decided that 
any reference to the question of complementary standards would be removed from the final 
document of conclusions and recommendations to be submitted to the Preparatory Committee f, 
as the Human Rights Council in its decision 3/103 stipulated that the fifth session of the Working 
Group should &#8220;mark the conclusion and closure of the Working Group&#8217;s debates and 
deliberations on the question of complementary standards&#8221;. The same decision provided for the 
establishment of an &#8220;Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration of 
Complementary Standards, with the mandate to elaborate, as a matter of priority and necessity, 
complementary standards in the form of either a convention or additional protocol(s) to the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, filling the 
existing gaps in the Convention and also providing new normative standards aimed at combating 
all forms of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial and religious hatred.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>32. The review resulted in the compilation of recommendations and conclusions from the five 
previous sessions of the Working Group. The recommendations and conclusions contained in the 
compilation, which is to be submitted to the Preparatory Committee, have been either updated, 
deleted or italicized to indicate their non-relevance as part of the contribution, either because the 
recommendation has been implemented or had become obsolete. The contribution of the 
Working Group to the Preparatory Committee is contained in the document entitled 
&#8220;Compilation of conclusions and recommendations adopted by the Intergovernmental Working 
Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>V.  FUTURE WORK OF THE WORKING GROUP 
</b></p>
<p>33.<b> </b>Speaking on behalf of the African Group, the representative of Egypt suggested a list of 
five themes, which either had not been examined or exhausted yet by the Working Group and 
were contained in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. The delegate considered 
that an analysis by the Working Group of the five themes would contribute to the Durban 
Review process and the fulfilment by the Working Group of its mandate. The suggested themes 
are: (a) effective remedies, recourse, redress, compensatory and other measures at the national, 
regional and international levels to victims of human rights violations resulting from racism; 
(b) incitement to racial and/or religious hatred; (c) racial profiling; (d) restoration of human 
dignity; (e) racism and refugees, migrants, asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p>34. Speaking on behalf of the European Union, the representative of Slovenia asserted that the 
discussion on the future work of the Intergovernmental Working Group should take place after </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>April 2008, once the Durban Review Conference was held, or at least once the substantive 
session of the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference was held. According to 
this delegation, it was unwise to set the agenda yet for the next session of this Working Group. 
</p>
<p>35. Speaking on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, the 
representative of Brazil considered that the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group, 
should concentrate mostly in the elaboration of contributions and inputs to the preparatory 
process of the Durban Review Conference, as it was established by the Preparatory Committee in 
its first session. In its analysis and decision on the contributions/inputs to the preparatory 
process, the Intergovernmental Working Group should start from the work done and the results 
achieved to date, without excluding the possibility of debating any issue related to the follow-up 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. The delegate expressed the hope that the 
present process would contribute to consensus and invited all the delegations and regional groups 
to participate in the discussions in a constructive spirit. 
</p>
<p>36. One representative highlighted the fact that the concrete results of the Working Group and 
the Durban Review process were very much connected to a consensual and truly constructive 
approach and participation. He further stated that his delegation would continue to dedicate full 
attention to this Intergovernmental Working Group and underlined the importance of active, 
constructive participation and a consensual approach in discharging its mandate. 
</p>
<p>37. The Chairperson-Rapporteur encouraged all delegations to follow this moderate approach. 
</p>
<p>38. Another delegate expressed the view that his<b> </b>initial vision was for this Intergovernmental 
Working Group to play a leading role in the preparation of the Durban Review Conference. He 
indicated that his delegation remained flexible whilst focused on the primary objective, which 
was to prepare the conference. He raised the point that, if the second part of the sixth session of 
the Intergovernmental Working Group was to be meaningful, some agreement had to be reached 
as to the themes to be discussed at that time.  
</p>
<p>39. The Chairperson-Rapporteur highlighted the convergence of views on a conservative and 
moderate approach and urged delegations to stay on board. He pointed out that the reaching of 
consensus would be less likely should the themes chosen for the next session include areas that 
were contentious. Without venturing too far, we could, he stated, remain open to new themes so 
long as they were included in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. He stated that 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance were issues that should be 
discussed all the time in light of the moral and historical imperatives attached to them. Hence, he 
questioned the resistance to discussing the themes in many forums within the United Nations. 
The Chairperson guaranteed that no new issue falling outside of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action would be discussed at the next session of the Intergovernmental Working 
Group. In this regard, he reminded delegations of the usefulness of the glossary of the 
Declaration and Programme of Action, which had been circulated for ease of reference.  
</p>
<p>40. One representative indicated that since so many themes under Durban had not been 
explored, he encouraged delegations to ensure that the Intergovernmental Working Group 
resumed its work and fulfilled its mandate.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>41. Another delegate questioned why the mandate of the Intergovernmental Working Group 
was being discussed since it was well established and defined by its supervisory body, the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>42. The representative of the European Union reiterated that the position of the 
European Union had been made very clear since the beginning. The position was that the 
European Union was not in a position to agree on any new items for future work. While the 
European Union did not wish to block any future discussion, it could not participate in reaching 
conclusions and recommendations by consensus on the future work of the Intergovernmental 
Working Group.  
</p>
<p>43. One representative recommended maintaining a holistic approach with regard to the future 
work of the Intergovernmental Working Group. 
</p>
<p>44. In reiterating the position of his group, the representative of the African Group underscored 
that the Intergovernmental Working Group was not a subsidiary body of the Preparatory 
Committee for the Durban Review Conference. Therefore, there was no reason for it to await the 
outcome of the substantive session of the Preparatory Committee to continue its work.  
</p>
<p>45. One representative expressed dismay that the positions expressed by the European Union 
seemed to contradict both the consensus taken at the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee as 
well as its organizational session (held from 27 to 31 August 2007) of which the European Union 
was part. The delegate also highlighted the fact that work undertaken after 2001 within the 
context of the follow-up to and implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action was carried out at the level of ambassadors in Geneva and within the context of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group. 
</p>
<p>46. The delegate further recalled that some of the critical themes contained in the Declaration 
and Programme of Action such as &#8220;historical injustices&#8221; were themes that emanated from the 
Ministerial Segment during the 2001 Durban Conference, in which all delegations taking part in 
the Intergovernmental Working Group were represented at the ministerial level. The delegate 
further suggested that the Chairperson should approach the political heads of delegations 
represented in the Intergovernmental Working Group to deal with some of the sensitive issues at 
the level of his counterparts. 
</p>
<p>47. As an observer delegation, the representative of the African Union asserted that it was 
important that States of Africa and the European Union work together to achieve their common 
aims within not only the framework of the Intergovernmental Working Group, but of the entire 
human rights system. He submitted that the two sides participated in a constructive summit-level 
meeting in Lisbon recently and that they agreed in their declaration, among other things, to 
&#8220;address the common contemporary challenges for our two continents&#8221;. They also decided to 
establish a strategic partnership underpinned by the Joint Strategy and Action Plan to strengthen 
inter alia their cooperation in achieving objectives in various areas of endeavours, including 
human rights and good governance. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>48. The representative of the African Union believed that issues being discussed in this forum 
were central if not critical to the realization of good governance and the achievement of the 
global objectives of all human rights principles. He asserted that combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance was at the heart of many international human 
rights covenants, instruments and processes. 
</p>
<p>49. The representative also noted that all Member States of the United Nations had committed 
themselves to combating these scourges. Those representing their Governments at this forum 
were also conscious of this fact. Therefore, failure to achieve consensus on the future work of 
this session of the Intergovernmental Working Group, and its substantive work would send the 
wrong signal to the outside world where incidents of racism and intolerance manifested 
themselves in increasing numbers and in more sophisticated forms. 
</p>
<p>50. Following consultations with the representatives of the regional groups of States, the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur announced that agreement had been reached as to the following: 
(a) discussions on the future work of the Intergovernmental Working Group will proceed, but 
that the representative of the European Union will exercise the right not to contribute to the 
discussion, the European Union will be an active listener; (b) the record of the discussion will be 
included in the report of the Intergovernmental Working Group; (c) the conclusions and 
recommendations agreed on by consensus) entitled &#8220;Compilations of conclusions and 
recommendations&#8221; would be the only conclusions and recommendations adopted and they would 
be submitted to the Preparatory Committee. 
</p>
<p>51. One representative sought clarification as to whether, in the future sessions of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group, the European Union intended to maintain the position 
adopted of non-participation in discussions connected to the future work of the Group. The 
representative of the European Union was not in a position to fully answer this question at this 
stage.  
</p>
<p>52. The Chairperson-Rapporteur announced that the scheduling of the second part of the 
sixth session of the Working Group and the themes to be examined will be agreed upon through 
informal consultations. On 6 November 2008, the Working Group held consultations with the 
regional coordinators to discuss the programme of work for the second part of the sixth session. 
Subsequently a draft programme of work (annex III) was agreed upon.  
</p>
<p>53. The Intergovernmental Working Group could not formally adopt the draft programme of 
work for the second part of its sixth session and discuss the content of the draft programme of 
work, owing to the non-availability of full conference services. Therefore, it concluded its 
sixth session with a meeting on 18 December 2008.  
</p>
<p>54. On 18 December, the Working Group adopted the draft report on its sixth session 
ad referendum.  </p>
