<p><b>  Addendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Preliminary note on the situation of indigenous peoples in 
Australia 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of indigenous people conducted an official mission to Australia, at the invitation of the 
Government, from 17 to 28 August 2009. In the present preliminary report, he provides an 
overview of his initial observations following the conclusion of the visit. A full report on 
the situation of indigenous peoples in Australia, with conclusions and recommendations, 
will be provided by the Special Rapporteur at a later date. 
</p>
<p>2. During his 11-day visit, the Special Rapporteur met with government authorities, 
representatives of indigenous communities and organizations and others, in Canberra, 
South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South 
Wales. He visited a number of indigenous communities in both remote and urban areas, and 
collected information from several sources. The Special Rapporteur would like to express 
his appreciation for the support of the Government of Australia and the indigenous 
individuals and organizations that provided indispensible support in planning and 
coordinating the visit. He would also like to express his appreciation to the United Nations 
Information Centre. 
</p>
<p>3. The Government of Australia is to be commended for having taken significant steps 
to improve the human rights and socio-economic conditions of the Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples of Australia, as well as for its recent expression of support for the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and for its apology to the 
victims of the &#8220;stolen generation&#8221;. After several days in Australia listening and learning, 
however, the Special Rapporteur observed a need to develop new initiatives and reform 
existing ones &#8212; in consultation and in real partnership with indigenous peoples &#8212; in order 
</p>

reconciliation measures, such as the proposed recognition of the rights of Aboriginal and </footnote>0

<p><b>A/HRC/12/34/Add.<footnote name="1">5. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur echoes the statements he heard from 
indigenous leaders for the need for indigenous peoples themselves to continue to strengthen 
their own organizational and local governance capacity in order to meet the challenges 
faced by their communities and, in this connection, notes the importance of restoring or 
building strong and healthy relationships within families and communities.

</p>
<p>to conform with international standards requiring genuine respect for cultural integrity and 
self-determination. 
</p>
<p>4. During his time in Australia, the Special Rapporteur was impressed by the 
demonstrations of strong and vibrant indigenous cultures and was inspired by the strength, 
resilience and vision of indigenous communities determined to move towards a better 
future, despite having endured tremendous suffering at the hands of historical forces 
involving entrenched racism. It is clear that these historical forces continue to make their 
presence known today, manifesting themselves in serious disparities between indigenous 
and non-indigenous parts of society, including in terms of life expectancy, basic health, 
education, unemployment, incarceration, children placed under care and protection orders, 
as well as of access to basic services. 
</p>
<p>5. Given the above-mentioned disparities, the Government has developed and 
implemented a number of important initiatives in order to close the gap of indigenous 
disadvantage within a wide range of social and economic areas, with a stated emphasis on 
women and children; these programmes must continue to be improved and strengthened. 
The Special Rapporteur also stresses that he learned of numerous programmes in place by 
indigenous authorities and organizations, at the local, regional and national levels, that have 
been working effectively to address the many problems that their communities face. 
</p>
<p>6. Some aspects of the Government&#8217;s initiatives to remedy situations of indigenous 
disadvantage, however, raise concerns. Of particular concern is the Northern Territory 
Emergency Response which, by the Government&#8217;s own account, is an extraordinary 
measure, especially in its income management regime, imposition of compulsory leases and 
community-wide bans on alcohol consumption and pornography. These measures overtly 
discriminate against aboriginal peoples, infringe their right to self-determination and further 
stigmatize already stigmatized communities. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur stresses that affirmative measures by the Government to 
address the extreme disadvantage faced by indigenous peoples and issues of safety for 
children and women are not only justified, but indeed required under the international 
human rights obligations of Australia. However, any such measure must be devised and 
carried out with due regard for the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination and to 
be free from racial discrimination and indignity. 
</p>
<p>8. In this connection, any special measure that infringes on the basic rights of 
indigenous peoples must be narrowly tailored, proportional and necessary to achieve the 
legitimate objectives being pursued. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the Northern 
Territory Emergency Response does not meet these requirements. As currently configured 
and carried out, the Emergency Response is incompatible with the country&#8217;s obligations 
under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, treaties to 
which Australia is a party, as well as with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, for which Australia has affirmed its support. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that a process to reform the 
Emergency Response is currently under way and that the Government has initiated 
consultations with indigenous groups in the Northern Territory in this connection. He 
expresses the hope that amendments to the Emergency Response will diminish or remove 
its discriminatory aspects and adequately take into account the rights of aboriginal peoples 
to self-determination and culture integrity, in order to bring this Government initiative into 
line with the international obligations of Australia. The Special Rapporteur also urges the 
Government to act swiftly to reinstate the protections of the Racial Discrimination Act with 
regard to the indigenous peoples of the Northern Territory. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/34/Add.<footnote name="1">4. It is also necessary that the meaningful, direct participation of Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples is ensured in the design of programmes and policies at the national 
level, within a forum that is genuinely representative of the rights and interests of 
indigenous peoples. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative that is 
supported by the Government to move towards the development of a model for a new 
national indigenous representative body, and emphasizes that indigenous participation in 
the development of this body is fundamental.

<p>GE.09-16888 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>10. Beyond the matter of the Northern Territory Emergency Response, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that there is a need to incorporate into Government programmes a 
more holistic approach when addressing indigenous disadvantage across the country, one 
that is compatible with the objective of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People 
of securing for indigenous peoples not just social and economic well-being, but also the 
integrity of indigenous communities and cultures, and their self-determination. 
</p>
<p>11. The above-mentioned approach must involve a real partnership between the 
Government and the indigenous peoples of Australia, to move towards a future that is fully 
respectful of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to maintain their 
distinct cultural identities, languages and connections with traditional lands, and to be in 
control of their own destinies under conditions of equality. 
</p>
<p>12. Given what the Special Rapporteur has learned to date, it would seem that the 
objectives of the Closing the Gap campaign, the Emergency Response and other current 
initiatives and proposed efforts of the Government would be best achieved in partnership 
with indigenous peoples&#8217; own institutions and decision-making bodies, which are those that 
are most familiar with the local situations. It is worth stressing that, during his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur observed numerous successful indigenous programmes already in place 
to address issues of alcoholism, domestic violence, health, education and other areas of 
concern, in ways that are culturally appropriate and adapted to local needs, and that these 
efforts need to be included in and supported by the Government response, both logistically 
and financially. In particular, it is essential that funding for programmes that have already 
demonstrated achievements be continued. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur observed that, although there are a number of Government 
partnerships with local initiatives that appear to be succeeding, he also heard many 
accounts of situations in which Government programmes fail to take into account existing 
local programmes already in place, thereby hampering their ultimate success. In this 
connection, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about any initiative that duplicates or 
replaces the programmes of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders already in place, or that 
undermines local decision-making through indigenous peoples&#8217; own institutions. In 
addition, international human rights norms, including those contained in the Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous People, affirmatively guarantee the right of indigenous peoples to 
participate fully at all levels of decision-making in matters which may affect their rights, 
lives and destinies, as well as to maintain and develop their own decision-making 
institutions and programmes. Furthermore, adequate options and alternatives for socio-
economic development and violence-prevention programmes should be developed in full 
consultation with affected indigenous communities and organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/12/34/Add.<footnote name="1">8. Finally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the framing and evaluation of legislation, policies and 
actions that affect the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Declaration 
expresses the global consensus on the rights of indigenous peoples and corresponding State 
obligations on the basis of universal human rights. The Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government undertake a comprehensive review of all its legislation, policies and 
programmes affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the light of the Declaration. 
</footnote>0

</p>
<p>Torres Strait Islander peoples in a charter of rights, to be included in the Constitution. He is 
pleased that the Government has expressed its willingness in this regard, and urges it to 
provide a high priority to this initiative. As was stressed by the indigenous representatives 
with whom the Special Rapporteur met, constitutional recognition and protection of the 
rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would provide a measure of long-
term security for these rights, and be an important building block for reconciliation and a 
future of harmonious relations between indigenous and non-indigenous parts of Australian 
society. 
</p>
<p>17. Furthermore, it is important to note that securing the rights of indigenous peoples to 
their lands is of central importance to indigenous peoples&#8217; socio-economic development, 
self-determination and cultural integrity. Continued efforts to resolve, clarify and 
strengthen the protection of indigenous lands and resources should be made. In this regard, 
Government initiatives to address the housing needs of indigenous peoples should avoid 
imposing leasing or other arrangements that would undermine indigenous peoples&#8217; control 
over their lands. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to comply with the 
recommendations concerning indigenous lands and resources made by the treaty-
monitoring bodies of the United Nations, including the recommendation of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, to advance in discussions with Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islanders on possible amendments to the Native Title Act and find solutions 
acceptable to all.
