affect any Lender’s or the Borrower’s rights or obligations in respect of such Loans or affect the validity of such
transfer by any Lender of its Note.
Section 2.03                            Requests for Borrowings.  To request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone or by written Borrowing Request in substantially the form of Exhibit
B and signed by the Borrower (a “written Borrowing Request”):  (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
12:00 noon, New York, New York time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the
case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York, New York time, on the Business Day of the proposed
Borrowing; provided that no such notice shall be required for any deemed request of an ABR Borrowing to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.08(e).  Each telephonic and written Borrowing
Request shall be irrevocable and each telephonic Borrowing Request shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request.  Each such telephonic and written Borrowing
Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)                                     the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;
(ii)                                  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)                               whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
(iv)                              in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall
be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”;
(v)                                 the amount of the then effective Borrowing Base, the current total Credit Exposures (without
regard to the requested Borrowing) and the pro forma total Credit Exposures (giving effect to the requested Borrowing);
and
(vi)                              the location and number of the Borrower’s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall
comply with the requirements of Section 2.05.
If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no
Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.  Each Borrowing Request shall constitute a representation
that the amount of the requested Borrowing shall not result in a Borrowing Base Deficiency.  Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent
29
shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.
Section 2.04                            Interest Elections.
(a)                                 Conversion and Continuance.  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the
applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as
specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different
Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all
as provided in this Section 2.04.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the
affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)                                 Interest Election Requests.  To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.04, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone or by a written Interest Election Request in substantially
the form of Exhibit C and signed by the Borrower (a “written Interest Election Request”) by the time that a Borrowing
Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from
such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each telephonic and written Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and each telephonic Interest Election Request shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent.
(c)                                  Information in Interest Election Requests.  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)                                     the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being
elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in
which case the information to be specified pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(iii) and (iv) shall be specified for each resulting
Borrowing);
(ii)                                  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be
a Business Day;
(iii)                               whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv)                              if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then
the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
30
(d)                                 Notice to Lenders by the Administrative Agent.  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of
each resulting Borrowing.
(e)                                  Effect of Failure to Deliver Timely Interest Election Request and Events of Default on Interest
Election.  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior
to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the
end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing:  (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be
converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing (and any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion
of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective) and (ii) unless
repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.
Section 2.05                            Funding of Borrowings.
(a)                                 Funding by Lenders.  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., New York, New York time, to the
account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received,
in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York, New York and
designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Loans made to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.08(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Issuing Bank that made such LC Disbursement.
(b)                                 Presumption of Funding by the Lenders.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the time such Lender is required to fund its share of a Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) above and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to
ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.
31
Section 2.06                            Changes in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.
(a)                                 Scheduled Termination of Commitments.  Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall
terminate on the Maturity Date.  If at any time the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts or the Borrowing Base is
terminated or reduced to zero, then the Commitments shall terminate on the effective date of such termination or
reduction.
(b)                           Optional Termination and Reduction of Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.
(i)                                     The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Aggregate Maximum
Credit Amounts; provided that (A) each reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be in an amount
that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (B) the Borrower shall not terminate or
reduce the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in
accordance with Section 3.04(c), a Borrowing Base Deficiency would exist.
(ii)                                  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts under Section 2.06(b)(i) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date
of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of
any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be irrevocable.  Any termination or reduction of the Aggregate
Maximum Credit Amounts shall be permanent and may not be reinstated.  Each reduction of the Aggregate Maximum
Credit Amounts shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with each Lender’s Applicable Percentage.
Section 2.07                            Borrowing Base.
(a)                                 Borrowing Base.  On the Effective Date, the Borrowing Base shall be equal to $50,000,000.  The
Borrowing Base shall be automatically reduced as follows:
(i)                                     upon the incurrence after the Effective Date of any additional Debt under the Second Lien Term
Loan Agreement, by $0.25 for each $1.00 of the aggregate principal amount of such additional Debt; and
(ii)                                  during any Subject Borrowing Base Period, in the event the calculation of Adjusted Consolidated
Net Tangible Assets, as shown on the certificate delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.01(i), results in the
sum of the Borrowing Base plus the aggregate principal amount of Secured Debt outstanding on the date of such
certificate (other than the aggregate Credit Exposure) exceeding the greater of (A) the sum of $50,000,000 and the
aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Term Loans repaid or prepaid as of such date of determination and (B) an
amount equal to 25% of such Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets, by the amount of such excess.
32
In addition, the Borrowing Base may be subject to further adjustments from time to time pursuant to Section 8.13(c) or
Section 9.11.
(b)                           Scheduled and Interim Redeterminations.
(i)                                     The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined semi-annually on or around November 1st and May
1st in accordance with this Section 2.07 (a “Scheduled Redetermination”) with the first Scheduled Redetermination to
take place May 1, 2015, and, subject to Section 2.07(d), such redetermined Borrowing Base shall become effective
and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders on or around November
1st and May 1st of each year.
(ii)                                  The Administrative Agent may or shall, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, by notifying the
Borrower thereof, one time during any six-month period, elect to cause the Borrowing Base to be redetermined
between Scheduled Redeterminations in accordance with this Section 2.07.
(iii)                               The Borrower may elect to redetermine the Borrowing Base, by notifying the Administrative Agent
thereof, one time during any six-month period, that it elects to cause the Borrowing Base to be redetermined between
Scheduled Redeterminations in accordance with this Section 2.07.
(c)                            Scheduled and Interim Redetermination Procedure.
(i)                                     Each Scheduled Redetermination and each Interim Redetermination shall be effectuated as
follows:  upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of (A) the Reserve Report and the certificate required to be
delivered by the Borrower, in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c), and, in
the case of an Interim Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.12(b) and (c), and (B) such other reports, data and
supplemental information, including, without limitation, the information provided pursuant to Section 8.12(d), as may,
from time to time, be reasonably requested by the Majority Lenders (the Reserve Report, such certificate and such
other reports, data and supplemental information being the “Engineering Reports”), the Administrative Agent shall
evaluate the information contained in the Engineering Reports and shall, in good faith, propose a new Borrowing Base
(such amount being the “Proposed Borrowing Base”) based upon such information and such other information
(including, without limitation, the status of title information with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties as described in
the Engineering Reports and the existence of any other Debt) as the Administrative Agent deems appropriate in its
sole discretion and consistent with its normal oil and gas lending criteria as it exists at the particular time.  In no event
shall the Proposed Borrowing Base exceed the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.
(ii)                                  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Proposed Borrowing
Base (the “Proposed Borrowing Base Notice”):
(A)                               in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination (1) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the
Engineering Reports and other information required to be
33
delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on or before
October 15th and April 15th of such year following the date of delivery or (2) if the Administrative Agent shall not have
received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a
timely and complete manner, then promptly after the Administrative Agent has received complete Engineering Reports
and other information from the Borrower and has had a reasonable opportunity to determine the Proposed Borrowing
Base in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i), and in any event, within 15 days after the Administrative Agent has
received the required Engineering Reports; and
(B)                               in the case of an Interim Redetermination, promptly, and in any event, within 15 days after the
Administrative Agent has received the required Engineering Reports.
(iii)                               Any Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect must be
approved or deemed to have been approved by all of the Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii) and any
Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or be
deemed to have been approved by the Supermajority Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii).  Upon receipt of
the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice, each Lender shall have 15 days to agree with the Proposed Borrowing Base or
disagree with the Proposed Borrowing Base by proposing an alternate Borrowing Base.  If, at the end of such 15 days,
any Lender has not communicated its approval or disapproval in writing to the Administrative Agent, such silence
shall be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed Borrowing Base.  If, at the end of such 15-day period, all of the
Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, or the
Supermajority Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing
Base then in effect, have approved or been deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Proposed Borrowing
Base shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d).  If, however, at the
end of such 15-day period, all of the Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders, as applicable, have not approved or been
deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Administrative Agent shall (A) notify the Borrower of the Proposed
Borrowing Base and which Lenders have not approved or been deemed to have approved the Proposed Borrowing
Base and (B) poll the Lenders to ascertain the highest Borrowing Base then acceptable to a number of Lenders
sufficient to constitute the Supermajority Lenders for purposes of this Section 2.07 and, so long as such amount does
not increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the
date specified in Section 2.07(d).
(d)                                 Effectiveness of a Redetermined Borrowing Base.  After a redetermined Borrowing Base is
approved or is deemed to have been approved by all of the Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(iii), the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the amount of
the redetermined Borrowing Base (the “New Borrowing Base Notice”), and such amount (or amounts, as applicable)
shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders:
34
(i)                                     in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (A) if the Administrative Agent shall have received
the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and
complete manner, then on the November 1st or May 1st, as applicable, following such New Borrowing Base Notice, or
(B) if the Administrative Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on the Business Day next
succeeding delivery of such New Borrowing Base Notice; and
(ii)                                  in the case of an Interim Redetermination, on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such
New Borrowing Base Notice.
Such amount shall then become the Borrowing Base until the next Scheduled Redetermination Date, the next Interim
Redetermination Date or the next adjustment to the Borrowing Base under Section 8.13(c) or Section 9.11, whichever
occurs first.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Scheduled Redetermination or Interim Redetermination shall become
effective until the New Borrowing Base Notice related thereto is received by the Borrower.
(e)                                  Reductions of Borrowing Base Related to Swap Agreements.  If any Swap Agreement to which
the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party is Liquidated and which was used by the Lenders to establish the Borrowing
Base, and the total termination value payable by the Borrower in respect of all such Liquidated Swap Agreements in
any period between any two Scheduled Redetermination Dates exceeds five percent (5%) of the then effective
Borrowing Base, then, contemporaneously therewith, the Borrowing Base then in effect shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the value, if any, assigned to the Liquidated portion of all such Swap Agreements so terminated during such
period, as determined by the Supermajority Lenders.
Section 2.08                            Letters of Credit.
(a)                                 General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the
Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit in dollars for its own account or for the account of any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from
time to time during the Availability Period.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.
(b)                                 Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.  To request the
issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have
been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (not less than three (3)
Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice: (i)
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit or identifying the outstanding Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank
to be amended, renewed or extended; (ii) specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which
shall be a Business Day); (iii) specifying the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
Section 2.08(c)); (iv)
35
specifying the amount of such Letter of Credit; (v) specifying the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and
such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit; and (vi)
specifying the amount of the then effective Borrowing Base (without regard to the requested Letter of Credit or the
requested amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit) and the pro forma total Credit
Exposures (giving effect to the requested Letter of Credit or the requested amendment, renewal or extension of an
outstanding Letter of Credit).  If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall submit a letter of credit application
on the Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit shall be
issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and with respect to each notice provided by the Borrower above and
any issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be deemed to represent
and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (A) the LC Exposure shall
not exceed the LC Commitment and (B) no Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist.
(c)                                  Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the
earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the
Maturity Date; provided, however, that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof
for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above).
(d)                                 Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to an existing Letter of
Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank that issues such
Letter of Credit or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit hereunder hereby grants to each
Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit hereunder, such Lender’s
Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on
the date due as provided in Section 2.08(e), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower
for any reason.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this
Section 2.08(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be
made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e)                                  Reimbursement.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of
Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the
Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York, New York time,
on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement
prior to 10:00 a.m., New York, New York time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the
36
Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York, New York time, on (i) the
Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York, New
York time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives
such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that if such LC
Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, the Borrower shall, subject to the conditions to Borrowing set forth herein,
be deemed to have requested, and the Borrower does hereby request under such circumstances, that such payment
be financed with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation
to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to
make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement,
the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. 
Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage
of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans
made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit the amounts so
received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(e), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank
that issued such Letter of Credit or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this Section 2.08(e)
to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any
payment made by a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement
(other than the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the
Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)                                   Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in
Section 2.08(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision
therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in
any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank
under a Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank against presentation of a draft or other document that does not
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit Agreement, or (iv) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section 2.08(f), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s
obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related
Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any
Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances
referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of
any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to
make a drawing thereunder), any error in
37
interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the
extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived
by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing
Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised all requisite care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which
appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank that issued
such Letter of Credit may, in its sole reasonable discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to
accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of
such Letter of Credit.
(g)                                  Disbursement Procedures.  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof,
examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement
thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h)                                 Interim Interest.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, until the Borrower
shall have reimbursed the Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement (either with its own funds or a Borrowing under
Section 2.08(e)), the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per
annum then applicable to ABR Loans.  Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 2.08(h) shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section
2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i)                                     Replacement of the Issuing Bank.  The Issuing Bank may be replaced or resign at any time by
written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, such resigning or replaced Issuing Bank and, in the
case of a replacement, the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
resignation or replacement of the Issuing Bank.  At the time any such resignation or replacement shall become
effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the resigning or replaced Issuing Bank
pursuant to Section 3.05(b).  In the case of the replacement of the Issuing Bank, from and after the effective date of
such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing
Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the
term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such
successor and all
38
previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the resignation or replacement of the Issuing Bank
hereunder, the resigning or replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such
resignation or replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(j)                                    Cash Collateralization.  If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Borrower
receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders demanding the deposit of Cash Collateral
pursuant to this Section 2.08(j), or (ii) the Borrower is required to pay to the Administrative Agent the excess
attributable to any LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c), then the Borrower
shall deposit, in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit
of the Lenders, Cash Collateral in an amount equal to, in the case of an Event of Default, the LC Exposure, and in the
case of a payment required by Section 3.04(c), the amount of such excess as provided in Section 3.04(c), as of such
date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such Cash Collateral shall
become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other
notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary described in Section 10.01(h) or Section 10.01(i).  The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, an exclusive first priority and continuing perfected security
interest in and Lien on such account and all cash, checks, drafts, certificates and instruments, if any, from time to
time deposited or held in such account, all deposits or wire transfers made thereto, any and all investments
purchased with funds deposited in such account, all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial assets and other
Property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise payable in respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of the
foregoing, and all proceeds, products, accessions, rents, profits, income and benefits therefrom, and any
substitutions and replacements therefor.  The Borrower’s obligation to deposit amounts pursuant to this Section 2.08(j)
shall be absolute and unconditional, without regard to whether any beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit has
attempted to draw down all or a portion of such amount under the terms of a Letter of Credit, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, shall not be subject to any defense or be affected by a right of set-off, counterclaim or
recoupment which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may now or hereafter have against any such beneficiary, the
Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person for any reason whatsoever.  Such deposit
shall be held as collateral securing the payment and performance of the Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents in a “securities account” (within the meaning of Article 8 of the UCC) over which the
Administrative Agent shall have “control” (within the meaning of the UCC).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Borrower may direct the Administrative Agent and the “securities intermediary” (within the meaning of the UCC) to
invest amounts credited to the securities account, at the Borrower’s risk and expense, in Investments described in
Section 9.05(c) through (f).  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. 
Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse, on a pro rata basis, the Issuing
Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for
the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other
39
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  If the Borrower is required to provide
an amount of Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, and the Borrower is not
otherwise required to pay to the Administrative Agent the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with
any prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c), then such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be
returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
(k)                                 Existing Letters of Credit.  The Existing Letters of Credit shall be Letters of Credit hereunder for all
purposes.
Payments of Principal and Interest; Prepayments; Fees
ARTICLE III
Section 3.01                            Repayment of Loans.  The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the
Termination Date.
Section 3.02                            Interest.
(a)                                 ABR Loans.  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base
Rate plus the Applicable Margin, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(b)                                 Eurodollar Loans.  The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin, but in no event to
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(c)                                  Post-Default Rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or
any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document is not paid when due,
whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as
before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in
Section 3.02(a), but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(d)                                 Interest Payment Dates.  Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and on the Termination Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to
Section 3.02(c) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than
an optional prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the Termination Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid
or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, and (iii) in the event of any conversion of
any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be
payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(e)                                  Interest Rate Computations.  All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, unless such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which
40
case interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), except that interest
computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate
Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and be binding upon the parties hereto.
Section 3.03                            Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a
Eurodollar Borrowing:
(a)                                 the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for
such Interest Period; or
(b)                                 the Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO
Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making
or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as
promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the
conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and
(ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
Section 3.04                            Prepayments.
(a)                                 Optional Prepayments.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to
prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 3.04(b).
(b)                                 Notice and Terms of Optional Prepayment.  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York, New York time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment,
or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York, New York time, on the
Business Day of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the
principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice
relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial
prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing
of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to
41
the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent
required by Section 3.02.
(c)                                  Mandatory Prepayments.
(i)                                     If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts
pursuant to Section 2.06(b) or to any reduction of the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.07(e), a Borrowing Base
Deficiency exists, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the applicable Borrowings on the date of such termination or
reduction in an aggregate principal amount equal to such deficiency, and (B) if such Borrowing Base Deficiency
remains after prepaying all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf
of the Lenders an amount equal to such deficiency to be held as Cash Collateral as provided in Section 2.08(j).
(ii)                                  Upon any redetermination of or adjustment to the amount of the Borrowing Base in accordance
with Section 2.07 (other than Section 2.07(e)) or Section 8.13(c), if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists after giving
effect to such redetermination or adjustment, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings in an aggregate
principal amount equal to such deficiency, and (B) if such Borrowing Base Deficiency remains after prepaying all of
the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders an amount
equal to such deficiency to be held as Cash Collateral as provided in Section 2.08(j).  The Borrower shall be obligated
to pay all of such prepayment and/or deposit of Cash Collateral amount within 45 days following its receipt of the New
Borrowing Base Notice in accordance with Section 2.07(d) or the date the adjustment occurs; provided that all
payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.04(c)(ii) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date.
(iii)                               Upon any adjustments to the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 9.11, if a Borrowing Base
Deficiency exists after giving effect to such adjustment, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings in an
aggregate principal amount equal to such deficiency, and (B) if a Borrowing Base Deficiency remains after prepaying
all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders an
amount equal to such deficiency to be held as cash collateral as provided in Section 2.08(j).  The Borrower shall be
obligated to make such prepayment and/or deposit of Cash Collateral on the date it receives cash proceeds as a
result of such disposition or such incurrence of Debt; provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to this
Section 3.04(c)(iii) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date.
(iv)                              Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied to outstanding
Borrowings as directed by the Borrower or, if no such direction is given, first, ratably to any ABR Borrowings then
outstanding, and, second, to any Eurodollar Borrowings then outstanding, and if more than one Eurodollar Borrowing is
then outstanding, to each such Eurodollar Borrowing in order of priority beginning with the Eurodollar Borrowing with
the least number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable thereto and ending with the Eurodollar Borrowing
with the most number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable thereto.
42
(v)                                 Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied ratably to the
Loans included in the prepaid Borrowings.  Prepayments pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be accompanied by
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 3.02.
(d)                                 No Premium or Penalty.  Prepayments permitted or required under this Section 3.04 shall be
without premium or penalty, except as required under Section 5.02.
Section 3.05                            Fees.
(a)                                 Commitment Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily
amount of the unused Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the Termination Date.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March,
June, September and December of each year and on the Termination Date, commencing on the first such date to
occur after the Effective Date.  All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless
such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case such fees shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).
(b)                                 Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same
Applicable Margin used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans on the average daily amount of
such Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the
period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s
Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, (ii) to the Issuing
Bank, for its own account, a fronting fee, of 0.375% face amount of each Letter of Credit upon its issuance, provided
that in no event shall such fee be less than $500, and (iii) to the Issuing Bank, for its own account, its standard and
customary fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit issued by the
Issuing Bank or processing of drawings thereunder.  Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including
the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day
following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date and fronting fees with
respect to any Letter of Credit shall be payable at the time of issuance of such Letter of Credit; provided that all such
fees shall be payable on the Termination Date and any such fees accruing after the Termination Date shall be payable
on demand.  Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 3.05(b) shall be payable within 10
days after demand.  All participation fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless such
computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day).
43
(c)                                  Administrative Agent Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter, or otherwise separately agreed
upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
(d)                                 Borrowing Base Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
each Lender then party to this Agreement, ratably in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a Borrowing Base
increase fee equal to an amount to be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower at the time of any
increase of the Borrowing Base on the amount of such increase over the highest Borrowing Base previously in effect,
payable on the effective date of any such increase to the Borrowing Base.
Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
ARTICLE IV
Section 4.01                            Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a)                                 Payments by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under
Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York, New York time, on the date
when due, in dollars that constitute immediately available funds, without defense, deduction, recoupment, set-off or
counterclaim.  Fees, once paid, shall not be refundable under any circumstances absent manifest error (e.g., as a
result of a clerical mistake).  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices located at 3
Times Square, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10036, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section
12.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such
payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt
thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon
shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b)                                 Application of Insufficient Payments.  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest
and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to
such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.
44
(c)                                  Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or
participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate
amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received
by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that
the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of
principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if
any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower
pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements
to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the
provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it
may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Section 4.02                            Presumption of Payment by the Borrower.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such
event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed
to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective
Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation.
Section 4.03                            Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent.  If any Lender shall fail to make any
payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(a), 2.08(d) or (e), 4.02 or 12.03(c), then the Administrative
Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or
the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are
fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any
future funding obligations of such Lender under such
45
Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its
discretion.
Section 4.04                            Disposition of Proceeds.  The Security Instruments contain an assignment by the
Borrower to and in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the other Persons named
therein of all of the Borrower’s interest in and to production and all proceeds attributable thereto that may be produced
from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property.  The Security Instruments further provide in general for the application of
such proceeds to the satisfaction of the Obligations and other obligations described therein and secured thereby. 
Notwithstanding the assignment contained in such Security Instruments, until the occurrence of an Event of Default,
(a) the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such
production nor take any other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders, but the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries
and (b) the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to take such actions as may be necessary to cause
such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and/or such Restricted Subsidiaries.
Increased Costs; Break Funding Payments; Taxes; Illegality; Defaulting Lenders
ARTICLE V
Section 5.01                            Increased Costs.
(a)                           Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:
(i)                                     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance
charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated
in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank;
(ii)                                  subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in
clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of “Excluded Taxes” and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loan, loan
principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto; or
(iii)                               impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition,
cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making,
converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, increase the
cost to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintain any Letter of
Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue and Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any
sum received or receivable by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise), then upon the request of such Lender, the Issuing Bank or
46
other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may
be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)                                 Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law
affecting such Lender or the Issuing Bank or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s
holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or
participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level
below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s policies and the
policies of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to
time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding
company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)                                  Certificates.  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
in Section 5.01(a) or (b) and reasonably detailed calculations therefor shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the
amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d)                                 Effect of Failure or Delay in Requesting Compensation.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender
or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 5.01 for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower
of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.
Section 5.02                            Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any
Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in
any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.04(b), then, in any
such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the
47
loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to
any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at
the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to
the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for
the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue
on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the
Eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 5.02 and reasonably detailed calculations therefor shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Section 5.03                            Taxes.
(a)                                 Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Section 5.03, the term “Lender” includes the Issuing Bank
and the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
(b)                                 Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan
Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by
applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent)
requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable
Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an
Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after
such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(c)                                  Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely
reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(d)                                 Indemnification by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each
Recipient, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including
Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid or payable by
such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own
behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
48
(e)                                  Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent,
within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent
that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with
the provisions of Section 12.04(c)(iii) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded
Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection
with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the
amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at
any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the
Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
(f)                                   Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to
a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 5.03, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.
(g)                                  Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed
by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information
reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.03(g)(ii)(A),
(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or
submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the
legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A)                               any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that
such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;
49
(B)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-
8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax
pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any
Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of,
U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(2)                                 executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign
Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the
Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN
or W-8BEN-E (as applicable); or
(4)                                 to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY,
accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents
from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct
or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may
provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and
indirect partner;
(C)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law
as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with
such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the
50
Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)                               if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of
FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such
Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for
purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this
Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate
in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(h)                                 On or before the date that BMO (or any successor or replacement Administrative Agent) becomes
the Administrative Agent hereunder, it shall deliver to the Borrower properly and completed executed originals of either
(i) IRS Form W-9, or (ii) such other documentation as will establish that the Borrower can make payments to the
Administrative Agent without deduction or withholding of any Taxes imposed by the United States.
(i)                                     Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.03 (including by the
payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.03), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal
to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 5.03 with respect to the Taxes
giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such
indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid
over pursuant to this paragraph (i) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (i), in no event will the indemnified
party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (i) the payment of which
would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have
been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or
otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been
paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to
51
make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
indemnifying party or any other Person
(j)                                    FATCA Grandfathering.  For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA,
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent to treat) this Agreement and any Advance as not qualifying as a “grandfathered obligation” within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).
(k)                                 Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 5.03 shall survive the resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the
termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan
Document.
Section 5.04                            Mitigation Obligations.
(a)                                 Designation of Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.01,
or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of
its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03, as the case may be, in the future and
(ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous
to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)                                 Replacement of Lenders.  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.01, (ii) the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) any Lender has not approved (or
is not deemed to have approved) an increase in the Borrowing Base proposed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 2.07(c)(iii), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, (A) require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04(b)), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment) or (B) require such Lender to be removed as a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents with a corresponding reduction in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount equal to the Maximum Credit
Amount of such Lender; provided that, (1) in the case of a required assignment of interest, the Borrower shall have
received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (2)
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it
hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and
52
(3) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.01 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 5.03, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of
a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and
delegation cease to apply.
Section 5.05                            Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it
becomes unlawful for any Lender or its applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans either generally or having a particular Interest Period hereunder, then (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof and such Lender’s obligation to make such Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended (the “Affected Loans”) until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain such Eurodollar
Loans and (b) all Affected Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender shall be made instead as ABR
Loans (and, if such Lender so requests by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, all Affected Loans of
such Lender then outstanding shall be automatically converted into ABR Loans on the date specified by such Lender
in such notice) and, to the extent that Affected Loans are so made as (or converted into) ABR Loans, all payments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to such Lender’s Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its ABR Loans.
Section 5.06                            Cash Collateral.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one
Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Bank’s Fronting Exposure with respect to
such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 5.07(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such
Defaulting Lender) in an amount equal to the Fronting Exposure as of such date.
(a)                                 Grant of Security Interest.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender,
such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank, and agrees to
maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders’ obligation to
fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below.  If at any time the
Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less
than the Fronting Exposure as of such date, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent,
pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such
deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
(b)                                 Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash
Collateral provided under this Section 5.06 or Section 5.07 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the
satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit (including, as to
Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral
was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
53
(c)                                  Termination of Requirement.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to
reduce the Issuing Bank’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this
Section 5.06 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting
Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank that
there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 5.07, the Person providing Cash Collateral and
the Issuing Bank may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other
obligations; and provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower, such Cash
Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.
Section 5.07                            Defaulting Lenders.
(a)                           Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting
Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
(i)                                     Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of
Majority Lenders and Supermajority Lenders and in the last sentence of Section 12.02(b).
(ii)                                  Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received
by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity,
pursuant to ARTICLE X or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 12.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second,
to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank hereunder;
third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Bank’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in
accordance with Section 5.06; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists),
to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required
by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s
potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuing
Bank’s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued
under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 5.06; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the
Issuing Bank against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to
the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such
Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations
54
under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Disbursements
in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made
or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 were satisfied or
waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting
Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to, such
Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in LC Disbursements are held
by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to Section 5.07(a)(iv).  Any
payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay
amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.07 shall be deemed paid to
and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(iii)                               Certain Fees.
(A)                               No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee payable under Section
3.05(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay
any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
(B)                               Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive participation fees pursuant to Section 3.05(b) for
any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of
the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 5.06.
(C)                               With respect to any participation fees not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (B) above, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise
payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Disbursements that has
been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (2) pay to the Issuing Bank the amount
of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the Issuing Bank’s Fronting
Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
(iv)                              Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting
Lender’s participation in LC Disbursements shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only
to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to
exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Credit Commitment.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or
release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a
Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s
increased exposure following such reallocation.
55
(v)                                 Cash Collateral.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be
effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash
Collateralize the Issuing Bank’s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.06.
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank agree in
writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto,
whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may
include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par
that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held
pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 5.07(a)(iv)), whereupon
such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect
to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder
from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from
that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
(c)                                  New Letters of Credit.  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank shall not
be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting
Exposure after giving effect thereto.

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite
power and authority, and has all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals necessary,
to own its assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, and is qualified to do business in, and is in good
standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where failure to have such power, authority,
licenses, authorizations, consents, approvals and qualifications could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
Section 7.02                            Authority; Enforceability.  The Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are
within such Loan Party’s corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate, limited liability company or partnership and, if required, stockholder action
(including, without limitation, any action required to be taken by any class of directors of such Loan Party or any other
Person, whether interested or disinterested, in order to ensure the due authorization of the Transactions).  Each Loan
Document to which any Loan Party is a party has been duly executed and delivered by such Loan Party and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and
subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
Section 7.03                            Approvals; No Conflicts.  The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of,
registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority or any other third Person (including
shareholders or any class of directors, whether interested or disinterested, of any Loan Party or any other Person), nor
is any such consent, approval, registration, filing or other action necessary for the validity or enforceability of any
Loan Document or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, except such as have been obtained
or made and are in full force and effect other than (i) the recording and filing of the Security Instruments as required by
this Agreement and (ii) those third party approvals or consents which, if not made or obtained, would not cause a
Default hereunder, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or do not have an adverse
effect on the enforceability of the Loan Documents, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter,
by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument
binding upon the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or its Properties, or give rise to a right thereunder to require
any payment to be made by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary and (d) will not result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any Property of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Liens created by
the Loan Documents and the Second Lien Term Loan Documents).
60
Section 7.04                            Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.

statement of income, stockholders equity and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, all
reported on by a firm of independent public accountants acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  Such audited
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash
flows of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with
GAAP.
(b)                                 Since December 31, 2013, (i) there has been no event, development or circumstance that has had
or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) the business of the Borrower and its
Restricted Subsidiaries has been conducted only in the ordinary course consistent with past business practices.
(c)                                  Except for the Obligations, the Second Lien Term Loans, and as set forth on Schedule 9.02,
neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary has on the Effective Date any material Debt (including Disqualified
Capital Stock) or any material contingent liabilities, off-balance sheet liabilities or partnerships, material liabilities for
taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable
commitments.
Section 7.05                            Litigation.

investigations or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the

expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve any Loan Document
or the Transactions.
(b)                                 Since the Effective Date, there has been no change in the status of the matters disclosed in

Material Adverse Effect.
Section 7.06                            Environmental Matters.  Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material

threatened action, suit, investigation, inquiry
61

Laws;
(c)                                  all notices, permits, licenses, exemptions, approvals or similar authorizations, if any, required to

and each Subsidiary are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such notices, permits, licenses and similar

has been no threatened release of any oil, hazardous substances, solid waste or oil and gas waste on or to any
Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary except in compliance with Environmental Laws and so as not to pose an
imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment;
(f)                                   to the extent applicable, all Property of the Borrower and each Subsidiary currently satisfies all
design, operation, and equipment requirements imposed by the OPA, and the Borrower does not have any reason to
believe that such Property, to the extent subject to the OPA, will not be able to maintain compliance with the OPA
requirements during the term of this Agreement; and
(g)                                  neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any known contingent liability or Remedial Work in
connection with any release or threatened release of any oil, hazardous substance, solid waste or oil and gas waste
into the environment.

default or would require the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary to Redeem or make any offer to Redeem under any
indenture, note, credit agreement or instrument pursuant to which any Material Debt is outstanding or by which the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their Properties is bound; and
(c)                                  no Default has occurred and is continuing.

accordance with GAAP or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of Taxes and other governmental charges are, in the reasonable opinion of the Borrower,
adequate.  No Lien relating to Taxes described in the first sentence of this Section 7.09 has been filed and, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, no claim is being asserted with respect to any such Tax or other such governmental
charge.
Section 7.10                            ERISA.  No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when
taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  The present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under
each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did
not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $250,000
the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all
underfunded Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than
$250,000 the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.
Section 7.11                            Disclosure; No Material Misstatements.  The Borrower has disclosed to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  To the knowledge of Borrower, taken as a whole,
none of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any of their Affiliates in connection
with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan
Document (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact
or omits to state any
63
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, prospect information, geological
and geophysical data and engineering projections, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in
good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.  To the knowledge of Borrower there is no
fact peculiar to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or in the future is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect and which has not been set forth
in this Agreement or the Loan Documents or the other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary prior to, or on, the
Effective Date in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.  There are no statements or conclusions
known to the Borrower in any Reserve Report which are based upon or include misleading information or fail to take
into account material information regarding the matters reported therein, it being understood that projections
concerning volumes attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties and production and cost estimates contained in each
Reserve Report are necessarily based upon professional opinions, estimates and projections and that the Borrower
and the Subsidiaries do not warrant that such opinions, estimates and projections will ultimately prove to have been
accurate.
Section 7.12                            Insurance.  The Borrower has, and has caused all its Restricted Subsidiaries to have, (a)
all insurance policies sufficient for the compliance by each of them with all material Governmental Requirements and
all material agreements and (b) insurance coverage in at least amounts and against such risk (including, without
limitation, public liability) that are usually insured against by companies similarly situated and engaged in the same or
a similar business for the assets and operations of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries.  The Administrative
Agent and the Lenders have been named as additional insureds in respect of such liability insurance policies and the
Administrative Agent has been named as loss payee with respect to Property loss insurance.
Section 7.13                            Labor Matters.  As of the Effective Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns
against the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened that are
reasonably likely to impact the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries material operations (taken as a whole).  The
hours worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries have not been in
violation in any material respect of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other material Federal, state, local or foreign
law dealing with such matters.  All material payments due from the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, or for which
any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health
and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or
such Restricted Subsidiary.  The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or
right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary is bound.
Section 7.14                            Subsidiaries.  Schedule 7.14 sets forth the name of, and the ownership interest of the
Borrower in, each Subsidiary of the Borrower (as such Schedule may be updated from time to time, including pursuant
to a notice delivered in accordance with Section 8.01(l)).
64
As of the Effective Date there are no Unrestricted Subsidiaries other than the Subsidiaries set forth on Schedule 1.01.
Section 7.15                            Location of Business and Offices.  The Borrower’s jurisdiction of organization is
Delaware; the name of the Borrower as listed in the public records of Delaware is Magnum Hunter Resources
Corporation; and the organizational identification number of the Borrower in Delaware is 2758331 (or, in each case, as
set forth in a notice delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.01(l) in accordance with
Section 12.01).  Each Subsidiary’s jurisdiction of organization, name as listed in the public records of its jurisdiction of
organization and organizational identification number in its jurisdiction of organization is stated on Schedule 7.14 (as
such Schedule may be updated from time to time, including pursuant to a notice delivered in accordance with Section
8.01(l)).
Section 7.16                            Properties; Titles, Etc.
(a)                                 Except as disclosed in Schedule 7.16, each of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries has
good and defensible title to the proved Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the most recently delivered Reserve
Report (excluding, to the extent this representation and warranty is deemed to be made after the Effective Date, any
such Oil and Gas Properties sold or transferred in compliance with Section 9.11) and good title to all its personal
Properties, in each case, free and clear of all Liens except Liens permitted by Section 9.03.  After giving full effect to
the Excepted Liens, the Borrower or the Restricted Subsidiary specified as the owner owns the net interests in
production attributable to the Hydrocarbon Interests as reflected in the most recently delivered Reserve Report, and
the ownership of such Properties shall not in any material respect obligate the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary
to bear the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of each such Property in an
amount in excess of the working interest of each Property set forth in the most recently delivered Reserve Report that
is not offset by a corresponding proportionate increase in the Borrower’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s net revenue
interest in such Property.
(b)                                 All material leases and agreements necessary for the conduct of the business of the Borrower and
the Restricted Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting, in full force and effect, and there exists no default or event or
circumstance which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would give rise to a default under any
such lease or leases, which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(c)                                  The rights and Properties presently owned, leased or licensed by the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries including, without limitation, all easements and rights of way, include all rights and Properties necessary
to permit the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct their business in all material respects in the same
manner as its business has been conducted prior to the Effective Date.
(d)                                 All of the material Properties of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries which are reasonably
necessary for the operation of their businesses are in good working condition and are maintained in accordance with
prudent business standards.
65
(e)                                  The Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks,
tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual Property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
Borrower and such Subsidiary does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such
infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  The Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries either own or have valid licenses or other rights to use all
databases, geological data, geophysical data, engineering data, seismic data, maps, interpretations and other
technical information used in their businesses as presently conducted, subject to the limitations contained in the
agreements governing the use of the same, which limitations are customary for companies engaged in the business
of the exploration and production of Hydrocarbons, with such exceptions as could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 7.17                            Maintenance of Properties.  Except for such acts or failures to act as could not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Oil and Gas Properties (and Properties unitized therewith)
have been maintained, operated and developed in a good and workmanlike manner and in conformity with all
Government Requirements and in conformity with the provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts
comprising a part of the Hydrocarbon Interests and other contracts and agreements forming a part of the Oil and Gas
Properties.  Specifically in connection with the foregoing, except for those as could not be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) no Oil and Gas Property is subject to having allowable production reduced below
the full and regular allowable (including the maximum permissible tolerance) because of any overproduction (whether
or not the same was permissible at the time) and (ii) to the knowledge of Borrower, none of the wells comprising a part
of the Oil and Gas Properties (or Properties unitized therewith) is deviated from the vertical more than the maximum
permitted by Government Requirements, and such wells are, in fact, bottomed under and are producing from, and the
well bores are wholly within, the Oil and Gas Properties (or in the case of wells located on Properties unitized
therewith, such unitized Properties).  All pipelines, wells, gas processing plants, platforms and other material
improvements, fixtures and equipment owned in whole or in part by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that are necessary to conduct normal operations are being maintained in a state adequate to conduct normal
operations, and with respect to such of the foregoing that are operated by the Borrower or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, in a manner consistent with the Borrower’s or its Restricted Subsidiaries’ past practices (other than
those the failure of which to maintain in accordance with this Section 7.17 could not reasonably be expect to have a
Material Adverse Effect).
Section 7.18                            Gas Imbalances, Prepayments.  As of the Effective Date, except as set forth on
Schedule 7.18 or on the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.12(d), on a net basis there are no gas
imbalances, take or pay or other prepayments which would require the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to deliver Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties at some future time without then or thereafter
receiving full payment therefor exceeding 500 mmcf equivalent in the aggregate.
Section 7.19                            Marketing of Production.  Except for contracts listed and in effect on the Effective Date
on Schedule 7.19, and thereafter either disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent or included in the most
recently delivered Reserve Report (with respect to all of which
66
contracts the Borrower represents that it or its Restricted Subsidiaries are receiving a price for all production sold
thereunder which is computed substantially in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract and are not having
deliveries curtailed substantially below the subject Property’s delivery capacity), no material agreements exist which
are not cancelable on 60 days’ notice or less without penalty or detriment for the sale of production from the
Borrower’s or the Restricted Subsidiaries’ Hydrocarbons (including, without limitation, calls on or other rights to
purchase, production, whether or not the same are currently being exercised) that (a) pertain to the sale of production
at a fixed price and (b) have a maturity or expiry date of longer than six (6) months from the Effective Date.
Section 7.20                            Swap Agreements.  Schedule 7.20, as of the Effective Date, and after the Effective
Date, each report required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.01(d), sets forth, a true and complete
list of all Swap Agreements of the Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary, the material terms thereof (including the
type, term, effective date, termination date and notional amounts or volumes), the net mark to market value thereof,
all credit support agreements relating thereto (including any margin required or supplied) and the counterparty to each
such agreement.
Section 7.21                            Use of Loans and Letters of Credit.  The proceeds of the Loans and the Letters of Credit
shall be used (a)  to repay existing Debt, (b) to provide working capital for exploration and production, midstream
trading and marketing operations and (c) for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
the acquisition of exploration and production and midstream properties.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not
engaged principally, or as one of its or their important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose,
whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation T, U or
X of the Board).  No part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used for any purpose which violates
the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board.
Section 7.22                            Solvency.  Before and after giving effect to the Transactions, (a) the aggregate assets, at
a fair valuation, of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will exceed the aggregate Debt of
the Borrower on a consolidated basis, as the Debt becomes absolute and matures, (b) none of the Borrower nor any
Restricted Subsidiary will have incurred or intended to incur, and will not believe that it will incur, Debt beyond its
ability to pay such Debt as such Debt becomes absolute and matures and (c) none of the Borrower nor any Restricted
Subsidiary will have (nor will have any reason to believe that it will have thereafter) unreasonably small capital for the
conduct of its business.
Section 7.23                            Sanctioned Persons; USA PATRIOT Act; FCPA.
(a)                                 None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any director,
officer, agent, employee or Affiliate of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is currently subject to any U.S. sanctions
administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (“OFAC”); and the Borrower will
not directly or indirectly use the proceeds of the Loans or otherwise make available such proceeds to any Person, for
the purpose of financing the activities of any Person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC.
67
(b)                                 The Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable statutes, regulations and orders of (including any laws relating to terrorism, money laundering, embargoed
persons or the USA PATRIOT Act), and all applicable restrictions imposed by, all governmental bodies, domestic or
foreign, in respect of the conduct of its business and the ownership of its property (including, without limitation,
applicable statutes, regulations, orders and restrictions relating to environmental standards and controls).
(c)                                  The Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C.§§ 78dd-1, et seq. (“FCPA”) and any foreign counterpart thereto applicable to
the Borrower or such Subsidiary.  Neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries has made a payment, offering, or
promise to pay, or authorized the payment of, money or anything of value (a) in order to assist in obtaining or retaining
business for or with, or directing business to, any foreign official, foreign political party, party official or candidate for
foreign political office, (b) to a foreign official, foreign political party or party official or any candidate for foreign
political office, and (c) with the intent to induce the recipient to misuse his or her official position to direct business
wrongfully to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or to any other Person.

to completion, and shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary to promptly commence and diligently prosecute to
completion, any assessment, evaluation, investigation, monitoring, containment, cleanup, removal, repair, restoration,
remediation or other remedial obligations (collectively, the “Remedial Work”) in the event any Remedial Work is

suspected past, present or future disposal or other release of any oil, oil and gas waste, hazardous substance or solid
waste on, under, about or from any of the Borrower’s or its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Properties, which failure to

correct any omissions in this Agreement or the Security Instruments, or to state more fully the obligations secured
therein, or to perfect, protect or preserve any Liens created pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Security
Instruments or the priority thereof, or to make any recordings, file any notices or obtain any consents, all as may be

(a)                                 Promptly after January 1st of each calendar year and in any event before April 1st of each
calendar year, and promptly after July 1st of each calendar year, commencing April 1, 2015, and in any event before
October 1st of each year, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a Reserve Report. 
The Reserve Report as of January 1st of each year and the Reserve Report delivered in connection with the first
redetermination of the Borrowing Base after the Effective Date shall be prepared by Borrower or an Approved
Petroleum Engineer and audited by one or more Approved Petroleum Engineers, and the July 1st Reserve Report of
each year shall be prepared by or under the supervision of the chief engineer of the Borrower.  In each case, the chief
engineer of Borrower shall certify such Reserve Report is based on information that was prepared in good faith based
upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time and to have been prepared in accordance with the procedures
used in the immediately preceding Reserve Report.
(b)                                 In the event of an Interim Redetermination, except in connection with the first redetermination, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a Reserve Report prepared by or under the
supervision of the chief engineer of the Borrower who
75
shall certify such Reserve Report to be based on information that was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time and to have been prepared in accordance with the procedures used in the
immediately preceding Reserve Report.  For any Interim Redetermination requested by the Administrative Agent or
the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.07(b)(ii) or Section 2.07(b)(iii), the Borrower shall provide such Reserve Report with
an “as of” date as required by the Administrative Agent as soon as possible, but in any event no later than 45 days
following the receipt of such request.
(c)                            Each Reserve Report may be supplemented by all such other internal information as the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, acting reasonably, may request or deem appropriate, including without limitation sufficient
internally prepared information to permit the Administrative Agent’s engineering consultants to prepare economic
engineering evaluations covering the Oil and Gas Properties.
(d)                           With the delivery of each Reserve Report, the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders a certificate from a Responsible Officer certifying that to his knowledge, after reasonable investigation, in
all material respects: (i) the information contained in the Reserve Report and any other information delivered in
connection therewith is based on information that was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time, (ii) the Borrower or its Subsidiaries owns good and defensible title to the Proved Reserves
evaluated in such Reserve Report and such Properties are free of all Liens except for Liens permitted by
Section 9.03, (iii) except as set forth on an exhibit to the certificate, on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take
or pay or other prepayments in excess of the volume specified in Section 7.18 with respect to its Oil and Gas
Properties evaluated in such Reserve Report which would require the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary to deliver
Hydrocarbons either generally or produced from such Oil and Gas Properties at some future time without then or
thereafter receiving full payment therefor, (iv) none of the Borrower’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Proved Reserves
have been sold since the date of the last Borrowing Base determination except as set forth on an exhibit to the
certificate, which certificate shall list all of its Proved Reserves sold and in such detail as reasonably required by the
Administrative Agent and (v) attached thereto is a schedule of the Proved Reserves evaluated by such Reserve
Report that are Mortgaged Properties and demonstrating the percentage of the Borrowing Base that the value of such
Mortgaged Properties represent.  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall attach to such
certificate a list of all marketing agreements entered into subsequent to the later of the Effective Date or the most
recently delivered Reserve Report which the Borrower could reasonably be expected to have been obligated to list on
Schedule 7.19 had such agreement been in effect on the Effective Date.
Section 8.13                            Title Information.
(a)                           On or before the delivery to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of each Reserve Report
required by Section 8.12(a), the Borrower will deliver title information in form and substance acceptable to the
Administrative Agent covering enough of the proved Oil and Gas Properties evaluated by such Reserve Report that
were not included in the immediately preceding Reserve Report, so that the Administrative Agent shall have received
together with
76
title information previously delivered, satisfactory title information on at least the Minimum Collateral Amount.
(b)                           If the Borrower has provided title information for additional Properties under Section 8.13(a), the
Borrower shall, within 60 days of notice from the Administrative Agent that title defects or exceptions exist with
respect to such additional Properties, either (i) cure any such title defects or exceptions (including defects or
exceptions as to priority) which are not permitted by Section 9.03 raised by such information, (ii) substitute acceptable
Mortgaged Properties with no title defects or exceptions except for Permitted Prior Liens having an equivalent value or
(iii) deliver title information in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent so that the Administrative
Agent shall have received, together with title information previously delivered, satisfactory title information on at least
the Minimum Collateral Amount.
(c)                            If the Borrower is unable to cure any title defect requested to be cured within the 60-day period or the
Borrower does not comply with the requirement to provide acceptable title information covering at least the Minimum
Collateral Amount, such default shall not be a Default, but instead the Administrative Agent and/or the Supermajority
Lenders shall have the right to exercise the following remedy in their sole discretion from time to time, and any failure
to so exercise this remedy at any time shall not be a waiver as to future exercise of the remedy by the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders.  To the extent that the Administrative Agent or the Supermajority Lenders are not satisfied with
title to any Mortgaged Property after the 60-day period has elapsed, such unacceptable Mortgaged Property shall not
count towards the Minimum Collateral Amount and the Administrative Agent may send a notice to the Borrower and
the Lenders that the then outstanding Borrowing Base shall be reduced by an amount as determined by the
Supermajority Lenders to cause the Borrower to be in compliance with the requirement to provide acceptable title
information on at least the Minimum Collateral Amount.  This new Borrowing Base shall become effective immediately
after receipt of such notice.
Section 8.14                            Additional Collateral.
(a)                           In connection with each redetermination of the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall review the
Reserve Report and the list of current Mortgaged Properties (as described in Section 8.12(d)) to ascertain whether the
Mortgaged Properties represent at least the Minimum Collateral Amount after giving effect to exploration and
production activities, acquisitions, dispositions and production.  In the event that the Mortgaged Properties do not
represent at least the Minimum Collateral Amount, then the Borrower shall, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries
to, grant to the Administrative Agent as security for the Obligations a first-priority Lien interest (subject only to
Permitted Prior Liens) on additional Oil and Gas Properties not already subject to a Lien of the Security Instruments
such that after giving effect thereto, the Mortgaged Properties will represent at least the Minimum Collateral Amount. 
All such Liens will be created and perfected by and in accordance with the provisions of mortgages, deeds of trust,
security agreements and financing statements or other Security Instruments, all in form and substance satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent and in sufficient executed (and acknowledged where necessary or appropriate) counterparts
for recording purposes.
77
(b)                           In addition, from time to time prior to the Second Lien Termination Date, the Borrower will, at its cost
and expense, secure the Obligations by pledging or creating, or causing to be pledged or created, perfected security
interests with respect to such of its assets and properties as the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders shall
designate within 30 days of such designation (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may agree (it being
understood that it is the intent of the parties that the Obligations shall be secured by substantially all the assets of the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including real and other properties acquired subsequent to the Effective
Date) subject to the limitations herein); provided that, neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall be
required to take additional action with respect to assets not required to be pledged as collateral for the obligations
under the Second Lien Term Loan Agreement, assets specifically excluded from Collateral in the Security Instruments
and assets which in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent are of de minimis value or for which the cost
of obtaining a perfected security interest outweighs the value thereof.  Such security interests and Liens will be
created under the Security Instruments and other security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
instruments and documents in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent all such instruments and documents (including legal
opinions and lien searches but excluding title insurance) as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request within
such thirty-day period to evidence compliance with this Section. The Borrower agrees to provide such evidence as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the perfection and priority status of each such security interest
and Lien.
Section 8.15                            ERISA Compliance.  In addition to and without limiting the generality of Section 8.09, the
Borrower shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to (a) comply in all material respects with all applicable
provisions of ERISA and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to all employee benefit
plans (as defined in ERISA), (b) not take any action or fail to take action the result of which could be (i) a liability to
the PBGC (other than liability for PBGC premiums) or (ii) a past due liability to any Multiemployer Plan, (c) not
participate in any prohibited transaction that could result in any material civil penalty under ERISA or any tax under
the Code, (d) operate each employee benefit plan in such a manner that will not incur any material tax liability under
Section 4980B of the Code or any liability to any qualified beneficiary as defined in Section 4980B of the Code except
to the extent such failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to have Material Adverse Effect and (e) furnish
to the Administrative Agent upon the Administrative Agent’s request such additional information about any employee
benefit plan as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent.
Section 8.16                            Additional Guarantors.  Concurrently with the acquisition or formation of any Subsidiary
(other than any Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
substantially concurrently with such acquisition or formation) and in any event no later than 30 days following such
acquisition or formation, the Borrower shall (a) cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent (i) a Joinder
Agreement executed by such Restricted Subsidiary and the direct owner of the Equity Interests of such Restricted
Subsidiary, (ii) stock certificates or other instruments representing all the Equity Interests of such Restricted
Subsidiary and stock powers and instruments of transfer, endorsed in
78
blank, with respect to such stock certificates or other instruments, or, if any Equity Interests pledged pursuant to
such Security Agreement are uncertificated securities, confirmation and evidence satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent that the security interest in such uncertificated securities has been transferred to and perfected by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with the UCC, (iii) all agreements, deeds of trust, mortgages, documents and
instruments, including UCC Financing Statements (Form UCC-1), required by law or reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent to be executed, filed, registered or recorded to create or perfect the Liens on the Property of
such Subsidiary (except to the extent not required under the Security Agreement), (iv) UCC searches, all dated
reasonably close to the date of the Joinder Agreement and in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, and evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that any Liens indicated in such UCC
searches are Excepted Liens or have been released, (v) the corporate resolutions or similar approval documents of
such Restricted Subsidiary approving the execution and delivery of the Joinder Agreement and the performance of the
Security Agreement and Guaranty by such Restricted Subsidiary, and (vi) if requested by the Administrative Agent, a
legal opinion reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, opining favorably on the execution, delivery and
enforceability of the Loan Documents to which such Restricted Subsidiary is a party, and the grant and perfection of
the security interest or lien purported to be made or effected by any such Loan Document and otherwise being in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 11.06) appoints the Administrative
Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such
powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents, together with
such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Section 11.02                     Duties and Obligations of Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not have
any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Administrative Agent (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of
whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except as provided in Section 11.03, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein,
shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as the Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of
any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to it by the Borrower or a Lender, and shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any
other Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
ARTICLE VI or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to it or as to
those conditions precedent specifically required to be to its satisfaction, (vi) the existence, value, perfection or priority
of any collateral security or the financial or other condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any other obligor or
guarantor, or (vii) any failure by the Borrower or any other Person (other than itself) to perform any of its obligations
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or the performance or observance of any covenants, agreements or
other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein.
Section 11.03                     Action by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take
any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby that it is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Majority Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02) and in all
cases it shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless it shall
(a) receive written instructions from the Majority Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
97
circumstances as provided in Section 12.02) specifying the action to be taken and (b) be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expenses which may be incurred by it by reason of taking
or continuing to take any such action.  The instructions as aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.  If a Default has occurred and is continuing, then the Administrative
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the requisite Lenders in the written
instructions (with indemnities) described in this Section 11.03, provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent
shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the
Lenders.  In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any action which exposes the
Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable
law.  If a Default has occurred and is continuing, the Arranger shall not have any obligation to perform any act in
respect thereof.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent
or at the request of the Majority Lenders or the Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02), and otherwise the Administrative Agent shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any other
document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith including its
own ordinary negligence, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Section 11.04                     Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon,
and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument,
document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be
made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon and each of the Borrower, the Lenders
and the Issuing Bank hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent’s record of such statement, except
in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.  The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the holder
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof permitted
hereunder shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.
Section 11.05                     Subagents.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its
rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.  The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related
Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding Sections of this ARTICLE XI shall apply to any such sub-agent
and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as
Administrative Agent.

Section 11.06                     Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent.  Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 11.06, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the
Majority Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with and upon the approval of the Borrower (so long as no Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, to appoint a
successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or removal of the
retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an
Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of
the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as
those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the
Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this ARTICLE XI and Section 12.03 shall continue in
effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Section 11.07                     Administrative Agent as Lender.  Each bank serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
Section 11.08                     No Reliance.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and each other Loan Document to
which it is a party.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time
deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or to inspect the Properties or books of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries.  Except for notices,
reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative
Agent hereunder, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Borrower
99
(or any of its Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates.  In
this regard, each Lender acknowledges that Andrews Kurth LLP is acting in this transaction as special counsel to the
Administrative Agent only, except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in any legal opinion or any Loan
Document.  Each other party hereto will consult with its own legal counsel to the extent that it deems necessary in
connection with the Loan Documents and the matters contemplated therein.
Section 11.09                     Authority to Release Collateral, Liens and Guarantors.  Each Lender and the Issuing
Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to (a) release any collateral that is permitted to be sold or released
pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents and (b) subject to Section 12.02(b)(vii), release any Guarantor from its
obligations under any Loan Documents if such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of a
transaction permitted under this Agreement.  Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower, at the Borrower’s sole cost and expense, any and all releases,
termination statements, assignments or other documents reasonably requested by the Borrower in connection with
such sale or other disposition or such transaction to the extent such sale or other disposition or such transaction is
permitted by the terms of Section 9.11 or is otherwise authorized by the terms of the Loan Documents.
Section 11.10                     The Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Co-Documentation Agents.  None
of the Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or the Co-Documentation Agents shall have any duties, responsibilities
or liabilities under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents other than, in the case of any Persons that are also
Lenders, their duties, responsibilities and liabilities in their capacities as Lenders hereunder.
Section 11.11                     Filing of Proofs of Claim.  In case of any Default or Event of Default under
Section 10.01(h), Section 10.01(i) or Section 10.01(j), the Administrative Agent (regardless of whether the principal of
any Loan or LC Exposure shall then be due and payable and regardless of whether the Administrative Agent has
made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a)                           to (i) file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in
respect of the Loans, LC Exposure and all other Obligations that is owing and unpaid and (ii) file such other
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
(including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent under Section 3.03 and Section 12.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(b)                           to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to
distribute the same.
Each Lender hereby authorizes any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, conservator, sequestrator or other similar
official in any such judicial proceeding: (i) to make such payments to the Administrative Agent; and (ii) if the
Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for
100
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 3.03 and Section 12.03.  Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt
on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations
or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in
any such proceeding.  Each Lender retains its right to file and prove a claim separately.

Section 12.02                     Waivers; Amendments.
(a)                           No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to exercise and no
delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege, under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under any of the Loan
Documents preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The
rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 12.02(b), and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a
waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had
notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b)                           Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except
pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Majority Lenders or by the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders; provided that no such agreement
shall (i) increase the Commitment or the Maximum Credit Amount of any Lender without the written consent of such
Lender, (ii) increase the Borrowing Base without the written consent of each Lender, decrease or maintain the
Borrowing Base without the consent of the Supermajority Lenders, or modify Section 2.07 without the consent of each
Lender, (iii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or
reduce any fees payable hereunder, or reduce any other Obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the
principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or any other
Obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such
payment, or postpone or extend the Termination Date without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(v) change Section 4.01(b) or Section 4.01(c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required
thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) waive or amend Section 8.14, without the written consent of
each Lender, (vii) release all or substantially all of the value of the guarantees of the Obligations pursuant to the
Guaranty, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) release any of the collateral (other than as provided in
Section 11.09), or reduce the percentage set forth in the definition of “Minimum Collateral Amount” to less than 90%,
without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) change any of the provisions of this Section 12.02(b) or the
definitions of “Applicable Percentage”, “Majority Lenders” or “Supermajority Lenders” or any other provision hereof
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or under any
other Loan Documents or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder or any other Loan Documents,
without the written consent of each Lender or (ix) waive, amend or modify this
102
Agreement or the Security Agreement in a manner that would alter the ratable treatment of Obligations arising under
the Loan Documents and Obligations described in clause (c) of the definition of “Obligations” or the definitions of
“Approved Counterparty”, “Obligations” or “Swap Agreement” in a manner adverse to any Person described in clause
(c) of the definition of “Obligations”, without the written consent of each such affected Person; provided further that no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing
Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any supplement to Schedule 7.14 (Subsidiaries)
shall be effective simply by delivering to the Administrative Agent a supplemental schedule clearly marked as such
and, upon receipt, the Administrative Agent will promptly deliver a copy thereof to the Lenders.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or modification hereunder, except that (x) any amendment, waiver or modification requiring the
consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently that other affected
Lenders and (y) any amendment referenced in clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of this Section 12.02(b) which affects such
Defaulting Lender, shall, in each case, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
Section 12.03                     Expenses, Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a)                           The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent

hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all
costs, expenses, Taxes, assessments and other charges incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of any security interest contemplated by this Agreement

incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit issued by the Issuing Bank or any demand for payment thereunder and (iv) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including its
rights under this Section 12.03, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including,
without limitation, all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during  any workout, restructuring or negotiations in
respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.
103
(b)                           The Borrower shall indemnify the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each
Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing persons (each such person being called an “Indemnitee”)
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related
expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by
or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the
performance by the parties hereto or the parties to any other Loan Document of their respective obligations hereunder
or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Loan Document, (ii) the
failure of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to comply with the terms of any Loan Document, including this Agreement, or
with any Governmental Requirement, (iii) any inaccuracy of any representation or any breach of any warranty or
covenant of the Borrower set forth in any of the Loan Documents or any instruments, documents or certifications
delivered in connection therewith, (iv) any loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom, including,
without limitation, (A) any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued
by the Issuing Bank if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit, or (B) the payment of a drawing under any Letter of Credit notwithstanding the non-
compliance, non-delivery or other improper presentation of the documents presented in connection therewith, (v) the
operations of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (vi) any assertion
that the Lenders were not entitled to receive the proceeds received pursuant to the Security Instruments, (vii) any
Environmental Law applicable to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their properties, including without limitation,
the presence, generation, storage, release, threatened release, use, transport, disposal, arrangement of disposal or
treatment of oil, oil and gas wastes, solid wastes or hazardous substances on any of their properties, (viii) the breach
or non-compliance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary with any Environmental Law applicable to the Borrower or any

of their properties which, though lawful and fully permissible at the time, could result in present liability, (x) the
presence, use, release, storage, treatment, disposal, generation, threatened release, transport, arrangement for
transport or arrangement for disposal of oil, oil and gas wastes, solid wastes or hazardous substances on or at any of
the properties owned or operated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any actual or alleged presence or release of

regardless of whether any indemnitee is a party thereto, and such Indemnity shall extend to each Indemnitee
notwithstanding the sole or concurrent negligence of every kind or character whatsoever, whether active or passive,
whether an affirmative act or an omission, including without limitation, all types of negligent conduct identified in the
restatement (second) of torts of one or more of the Indemnitees or by reason of strict liability imposed without fault on
any one or more of the Indemnitees; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the
extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (a) are
104

negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (b) relate to agreements, or obligations to which Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are not parties, (c) relate to any claim not involving an act or omission by the Borrower or its Affiliates
that is brought by an Indemnitee against any other Indemnitee (other than a dispute involving claims against the

obtained possession of such property (whether by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, as mortgagee-in-
possession or otherwise).  This Section 12.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that
represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
(c)                            To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative
Agent or the Issuing Bank under Section 12.03(a) or (b), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that
the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.
(d)                           To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower and the Indemnified Parties shall not assert,
and hereby waive, any claim against each other, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof (it being understood that, to the extent
any Indemnitee is liable to a third party for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, the Borrower’s
indemnification obligations set forth in paragraph (b) above shall apply, subject to the proviso contained in such
paragraph (b)).  No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any
information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information
transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.
(e)                            All amounts due under this Section 12.03 shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.

and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues
any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower
105
without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section 12.04.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the
extent provided in Section 12.04(c)) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.
(b)                           (i)                                     Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 12.04(b)(ii), any Lender may assign
to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:  (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for
an assignment to a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender, an
Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee, provided further that the
Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice
to the Administrative Agent within five Business Days after having received written notice thereof; and (B) the
Administrative Agent, provided that no such consent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a
Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.
(ii)                                  Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:  (A) except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender’s Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000, and the Commitments of any assigning Lender remaining a
party hereto after giving effect to the assignment shall be at least $10,000,000, unless, in each case, each of the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be
required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement; (C) the
parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,

the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and shall deliver notice of the Assignment and Assumption
to the Borrower; (E) in the case of an assignment to a CLO, the assigning Lender shall retain the sole right to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, provided that the Assignment and
Assumption between such Lender and such CLO may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of such
CLO, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 12.02 that affects such
CLO or (F) no assignment shall be made to (1) a natural Person, (2) the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries or (3) any Defaulting Lender or
106
any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing
Persons described in this clause (3).
(iii)                               Subject to Section 12.04(b)(iv) and the acceptance and recording thereof, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to
the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01, Section 5.02,
Section 5.03 and Section 12.03).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.04(c).
(iv)                              The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one
of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Maximum Credit Amount of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC
Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.  In connection with any changes to the Register, if necessary, the Administrative Agent will reflect the
revisions on Annex I and forward a copy of such revised Annex I to the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and each Lender.
(v)                                 Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning
Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be
a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 12.04(b) and any written consent to
such assignment required by Section 12.04(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No assignment shall be effective for
purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 12.04(b).
(c)                            (i)                                     Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
or the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing
to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and
107
(C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 12.02
that affects such Participant.  In addition such agreement must provide that the Participant be bound by the
provisions of Section 12.03.  Subject to Section 12.04(c)(ii), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01, Section 5.02 and Section 5.03 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.04(b).  To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 4.01(c) as though it were a Lender.
(ii)                                  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.01 or
Section 5.03 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written
consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 5.03 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees,
for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 5.03(g) as though it were a Lender.
(iii)                               Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent
of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal
amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion
of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s
interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person
except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or
other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries
in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as
Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(d)                           Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations
to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 12.04(d) shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security
interest; provided that no such
108
pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute
any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(e)                            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, no transfer or assignment of the interests
or obligations of any Lender or any grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or
grant would require the Borrower to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the “Blue
Sky” laws of any state.
Section 12.05                     Survival; Revival; Reinstatement.
(a)                           All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty
at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or
any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and
unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The
provisions of Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 and ARTICLE XI shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.
(b)                           To the extent that any payments on the Obligations or proceeds of any collateral are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in
possession, receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then to such extent,
the Obligations so satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and
the Administrative Agent’s, and the Lenders’ Liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies under this
Agreement and each Loan Document shall continue in full force and effect.  In such event, each Loan Document shall
be automatically reinstated and the Borrower shall take such action as may be reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders to effect such reinstatement.
Section 12.06                     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
(a)                           This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract.
(b)                            This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent constitute the entire
109
contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.  This Agreement and
the other Loan Documents represent the final agreement among the parties hereto and thereto and may not be
contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties.  There are no
unwritten oral agreements between the parties.
(c)                            Except as provided in Section 6.01(a), this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have
been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts
hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or electronic transmission (e.g., “pdf”)
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
Section 12.07                     Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions hereof or thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate
such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 12.08                     Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender,
the Issuing Bank and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations (of whatsoever kind, including, without limitation, Swap
Agreements with the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary) at any time owing by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary against any of and all the
obligations of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary owed to such Lender now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such Affiliate
shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations may
be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or the Issuing Bank different
from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event
that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over
immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.07 and,
pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust
for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall
provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to
such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender, the Issuing Bank and
their respective Affiliates under this Section 12.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) which such Lender, the Issuing Bank or their respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender and the Issuing
Bank agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any
110
such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and
application.
Section 12.09                     Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a)                           This Agreement and the Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York without regard to any choice-of-law provisions that would require the application of
the law of another jurisdiction; provided, to the extent any of the Security Instruments recite that they are governed by
the law of another jurisdiction, or any action or event taken thereunder (such as foreclosure of the Mortgaged
Property) requires application of or compliance with the law of another jurisdiction, such provisions and concepts shall
apply.
(b)                           Any legal action or proceeding with respect to the Loan Documents shall be brought in the courts of
the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the
Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereby accepts for itself
and (to the extent permitted by law) in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts.  Each party hereby irrevocably waives any objection, including, without limitation, any objection to
the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter have to the
bringing of any such action or proceeding in such respective jurisdictions.  This submission to jurisdiction is non-
exclusive and does not preclude a party from obtaining jurisdiction over another party in any court otherwise having
jurisdiction.
(c)                            Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any
such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to it at the
address specified in Section 12.01 or such other address as is specified pursuant to Section 12.01 (or its assignment
and assumption), such service to become effective 30 days after such mailing.  Nothing herein shall affect the right of
a party or any holder of a note to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal
proceedings or otherwise proceed against another party in any other jurisdiction.
(d)                           Each party hereby (i) irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document and for any
counterclaim therein; (ii) irrevocably waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to
claim or recover in any such litigation any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or damages other
than, or in addition to, actual damages (it being understood that, to the extent any Indemnitee is liable to a third party
for any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, the Borrower’s indemnification obligations set forth in
Section 12.03(b) shall apply, subject to the proviso contained in Section 12.03(b)); (iii) certifies that no party hereto
nor any representative or agent of counsel for any party hereto has represented, expressly or otherwise, or implied
that such party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers, and (iv) acknowledges that
it has been induced to enter into this Agreement, the Loan Documents
111
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
contained in this Section 12.09.
Section 12.10                     Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for
convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
Section 12.11                     Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other
advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or
requested by any regulatory authority or self-regulatory body, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; provided Borrower has been given reasonable advance notice
thereof, to the extent permitted by law, and been afforded an opportunity to limit or protest the disclosure, (d) to any
other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 12.11, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any Swap Agreement relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with
the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result
of a breach of this Section 12.11 or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.  For the purposes of this Section 12.11,
“Information” means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary and their businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or a Subsidiary.  Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 12.11 shall be considered to
have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any party hereto (and each employee, representative or other agent of such party)
may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the “tax treatment” and “tax structure” (in
each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and
all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to that party relating to such tax
treatment or tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains
information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions, as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax
structure of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Section 12.12                     Exculpation Provisions.  Each of the parties hereto specifically agrees that it has a duty to
read this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and agrees that it is
112
charged with notice and knowledge of the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; that it has in fact
read this Agreement and is fully informed and has full notice and knowledge of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; that it has been represented by independent legal counsel of its choice throughout the negotiations
preceding its execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and has received the advice of its attorney
in entering into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and that it recognizes that certain of the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents may result, subject to the terms hereof and thereof and applicable law, in
one party assuming the liability inherent in some aspects of the transaction and relieving the other party of its
responsibility for such liability.  Each party hereto agrees and covenants that it will not contest the validity or
enforceability of any exculpatory provision of this Agreement and the other loan documents on the basis that the party
had no notice or knowledge of such provision or that the provision is not “conspicuous.”
Section 12.13                     No Third Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the
agreement of the Lenders to make Loans and the Issuing Bank to issue, amend, renew or extend Letters of Credit
hereunder are solely for the benefit of the Borrower, and no other Person (including, without limitation, any Subsidiary
of the Borrower, any obligor, contractor, subcontractor, supplier or materialmen) shall have any rights, claims,
remedies or privileges hereunder or under any other Loan Document against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender for any reason whatsoever.  There are no third party beneficiaries.
Section 12.14                     Collateral Matters; Swap Agreements.  The benefit of the Security Instruments and of the
provisions of this Agreement relating to any collateral securing the Obligations shall also extend to and be available to
those Lenders or their Affiliates which are counterparties to any Swap Agreement with the Borrower or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries on a pro rata basis in respect of any obligations of the Borrower or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries which arise under any such Swap Agreement so long as such Person or its Affiliate was a Lender under
the Prior Agreement or this Agreement at the time of entering into such Swap Agreement.  No Lender or any Affiliate
of a Lender shall have any voting rights under any Loan Document as a result of the existence of obligations owed to
it under any such Swap Agreements, except as expressly set forth in Section 12.02(b)(ix).
Section 12.15                     USA Patriot Act Notice.  Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the
requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”),
it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name
and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance
with the Patriot Act.
Section 12.16                     Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the
interest rate applicable to any Loan or reimbursement obligation, together with all fees, charges and other amounts
that are treated as interest on such Loan or reimbursement obligation under applicable law (collectively the “Charges”),
shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender
holding such Loan or reimbursement obligation in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in
respect of such Loan or reimbursement obligation hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof,
shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate and, to
113
the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan or reimbursement
obligation but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans, reimbursement obligations or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Highest Lawful Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount shall have been received by such
Lender and in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, under any circumstances the aggregate amounts taken,
reserved, charged, received or paid on the Loans include amounts which by applicable law are deemed interest which
would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, then such excess shall be deemed to be a mistake and each Lender receiving
same shall credit the same on the principal of its Loans (or if such Loans shall have been paid in full, refund said
excess to the Borrower).  In the event that the maturity of the Obligations are accelerated by reason of any election of
the holder thereof resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any
required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never include more than the
Highest Lawful Rate, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled
automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the
Obligations (or, if the applicable Loans shall have been paid in full, refunded to the Borrower of such interest).  The
provisions of this Section shall control over all other provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents which
may be in apparent conflict herewith.
Section 12.17                     Intercreditor Agreement.  Each Lender hereby (a) acknowledges that it has received a copy
of the Intercreditor Agreement, (b) agrees that it will be bound by and will take no action contrary to the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement as if it were a signatory thereto and (c) authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent
to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement (including any and all amendments, amendments and restatements,
modifications, supplements and acknowledgements thereto as permitted hereby) on behalf of and without any further
action by such Lender.
Section 12.18                     Amendment and Restatement.
(a)                           On the Effective Date, the Prior Agreement shall be amended, restated and superseded in its entirety
hereby.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) this Agreement, any promissory notes delivered pursuant
to Section 6.01(f) and the other Loan Documents executed and delivered in connection herewith do not constitute a
novation or termination of the “Obligations” (as defined in the Prior Agreement) under the Prior Agreement as in effect
prior to the Effective Date and (ii) such “Obligations” are in all respects continuing with only the terms thereof being
modified as provided in this Agreement.
(b)                           Notwithstanding the modifications effected by this Agreement of the representations, warranties and
covenants of the Borrower contained in the Prior Agreement, the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any causes
of action or other rights created in favor of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, in each case,
party to or its successors arising out of the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in or delivered in
connection with the Prior Agreement shall survive the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Agreement to the
extent provided in the Prior Agreement prior to the termination thereof.
114
(c)                            All indemnification obligations of the Borrower arising under the Prior Agreement (including any
arising from a breach of the representations thereunder) shall survive to the extent provided in the Prior Agreement
prior to the termination thereof.
Section 12.19                     Exiting Lenders.  Upon the Effective Date, Royal Bank of Canada, as a “Lender” under the
Prior Agreement (the “Exiting Lender”), shall be paid in full for all amounts owing to it under the Prior Agreement and
cease to be a “Lender” under the Prior Agreement and the “Loan Documents” as defined therein.  The Exiting Lender
is executing this Agreement solely for the purpose of evidencing its agreement to this Section 12.19 only and for no
other purpose.
