Pampa el Toro Mineral Resource Technical Report
1  Summary
Page 7
Cardero  is  a  leader  in  exploration  and  development  of  Iron-ore,  Copper  and  Gold  projects  in  the 
Americas.  Their  projects  include  a  highly  prospective  Iron  Oxide  Copper  Gold  (IOCG)  project 
within the Alisitos Arc in Baja California Norte, Mexico, various gold projects in Argentina and Iron 
Sands projects in Peru. The Pampa el Toro Project is an Iron Sands project situated in the desert 
coastal region of Southern Peru. During late 2005 Cardero initiated a feasibility study on this project 
by starting a sand sampling program headed by Cooke Geochemical Consulting, and a trenching and 
percussion  drilling  programme  managed  by  their  own  geologists,  This  has  been  followed  up  by 
various outsourced metallurgical test programs, initially done by Midrex (2005) and most recently 
by Bateman Engineering (2007).
Location
The  property  is  located  near  the  city  of  Nazca  in  the  desert  coastal  region  of  southern  Peru 
approximately  45  km  northeast  of  the  port  of  San  Juan,  close  to  the  large  Marcona  iron  mine 
(approximate resource of 1.4Bt @ 54% iron), the Mina Justa copper deposit (inferred resource of 
218Mt @ 0.8% copper), and to Cardero's Pampa de Pongo iron deposit
Ownership
There  are  14  mining  concessions within the Pampa  El Toro Project area totalling  10 00  hectares. 
Cardero has direct ownership of the 9 concessions  and has signed an option agreement with Minas 
Ataspacas S.A. to acquire an initial 70% interest in the other 5 concessions.
Geology and Mineralisation
The Lower Paleozoic iron rich Marcona Formation is unconformably overlain by Triassic, Jurassic 
and  Cretaceous  volcanic  and  sedimentary  sequences  which,  in  turn,  were  intruded  by  stocks  and 
dykes belonging to the Peruvian Coastal Batholith complex.  These strata were, in turn, deformed, 
uplifted and eroded, and formed a base on which Quaternary sediments were deposited.
It is speculated that the iron-bearing minerals contained in the iron sands either partially or wholly 
originated  from  the  volcanic  units  overlying  the  Marcona  formation,  however  additional  as  yet 
unidentified sources are possible. However, it is possible that erosion of these Quaternary sediments 
contributed significant quantities of magnetite material contained in the dune fields.
the  principal
in
iron-bearing  minerals
Mineralogically, 
the  dunes  consist  of  magnetite, 
titanomagnetite and ilmenite, with minor to trace amounts of hematite, rutile, titanite, ulvospinel and 
goethite.  Silicate minerals, which make up the bulk of the sands, are primarily quartz, plagioclase, 
amphibole,  chlorite,  mica  and  pyroxene  (SGS  Lakefield  Research,  2005a).    The  majority  of  the 
ilmenite (80-85% by volume) is associated with magnetite, titanomagnetite and hematite, with the 
remaining 15-20% by volume present as free ilmenite grains.
The  dune  sands  are  considered  to  be  the  product  of  aeolian  re-distribution  of  contemporary  and 
ancient  beach  sands  and  Quaternary  basin  sediments  derived  from  erosion  of  the  bedrock,

winnowed,  and  re-distributed,  by  prevailing  winds  (Gay,  2005)  to  produce  potentially  economic 
concentrations of magnetite in extensive, and partially active, dune fields.
Exploration Concept
The  primary  focus  of  the  exploration  work  has  been  on  the  sampling,  trenching  and  percussion 
drilling of the deposit, combined with significant amounts of metallurgical testwork. This has lead to 
the  development  of  a  robust  geological  and  structural  model  on  which  the  mineral  resource 
estimation and calculation is based. Exploration is thus at an advanced stage. Detailed metallurgical 
testwork has also been completed.
Cardero  has  conducted  the  exploration  program  with  a  set  of  standard  procedures  which  aim  to 
monitor the quality of the sampling and assay results. The standard procedures include submitting 
both Certified Reference Materials to monitor the accuracy of the analyses, as well as the analysis of 
field and laboratory pulp duplicate samples to benchmark the sampling and sample splitting errors as 
well  as  the  precision  and  repeatability  of  the  analyses.    The  quality  control  samples  are  checked 
before accepting the batch analytical results from the laboratory in order to control the quality of the 
data accepted in the exploration database. The quality control samples indicate that there was no bias 
introduced  in  the  samples  splitting  process,  as  field  duplicates  and  pulp  duplicates  from  the 
laboratory show very similar characteristics. Analysis of the quality control sample results indicates 
that the analyses have been conducted to a high level of accuracy and precision, and are acceptable 
for use in Mineral Resource Estimation.
Status of Exploration
A pilot mineral processing plant has been erected on site in early 2008 and approximately 56.8 tons 
of magnetic concentrate was produced. In terms of metallurgical testwork The Phase I briquetting 
work and the Phase II bench-scale pig iron production program has been completed. The Phase III 
pilot-scale pig iron production program has been completed and the analytical results are currently 
being determined.
Mineral Resource Estimation
SRK have generated a Mineral Resource estimate based on the data supplied by Cardero from their 
exploration programs. The assay results of a selected set of elements from the 5m composite samples 
were analysed and found to represent a relatively well represented single population of all elements. 
There  are  strong  correlations  between  the  major  economic  elements  (Fe2O3,  TiO2,  and  V)  that 
indicate  a  common  genetic  and  depositional  history.  This  indicates  that  these  elements  are  most 
likely contained within the same, or strongly associated minerals.
SRK generated and modeled experimental semi-variograms that indicate long range continuity in the 
major elements, but that also indicate a long range trend element within the deposit in a north-south 
direction.  Cross  validation  tests  conducted  by  SRK  on  the  semi-variograms  indicate  that  the 
modelled semi-variograms and the selected search neighbourhood parameters should provide robust 
estimates.
The  surface  topography  contours  were  used  to  generate  a  wireframe  representation  of  the 
topography. This surface was copied vertically downwards by 30m, and used to constrain the depth 
extent  of  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate.  Drillhole  collars  were  also  projected  vertically  onto  the
WANL/wanl

surface  as  the  various  generations  of  GPS  surveys  of  the  collars  did  not  accurately  match  the 
surveyed contours.
SRK created a block model with a block size equivalent to the nominal drillhole spacing of 250m X 
and Y directions, and 5m vertically. The block model was rotated to approximately match the dip of 
the topographic surface, which coincided with the plane of best continuity. In order to better model 
the volume, and the topographic variations, the parent blocks were sub-divided into smaller blocks, 
with a minimum size in the XY plane of 6.25m by 6.25m. The blocks were created to exactly match 
the intersection of the wireframe with the block center. Only parent blocks were estimated (i.e. each 
250m by 250m by 5m collection of sub-blocks will have the same grade estimate)
The vertical continuity of mineralisation is significantly shorter than the lateral continuity, as would 
be expected from a deposit emplaced and reworked in thin sheets over time. The search ellipsoid 
employed  by  SRK  takes  this  into  account  using  anisotropic  search  scaling,  with  the  result  that 
samples from adjacent boreholes are given a higher weighting than samples from the same borehole  
that occur above or below the block being estimated. A minimum of four samples was required to 
estimate a block, and a maximum of 12 was used, to preserve some local variability in the grades. 
The maximum number of samples used in the estimation was selected after an optimisation exercise 
indicated  that  this  was  the  best  balance  between  generating  high  quality  estimates,  and  over-
smoothing of the estimation.
The Mineral Resources were classified on the basis of the confidence in the geological variation, the 
quality of the sampling and analytical results, drillhole spacing, and indicators of the quality of the 
estimation.  The  central  portion  of  the  deposit,  which  is  drilled  on  approximately  250m  centers, 
which has high quality estimates was classified as in Indicated Mineral Resource. The portion of the 
deposit surrounding this, drilled on approximately 500m centers, and extending approximately 500m 
beyond the area drilled on 500 centers is classified as an Inferred Mineral Resource. Portions of the 
deposit  that  were  estimated  further  than  500m  from  the  500m  spaced  drilling  were  also  excluded 
from the mineral Resources until further confirmatory work is completed to confirm the grades of 
the material. The Mineral Resources are reported in Table ES1.1.

Qualified Person’s Conclusions and Recommendations
In the Exploration conducted to date at the Iron Sands Project, the surface sampling and subsequent 
percussion drillhole testing indicates that the overall magnetite content is relatively homogeneous, 
particularly in the uppermost 30 meters.  Sample density achieved in the investigations is considered 
to be more than adequate to support these assertions.

The underestimation of magnetic mineral content and Fe grades caused by milling and grinding of 
sand is not expected to affect the in situ Fe grade which the current Mineral Resource estimate is 
based.
As  an  additional  upgrading  step  to  dry  magnetic  separation,  screening  of  the  concentrate  is  both 
simple and economic. Further testing in this regard is strongly recommended
A  robust  Mineral  Resource  estimate  has  been  generated  based  on  a  sound  geological  model  and 
exploration  database.  The  Mineral  Resource  is  classified  in  terms  of  the  CIM  definitions  on 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves – Definitions and Guidelines. An Indicated Mineral 
Resource  of  133,608  kT  with  a  Fe2O3  grade  of  6.67%  has  been  defined,  along  with  an  Inferred 
Resource of 348,190 kT with a Fe2O3 grade of 6.47%. 
SRK recommend that the metallurgical test work continue to improve the confidence in the ability to 
upgrade the raw sand material into a saleable product, and that Cardero proceed with the preliminary 
economic assessment of the project 
Introduction  
SRK Consulting South Africa (SRK) have prepared an independent Mineral resource estimate of the 
Pampa el Toro Iron sands project (the Project), based on information supplied to SRK by Cardero, as 
well as knowledge gained about the property during two site visits to the project by representatives 
from  SRK.  The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  was  generated  by  Mr.  Mark  Wanless  a  Professional 
Natural  Scientist  (Pr.Sci.Nat)  registered  with  the  South  African  Council  for  Natural  Scientific 
Professionals  (SACNASP).  SACNASP  is  a  statutory  body  which  is  recognized  as  a  Recognized 
Overseas Professional Organization (ROPO) by the Canadian Institute  of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum.  Mr.  Wanless  served  as  the  Qualified  Persons  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the 
Independent  Technical  Report  (ITR)  as  defined  in  National  Instrument  43-101,  Standards  of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects, and in compliance with Form 43-101F1 (the Technical Report).

2.2  Terms of Reference
SRK  was  required  to  prepare  an  ITR  for  the  Project  according  to  the  requirements  of  National 
Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) in support of the disclosure of a Mineral Resource estimate for the 
Project.  The  work  involved  auditing  the  exploration  practices  used  to  generate  the  source 
information, and estimating a Mineral Resource for the project.
2.3  Purpose of Independent Technical Report
This  ITR  was  prepared  to  support  the  disclosure  made  by  Cardero  on  21  July 2009  of  a  Mineral 
Resource  estimate  for  the  Project.    It  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of 
NI43-101 and the NI43-101F1, and conforms with generally accepted Canadian Institute of Mining 
(“CIM”) “Exploration Best Practices” and “Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Best Practices” Guidelines.
2.4  Site Visit
In compliance with NI 43-101 guidelines, Mr Mark Wanless, a Qualified Person, visited the Project 
in February 2008. During the site visit, SRK viewed a selection of drilling locations and the extent of 
the project area. SRK reviewed the sampling procedure as well as the processes used by Cardero to 
generate magnetic concentrates from the raw samples. SRK recommended that analyses should be 
done  on  the  feed  samples.  The  analyses  were  then  used  in  the  generation  of  a  Mineral  Resource 
estiamate. Cardero subsequently created a number of sub-samples from the reference samples stored 
at the drilling locations for the purposes of generating representative 5m composites for the top 30m 
of all drillholes.

4.2  Land tenure
Page 14
The 14 mining concessions which now constitute the Pampa el Toro property total 10,300 ha. The 
distribution of individual concessions and corresponding reference number is shown in Figure 3.2, 
and a complete list is provided in Table 3.1. The status of each of the concessions in Table 3.1 has 
been checked by Cardero against the INACC database (effective date June 30, 2009) and found to be 
correct.
Cardero  has  assumed,  from  a  private  Peruvian  company,  all  rights  and  obligations  under  an 
agreement, dated 16 December, 2005, between the private Peruvian company and Minera Ataspacas 
S.A. (a Peruvian private company) whereby the private Peruvian company has the option to acquire 
from Minas Ataspacas S.A. an initial 70% interest in five mineral sands concessions (totalling 3,600 
ha)  situated  adjacent  to  Cardero’s  existing  iron  sands  claims.    In  order  to  exercise  the  option, 
Cardero is required to pay a total of US$ 2,500,000 over five years to 15 December, 2010, and incur 
exploration expenditures of not less than US$ 250,000 over the same period.  Upon Cardero having 
the acquired the 70% interest, a joint venture company will be formed with Minas Ataspacas S.A., 
and  each  party  will  thereafter  be  required  to  contribute  its  share  of  ongoing  expenditure  or  be 
diluted.   If  either  party  is diluted  to  less  than  10%,  such  interest  will  be  converted  to  a  2%  NSR 
royalty.  If Minera Ataspacas S.A. is reduced to the 2% NSR, Cardero may purchase half the NSR 
(1%) for US$ 2,000,000 within 24 months of the exercise of the option, and the remaining half (1%) 
for US$ 8,000,000 within 36 months of the exercise of the option.
SRK has not independently reviewed the mineral titles to assess the validity of the stated ownership, 
and relies on documentation provided by Cardero.

4.3  Environmental and Socio-Economic Issues
The  immediate  property  area  is  uninhabited,  and  the  nearest  settlement,  Acari,  subsists 
predominantly on agriculture. If water is determined to be necessary in the process of extracting the 
magnetite sands, the local population will need to be consulted.

5  Accessibility,  Climate,  Local  Resources,
Infrastructure and Physiography
5.1  Accessibility
Access  to  the  Property  is  via  the  Panamericana  Sur  Highway  from  Lima  (528  km  to  the  coastal 
village of Lomas, approximately six hours by car), and then approximately 60 km by local dirt roads 
(around 1 hour on average; Figure 3.1) to the Pampa El Toro Dune Field.  It is accessed from the 
Acari Junction on the Panamerican Sur Highway and then via local dirt road to the village of Acari.  
An access road was built from Acari to the upper levels of the dune field prior to percussion drilling, 
although  access  was  restricted  to  dune-buggy  or  light  pick-up  trucks  due  to  the  steepness  of  the 
sandy  slopes.    A  heavy  duty  road  capable  of  taking  drilling  equipment  was  constructed  from  the 
Panamericana Sur Highway just south of the village of Chavina in November 2005 (Figure 3.2).
5.2  Climate
The Project area lies within the desert coastal tract of southern Peru, a northward continuation of the 
Atacama Desert of northern Chile.  It is extremely arid, with less than 1cm annual rainfall and is 
virtually  devoid  of  vegetation,  except  in  irrigated  river  valleys.    During  the  summer  months,  the 
climate  is  extremely hot and  dry,  with  only gentle  breezes  along  the  coast  and high  temperatures 
over the dune fields and valleys, with little movement of sand.
During the winter months, the coastal areas below 1,000 m.a.s.l. are cool, and covered by sea mists 
which  contribute  to  a  humidity  of  around  100%  and  light  drizzle  which  gives  rise  to  sparse 
vegetation (“lomas”) on which domestic animals are able to graze.  Strong onshore winde (southeast, 
verging-to-south,  and-to-southwest)  winds  are  generated  at  this  time  by  solar  heating  of  the 
hinterland  pulling  cooler  air  inland  from  the  coastal  belt.    These  winds  carry  the  mist  and  a 
considerable burden of aeolian sand with them, the latter being deposited against rising ground as the 
strength of the winds diminishes.
5.3  Local Resources and Infrastructure
The local economy is very poor, and dominated by agriculture and animal husbandry in the river 
valleys  where  irrigation  is  possible.    The  dune  fields  constitute  hostile  terrain  and  are  generally 
unvisited.
The deep-water port of San Juan (exit port for the  Marcona  Iron Mine) is situated around 40  km 
from the Panamericana Sur Highway and a further 100 km (maximum) from any of the dune fields 
under investigation.
5.4  Physiography
The large dune fields of southern Peru were described in detail by Gay (2005), who referred to the 
Pampa  El  Toro  Dune  Field  (Acari  Sand  Mass)  as  resulting  from  the  action  of  strong,  persistent, 
onshore  winds  (southeast-to-south-to-southwest)  acting  on  large  quantities  of  coastal  beach  sands 
derived from rapid uplift of the Andes (and coastal belt) under the influence of an extremely arid 
climate. He concluded that the dune fields accumulated at elevations of between 500m and 2000m in

the  Andean  foothills  where  weakening  of  the  carrying  winds  against  rising  topography  led  to 
deposition of the sands.
The Pampa El Toro Dune Field comprises a mainly flat-lying to gently-rolling pampa or “erg” (sand 
sea) in its southern and eastern part, and active dune fields in the north and west.
The Dune Field is oriented roughly north-south around the western and southern flanks of Cerro de 
Arenas.  Surface area amounts to > 120 km2, of which around two-thirds in the south and south-
eastern part of the field consists of pampa sands (a flat-to-gently-rolling sand apron surface similar 
to that of an “erg” or “sand sea”).  The remaining third consists of active dunes of small and similar 
size, mainly in the northern part of the area.
Topographically,  the  Pampa  El  Toro  Dune  Field  is  a  perched  dune  field  situated  high  above  the 
valley  floor  at  elevations  of  between  1000m  and  1400m.a.s.l.,  rising  in  elevation  from  the  south 
towards the north and northeast.
6  History
The Pampa el Toro dune sands were investigated for their iron, titanium and vanadium content by 
the Marcona Mining Company between 1959 and 1961.  The high titanium and vanadium content of 
the magnetite, untreatable at that time, ended the project in the early 1960’s.  Later, the Peruvian 
Ministry of Energy and Mines identified the iron potential of the sands in 1974 as part of a United 
Nations sponsored national iron inventory study.
The  Iron  Sands  Project  was  initiated  by  Cardero  Resource  Corp.  in  mid-2005,  following  the 
acquisition  of  magnetite-bearing  sand-dune  properties  located  southeast  of  Nazca.    Preliminary 
surface sampling of magnetite-bearing active dune sands (a suite of 12 samples from the Carbonera 
Dune  Field),  and  separation  of  the  magnetic  fraction,  gave  magnetic  concentrates  (MC’s)  in  the 
range 0.7 to 21.24 Wt.%, with an average of around 11.0 Wt.%. Geochemical assays of the magnetic 
concentrates by ALS Chemex Labs, North Vancouver, B.C., returned results of about 61.5% Fe and 
4.3 to 6.4 % TiO2. 
Also during 2005, magnetic concentrates separated by SGS Lakefield Research, Ontario, from two 
preliminary bulk samples from the Carbonera Dune Field were sent to Midrex Technologies Inc., a 
division of Kobe Steel, in North Carolina.  An initial Midrex FASTMELT test successfully produced 
a high-quality  low-sulphur,  low-phosphorus  and  low  titanium liquid  iron  of  approximately  91.6% 
iron, 4.88% carbon and <0.21% sulphur (Ripke, 2005).  The FASTMELT® Process utilizes the same 
basic  flowsheet  and  equipment  as  FASTMET®,  but  includes  an  electric  melter  to  produce 
FASTIRON®, a high quality liquid iron product. Hot Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) is discharged from 
the  Rotary  Hearth  Furnace  (RHF)  and  melted  in  an  electric  furnace  or  coal-based  melter.  The 
FASTMET®  Process  is  a  solid  carbon-based  reduction  technology  using  a  rotary  hearth  furnace 
(www.midrex.com).  Waste slag from the process reportedly assayed up to 21.48  Wt.% TiO2  and 
3.18 Wt.% V2O5. (Cook, 2006). 
Based  on  these  early  positive  Midrex  results,  Cardero  decided  to  continue  with  the  Iron  Sands 
Project with the objective of identifying a logistically easily accessible area containing the potential 
for sufficient resources of magnetite sand at sufficient concentration to support a viable 20 to 30 year 
integrated mining operation.  To this end, Cardero focussed initial exploration work on the larger

Pampa El Toro and Carbonera dune fields, and later over the highest-grade parts of the Pampa El 
Toro Dune Field.
7  Geological Setting
Regional basement in the coastal area between Marcona and Yauca consists of gneissic and schistose 
Precambrian  metamorphic  rocks  separated,  by  angular  discontinuity,  from  silicified  and 
metamorphosed carbonate rocks of the overlying Lower Palaeozoic Marcona Formation.  It is the 
Marcona  Formation  which  hosts  the  Marcona  Iron  Mine,  an  Iron  Ore  Copper  Gold  (IOCG)-style 
iron oxide deposit of around 1,440Mt at 54.1% Fe (Hawkes et al, 2002).  The Marcona Formation is 
unconformably  overlain  by  Triassic,  Jurassic  and  Cretaceous  volcanic  and  sedimentary  sequences 
which,  in  turn,  were  intruded  by  stocks  and  dykes  belonging  to  the  Peruvian  Coastal  Batholith 
complex.  These strata were, in turn, deformed, uplifted and eroded, and formed a base on which 
Quaternary sediments were deposited.
The Marcona iron ore has a different chemical signature than the iron sands, which contain elevated 
Ti and V concentrations.  It is speculated that the iron-bearing minerals contained in the iron sands 
either  partially  or  wholly  originated  from  the  volcanic  units  overlying  the  Marcona  formation, 
however additional as yet unidentified sources are possible.
A Cardero consulting geologist, Gary Belik, reported the presence of a Quaternary basin flanking 
rising ground in the study area, with exposures of friable sand sequences locally containing visible 
magnetite (Belik, 2005).  However, Belik also noted that most of the Quaternary sections were not 
magnetite-bearing,  and  were  disrupted  by  lenses  and  layers  of  barren  conglomerate,  clay  and 
volcanic ash, and concluded that the Quaternary sediments did not present an attractive exploration 
target for iron, relative to the active dune sands (Cook, 2006).  However, it is possible that erosion of 
these Quaternary sediments contributed significant quantities of magnetite material contained in the 
dune fields.
the  principal
in
iron-bearing  minerals
Mineralogically, 
the  dunes  consist  of  magnetite, 
titanomagnetite and ilmenite, with minor to trace amounts of hematite, rutile, titanite, ulvospinel and 
goethite.  Silicate minerals, which make up the bulk of the sands, are primarily quartz, plagioclase, 
amphibole,  chlorite,  mica  and  pyroxene  (SGS  Lakefield  Research,  2005a).    The  majority  of  the 
ilmenite (80-85% by volume) is associated with magnetite, titanomagnetite and hematite, with the 
remaining 15-20% by volume present as free ilmenite grains.
The  dune  sands  are  considered  to  be  the  product  of  aeolian  re-distribution  of  contemporary  and 
ancient  beach  sands  and  Quaternary  basin  sediments  derived  from  erosion  of  the  bedrock, 
winnowed,  and  re-distributed,  by  prevailing  winds  (Gay,  2005)  to  produce  potentially  economic 
concentrations of magnetite in extensive, and partially active, dune fields.
8  Deposit Types
The dune sands fall into two deposit types based on dune morphology.  The first is stable pampa 
sand, consisting of a flat-to-gently-rolling sand apron surface similar to an “erg” or “sand sea”, with 
small active dunes superimposed.  The second is active dunes with little evidence of a stable sub-
stratum.  The deposit may be classified as a heavy minerals deposit, although one generated by wind 
rather than water processes, as is the norm.

Pampa el Toro Technical Report

The  Pampa  El  Toro  Dune  Field  is  aligned  approximately  N-S  around  the  western  and  southern 
flanks of the Cerro de Arena.  Surface area is >120km2, although 2005 sampling was confined to 
~63km2 in the southern and eastern parts of the field.  Around two thirds of this area (~41km2) is 
comprised mainly of stable pampa sands, predominantly in the south and south east.  The remaining 
1/3 of the area consists of active sand dunes, mainly in the northern parts of the area.  Active sand 
dunes are relatively small, and of similar size.  Cardero holds claims in ~100 km2 of the dune field. 
Topographically,  the  Pampa  El  Toro  Dune  Field  is  a  perched  dune  field,  situated  high  above  the 
desert plain.  Most of the area lies between 1000m and 1400m.a.s.l., elevation increasing from the 
south towards the northeast.  This is ~1000m above the level of the adjacent Acari Valley (elevation 
~150m  a.s.l.).    Sand  depth  is  a  minimum  of  141m  over  most  of  the  dune  filed,  and  geological 
reconstruction by Cardero suggests the dune field may attain thickness approaching 300 meters in 
places, although ultimate depths are unknown.
In general, particle sizes of pampa sands appeared to be somewhat coarser than active sand dunes, 
perhaps due to active winnowing, although both are fine-grained.
9  Mineralization
The magnetic minerals component of the dune sands is believed to have been derived from erosion 
of the bedrock, and also later Quaternary basin sediments which probably received their magnetic 
minerals  from  the  same  source.    The  magnetic  minerals  were  transported,  together  with  non-
magnetic  components,  by  prevailing  winds  (Gay,  2005),  to  produce  potentially  economic 
concentrations of magnetite in extensive, and still active, dune fields.
Magnetic  minerals  are  distributed  throughout  the  pampa-type  surface  sands  and  the  active  dune 
sands  as  rhythmically  repetitive  millimetre  thick  stratified  bands.  The  variable  intensity  of  the 
mineralization, both vertically and horizontally (up to 15.36 Wt% magnetic concentrate) is probably 
due to differential winnowing of pampa-type and active dune sands by winds of different strengths 
over different periods and in different locations.
Grain  size  analysis  of  sands  from  Pampa  El  Toro  showed  that  surface  pampa-type  sands  were 
generally somewhat coarser-grained than surface sands taken from active dunes in both of those two 
dune fields.  This may be explained by winnowing of the surface sands in areas with stable pampa-
type sands.
Le Couteur (2005) screened two active dune sand samples from the Pampa El Toro Dune Field, and 
found  that  63.5%  (for  the  coarser  grained  of  the  two  samples)  and  80%  (for  the  finer-grained 
sample)  of  the  magnetic  mineral  concentrate,  respectively,  was  contained  in  the  <150  micron 
fraction,  with  most  of  the  remaining  magnetic  fraction  reporting  to  the  slightly  coarser  150-250 
micron range.   Bateman  Minerals  and  Metals (Pty)  Ltd.,  reported  an  average  particle  size  of  125 
micron for MC “sinks” (TBE separation) carried out on a composite of ‘milled’ drillhole samples 
and  consequently  is  not  considered  to  be  representative  of  the  dune  field  (Rademeyer,  2006).  
Deeper,  pampa-type  sands  obtained  during  percussion  drilling  were  finer-grained  than  either  the 
active  dune  sands  or  the  pampa  sands,  although  there  is  overwhelming  evidence  (including  rock 
flour in recovered samples) that there was milling of the sands during drilling.

During Phase II percussion drilling and accompanying trenching, it was observed that the grain size 
of  material  collected  from  the  drillholes  was  significantly  finer  than  that  encountered  during 
trenching (Torres, 2006a).
The presence of fines in drillhole samples was corroborated by SRK who noted that material was 
being lost as fines through the cyclone exhaust and that fines captured as part of the sample were 
problematical when passed through the magnetic separator.  Fines tended to agglomerate and bounce 
off the drum during separation (Van der Merwe, 2006b).  This raises the possibility that the MCs of 
drillhole samples are systematically understated due to loss of magnetic minerals to fines.  The most 
recent  work  by  SRK  indicates  that  these  should  not  create  any  issues  from  a  resource  estimate 
perspective  since  the  resource  estimate  is  done  on  an  in  situ  basis,  before  any  magnetic 
concentration, and loss of fines during the drilling is not considered material because of the small 
weight  of  material  lost.  Furthermore  the  pilot  plant  tests  conducted  in  2008  have  shown  that 
magnetic concentrate recoveries from Pampa el Toro are a maximum of 7.5 wt% MC (see section 
16.16).
Preliminary  mineralogical  studies  by  Le  Couteur  (2005)  indicated  that  the  magnetic  concentrate 
consisted  mainly  of  titanomagnetite  (Fe2+{  Fe3+,  Ti}2O4),  magnetite  (Fe3O4)  and  minor  ilmenite 
(FeTiO3).    Detailed  point  counts  of  the  various  minerals  were  not  conducted  during  this  study.  
However, on the basis of 45 mineral grains in a polished section of the sample, Le Couteur estimated 
the composition to be around 50% titanomagnetite, 40% magnetite and 10% ilmenite.  It was also 
noted by Le Couteur that titanomagnetite and magnetite have been partially altered by martitization 
to titanohematite and hematite grains respectively, and that this alteration not only frequently follows 
octahedral planes bisecting the grains but also forms grain rims.
10  Exploration  
10.1  Surface Sand Sampling 
10.1.1 Reconnaissance Surface Sand Sampling Phase
The  sampling  crew  was  headed  by  consulting  geochemist  Stephen  Cook  (P.  Geo.)  of  Cook 
Geochemical  Consulting  and  supplemented  by  a  four-person  dune  buggy  crew  of  drivers  and 
mechanics.  (the  two  dune  buggies  working  in  tandem  for  safety  reasons)  Reconnaissance  surface 
sand samples were collected in each dune field at a 1km sample site spacing along north-south lines 
500m apart, with samples along adjacent lines being collected at 500m offsets as shown in Figure 
9.1. This corresponds to a northwest-southeast / northeast-southwest orientated square grid with a 
sample spacing of 707m.  The area sampled over pampa sands and dune sands at Pampa El Toro 
amounted to around 70-75 km2  
Regional  surface  sand  samples  were  processed  in  Canada  at  Vancouver  Indicator  Processors  Inc. 
laboratory, Burnaby, B.C.  Magnetic concentrates were prepared for each sample and weight-per-
cent magnetic concentrate (Wt% MC) content calculated.
10.1.2 Infill Surface Sand Sampling Phases I and II: Pampa El Toro
An  infill  surface  sand  sampling  programme  (Phase  I  Infill  Survey)  was  initiated  in  mid-January, 
2006, over Toro West, broadly covering the extent of sites reporting high (>5.0 Wt.% MC) values 
which were known from analytical results at that time.  The area covered by Phase I Infill Survey is

shown in Figure 9.2.  The objective of the infill surface sampling was to provide a more detailed 
understanding  of  grade  and  MC  distribution  in  the  surface  sands  by  increasing  the  original 
reconnaissance grid spacing (1000m x 500m, with 500m offset) to one of 250 m x 250 m along a N-
S and E-W oriented grid.  A total of 235 sites were sampled, covering an area of approximately 15 
km2. 
Following  the  infill  surface  sand  sampling  at  Toro  West,  a  Phase  II  infill  survey  commenced  in 
April, 2006, over the smaller Toro Southeast Zone, and also an area adjacent to the southwest corner 
of Toro West (Figure 9.2).  The distribution of samples, together with those of Phase I Infill Survey, 
are shown in Figure 9.2.  A total of 168 sites were sampled in Phase II Infill Survey (of which results 
are available for 164), covering an area of approximately 10 km2.

10.2  Trenching
Page 24
The results from Phase I percussion drilling showed a marked fall-off in MC values and grain size of 
material  recovered  from  the  first  few  meters  of  the  drill  holes,  downwards.    Therefore,  it  was 
decided  to  trench  alongside  existing  drillhole  sites  to  the  maximum  depth  (5-6  metres)  attainable 
with the equipment available in order to try to resolve this discrepancy.
A total of 41 trenches were excavated variously by bulldozer and excavator (as detailed in Section 
12.3.1) adjacent to previously drilled Phase II percussion drillholes.  The objective was to compare 
Wt.% MC separated from paired drillhole and trench samples over the 0 – 6 m depth interval from 
surface.
Reconnaissance surface sampling, Phase I infill surface sampling, the Toro West Zone of Phase II 
infill  surface  sampling,  and  Phase  I  Percussion  Drilling  Programme  were  all  carried  out  by 
contractor Cook Geochemical Consulting, of Victoria, BC, Canada.
The  Toro  Southeast  Zone  of  Phase  II  infill  surface  sampling,  Phase  II  Percussion  Drilling 
Programme and trenching were carried out by Cardero personnel under the supervision of Cardero’s 
Project Geologist following the protocols previously established by Cook Geochemical Consulting.

11  Drilling  
11.1  Percussion Drilling 
11.1.1 Percussion Drilling Programme:  Phase I
Page 25
A widely-spaced percussion drilling programme was conducted in November and December, 2005, 
over the Pampa El Toro Dune Field.  Nine drillholes were drilled mainly on the flat-to-gently-rolling 
pampa sands in the southern and central part of the dune field.  The holes were drilled with nominal 
2 km spacing along E-W oriented lines, with drill sites along adjacent lines being offset by 1km.  
Most of the drillholes were drilled to a depth of 100m, with two holes (PET-5 and PET-6) drilled to 
141m.    Eight  of  the  drillholes  terminated  in  sand and  therefore  remain  open  in  depth.    However, 
drillhole PET-12, one of two along the southern edge of the dune field, encountered bedrock at 38 m 
depth.  All these, and later drillholes, were drilled vertically.
Collar elevations of the drillholes ranged from 1,000 m.a.s.l. in the southern part of the area to a high 
of  1,529m.a.s.l.  in  the  northeast.    The  percussion  drilling  programme  was  truck-supported  and 
operated from a base in Lomas.  Drilling services were provided by GeoTech of Lima, equipment 
including a truck-mounted percussion drilling unit, a second truck with hydraulic crane to remove 
casings, a D-8 bulldozer to pull the trucks from site to site across the dune field and a local tractor 
contracted for miscellaneous tasks. 
Preparation of magnetic concentrates from these drillholes, and their subsequent assay for %Fe2O3, 
%TiO2 and related constituents were carried out at Acme Labs in Vancouver.
11.1.2 Percussion Drilling Programme:  Phase II
Following a recommendation from SRK (Van de Merwe, 2006), a 72 drillhole definition campaign 
was  designed  and  conducted  between  May  and  July  2006,  to  systematically  drill-test  an 
approximately 6.5km2 area of the Pampa El Toro  dune field to  a depth of  60m.  The programme 
included  a  combination  of  holes  at  both  500m  drill  centres  and  250  meter  drill  centres  (Error! 
Reference source not found.).  Approximately 2.5 km2 of the pampa sands were tested by holes 
with 250m centre separations.
The definition drill program was designed to test the central part of Toro West Zone where Phase II 
surface sand sampling had defined a broad area containing >5.0 Wt.% MC within which were two 
higher-grade  areas,  shown  as  Zone  “A”  and  Zone  ”B”  in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found., 
reporting mean values of 8.6 and 9.7 Wt.% MC respectively. Additional holes were drilled at the end 
of the programme to capture parts of zones “C” and “D” (Error! Reference source not found.).  
All of the drillholes were targeted to 60m.
Following the completion of the 72 drillhole definition campaign, a repeat of Phase I drillhole PET-
08 was drilled 5 m from the original in order that the results might be compared between Phase I and 
Phase II drilling.  It was during the process of splitting the samples from the PET-08 repeat hole that 
it became clear that the material retrieved appeared to be much finer grained than the surface sands 
with a significant amount of dust-particle-size fines, or “rock flour”.

At the drilling company’s suggestion, and in order to check whether or not the percussion bit in use 
was  grinding  the  sand  during  drilling,  a  different  type  of  bit  with  characteristics  that  might  not 
generate the same amount of in-hole friction was employed for the remainder of the Phase II drilling 
programme.    This  included  a)  the  additional  10  drillholes  capturing  parts  of  zones  “C”  and  “D”, 
mentioned above, b) duplicates (or “twins”) of 10 Phase II drillholes already drilled and c) a further 
10 drillholes (an “L” set), to provide details for geostatistical analysis, also on the recommendation- 
of SRK Consultants (Figure 11.2).  The characteristics of the samples appeared to be unchanged.
Field and laboratory processing of Phase II drillhole samples was carried out under the supervision 
of Cardero’s Project geologist.   Representative  splits of  borehole sand samples were  processed  at 
Cardero’s on-site magnetic separation laboratory at Lomas.

12  Sampling Method and Approach  
12.1  Reconnaissance and infill surface sand sampling 
12.1.1 Field collection methods
Page 29
In all cases, field sampling equipment consisted of a Jones riffle splitter with stainless steel catch 
pans, a series of steel sample collection pans, and a short-handled shovel.
Two different sampling techniques were employed for the pampa and active dune sands respectively.
a)
Pampa sands
After digging an 80-90 cm deep pit in the relatively flat-lying pampa, three vertical channel samples 
were  taken  by  sweeping  a  shovel  blade  upwards  from  base  to  top  along  different  parts  of  one 
sidewall of the pit (Figure 12.1).  Each of the three channel samples was split once in a Jones splitter, 
and a composite sample made by combining one of each of the three splits.  The remaining halves of 
the three splits were discarded.  The final sample weighed 10-12 kg.

for  collecting
b)
Active dune sands
A different collection method was adopted for the active dune sands, where a greater variation in 
results  was  considered  possible  from  the  constantly-shifting  dunes.    Nine  individual  sub-samples 
were  collected  on  a  north-oriented  cross,  with  the  designated  sample  site  location  at  its  centre 
(Figure 12.2).  Each of the nine sub-samples were taken as one “spade-full”, after scraping away the 
upper several centimetres of surface sand.  These individual samples were then riffle-split twice, and 
composited to produce a final sample weighing around 10-12 kg.

12.1.2 Sample documentation and security
Sample  site  locations  (UTM  coordinates,  WGS  84  datum,  18S  zone)  were  selected  in  advance  to 
ensure  that  any  sample  site  selection  biases  were  eliminated.    Sites  were  located  by  pre-entering 
coordinates  into  a  Garmin  GPS  and  utilizing  the  “go-to”  feature  to  travel  to  the  spot  with  a 
horizontal accuracy of approximately 5m.  Only a few sites were moved, minimally, from their pre-
ordained locations as a result of local conditions such as steep dune slopes.
At each site, UTM coordinates were re-read and recorded on field cards, along with sample number, 
site  number,  sample-type  information,  site  elevation,  duplicate  /  standard  status  (if  applicable), 
reference to digital photo of sample site and other relevant data as required.  Sample numbers were 
written two  or three times onto heavy-duty polythene sample  bags using indelible  markers, and  a 
numbered ticket detached from the respective field card placed in each bag.  Each sample bag was 
secured with heavy string and placed within protective rice sacks for transport via dune buggy and 
truck to the field camp at Lomas.
All  field  samples  were  temporarily  stored  in  a  locked  warehouse  with  night-watchman  cover  in 
Lomas, prior to being double bagged, trucked to Lima, and sea-freighted to Vancouver.
12.1.3 Quality control procedures in the field
Quality control procedures used to help quantify the extent of site and sampling variations included 
the collection of field duplicate samples, within-pit duplicate samples and splitter (check) duplicates 
at regular intervals, and also the incorporation of field standards into the collection suite.
Field duplicates were collected at the rate of one pair every ten samples.  Pampa site duplicates were 
collected by the method noted above (11.1.1a) from two adjacent pits dug approximately 3.5m apart.  
Dune sand site duplicates were collected by the method noted above (11.1.1b) but by moving the 
sites of individual sub-samples (and therefore the north-oriented cross as a whole), 3 metres to the

east  and  1  m  to  the  north  to  create  a  new  identical  sampling  cross  with  individual  sub-sample 
separation equivalent to that between pampa sample duplicates (Figure 12.3).
Within-pit duplicates also were collected at the rate  of one pair every ten samples.  Pampa sands 
within-pit duplicates were taken by the same methodology from the opposite wall of the same pit. 
Dune  sands  “within-pit”  duplicates  were  produced  by  repeating  the  process  described  in  11.1.1b 
above with a second sub-sample “spade-full” taken immediately adjacent to the first (Figure 12.4).
Splitter  duplicates  also  were  collected  at  the  rate  of  one  pair  for  each  ten  samples,  and  involved 
bagging separately but numbering identically each of the respective splits for a given sample site.  
However,  the  practice  of  taking  riffle  splitter  duplicates  to  test  for  variations  introduced  by  the 
splitting  method  was  later  discontinued  in  the  surface  sampling  programme  as  no  significant 
differences in results were detected between splitter duplicate pairs.
Slots for insertion of  field standard samples, included to  monitor  magnetic  concentrate separation 
processing  accuracy  and  precision,  were  left  open  every  20  samples.  As  no  standards  are 
commercially available for the separation of magnetic minerals from iron sands, a field standard was 
prepared from a high-magnetite site at Pampa El Toro. In the analytical assay suites, the magnetic 
concentrate from this sample was used as a drift monitor.

12.2  Percussion Drilling 
12.2.1 Field collection methods
Page 33
Sand  samples  were  obtained  from  the  drill  rig  at  one  metre  intervals,  discharged  into  heavy 
polythene  bags,  tied,  labelled,  and  left  onsite  for  splitting.    Each  1  metre  sample  weighed 
approximately  40-45kg.    Five-metre  composite  samples  were  prepared  by  splitting  the  sand 
recovered from each interval using a large “Jones Riffle Splitter”.  In each case, composites were 
prepared  by  pouring  the  five  bags  (approximately  200-250kg  total)  onto  large  plastic  trays, 
homogenizing, and splitting three times to produce a single 25-30kg composite sand sample for each 
5m  interval.    These  samples  were  transported  to  the  Lomas  laboratory  for  magnetic  separation.  
Reject  drilling  samples  are  stored  at  the  drilling  site,  buried  and  covered  with  sand  to  prevent 
deterioration of the bags due to ultraviolet radiation.
In  2008,  the  reject  drilling  samples  were  recovered,  re-split,  employing  the  same  procedures,  and 
reduced to 5kg representative composite samples for each 5m interval of drilling.  These samples 
were transported to the laboratory in Lomas and are stored as representative raw (unseparated) sand 
samples from the drilling campaigns.
12.2.2 Sample documentation and security
Sample documentation and security followed the same protocol as that adopted for reconnaissance 
and infill surface sand sampling described above. However, differential rather than hand-held GPS 
was used to position holes, and later to check coordinates of drill sites with greater confidence.
12.2.3 Quality control procedures in the field
Quality control procedures included the collection of splitter duplicates at regular intervals and the 
incorporation  of  field  standards  (for  magnetic  separation)  and  certified  reference  materials  (for 
analytical quality control) into the sample suite. Given the limitations of collecting drill hole samples 
compared  to  surface  samples,  it  was  not  possible  to  collect  the  equivalent  of  field  duplicate  or 
within-pit duplicate samples. It should be noted that in this case (cf. surface samples) the numbering 
scheme used for splitter duplicates ensures that their relation to adjacent samples remains blind to 
the processing laboratory (Figure 12.6).
Splitter duplicates were collected at a rate of one pair every 10 samples for the magnetic separation 
work, and one pair every 20 samples for the analytical work.  The location of splitter duplicates in 
the drill hole were chosen in advance, and the duplicates were prepared by retaining both halves of 
the third, and final, split of these samples during riffle splitting.  In these cases the usual split was 
retained for the routine sample, and the other split was retained as the splitter duplicate sample.
In the case of the raw (unseparated) sand samples, analytical (pulp) duplicates were also inserted, by 
means  of  leaving  an  ‘open’  sample  number  (empty  bag)  every  1  in  20  samples.  This  alerted  the 
laboratory to take a split of the previous sample after the pulverization stage.
Slots  for  insertion  of a  control  standard  were  left  open  at  a  rate  of  one in  20  drilling  samples.  A 
thoroughly-homogenized  field  standard  was  inserted  for  monitoring  the  quality  of  the  magnetic 
separation  work  and  as  an  analytical  drift  monitor  in  magnetic  concentrate  analyses.  Certified 
reference  materials  were  inserted  to  monitor  analytical  accuracy  in  the  raw  (unseparated)  sand

samples.  An  internal  standard  was  created  (MAG-1)  from  pulverized  and  homogenized  magnetic 
concentrate material and inserted into the magnetic concentrate analytical sample batches.
A typical 20-sample collection block used in drill hole sampling, showing splitter duplicate, control 
standard insertion frequency and labelling protocol is shown in Figure 12.6. In the case of Phase II 
drilling at Pampa El Toro, where the holes were drilled to 60 m depth, it was ensured that a single 
pair of splitter duplicates and a single field standard were included in each drillhole.

Figure 12.6
Typical quality control scheme used in the sampling of sands from a 
typical 100 metre-deep percussion borehole at Pampa El Toro.
12.3  Trenching  
12.3.1 Field collection methods
Trenching methods included the use of both a Cat D-8 Bulldozer, when this was on site to assist with 
the percussion drilling phase, and a Cat 330C Excavator.  Trenches were dug immediately adjacent 
to actual borehole sites for direct comparison purposes, and care was taken to avoid areas where the 
pampa  surface  had  been  disturbed  by  drilling-related  activity  or  contaminated  by  drill-generated 
fines.  In the case of the bulldozer, four samples were taken in the same way as pampa sands (section 
11.1.1a, above), with the first metre being sampled via an 80-90 cm deep pit. The first metre of sand 
was then scraped off with the bulldozer blade, using a graduated pole as depth reference, to form a 
platform from which the next pit could be dug to sample the 1.0-2.0 m interval.  In this way it was 
possible to sample 1.0 m intervals to a depth of 4.0m to 5.0m (Torres, 2006a; Torres, 2006b).
In the case of the 37samples obtained by excavator, the first sample from surface to a depth of 1.0 m 
was collected with a single rotation of the excavator bucket.  This was unloaded well away from the 
sides of the designed trench to form a small pile, from which a representative sample of around 25 
kg was then taken and bagged. The surrounding sand was then excavated to a depth of 1.0m over an 
area sufficient to ensure that the walls of the trench did not collapse into the trench and contaminate

subsequent samples as the trench was deepened.  The second sample was then collected with a single 
rotation  of  the  excavator  bucket  between  1.0m  and  2.0m.  This  process  was  repeated  in  1.0m 
intervals to 5.0m or 6.0m, depending on operating conditions.
12.3.2 Sample documentation and security
Sample documentation and security followed the same protocol as that adopted for reconnaissance 
and infill surface sand sampling described above. Samples were numbered in a way which related 
them to the adjacent borehole and depth from which they were collected.
12.3.3 Quality control procedures in the field
Trench  sites  were  located  adjacent  to  existing  percussion  drillhole  sites  in  order  to  verify  the 
consistency of data obtained by percussion drilling over the first five metres. Due to the instability of 
loose,  dry  sand  under  trenching  conditions,  and  the  probability  of  “run-in”  of  loose  material  and 
contamination of repeat samples taken from the same point, field duplicate and within-pit duplicate 
samples were not included in the sample suite. Splitter duplicates were also omitted because of the 
lack  of  significant  differences  detected  between  splitter  duplicate  pairs  in  the  results  from 
reconnaissance and infill surface sand sampling.
12.4  Bulk Sample Collection 
12.4.1 Field Collection Methods
A  2500  ton  bulk  sand  sample  from  the  Pampa  el  Toro  property  was  collected  in  November-
December 2007 for processing at a magnetic separation pilot plant facility in the town of Acari.  The 
sample was taken from two separate areas within the high-grade core of the property to a depth of 
1m with the use of a backhoe and transported by truck to a secure pilot plant site facility in Acari.
The sample  is  determined  to  be  representative  of  the  known  magnetic  concentrate  grade  over the 
high-grade core of the property where contingent on ongoing results any future mining operation is 
most likely to commence; however, it was not possible to adequately test the sub-surface below 1m 
depth.
12.4.2 Sample documentation and security
Tonnage  by  truck  haul  was  tallied  at  the  site  and  2500  tons  were  collected.    The  stockpile  was 
covered  securely  in  tarpaulin  to  avoid  contamination  and/or  upgrade  of  the  bulk  sample  due  to 
aeolian processes.  The site facility is a secure area with guarded surveillance twenty-four hours a 
day.
12.4.3 Quality control procedures in the field
The sample areas were located by GPS, staked and flagged in the field.

samples 
All  reconnaissance  surface  sand  samples  were  trucked  from  the  Lomas  field  warehouse  to  Lima, 
Peru and then shipped to North America.  Samples were shipped in secure wooden crates to protect 
against any damage to the plastic sample bags while in transit.  They were forwarded to Vancouver 
Indicator  Processors  Inc.  laboratory  (VIPI),  Burnaby,  B.C.,  Canada,  for  magnetic  separation  of 
magnetite grains from the sands, and subsequent determination of the percent magnetic concentrate 
in each sample.
VIPI laboratory was primarily a heavy mineral lab for the diamond exploration industry, and was 
equipped  with  suitable  magnetic  concentration  equipment  for  processing  iron  sands  samples.    All 
magnetic separation work was conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Peter Le Couteur of VIPI, 
and the following details of the equipment and the separation procedure are taken from his report (Le 
Couteur, 2005).
The field samples, generally between 9kg and 13kg each in weight, were weighed as received at the 
Burnaby laboratory, and magnetic concentrates prepared using a ‘scalper’ magnet to remove only 
ferromagnetic mineral grains (ie. only magnetic, not paramagnetic, mineral particles).  The scalper 
unit  comprises  an  Eriez  sample  hopper  and  vibratory  feed  chute  coupled  with  a  new  Outukumpu 
Model LP10 dry permanent magnet with a weak magnetic field (approx. 0.05 Tesla).  The sample 
was fed from the hopper down the vibrating chute, and slides under gravity across the magnet.  The 
magnet attracts ferromagnetic particles into one receiving pan beneath the magnet, allowing all other 
non-magnetic grains to pass undeflected into a second receiving pan.  A single-pass procedure was 
used for all sand samples.
13.1.2 Magnetic  separation  and  processing  of  drillhole  and  infill  surface  sand
samples 
Magnetic  separation  of  drillhole  and  infill  surface  sand  samples  from  the  Toro  West  and  Toro 
Southeast  infill  surveys,  was  carried  out  on-site  at  Cardero’s  Lomas  field  facility  beginning  in 
January,  2006,  using  an  Eriez  Model  FR  ferrite  radial  drum  magnetic  separator.    This  work  was 
carried out by, or under the direction of, Cardero’s Project Geologist.
The  equipment  and  laboratory  was  tested  by  Dr.  P.  Le  Couteur  in  January,  2006,  and  set  up  for 
optimum performance on-site (Le Couteur, 2006).
Drillhole and/or infill surface sand samples were weighed in the warehouse using a high-capacity 
Bascula  PCR-40  electronic  balance  (40  kg  capacity),  and  then  processed  using  the  magnetic 
separator.    Material  was  fed  from  the  sample  hopper  onto  the  rotating  magnetic  drum  using  a 
vibratory  chute  feeder.    Non-magnetic  reject  material  passes  over  the  rotating  drum  and  was 
captured  by a  large  tray prior  to re-bagging  and  storage.   Ferromagnetic  minerals attracted  to the 
drum were captured in a smaller tray positioned beneath it.  After primary magnetic separation, the 
magnetic concentrate was fed through the separator a second time to remove any adhering silicate

Page 37 
grains.  The subsequent, second-pass concentrate was retained, bagged and weighed using a Bascula 
LEQ-5  electronic  balance  (5kg  capacity),  and  the  weight  per  cent  magnetic  concentrate  content 
calculated. The weight of the first-pass concentrate was also recorded, and the resulting ‘middlings’ 
sample fraction from the second pass bagged and retained for any possible future use (Cook, 2006).
Following  observations  by  SRK  during  an  April  2006  visit  to  the  Lomas  field  facility  (Van  der 
Merwe, 2006b), Cardero field operators introduced a third pass to the separation process whereby 
the second pass concentrate was fed through the separator a third time to remove remaining non-
magnetic material and to further clean the concentrate.  Van der Merwe had noted that a comparison 
of four samples that were processed by both the Vancouver Indicator Processors Inc. and the Lomas 
facility showed consistent better recovery of ‘magnetic concentrate’ by the Lomas separator.  It is 
possible  that  the  Lomas  machine  might  have  been  over-recovering  “magnetic  concentrate”  by 
including some non-magnetic fraction (Van der Merwe, 2006).  Therefore, from April 2006, it was 
the third-pass concentrate that was retained, bagged and weighed, and the weight per cent magnetic 
concentrate content calculated.  The weight of the second-pass concentrate was also recorded, and 
rejects from the third pass were added to the ‘middlings’ sample fraction from the second pass noted 
above.
13.1.3 Quality control and security
a)
VIPI Laboratory
Le Couteur (2005) conducted several tests to determine the efficiency of magnetic separation at the 
VIPI  Laboratory.    Results  of  these  tests  suggested  that  the  VIPI  scalping  magnet  recovers  most 
(approximately 90% of the total ferromagnetic material) in the first pass.  Tests of several samples 
which  were  processed  using  between  four  passes  and  ten  passes  through  the  magnetic  separator 
showed  that  most  of  the  magnetite,  about  87-94%  of  the  total,  was  removed  in  the  first  pass.  
Typically  the  second  pass  yielded  only  a  small  amount  of  magnetite,  in  the  range  3.3–4.7%,  and 
subsequent  passes  yielded  progressively  smaller  and  smaller  amounts.    Nevertheless  the  single 
sample which was subjected to ten passes through the separator (87% magnetic mineral recovery on 
the first pass) yielded a small amount of magnetic material even on the tenth pass (0.6%).
Lomas Facility
Reproducibility testing, involving two samples which were processed 5 times each, showed a high 
degree of replicate precision in the magnetic separation results.  Replicate results were within about 
±3% of mean values, varying only narrowly in the range 4.11-4.21% in one case, and in the range 
1.77-1.87% in the second case (Le Couteur, 2005). 
b) 
Following  initial  set  up  of  the  magnetic  separator  at  the  Lomas  field  facility  in  December,  2005, 
testing  of  optimal  operating  parameters  for  processing  iron  sands  samples  was  carried  out  VIPI 
Laboratory during a visit to Lomas in mid-January 2006 (Le Couteur, 2006).  Le Couteur determined 
that an extraction efficiency of about 98% magnetite was achieved from test samples using a feed 
rate of 3.5 kg/minute and a drum rotation speed of about 118 rpm.  These settings were adopted as 
the standard separator operation settings for the Pampa El Toro sand samples although, as he notes 
in his report, a wider range of feed rate settings is possible.  Tests showed that a 25kg sand sample 
could, ideally, be processed in about 7 minutes at the recommended settings.

A calibration standard, prepared by Le Couteur, was run at the start of every magnetic separation 
processing  session  in  Lomas  in  order  to  test  the  functioning  of  the  magnets  and  the  apparatus  in 
general.    This  calibration  standard  is  separated,  the  weights  are  recorded,  and  the  standard  is 
subsequently re-combined for processing at the start of the next session.  The reproducibility of the 
results  has  shown  to  be  exemplary,  and  this  demonstrates  that  any  over-time-drift  of  the  magnet 
and/or apparatus function is insignificant.
13.2  Sample analysis and assay procedures
Raw (unseparated) sand samples from all boreholes (5 m intervals) were submitted for analysis. In 
addition,  a  subset  of  magnetic  concentrates  and  ‘middlings’  samples  were  analysed  at  Acme 
Analytical  Laboratory  (ISO  9001:2000  accredited),  Vancouver,  British  Columbia.  These  samples 
form the basis of the data that was used for Mineral Resource estimation.
13.2.1 Sample Preparation
For raw (unseparated) sand analyses, 250-300 g of material are riffle-split from the representative 
drilling interval samples (5kg each) at the Lomas facility by Cardero employees. The samples are 
forwarded to Acme Labs for pulverization by ceramic ring mill and analysis.
Upon arrival at the Acme Analytical Laboratory, Vancouver, each magnetic concentrate sample is 
rolled thoroughly on a large clean piece of paper to ensure that it was adequately mixed prior to the 
separation of an approximately 200-250 g sub-sample.  The sample is pulverized, using a ceramic, 
rather than steel, ring mill to prevent any possible iron contribution to (and contamination of) the 
concentrate  during  ring  milling.    All  unused  magnetic  concentrate  material  are  retained  in  the 
original  sample  bag;  and  the  pulverized  magnetic  concentrate  pulp  material  is  retained  in  an 
additional bag.
13.2.2 Analysis
Group 4A major element oxide suite
All samples were analyzed at Acme laboratories for potentially economic elements including total 
iron, titanium and vanadium, and for  potentially deleterious constituents  such  as  %SiO2,  %Al2O3, 
%MgO and %P2O5, by the following total-decomposition methods: 
a) 
This whole rock package uses a LiBO2 fusion and dilute nitric acid digestion of a 0.2 g sub-sample 
with  an  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  –  Optical  Emission  Spectroscopy  (ICP-OES)  finish.  
Constituents determined are SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O, MnO, TiO2, P2O5, Cr2O3, 
LOI, Total C and Total S.  The analytical upper limits of each of these determinations are stated by 
Acme Labs to be 100%, suitable for the high-iron composition of the magnetic concentrates. 
b)
Total vanadium
Determination of total vanadium was conducted as part of the Group 4B suite of elements, including 
the rare earths.  This total determination method involves the fusion of a 0.2 gram sub-sample by 
LiBO2/Li2B4O7 fusion followed by an ICP/MS finish.  
The magnetic concentrate samples submitted from the Phase II drilling program followed the same 
analytical  procedures  as  listed  above,  however  with  a  0.1  g  sub-sample  weight  (refer  to  section 
14.1.2).

14.1  Cardero Verification 
14.1.1 Quality Control Procedures
Page 39
Magnetic concentrates of all duplicate samples including field, within-pit and splitter duplicates for 
reconnaissance and infill surface sand samples, and splitter duplicates from Phase I drillhole sand 
samples  were  analyzed  along  with  concentrates  from  the  routine  surface  sand  and  drillhole  sand 
samples.  The field standard sample was analyzed in replicate seven times for the reconnaissance 
suite.
CANMET iron ore CRM MW-1 was  initially inserted  as an  assay standard in the reconnaissance 
program,  but  after  the  laboratory  reported  continued  problems  in  fusing  this  material,  two  drift 
monitors were instead created from the pulverized pulp material of two routine borehole samples.  
Multiple  insertions  of  the  two  sets  of  drift  monitors  into  the  magnetic  concentrate  assay  suites 
permitted an evaluation of analytical precision, if not absolute accuracy.  Raw sand borehole samples 
included  splitter  duplicates  and  preparation  duplicates,  each  inserted  at  a  rate  of  one  per  twenty 
samples.    Preparation  duplicates  were  split  at  Acme  laboratories  from  the  original  sample  after 
pulverization and before analysis.  A Certified Reference Material (OREAS 42P, 8.8% Fe; GBAP6, 
4.8% Fe; or Blank, <1.5% Fe) was also inserted into the sample sequence at a rate of 5%.
The  laboratory  also  reports  their  internal  quality  control  data,  which  includes  pulp  duplicates 
(identical split as the preparation duplicates), blanks and standards each at a rate of approximately 
per forty samples.
14.1.2 Internal and External Check Assays
Subsequent to the primary magnetic concentrate assays, a suite of magnetic concentrates from two 
complete drillholes (PET-03 and PET-08) was submitted in entirety for both internal and external 
check assays, providing a total of three comparative assay results for magnetic concentrates prepared 
from  these  borehole  sands.    Each  hole  comprised  20  sample  intervals,  and  in  addition  to  this  all 
splitter duplicate samples and drift monitor insertions which had previously been part of this group 
of  samples  were  also  included  in  the  subsequent  check  assays.    Internal  check  assays  for  iron, 
titanium and vanadium using the Group 7PF sodium peroxide fusion method for refractory ores was 
conducted at Acme Labs, using pulverized pulp material which had been previously prepared for the 
primary assays.  The Group 7PF peroxide fusion method was chosen here to i) provide alternative 
results to the Group 4A whole rock fusion method which, as all analyses necessarily total to 100%, 
might be affected by mathematical closure, and ii) to determine if a more aggressive fusion method 
is required to deal with any refractory minerals which might be present in the magnetic concentrates.
In addition, external check assays of all magnetic concentrate samples from the same two complete 
drillholes  (PET-03  and  PET-08)  were  carried  out  at  ALS  Chemex  Laboratories  (ISO  9001:2000 
accredited), North Vancouver, B.C.  Pulverized pulps were forwarded to ALS Chemex from Acme 
Labs,  and  a  suite  of  CANMET  CRM  MW-1  samples  were  also  sent  for  inclusion  in  the  ALS 
Chemex analytical suite as blind standards (Cook, 2006).
The internal and external check assays of the magnetic concentrate samples highlighted an issue with 
the  laboratory  initially  underestimating  the  grade  of  %V  and  %TiO2  in  the  Group  4A  and  4B
WANL/wanl

analyses.  Upon further investigation, it was discovered by the laboratory that halving the sample 
weight  would  ensure  a  complete  fusion  of  the  sample  material.    The  results,  expressed  here  as 
percent  change  from  the  original  method,  are  an  average  increase  by  35%  (±13%)  in  TiO2,  40% 
(±19%) in V and a decrease by 2% (±2%) in Fe2O3.  These results suggest that the original Phase I 
drillhole analytical results as reported by Cook (2006) may be upgraded to 4.8 wt.% TiO2 and 2217 
ppm V, while Fe2O3 is downgraded to 58.0 wt.%.  Given the minor changes in assay grades, Cardero 
elected not to have the analytical batches re-analysed in entirety.
In the SRK’s opinion, and on the basis of all the information that is available to them, quality control 
of  sample  preparation,  analytical  and  assay  procedures,  and  security  including  chain  of  custody 
procedures, followed industry best practice standards.
14.2  SRK Verification
Cardero  supplied  SRK  with  assay  results  from  the  analysis  of  two  Certified  Reference  Materials 
(CRMs) (fourteen results for OREAS 42P and eleven results for GBAP-6) and three sets of samples 
that were analysed in duplicate by Acme Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Forty one duplicates (splitter or field duplicates) were taken in the field during the sample splitting 
process  from  the  final  split.  Forty  one  duplicates  identified  and  requested  by  Cardero  were  taken 
after pulverization (“Preparation duplicates”), and twenty seven pulp duplicates (“Pulp duplicates”) 
were selected by the laboratory for their own internal quality control after pulverization and at the 
sample weighing stage. The CRM’s are commercially available pulps created by Ore Research & 
Exploration Pty (Ltd) for OREAS 42P and Geostats Pty (Ltd) for GPAB-6.
OREAS  42P  is  a  composite  standard  produced  from  a  range  of  oxidized  materials,  but 
predominantly a gold bearing greywacke. GPAB-6 is a Bauxite pulp sourced from material in the 
Gove  Peninsula,  Northern  Territory,  Australia.  Both  CRM’s  are  certified  for  Fe2O3  content,  and 
other  major element oxides. OREAS42P was analysed by Borate fusion disc X-Ray Fluorescence 
(“XRF”),  while  GPAB-6  was  analysed  by  both  XRF  and  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  (“ICP”) 
analyses  (the  certification  is  not  specific  as  to  the  finish  used  with  the  ICP  method,  but  this  is 
typically assumed to be Optical Emission Spectroscopy (“OES”)).
Both  the  CRM’s  and  the  duplicate  analytical  results  have  been  analysed  by  SRK  and  selected 
statistics  and  graphics,  and  the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  analysis  are  summarized  below.  The 
certified  values  for  selected  variable  are  presented  in  Table  14.1  and  Table  14.2  along  with  the 
estimated acceptance limits (calculated as 5% above and below the certified value) and the mean of 
all the assays and the difference between the average of the assays and the certified value, expressed 
as a percentage of the certified value.

For Fe2O3, SiO2, K2O and TiO2 percentages the analyses of both CRM’s show a small difference 
between the average of the assay values and the certified value. All but one Fe2O3 assays fall within 
the 5% acceptance bracket values, while two of each of the SiO2 and TiO2 analyses of the GPAB-6 
CRM are outside the 5% bracket values. One of the OREAS 42P K2O values falls outside the 5% 
bracket values.
In contrast, of the nine GPAB-6 assay results for Vppm, only one is within the bracket values and 
there appears to be a small positive bias in the Vppm values. %MgO shows a small negative bias but 
good precision with none of the assay results falling outside the 5% bracket values. %MnO, %P2O5 
and  %Na2O are  all  close  to  the  detection  limit.  All  %MnO  values  are reported  at  detection  limit, 
while  the  P2O5  and  Na2O  results  are  highly  variable,  and  are  not  considered  precise  at  the  CRM 
certified  value  levels.  Time  sequence  control  plots  of  Fe2O3  %,  SiO2  %,  TiO2  %  and  V  ppm  are 
presented in Figure 14.1 to Figure 14.4.

Duplicate  analyses  were  performed  on  a  three  sets  of  samples  split  in  the  field  or  after  pulping 
(Splitter,  preparation  and  pulp  duplicates)  stages  of  the  sample  preparation  process  as  described 
above. Typically the splitter duplicates are expected to have a lower level of accuracy than the pulp 
duplicates, as the inhomogeneity in the raw samples results in differences between the splits. In this 
instance, the field duplicates show similar levels of accuracy to the pulp duplicates as illustrated in 
the three scatter plots in Figure 14.5.  The graphs plot the original assay against the duplicate assay 
for each of the three datasets. The green line represents where the ideal correlation, where original 
and  duplicate  analyses  return  identical  values,  the  dashed  black  lines  are  a  10%  error  around  the 
ideal correlation, the blue line represents the Reduced Major Axis (RMA) trend line for the data, and 
the red points represent actual assay results. All three graphs show similar ranges of data, clustering 
of the data around the ideal correlation line, and RMA lines. The slope, Y axis intercept and errors 
on the slope and Y axis intercept listed on each graph relate to the RMA line.

Figure 14.5:  Scatter  plots  of  Fe2O3  duplicate  analyses  from  Splitter,  Preparation
and Pulp datasets
SRK’s  analysis  of  the  duplicate  assay  results  focussed  principally  on  Fe2O3,  %TiO2,  Vppm  and 
%SiO2 results, although additional checks were performed on minor constituent element results such 
as  %CaO,  %MgO,  %Na2O,  %K2O,  %P2O5  and  %Al2O3.  In  all  cases,  for  all  three  datasets  the

duplicate results were found to have a good correlation, low scatter and no evidence of any bias. The 
correlations and relative errors are consistent for all three datasets as discussed above, and SRK have 
elected  to  present  some  of  the  analytical  results  from  the  Pulp  duplicate  analytical  dataset  in  this 
section.  Summary  statistics  for  the  major  element  results  from  the  pulp  duplicate  analyses  are 
presented in Table 14.3. All the variables presented in Table 14.3 have less than 1% difference in the 
means, and excellent correlation coefficients. The scatter plots of the original versus duplicate pulp 
analysis datasets for %SiO2, %Fe2O3, %TiO2 and Vppm are presented in Figure 14.6 to Figure 14.9.

analytical  datasets  using  the  Half  Absolute  Relative  Difference  (“HARD”)  statistics  and  plots. 
HARD Plots for SiO2, Fe2O3, TiO2 and V are presented in Figure 14.10 to Figure 14.13. The HARD 
value is calculated by the following formula (with A and B representing the original and duplicate
analyses)
i.e.  the  absolute  difference  of  the  duplicate  assay  pair  divided  by  the
average of the pair, and then multiplied by 0.5. The HARD value is expressed as a percentage. In a 
high quality dataset, 90% of the sample pairs have a HARD value of less than 10%. In the HARD 
plots in Figure 14.10 to Figure 14.13 the target accuracy is represented by the green block. The blue 
line represents the ranked HARD values for all assay pairs. In all cases the blue line passes through 
the green block, indicating a high accuracy dataset. The HARD statistics are comparable for all three 
datasets, and for all the minor elements analysed.

In  summary,  SRK  consider  that  Cardero  have  a  suitable  quality  control  program  in  place  for 
ensuring  the  precision  and  accuracy  of  their  assays,  and  that  the  assay  results  are  of  sufficient 
accuracy and precision for use in Mineral Resource estimation. The quality of the assay results does 
not represent a limiting constraint in the classification of the Mineral Resources.

15  Adjacent Properties
Page 52
To the knowledge of SRK and Cardero, there are no properties immediately adjacent to the Pampa el 
Toro property currently undergoing exploration by another company. Cardero Resource Corp. owns 
the rights to the Carbonera Iron Sands property approximately 50km to the northwest of Pampa el 
Toro (4,195.12 ha). It underwent initial exploratory investigations concurrently with the Pampa el 
Toro  property.  Surface  sand  samples  were  collected  and  anomalous  areas  identified,  however  the 
property has  not  been drill tested. One bulk  sand sample from this property was  processed  at the 
magnetic separation pilot plant for investigative purposes.
16  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing  
Cardero has undertaken metallurgical test work on block samples obtained from the Pampa el Toro 
dune site, and the results are described in this section. SRK has not currently undertaken any review 
of the metallurgical results presented herein. Review of these results is planned to follow the Mineral 
Resource estimate when SRK have been requested to undertake a Preliminary Economic Assessment 
on the Pampa el Toro project.
16.1  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 2005 - 2007
Five  bulk  sand  samples  have  been  submitted  to  various  consultants  and  laboratories  in  order  to 
ascertain the optimum process for magnetic concentration of the iron sands, as well as upgrading the 
recovery of Fe, and in the case of Midrex, %TiO2 and %V2O5 as well.  A summary of the sample 
origin and results are presented in Table 16.1 
Summary  of  source  and  results  of  tests  conducted 
on five bulk samples from Pampa el Toro and two bulk samples from Carbonera – 2005-2007.

The primary objective was to ascertain the purity level of the magnetic concentrate, and determine 
whether  grinding would  be  a  viable  exercise in  order  to  upgrade  the  Fe  content  and  decrease the 
amount  of  impurities.    Mineralogical  investigations  (optical  microscopy,  electron  microprobe 
analysis  and  x-ray  diffraction)  were  undertaken  on  the  second-pass  MC  (#2  ROM)  in  order  to 
ascertain  the  host  of  titanium  in  the  ore,  a  penalty  element  or  impurity  when  trying  to  produce  a 
marketable iron concentrate (SGS Lakefield 2005a). 
Mineralogical  studies  confirmed  that  only  fine  grinding  to  micron-scale  would  lower  the  TiO2 
concentration, which would be cost prohibitive from a production perspective.  The authors of the 
report recommend that cleaning of the Fe ore not by a physical process, but rather by a metallurgical 
process (eg. Fastmelt by Midrex) is a viable option.  The magnetic concentrate produced from these 
tests was forwarded to Midrex Technical Center for preliminary testing with Fastmelt.
16.15.2
Midrex Test (2005)
Based on positive results from preliminary testwork by Midrex (Ripke, 2005)), Cardero Resource 
Corp. supplied Midrex Technologies with a large bulk surface raw sand sample (1060 kg; August 
2005)  from  the  Carbonera  dunes  area  for  more  comprehensive  testing  of  magnetic  concentrate 
processing (separation) and the feasibility of Fe concentrate upgrading utilizing the Fastmelt process.  
Single pass magnetic separation of raw magnetite sands was deemed to be sufficient (12 in diameter, 
5.5 in wide laboratory drum magnet separator at a feed rate of 41Kg/hour at 1.4 DC amps), and the 
bulk sample was processed in this manner.  The magnetic concentrate grade obtained was 11.43 Wt. 
%, with a total Fe content of 59.70% (of which 69.22% is recoverable), 2.02% TiO2 and 0.80% V2O5 
(Ripke 2005).
16.15.3
Solumet Upgrading Test (2006)
In order to independently assess the quality of the magnetic concentrate as well as any upgrading 
potential of the Fe ore, Worldlink Resources Canada appointed Solumet Metallurgical Solution Inc. 
(2006) to study a magnetic concentrate provided by Cardero Resource Corp.  The 2 tonne magnetic 
concentrate was produced from surface sands at Pampa El Toro using the dry magnetic processing 
facilities onsite in Lomas.  Magnetic concentrate grade recovery was not calculated by Cardero for 
this bulk sample.
Work conducted on behalf of Solumet by SGS Lakefield Research Ltd. concluded that upgrading by 
magnetic separation without grinding is feasible into a product with 75.5% Fe2O3 (52.8% Fe) and a 
recovery of 67% of the iron, and that further upgrading to 87.5% Fe2O3 (61.2% Fe) with an overall 
recovery  of  58%  of  the  iron  is  possible.    However,  best  concentrates  achieved  still  contained 
between five and six percent TiO2, which is detrimental to concentrate quality.  Mineralogy showed 
that the titanium is mainly contained in the form of ilmenite, intimately and finely exsolved in the 
crystal lattices of magnetite and hematite.  Liberation of such ilmenite for physical separation would 
require  milling to a likely-uneconomic micron size, and separation of the titanium during melting 
remains probably the best solution.
Preliminary grinding and wet magnetic separation (Davis Tube analysis) tests were carried out on a 
sub-sample.    A  process  was  then  designed  for  the  remainder  of  the  bulk  sample  that  involves 
grinding the concentrate to <180  microns, then passing the concentrate in a slurry over three low 
intensity magnetic separators (LIMS) to produce an upgraded product.

The result of this test is a concentrate containing 66.20% FeTOT (upgraded from 63.5%), 3.56% TiO2, 
0.56% V2O5 and 0.18% P2O5.  Grinding studies demonstrated that P2O5 concentration decreased with 
grinding,  whereas  TiO2  and  V2O5  concentrations  remained  roughly  the  same.    The  findings 
corroborated previous mineralogical studies (SGS Lakefield, 2005a, 2005b; LeCouteur, 2005) which 
demonstrate that TiO2 is encapsulated within the magnetite crystals as ilmenite lamellae, and, in the 
case of V2O5, within the magnetite crystal lattice itself.  Solumet states that, although the overall Fe 
content is adequately upgraded, the elevated concentrations of impurities are problematic.  Solumet 
stated that the product may be classified as a secondary quality Fe ore concentrate for direct shipping 
purposes.
16.15.4
Eriez Magnetic Separation Test (2006)
A 155kg sample of raw surface sands from Pampa El Toro was submitted to Eriez Magnetics Test 
and Research & Development, Pennsylvania (Eriez, 2006) in order to ascertain the optimum magnet 
and  feeder  set-up  for  processing  the  iron  sands  in  addition  to  independently  repeat  the  above 
Solumet test-work.  The results of this test were not definitive, as multiple tests were not carried out 
on several machines and compared.  Rather, the bulk sample was passed over a DFA-25 Drum at a 
setting of 10 tons per hour per foot (t/h/f) and drum speed of 500 feet per minute (f/m), and a second 
pass of the magnetic fraction at different settings (5t/h/f and 750 f/m).  This resulted in a magnetic 
concentrate grade of 2.67 Wt. %.  A sub-sample of the non-magnetic fraction from the first pass was 
passed over a SPRE 15-inch drum (settings not specified).  The result from this second test, back 
calculated,  was  12.70  Wt.  %  magnetic  concentrate.    Samples  of  each  fraction  were  returned  to 
Cardero, which were in turn analysed at Acme Laboratories in Vancouver.  The analytical results of 
the final magnetic concentrate were 53.36% FeTOT, 5.52% TiO2 and 0.43% V2O5.
16.15.5
Midrex Test (2006)
A  second  bulk  sample  (435.6  kg)  of  Pampa  El  Toro  raw  sand  was  submitted  to  Midrex.    The 
mandate was to dry-magnetically-separate the raw sand in order to achieve a target minimum 62% 
FeTOT with favourable recoveries.  The processing equipment chosen for the test was an Eriez drum 
separator  (type  “A”  –  agitator  type)  with  “Erium  25”  axial  magnetic  fields  using  barium-ferrite 
ceramic  permanent  magnets.    This  equipment  was  run  on  sub-samples  at  several  different  drum 
speed  settings from  which samples  were split off and analysed to determine the optimum setting. 
30 rpm  produced  the  best  grade  of  60.1%  recovered  Fe.    A  three-stage  dry  magnetic  separation 
process was then designed.  The result of the test is 7.1 wt. % magnetic concentrate of the ROM that 
contains 59.1% FeTOT, 4.1% TiO2 and 0.45% V2O5 with Fe recovery of 47.39%.  Recommendations 
in the report include the possibility of crushing the coarse size fraction of the magnetic concentrate 
in order to liberate non-magnetic material (silica and silicates adhering to magnetite) and potentially 
up-grade the product to the target grade of 62% Fe.
16.15.6
Bateman Engineering Test (2006)
After the phase II drilling program, a bulk sample (480 kg) of raw sand from a composite of ten 
drillholes (0-60 m depth) were submitted to Bateman Minerals and Metals (South Africa) for another 
magnetic separation process study (Rademeyer 2006).
Initial testing was performed on a small sub-sample of the drilling sands. 12.6 wt. % of the ROM 
reported to the sinks after heavy liquid separation (SG > 2.95).  The sinks were analyzed by XRF 
and contain 33.4% Fe2O3 and 3.38% TiO2.  Particle size analysis was performed on both the ROM

and  sinks  using  wet  screening  techniques  to  reduce  fines  loss.    Results  demonstrated  that  the 
prevailing particle sizes for the ROM and sinks are 180um and 125um respectively.  Dry magnetic 
separation on a sub-sample was performed (Carpo Laboratory Scale Induced Roll Lift Magnet) as 
well  as  optimization  of  the  magnet  strength  to  balance  magnetic  concentrate  grade  and  Fe2O3 
recovery.    The  required  strength  was  determined  as  0.09  amps  (81%  Fe2O3,  5.44%  TiO2  with  a 
magnetic concentrate grade of 2.9% of the ROM).
The bulk processing test was designed to assess the performance of an Eriez rare earth drum magnet 
(RED) in creating a high-iron magnetic concentrate.  After extensive testing, a process flow diagram 
was produced and recoveries and grades calculated.  The final recommendation for a plant is based 
on a three stage circuit: two passes through a RED magnet and a final electrostatic circuit upgrade 
to  make  a  product  grade  of  79.8%  Fe2O3  (55.86%  FeTOT),  4.89%  TiO2  and  0.22%  P2O5  from  a 
magnetic concentrate grade of 2.75 wt. % of the ROM.
16.15.7
Bateman Engineering Test (2007)
A second bulk sample was sent to Bateman Engineering of raw sand from trenching at Pampa el 
Toro (622.8 kg).  The scope of this test was to determine the suitability of upgrading the sand with 
use of gravity spirals and follow-up wet magnetic separation, while at the same time compare these 
results to dry magnetic separation of a representative split of the ROM.
The dry magnetic separation process included 4 stages of magnetic separation.  The result for the 
best iron grade concentrate, albeit at lower recoveries, was after a simple two-pass process over an 
Eriez Model 380mm diameter BaFe drum magnet.
The  spiral  gravity  separation  tests  were  performed  with  a  Multotec  SC18  spiral  at  varying  feed 
densities  and  rates.    This  effectively  removed  much  of  the  gangue  material;  however  a  further 
upgrading by wet magnetic separation was necessary due to the large amount of heavy non-magnetic 
minerals.    The  wet  magnetic  separations  of  the  concentrate  were  done  in  a  slurry  of  water.    The 
resulting concentrate contained 50% Fe, and a final milling stage was tested to further upgrade the 
material.  With the possibility of further refining the milling stage parameters (as this step was not 
part of the original work proposal), the final concentrate was upgraded to 60.32% Fe with a mass 
recovery of 3.35%.

Mineral Processing
The  major  equipment  supply  for  a  dry  magnetic  separation  pilot  plant  was  provided  by  Eriez 
Manufacturing  Co.  with  input  from  Cardero  Resource  Corp.,  based  on  the  small-scale  laboratory 
magnetic separation of Pampa El Toro iron sand feed conducted during 2005 and 2006 as reported 
previously.  The equipment packages were then fabricated and delivered to the Pampa El Toro pilot 
plant site in late  2007.  The  plant site  is located at  the  base  of the Pampa El Toro dune  near the 
village of Acari.
Pilot plant operations were carried out under the supervision of the Cardero technical team (Hoffman 
and Ripke), and consultants from Holland & Holland and BBA Engineering.

The pilot plant facility was commissioned in March 2008 during Phase I of the pilot plant test.  Two 
additional periods of pilot plant operation occurred in 2008: Phase II (May) and Phase III (June).  A 
final total of 56.8 tonnes of Pampa El Toro magnetic concentrate was produced (Table 15.2).

a portable XRF analyzer (Innov-X XRF Alpha 6000 Analyzer) to aid the optimization and control of 
the plant.  As a check on the XRF results, representative splits of a subset of these samples were sent 
to  Acme  and  ALS-Chemex  laboratories  for  analysis  and  the  remainder  of  the  samples  are  being 
stored at the secured site.  All Fe grades reported in Table 16.2  Summary  table  of  amount  of  sand 
processed, magnetic concentrate produced, weight recoveries and concentrate grades from each of 
the three pilot plant tests. (std = standard deviation) are analytical laboratory results.
During commissioning of the pilot plant (Phase I), approximately 83 tonnes of the feed sand was 
processed, producing 4.8 tonnes of iron concentrate at 47.9±2.4% Fe (Table 16.2 Summary  table  of 
amount of sand processed, magnetic concentrate produced, weight recoveries and concentrate grades 
from each of the three pilot plant tests. (std = standard deviation)).  Feed rates, magnetic separator 
drum  speeds,  splitter  positions,  and  the  overall  flow  sheet  were  all  variables  tested  during 
commissioning (Hoffman, 2008a; Holland, 2008).
During Phase II, the pilot plant throughput was improved from 2.8 to 27 tonnes per hour (Hoffman, 
2008b).    The  scavenger  magnetic  separator  recovered  only  a  low  grade  iron  material  as  its  C2 
concentrate, so it was discarded rather than send it to the finisher magnetic separator.  Consequently 
the scavenger magnetic separator was removed from the flowsheet.  The average feed grade for the 
head  sand  of  the  ROM  was  determined  to  be  7.3±1.7%  Fe,  however  additional  testing  is 
recommended.    A  total  of  46  tonnes  of  magnetic  concentrate  at  a  grade  of  55.5±2.8%  Fe  was 
produced from 613 tonnes of head sand resulting in a weight recovery of 7.5% MC.  The concentrate 
was produced during nearly continuous operation for eight hours per day over a 10 day period at 
steady-state  parameters  (Hoffman,  2008b).    The  calculated  Fe  recovery  for  the  plant  is  63.66%, 
based on data gathered from this period of steady-state operation (Hoffman, 2008b).
During Phase III, the pilot plant was modified to increase the feed throughput to 30 tonnes per hour.  
The maximum plant throughput was investigated by batch processing.  A throughput of 30 tonnes 
per hour was achieved with essentially no loss in recovery on the primary magnet.  The concentrate 
weight recovery is 7.3 weight per cent as an average of nine separate batch tests, which compares to 
the 7.5% determined in Campaign II.

Preliminary  bench-scale  test  work,  completed  by  RDI  Consultants,  Denver,  and  followed  up  by 
Natural  Resources  Research  Institute  (NRRI),  indicates  that  the  iron  concentrate  can  be  further 
upgraded  to  62.8%  iron  by  screening  out  a  portion  of  the  concentrate  that  has  a  high  relative 
concentration of silica (Table 16.3).

One  tonne  of  iron  ore  concentrate  has  been  shipped  to  the  Natural  Resources  Research  Institute 
(NRRI), Minnesota and test work is underway to further concentrate it through screening and other 
mineral separation techniques, targeting the production of a concentrate grade of 64% iron, which 
would be suitable for blast furnace sinter feed production.  It is noteworthy that the total iron content 
of the concentrate with the +80 mesh fraction removed calculates to 64.7%.  This top fraction can 
either be rejected or ground slightly to recover this iron at a higher grade by recycling it as a portion 
of the feed to the cleaner magnetic separation.

Metallurgical Testing
The Phase I briquetting  work and the  Phase II bench-scale pig iron  production program  has been 
successfully completed by NETL. The Phase III pilot-scale pig iron production program has been 
completed by NETLand the analytical results are currently being determined.
In the Phase I briquetting and Phase II bench-scale pig iron production work, a portion of the Pampa 
El Toro concentrate was agglomerated, processed into liquid hot metal (molten iron) and cast into 
pigs in a total of ten bench-scale electric arc-based smelting furnace tests. A total of 128 kilograms 
of pig iron were produced. The test work was conducted in cooperation with the U. S. Department of 
Energy (DOE)'s National Energy Technology Lab (NETL) located in Albany, Oregon. The weight 
recovery of pig iron was very good at up to 90%.
The certified chemical analysis of the sulphur and carbon content of the pig iron was determined by 
Howmet  Research  Center  (Whitehall,  Michigan,  USA).  The  chemical  analysis  of  the  remaining 
elements of interest was determined at NETL by XRF. NETL’s chemistry lab is not certified, so an 
alternate certified lab is being identified to verify these analytical results. The optimum bench scale 
test, test run  number  10  of the  10  bench-scale tests  was selected  for subsequent larger  pilot-scale 
testing. For test #10, the furnace was fed with 50.0 kg of iron ore and additional weight of reductant, 
slag, and binder and yielded 26.5 kg of pig iron and 11.7 kg of slag.  The following table shows the 
chemical analyses for the iron ore concentrate that was processed into pig iron and slag for test # 10 
(Table 15.4). The results were positive and either conform to or exceed industry specifications.

The pig iron product from test #10 has undergone chemical analysis and quality was determined to 
be  good.  Additional  bench-scale  smelting  tests  may  be  conducted  following  receipt  of  results. 
Knowledge gained from the bench scale tests have been incorporated in the large scale pilot smelting 
test.
The Phase III pilot-scale smelting tests were completed in July 2009 utilizing the optimum briquette 
formulation  and  operating  control  parameters  as  determined  from  the  bench-scale  smelting  tests 
discussed  above.  The  pilot-scale  smelting  test  successfully  demonstrated  consistent  smelter 
operation, uniform hot metal quality and slag quality over an extended period of operation time. The 
preliminary chemical analyses are currently being confirmed by an independent certified lab.

Estimates  
Cardero supplied SRK with a set of data from their geological investigations, exploration program 
and surface surveys including the following:
•  Reports on the geology and the exploration programs;
•  Drillhole collar positions and assay results;
•  Bulk Density and Specific Gravity testing methodologies and results; and
•  Contours of the surveyed topography elevation.
Based primarily on this data SRK generated a Mineral Resource estimate for a portion of the Pampa 
el Toro dune field. The data analysis and Mineral Resource estimation is described in this section.
17.1  Data Statistics
SRK  were  supplied  with  the  collar  coordinates  and  assay  results  for  112  drillholes.  The  assays 
results are from 5m composite samples and extend to 30m depth for most holes (6 holes have assays 
extending to  60m).  The  majority  of  the  holes  were  drilled  to  depth of  60m  (103  holes), one  hole 
(PET-12) stopped at 38m on bedrock, and the remainder of the holes were drilled to 100m or greater 
depth. Samples were collected from the drill rigs at 1m intervals and composited in the field to create 
the 5m composite samples. The details of the compositing are contained in Section 12. At present, 
only  samples  from  the  top  30m  have  been  submitted  for  analysis,  as  it  was  estimated  that  the 
resource  above  this  level  would  contain  sufficient  material  to  complete  the  necessary  feasibility 
studies.
A  total  of  718  assay  results  were  supplied  to  SRK  with  analyses  for  a  wide  range  of  elements, 
including  the  major  element  oxides  by  ICP-OES  and  minor  elements  by  ICP-MS  as  discussed  in 
Section 13. SRK have focused its analysis on the three elements of economic interest (Fe, Ti and V), 
but  has  also  considered  a  number  of  other  variables  that  may  impact  the  project  (such  as  Al2O3, 
SiO2, MgO, MnO, K2O, Na2O, and P).  
SRK conducted an analysis of the univariate statistics of the selected set of variables, as well as the 
correlation  between  the  variables.  The  univariate  statistics  are  presented  in  Table  17.1  and  a 
correlation  matrix  is  presented  in  Table  17.2.  All  variables  have  low  a  Coefficient  of  Variation 
(“CoV”) reflecting the relatively consistent distribution of the elements in the deposit, as well as the 
approximately normal distributions of all of the variables. MnO, MgO, Na2O and Al2O3 have very 
low CoV and this reflects the limited range of values in the assay results.

The  correlation  coefficients  in  Table  17.2  have  been  colour  coded  with  the  positive  correlations 
having  hot  colours,  and  the  negative  correlations  having  cooler  green  colours.  The  correlation 
between %Fe2O3, %TiO2 and Vppm is very strong, suggesting that either the metals are contained 
within the same minerals, or that the deposition processes have acted on the host mineral in a very 
similar  manner.  MgO  and  MnO  also  show  good  correlations  with  %Fe2O3,  %TiO2  and  Vppm 
suggesting  that these  metals are  likely to  be contained  within  the  magnetite,  titano-magnetite  and 
ilmenite crystals. %P2O5 shows a reasonably good correlation with the 5 aforementioned variables, 
although the P is likely to be contained within Apatite grains. Al203, SiO2, K2O, and NaO2 all show 
relatively  strong  negative  correlations  with  %Fe2O3,  %TiO2,  Vppm,  %MgO,  and  %MnO,  and 
relatively weaker negative correlations with P2O5. SiO2 in particular has a strong negative correlation 
with  %Fe2O3,  %TiO2,  Vppm,  %MgO,  and  %MnO,  suggesting  that  Quartz  is  the  main  gangue 
mineral.

17.2  Semi Variogram analysis
Page 65
The  5m  composites  from  the  drillholes  were  used  to  generate  experimental  semi-variograms  in  a 
plane that is approximately parallel to the average topography. The variations in the topography and 
the large distances between samples made the selection of an appropriate plane difficult, however 
after some trial and error SRK settled on a plane with a dip of 3.3º to the south. SRK tested the data 
for indications of anisotropy within the plane selected, by calculating semi-variograms in 10º sectors, 
and assessing the variations in continuity. The direction of best continuity is east-west; however the 
variogram in a north-south direction shows a very similar structure, with some evidence of a trend. 
Additionally, the semi-variogram in the east-west direction did  not reach the population variance, 
until after a stable ranged had been reached, and showed no interpretable structure at that range, as 
can be seen in Figure 17.3.

Figure 17.3:  Directional  semi-variogram  for  Fe2O3  in  the  plane  approximately
parallel to the topography
After  the  masking  of  four  holes  in  the  south  of  the  deposit  (plotted  in  Figure  17.4),  which  were 
mostly drilled at significantly wider distances than the 500m grid, the trend structure disappeared 
from the experimental semi-variogram, and more robust structures could be resolved and modeled. 
One  of the masked holes was a twinned hole  with  unusually high grades that contributed to high 
variances in the experimental semi-variogram. It is likely that at the distances between the widely 
spaced holes in the south and the main concentration of data, as well as changes in the topography 
and  average  dip  of  the  surface  mean  that  the  sample  pairs  which  generate  the  semi  variogram  at 
longer distances are from different layers, which have less correlation than samples from the same

from the dataset used for generation of the semi-variogram, were included in the dataset used for 
Mineral Resource estimation. The hole collars with red symbols in Figure 17.4 are the masked holes; 
the crosses symbolizing the collar locations are shown proportional to the drilled depth of the hole.

Figure 17.4:  Plan view of drillhole collars displaying masked drillholes in red 
The structures of the directional semi-variograms in Figure 17.3 before the 1500m distance on the X 
Axis are very similar, and SRK elected therefore to model only an omni-directional semi-variogram 
in the selected plane as this yielded more robust structures, and the scale of possible anisotropy is not 
considered significant. SRK modeled a shorter range semi-variogram in the direction perpendicular 
to  the  sub-horiontal  plane  which  approximates  a  down  hole  semi-variogram.  In  the  plane  of  the 
omni-directional semi-variogram, a slicing height of 7.5m was used. Because of the good correlation 
between the major elements (albeit negative correlations such as that between Fe2O3 and SiO2) most 
of the semi-variograms show very similar ranges and structures. Examples of the semi-variograms 
modeled for Fe2O3, TiO2, V and SiO2 are presented in Figure 17.5.

In all cases two structured spherical models were fitted to the experimental data in the plane parallel 
to  the  topography,  and  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  omni-directional  plane.  Table  17.3 
presents  the  modeled  semi-variogram  parameters  for  all  modeled  variables.  All  variables  except 
Na2O, Vanadium and Al2O3 have models with a second range of over 2000m indicating long range 
continuity in the mineralization. The total sills of all the models except Na2O also approximate the 
population variance. In all cases there is a relatively high nugget effect (modeled from the down-hole 
semi-variogram) of between 50 and 70% of the total sill.

To  test  the  robustness  of  the  semi-variogram  model  and  the  search  parameters  SRK  conducted  a 
Cross Validation process for the three variables of economic interest. The cross validation procedure 
considers each composite in the database sequentially, and temporarily removes the composite from 
the database, before Kriging the data point using the defined semi-variogram and search parameters. 
The estimated value is then compared with the true value. Outputs from the Cross Validation include
the  mean  error  (Z*-Z)  and  the  mean  standardised  error  (
),  which  measure  the  degree  of
unbiasedness. A graphical representation of the results is presented in Figure 17.6, Figure 17.7, and 
Figure 17.8 for Fe2O3, TiO2, and V respectively.  
The mean (Z*-Z/S*) values for Fe2O3, TiO2, and V are -0.004, -0.006, and -0.003 respectively. This 
indicates that there no material bias in the estimates, and the majority of the composites estimated 
values compare favourably with the real values, with a small number of composites (between 8 and 
11  composites)  falling  outside  the  selected  threshold  of  2.5  (interval  [-2.5  ;  2.5])  which  defines 
outliers  as  being  outside  the  99%  confidence  limit  of  a  normal  distribution.  This  tendency  to 
underestimate some of the highest grade values, however is considered to be a normal consequence 
of the smoothing effect that results from the Kriging process.  The Cross Validation tests indicate 
that with the selected search criterion (discussed in Section 17.5) the estimates can be considered 
robust.

17.3  Density Determination
Samples  from  nine  drillholes  were  selected  for  bulk  density  determinations  using  a  graduated 
cylinder  from  which  the  samples  volume  and  weight  were  measured.  Two  bulk  density 
determinations were done for each 5m composite sample from the 9 drill holes (resulting in two sets 
of 54 determinations each), one  on  untreated sand,  and another  on compacted sand that had been 
vibrated  for  15  minutes  on  a  vibrating  plate.  Histograms  for  the  compacted  and  un-compacted 
samples  are  presented  in  Figure  17.9.  The  compacted  bulk  densities  appear  to  have  a  bimodal 
distribution,  however;  there  is  no  apparent  correlation  between  major  element  concentration,  or 
depth, and the range of values is tightly constrained, having a coefficient of variation of 0.04. This 
may be a result of the small number of samples rather than two populations of data. SRK consider 
the  average  value  of  1,81  t/m3  to  be  an  acceptable  estimate  of  the  average  bulk  density  for  the 
deposit, and this has been used to calculate the tonnages in the Mineral Resource estimate.

17.4  Wireframe modeling
Cardero supplied SRK with a set of contour lines that defined the topographic surface over the major 
portion  of  the  deposit.  The  topographic  contours  were  used  as  the  basis  for  generating  the 
topography wireframe, which is used to vertically constrain the Mineral Resources. A comparison of 
the  contour  elevations  and  the  collar  elevations  of  the  drillholes  reveals  that  there  are  some 
significant  differences  between  some  drillhole  data  and  the  surface  defined  by  the  contours.  In 
consultation with Cardero, SRK elected to project the collar positions onto the wireframe surface. 
Where there  were  no contours,  SRK  relied  on  the  collar  elevations  of  the  drillholes  to  model the 
surface topography. The topography surface was therefore created in the following sequence:
•  A wireframe surface was created based on the contour stings only;
•  The drillhole collars that overlapped the wireframe were vertically projected onto the wireframe
surface; and
•  A  second  surface  was  created,  using  the  contours  and  the  borehole  collar  positions.  Collar 
elevations  within  the  area  covered  by  the  contours  are  consistent  with  the  surface  elevation, 
while the surface is defined by only the collar elevations outside of the area covered by contours.
As discussed in Section 17.1 the majority of holes were drilled to at least 60m or deeper, although 
only  samples  to  a  depth  of  30m  were  typically  assayed.  The  mineralization  is  assumed  to  be 
continuous below 30m depth, which is supported by the results from the six holes that have assays to 
60m.  In  these  6  holes  there  is  no  indication  of  significant  changes  in  the  grades  of  the  primary 
variables (Fe2O3, TiO2 and V). The topography surface was copied 30m vertically downwards and 
used to constrain the depth extent of the Mineral Resource.
17.5  Resource estimation
A three dimensional block model was created to model the volumes of mineralized material, and to 
contain the grade estimates. The rotation that was applied to the semi-variograms (see section 17.2) 
was  also  applied  to  the  block  model  such  that  the  XY  plane  was  approximately  parallel  to  the 
topographic surface. The blocks were defined as 250m in the X and Y plane, as this resulted in one

drillhole in  the  approximate  center  of  each  block in  the  densely drilled  area,  and  one drillhole  in 
every alternate block in the more sparsely drilled areas. The blocks are generated with a 5m Z axis 
dimension, which matches the composite lengths, and would typically result in one sample per block 
where a drillhole exists in a block column.
The block model was split to better model the volumes defined by the topography surface and the 
depth boundary of the Mineral Resource. The blocks were sub-celled to create the minimum number 
of blocks (i.e. where an entire parent cell did not intersect a wireframe, it was not split, however 
where it was split, the largest blocks possible were created). The minimum block size in X or Y was 
set  at  6.25m  (or  1/40th  of  the  parent  block  size),  whereas  the  in  the  Z  axis  blocks  were  split  to 
precisely  match  where  the  wireframe  crossed  the  block  axis.  In  the  estimation  however,  only  the 
250m parent blocks were estimated (i.e. all sub-blocks within an original parent block would receive 
the same grade estimate).  
SRK conducted a kriging search neighborhood analysis exercise for Fe2O3 to determine the optimum 
number of samples to use in the estimates. A single block in a densely sampled area is repeatedly 
kriged using the same parameters, and altering only the maximum number of samples in each cycle. 
Various indicators of the quality of the kriged estimates, such as the Slope of Regression (“SR”) and 
Kriging Efficiency (“KE”), are compared. The results of the tests are illustrated in Figure 17.10.

Figure 17.10:  Kriging search neighbourhood analysis results 
Increasing the number of samples used in the estimate generally increases the quality of the estimate. 
In Figure 17.10 the KE and SR consistently increase as more samples are included in the kriging 
neighborhood. The estimation variance also decreases as more samples are included. Using a very 
large number of samples in the estimate can result in an overly smoothed estimate, where none of the 
local variability in the deposit is retained. SRK selected 12 as the maximum number of samples to

use in the search neighborhood as this resulted (for the block being estimated) in a SR of over 0.8 
and a Kriging efficiency of over 0.6. Additionally, for a typical block, with a drillhole in the center 
of  the  block,  using  12  samples,  the  samples  selected  will  typically  have  the  configuration 
schematically illustrated in Figure 17.11.
The  block  to be  estimated  is  the  central  red  block,  while  the  surrounding  blocks  are  the  adjacent 
blocks in the same plane as the block to be estimated. The 5m samples from the drillholes that pass 
through  each  of  the  blocks  are  represented  as  yellow  cylinders,  with  the  central  sample  in  each 
drillhole in the same plane as the block being estimated. Samples marked with an X are the samples 
that are be selected by the search neighborhood definition. The sample at the center of the block to 
be estimated is selected, as well as the other 8 samples in the plane of the block to be estimated. 
Additionally one other sample from the drillhole passing through the block to be estimated (above or 
below the block) and two other samples from the central cross of drillholes (depending on which 
drillhole is closer to the center of the block being estimated) are selected.

SRK used Ordinary Kriging to populate the blocks with grade estimates for a range of variables that 
could  be  economically  important,  or  could  possibly  affect  the  mineral  processing.  The  variables 
estimated are Fe2O3 %, TiO2 %, V ppm, SiO2 %, P2O5 %, Na2O %, K2O %, MgO %, MnO %, and 
Al2O3 %. Block discretisation of 10 by 10 by 5 was used in the estimation. Any blocks not estimated 
for Fe2O3 %, TiO2 %, V ppm were excluded from the Mineral Resources, and only Fe2O3 %, TiO2 
%,  V  ppm  are  reported  as  Mineral  Resources.  Average  estimated  grades  of  the  other  estimated

variables are reported separately from the Mineral Resources. Only the parent 250m by 250m by 5m 
blocks were estimated, and all sub blocks within the parent blocks have the same grade value.
17.6  Classification and Mineral Resource Reporting
The Mineral Resources estimated by SRK for the Pampa el Toro are reported in Table 17.4. The 
Mineral Resources are classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy 
and  Petroleum  (CIM)  Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves  –  Definitions  and 
Guidelines. SRK used a scorecard approach in the classification:  
•  Geological  logging  and  sampling  quality:  SRK  conducted  site  visits  in  2006  and  2008  to 
assess the quality of geological logging and sampling and were satisfied that due care was being 
taken in the logging, handling and sampling of the percussion drilling samples.
•  Data  quality:  Cardero  have  implemented  industry standard  procedure  for  data  collection  and 
storage during the exploration program.  The quality control program implemented by Cardero is 
sufficient  to  monitor  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  analytical  results.  The  analysis  of  the 
quality  control  sample  results  indicates  sufficient  accuracy  and  precision  on  the  analytical 
results.
•  Geological interpretation: The geological model proposed by Cardero for the formation of the 
dune sands is supported by the exploration results, as well as by the results seen in the Mineral 
Resource estimation.
•  Geological  modelling:  The  geological  model  generated  by  SRK  honours  the  drilling 
information  supplied  by  Cardero.  There  is  little  extrapolation  of  the  model  beyond  the  500m 
spaced drilling.
•  Grade  estimation:  The  experimental  semi-variograms  calculated  by  SRK  show  good 
continuity, and ranges significantly longer than the average drillhole spacing, and SRK consider 
the grade estimates to be robust.

1 No grade cut-off has been applied to the material in the Mineral Resource, as the grades are relatively homogenous, would likely be able 
to be blended,  and  are projected to  be  economically  viable, based  on the  assumptions  made by  Cardero.  A Mineral  Resource is not  a 
Mineral Reserve and does not have demonstrated economical viability.  
SRK consider that all aspects of the exploration program have produced a high quality dataset with 
good external control on the analytical results. The quality of the estimates, measured by the Slope 
of  Regression  of  the  actual  value  knowing  the  estimated  value  of  the  specified  variable,  and  the 
Kriging efficiency. The portion of the deposit drilled on a 250m grid has slopes of regression that 
generally exceed 0.7, and Kriging efficiencies generally in excess of 40%. SRK has classified the 
one surrounding the 250m drilling as Indicated Mineral Resources.
The portion of the deposit surrounding this, drilled on approximately 500m centers, and extending 
approximately  500m  beyond  the  area  drilled  on  500  centers  is  classified  as  an  Inferred  Mineral 
Resource.  Portions  of  the  deposit  that  were  estimated  further  than  500m  from  the  500m  spaced

to confirm the grades of the material.

19  Interpretation and Conclusions
Exploration conducted to date at the Iron Sands Project has resulted in the discovery of a large, low-
grade magnetite sand deposit at Pampa El Toro which could be amenable to modern bulk mining 
technologies.  Surface sampling and subsequent percussion drillhole testing indicates that the overall 
magnetite  content  is  relatively  homogeneous,  particularly  in  the  uppermost  30  meters.    Sample 
density  achieved  in  the  investigations  is  considered  to  be  more  than  adequate  to  support  these 
assertions.
Based on available information, it would appear that a certain amount of milling and grinding of the 
sand  has  occurred  during  percussion  drilling,  resulting  in  samples  which  may  result  an  under-
estimation of magnetic mineral content and Fe grades due to possible loss of magnetite to fines in

addition to contamination of MC by fine non-magnetic fractions.  This is not expected to affect the 
in situ Fe grade which the current Mineral Resource estimate is based.
Mineral  processing/recovery  tests  conducted  by  five  separate,  independent  laboratories  provide 
encouraging  results  clearly indicating  the  feasibility  of  magnetic  separation and  upgrading  of raw 
sand material to produce a final iron concentrate of 53.4% to 66.2% Fe.  The tests have investigated 
various upgrading techniques with the objective of reducing the Si content of the concentrate.  These 
included dry magnetic separation using a variety of drum magnet specifications, gravity spirals, wet 
magnetic separation techniques and grinding of the concentrate.  Whereas the tests that included wet 
separation  techniques  and  grinding  of  the  concentrate  were  able  to  upgrade  the  material,  their 
economic  viability  outweighs  their  effectiveness.  Dry  magnetic  separation  techniques  were 
determined to be the most effective and viable.
The Pilot Plant dry magnetic separation tests recovered up to 7.5 Wt. % MC at a grade of 55.5% Fe 
from the Pampa el Toro bulk sample.  Screening of the concentrate is currently being investigated as 
an additional upgrading step, as preliminary testing has indicated that the grade may be improved to 
62.8%  Fe.    As  this  would  be  a  simple  and  economic  upgrading  step,  further  testing  is  strongly 
recommended.
A  robust  Mineral  Resource  estimate  has  been  generated  based  on  a  sound  geological  model  and 
exploration  database.  The  Mineral  Resource  is  classified  in  terms  of  the  CIM  definitions  on 
Standards  on  Mineral  Resources  and  Reserves  –  Definitions  and  Guidelines.  An  Indicated 
Mineral Resource of 133,608 kT with a Fe2O3 grade of 6.67% has been defined, along with an 
Inferred Resource of 348,190 kT with a Fe2O3 grade of 6.47%. 
Laboratory scale metallurgical testing indicates that it is feasible at the bench-scale to produce a high 
quality, saleable, iron product.  Pilot plant scale metallurgical testwork is required to determine if 
this is possible at an industrial scale.
20  Recommendations
SRK recommend that the metallurgical test work continue to improve the confidence in the ability to 
upgrade the raw sand material into a saleable product, and that Cardero proceed with the preliminary 
economic assessment of the project.
