<p>Distr.: General 
19 July 2011</p>
<p>undermine the values of democracy and morality and jeopardize social, economic and 
political development,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned </i>that the enjoyment of human rights, be they economic, social and 
cultural, or civil and political, in particular the right to development, is seriously 
undermined by the phenomenon of corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging 
to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that States continue to face various challenges in fund and asset 
recovery of illicit origin, including legal challenges, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that corruption, including the transfer of funds and assets of illicit origin 
and the non-repatriation of such funds and assets, is no longer a local matter but a 
transnational phenomenon that affects all societies and economies, making international 
cooperation essential to prevent and combat it, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> about cases of corruption that involve vast 
quantities of assets, which may constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, 
the deprivation of which threatens the political stability and sustainable development of 
those States;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> the urgent need to repatriate such illicit funds to the countries of 
origin and urges all States to commit their political will to act together to recover the 
proceeds of corruption, including by repatriating illicit funds and assets to the countries of 
origin;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
prepare a comprehensive study and, when necessary, to seek information from relevant 
international organizations and agencies on the negative impact of the non-repatriation of 
funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of human rights, in 
particular economic, social and cultural rights, and to submit a report thereon to the Human 
Rights Council at its nineteenth session.
