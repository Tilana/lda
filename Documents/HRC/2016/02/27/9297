<p><b>INTRODUCTION 
 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its sixty-first session, the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/38 
entitled &#8216;The right to freedom of opinion and expression&#8217;, appealed to all States to cooperate 
fully with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his tasks, and to provide 
him with all necessary information requested by him.  The Human Rights Council, in its 
decision 1/102, dated 30 June 2006, decided to extend exceptionally for one year, subject to 
the review to be undertaken by the Human Rights Council in conformity with General 
Assembly resolution 60/251, the mandates and the mandate holders of all the special 
procedures of the Commission on Human Rights.  The Human Rights Council also requested 
the special procedures to continue with the implementation of their mandates and the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to provide them with 
the necessary support. 
 
2. In accordance with the above-mentioned provisions, the present report contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of general and individual allegations, as well as urgent 
appeals transmitted to Governments between 1 January and 31 December 2007, as well as 
replies received from Governments until 15 January 2008. Replies to communications 
received after 15 January 2008 will be included in the next communication report of the 
Special Rapporteur, as well as replies not yet translated by that date. Observations made by 
the Special Rapporteur have also been included where applicable.  
 
3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur transmitted 241<b> 
</b>communications on behalf of 623 persons to the Governments of 81 countries: Afghanistan, 
Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, 
Cambodia, Chad, Chile, China (People's Republic of), Colombia, Congo (Republic of the), 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Cuba, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, 
Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guin&#233;e-Bissau, Haiti, Hungary, India, 
Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Mali, Morocco, Mauritania, M&#233;xico, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, 
Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Republic of Moldova, Republic of Serbia, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, South 
Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, 
Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of 
America, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. Two communications 
were sent to the Palestinian Authorithy.  
 
4. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has reduced 
details of communications sent and received. The full text of all communications is available 
within the files of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
 
5. In reporting on the communications, the Special Rapporteur has used initials for those 
victims who, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, could be in a potentially sensitive situation, 
in order to respect their privacy and to prevent the possibility of further victimization.  With a 
view to preserve the presumption of innocence, the Special Rapporteur omitted to include the 
names of alleged perpetrators, and of other individuals involved in the cases included in this 
report.  Conversely, Governments&#8217; communications may contain names of persons and/or 
disclose specific situations linked to the violation.

6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate that violations and concerns regarding the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression are, to different extents, a common phenomenon in 
the whole world.  Consequently, the exclusion or the inclusion of a particular country or 
territory should not be interpreted as the indication of any specific choice done by the Special 
Rapporteur regarding the analysis of trends and patterns of the implementation of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 March 2007 
</b> 
7. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government a case in which  
the Minister of Culture and Information and 50 security personnel allegedly entered the <b>Radio 
Television Afghanistan</b> (RTA) headquarters, during the absence of the then director-general, 
Mr. Najib Roshan, to dismiss the chief of the news section. It is alleged that the Minister 
instructed the security guards protecting the headquarters to prevent 55 persons appointed as 
contractors to enter the premises. It was also reported that on 20 December 2006, the Minister 
of Communication appointed the director of the Radio Division of RTA, in apparent 
contravention with the procedures outlined in the applicable Media Law (2004).  Reportedly, 
these were attempts of the Minister of Culture and Information to maintain and further 
increase government control over the media. 
 
8. The Special Rapporteur also referred in his communication to the new <b>Draft Law on 
Media</b>, adopted in December 2005 by presidential decree, and expected to be approved by the 
Parliament. According to the information received, since the appointment of the Minister of 
Culture and Information, and particularly since November 2006, control oriented amendments 
have been introduced in the draft Media Law. Allegedly, these amendments, if adopted, 
would introduce new prohibitions for journalists; eliminate several of the initially proposed 
commissions, including the Afghan National Radio-Television Commission; place the 
Minister of Culture and Information at the Head of the High Media Council (in charge of 
policy making) and grant him significant new powers over the Commission on Media Affairs 
(replacing the former Private Media Commission).  These amendments, if adopted, are seen to 
effectively open the media to political interference and to place the national broadcaster Radio 
Television Afghanistan under direct control of the State, via the Ministry of Culture and 
Information.  
 
9. This draft Law on Media is also considered as failing to address the needs of private 
media in Afghanistan. In this regard, the Rapporteur referred to reports that over the past 
months, a prominent Dari/English publication, Kabul Weekly &#8211; among the first of the post-
Taliban papers, closed down, and that financial problems were reported at other media 
organizations and programmes including Nai, CIJ, The Khillid Group, The Voice of Women 
Radio, Internews, Good Morning Afghanistan, Institute of War &amp; Peace Reporting, Pahjwok 
Afghan News Agency, and the UN&#8217;s Irin Radio. As of late 2006, some 15 provincial 
community radio stations were reported to be facing difficulties in paying staff and meeting 
running costs. It has been reported as well that a growing number of Islamist government </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 7 
 
officials have expressed their concerns with regard to the number of women portrayed on TV 
and their clothing, which they consider to be disrespectful to Islamic values.  
 
10. In the same communication, the Special Rapporteur finally referred to information 
received that the <b>National Assembly&#8217;s Draft Amnesty law</b> reportedly contains two articles 
that appear to conflict with the Constitutional guarantees relating to Freedom of Expression 
and that would prevent journalists from reporting on certain issues. Allegedly, its Article 1 
states that: &quot;the champions of resistance shall be immune to all kinds of animosity&#8221; and 
should be &#8220;treated properly&#8221;. In addition, Article 11 reportedly states that &#8220;the mass media 
should keep in mind the provisions of the national reconciliation charter and make efforts to 
strengthen peace and national reconciliation.&#8221; 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 10 October 2007 
</b> 
11. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of 
<b>Ghulam Ali Sarem</b>, Chief-Editor of Etesam Monthly Magazine. On 4 October 2007, Mr. 
Sarem was attacked in Kabul while attempting to take photographs of an army bus which had 
exploded by a suicide bomber. It is reported that the attackers were members of the Afghan 
National Army, and that Mr. Sarem was placed under arrest and taken to a detention facility.

Observations 
 
</b>16. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he has not received a reply for the two 
communications sent in 2007. <b>  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Angola 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 6 March 2007 with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
</b> 
17. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Ms <b>Sarah Wykes</b>, a human rights activist working for Global 
Witness, a non-governmental organization dealing with environmental issues and 
campaigning against corruption. According to the information received, on 18 February 2007, 
Ms Wykes was arrested by the Angolan police in Cabinda, following her meetings with 
representatives of the human rights organization Mpalabanda to discuss revenue transparency 
issues related to oil resources. On 19 February, Ms Wykes was presented to the Provincial 
Public Prosecutor of Cabinda for the first official hearing and was accused of espionage. She 
was released on bail, but she was not allowed to leave the country. In the course of the 
hearing, Ms Wykes was reportedly denied access to the lawyer of her choice, Mr David 
Mendes, a prominent human rights lawyer and leader of the human rights organization M&#227;os 
Livres and the newly established Angolan Council for Human Rights Coordination.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 14 March 2007 
 
</b>18. The Government emphasized that the case did not fall within the purview of the 
executive, but rather the judiciary, and noted that that the case was still being dealt with by the 
court and that the verdict had yet to be released. It was stated that Ms Wykes was 
apprehended by local police on 18 February, while photographing strategic military and 
civilian facilities. The Government informed that three Angolan lawyers had been assigned to 
Ms Wykes. As one of them, Mr David Mendes, was accompanying the defendant from 
Luanda and his name was referred in the process, the prosecutor barred him from the defence 
team. The other two lawyers then walked out of the courtroom in a show of solidarity. The 
Government further informed that the British Embassy in Angola was following the case 
closely. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
19. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 11 May 2007 with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on arbitrary detention 
</b> 
23. The Special Rapporteur and the Chairperson-Rapporteur brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of <b>Mr. Rafiq Tagi</b> and <b>Mr. Samir Sadagatoglu</b>, reporter and 
editor of the newspaper Sanat, who were reportedly sentenced, respectively to three and four 
years in prison on charges of religious hatred by the Sabail district court in Baku on 4 May </p>

2007.  The journalists had reportedly already been held for more than four months in pretrial 
detention. This reportedly followed an article published on 1 November 2006, in which Mr. 
Tagi allegedly linked religious influence to the lack of economic and political development in 
the country. According to information received, a group of religious activists, sitting in the 
court room, menaced the defendants, and insulted journalists and other observers attending 
the trial.  It has also been reported that the court took no action in this regard, and that the trial 
went on in an atmosphere of intimidation. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 5 September 2007 
</b> 
24. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the case of <b>Mr. 
Faramaz Allahverdiyev</b>, also known as Faramaz Novruzoglu, a journalist working for the 
independent newspaper &#8220;Nota Bene&#8221;. According to the information received, Mr. 
Allahverdiyev has been in detention since 30 January 2007, serving a two-year sentence after 
being condemned of libelling the Minister of Interior. According to reports, Mr. 
Allahverdiyev was in a critical state and his health was rapidly deteriorating. He had already 
undergone an operation since his detention and conducted a hunger strike in July 2007. 
Concern was expressed that Mr. Allahverdiyev&#8217;s life may be in danger if he does not undergo 
appropriate medical treatment. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 September 2007 
</b> 
25. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information he 
received concerning <b>Mr. Eynulla Fatullayev</b>, editor of the newspaper &#8220;Realny Azerbaidjan&#8221;. 
Mr. Fatullayev was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 3 October 2006, after he was 
sentenced on 26 September 2006 to two years of incarceration and a fine of US$ 11,500 for 
libelling and insulting the Minister of Interior. According to the information received, Mr. 
Fatullayev was charged with three additional criminal offenses after his initial conviction in 
September 2006. In April 2007, he was reportedly sentenced to 30 months in prison for 
defaming Azerbaijanis in an Internet posting which he denied writing. In July 2007, the 
National Security Ministry allegedly charged Mr. Fatullayev with terrorism and incitement of 
religious hatred. If convicted, he could spend up to 16 years in prison. Finally, on 4 
September 2007, he was reportedly charged by the National Security Ministry with tax 
evasion, which carries a penalty of six months in prison or two years in a corrective labor 
facility. The Rapporteur expressed concern that the charges against Mr. Fatullayev are related 
to the critical reports he published as a journalist. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 8 October 2007 
</b> 
26. The Government stated that the necessary legal framework was established to promote 
freedom of expression and freedom of the media. The mechanisms for censorship and control 
over the mass media were abolished and there are over 3,000 media outlets in Azerbaijan. 
Serious and systematic measures to promote freedom of expression are being undertaken by 
the Government, in line with European standards. One of the serious problems of Azerbaijani 
journalism, however, is the low level of ethics and professional behaviour, and offenses on 
human dignity, sentiment and business reputation, which leads to individual complaints for 
defamation and libel. Mr. Fatullayev was held criminally liable for insulting the honor and 
dignity of the residents of the town Xojali, which suffered from the Armenian aggression and 
genocide. On 5 April 2007, the local court imposed on Mr. Fatullayev a fine of USD 23,000, </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 11 
 
but the applicants &#8211; former residents of Khojali &#8211; did not agree with the allegedly soft penalty 
and appealed against the decision. On 20 April 2007, Mr. Fatullayev was sentence to 2,6 
years&#8217; imprisonment. In April 2007, the website of Mr. Fattullayev&#8217;s newspaper also 
published information stating that some foreign companies, organizations and individuals 
working in Azerbaijan would be targeted by Iranian military strikes if Azerbaijan supported 
an anti-Iranian coalition. Following complaints issued by companies, organizations and 
individuals concerned, Mr. Falluyev was subject to criminal proceedings based on the fact of 
terrorist blackmailing. In the same text, false information was disseminated concerning 
discrimination against Azerbaijani citizens of Talish origin living in the southern regions of 
the country. Such information aimed to disseminate ethnic and religious hatred and hostility. 
An investigation showed that this information was given to Mr. Fatullayev by an Iranian 
citizen. These acts are posing serious threats to the national security interests of the 
democratic and secular state of Azerbaijan. The investigation on this matter is still underway. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
27. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response to his 
communication of 12 September 2007. He regrets, however, that the Government has yet to 
reply to the two other communications sent in 2007.

<p><b>Bahrain</b> 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 25 January 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention 
</b> 
28. The Special Raporteur and the the Chairperson-Rapporteur brought to the attention of 
the Government the case of <b>Dr M. Al Sahlawi</b> and <b>Mr. H. Al Hebshi</b>, who were reportedly 
arrested on 16 November 2006 by the authorities for being found in possession of 1.500 
copies of a publication deemed by the authorities to be &quot;subversive literature&#8221;. The 
publication is said to call on Bahrainis to boycott the parliamentary elections held in 
November 2006. On 7 January 2007, the public prosecutors reportedly charged them with 
crimes related to State security under Articles 160, 161 and 168 of the Penal Code, which 
prescribe prison sentences for up to seven years. The session was adjourned till 14 of January 
2007 during which the attorneys of the accused presented their defense. Since then, the two 
detainees were allegedly held in solitary confinement. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 31 May 2007 
</b> 
29. The Government stated that the information contained in the urgent appeal was 
inaccurate. The publications which the two defendants, <b>Mohammed Sa`id al-Sahlawi </b>and 
<b>Hussayn Abd al-Aziz Salman &#8220;Al-Habashi&#8221;</b>, had in their possession and acquired contained 
material advocating the overthrow and  change of the Government, together with false and 
tendentious reports and rumours and seditious messages of a kind likely to disrupt public 
order and to damage the public interest. The claim, in the urgent appeal, that the publications 
simply called on Bahrainis to boycott the parliamentary elections is not true. 
 
30. The defendants were not charged under article 160 of the Penal Code, which 
prescribes a penalty of up to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment, but under articles 161 and 168 (2), 
which prescribe a penalty of either imprisonment or a fine. The place in which any sentence </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 12 
 
of deprivation of liberty imposed by a court must be served is a designated prison and there is 
no discrimination between convicted persons. The place in which the two defendants were 
being held was Jaw Prison; it is not true that they were being held in solitary confinement. 
The two defendants were brought before the third lower court, an independent and impartial 
judicial authority constituted in accordance with the Constitution and the law. The court 
examined the facts of the case during a trial in which full legal guarantees were provided. On 
the basis of the evidence and the admissions of the two defendants that, at the time of their 
arrest, they were in possession of papers containing seditious messages, false reports and 
propaganda aimed at changing the political, social and economic system of the State, the court 
issued its verdict on 31 January 2007, sentencing Mohammed Sa`id al-Sahlawi to one year in 
prison and Hussayn Abd al-Aziz Salman to six months in prison. Bahraini laws grant every 
individual the freedom to express his or her opinion and to hold gatherings, subject to certain 
conditions. These laws also provide guarantees against the disruption of public order and 
damage to the public interest or to the honour and reputation of others. On 25 February 2007, 
His Majesty the King issued Decree No. 27/2007, granting a pardon which annulled the 
sentences imposed on the two men in case No. 8350/C/2005. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 7 March 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers 
</b> 
31. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Ali 
Jaffar Ali</b>, 17 years old, <b>Mr. Jassim Mirza</b>, 17 years old, and his brother <b>Mr. Mohammad 
Mirza</b>, 16 years old, who were reportedly arrested after participation in a demonstration 
regarding Mr. Hassan Mushiama, Secretary-General of the organisation &#8220;Movement of 
Freedoms and Democracy &#8211;HAQ&#8221;, and Mr. Abdul Hadi Al-Khawaja, President of the 
organisation &#8220;Bahrain Center for Human Rights&#8221;. Mr. Hassan Mushiama and Mr. Abdul Hadi 
Al-Khawaja were the subject of a joint urgent appeal by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders on 2 February 2007 and have since been 
released as stated in your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s reply dated 15 February 2007.  
 
32. According to the information received, Mr. Ali Jaffar Ali was arrested on 25 February 
2007 after security forces had searched the home of his father in Sanabis several times during 
his absence. On the same day he was formally ordered into custody for 15 days by the Public 
Prosecutor and charged pursuant to article 178 of the Penal Code of 1976, which provides that 
anyone &#8220;shall be punished by a term of up to two years and a fine not exceeding two hundred 
Dinars, or both, who participated in a gathering in a public place consisting of at least five 
persons, the purpose of which is to commit crimes, or acts equipping or facilitating it, or to 
disturb public security, even if that was to fulfill a legitimate objective.&#8221; Mr. Ali Jaffar Ali 
was reportedly being detained at Khamees police station detention center at the time the 
communication was sent. Mr. Jassim Mirza and Mr. Mohammad Mirza were reportedly 
arrested on 3 February 2007 at their homes in Sanabis by heavily armed special forces and 
were detained at an unknown place of detention without access to lawyers or members of their 
family since then. The arrests were made following their participation in a peaceful protest on 
2 February 2007 against the arrests of Mr. Hassan Mushiama and Mr. Abdul Hadi Al-
Khawaja.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 25 May 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the

torture 
</b> 
33. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr Ali 
Saeed Yacob Al-Khabaz</b>, 22 years old, residing in Sanabis, who was arrested after a 
demonstration regarding Mr. Hassan Mushiama and Mr. Abdul Hadi Al-Khawaja. Mr. Hassan 
Mushiama and Mr. Abdul Hadi Al-Khawaja were the subject of a joint urgent appeal by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 2 
February 2007 and have since been released as stated in your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
reply dated 15 February 2007. 
 
34. According to the information received, Mr Ali Saeed Yacob Al-Khabaz was arrested 
by Special Forces on 20 May 2007 after attending a peaceful demonstration that took place in 
an area between the cities of Sanabis and Daih. The Special Forces allegedly dispersed the 
demonstration, making use of rubber bullets, sound bombs and tear gas. The Special Forces 
were allegedly chasing some of the demonstrators and arrested Mr Al-Khabaz in front of his 
family home. During the arrest, he was forced to the ground by the Special Forces, 
collectively beaten with batons and kicked with boots.  For two days he was treated at the 
Bahrain Defence Force Hospital for various injuries, and he was not able to walk. The public 
prosecutor reportedly ordered Mr Al-Khabaz&#8217; detention for one week. On 23 May 2007 he 
was first transferred from the hospital to Qudhaibeya police station and then to Nuaim police 
station in Manama, where he was reportedly being held at the time the communication was 
sent. When his family requested to visit him on 22 May 2007 at Nuiam police station, they 
were reportedly threatened by the station commander and forced to leave.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 14 June 2007 
</b> 
35. The Government indicated that the facts set out in the summary to which the letter 
refers are untrue and baseless. According to the Government, the right to express an opinion 
by peaceful means is guaranteed by the Constitution and by Bahraini law.  No one has ever 
been arrested for exercising this right. Mr. <b>Al Khabbaz</b> was one of a group of around 40 
persons who took part in riots in the Sanabis area on 20 May 2007. They threw Molotov 
cocktails and stones at the security forces which had been sent to the area to disperse the 
crowds, quell the rioting and protect the lives of citizens from these irresponsible acts of 
sabotage. Such acts are punishable by a term of imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 500 
dinars, pursuant to article 179 of Decree Law No. 15 of 1976, promulgating the Criminal 
Code. There is no truth to the allegations that he was picked up in front of his home. 
According to article 55 of Decree Law No. 46 of 2002, promulgating the Code of Criminal 
Procedures, a senior police officer must remand an accused person in custody if there is 
sufficient evidence to charge him with a serious or lesser delicto flagrante offence that carries 
a penalty of over three months in prison.  The accused was arrested after being caught red-
handed committing the offence of rioting, for which the punishment is a custodial sentence. 
The Ministry of the Interior did not receive any complaints from or on behalf of this person in 
connection with the allegations set out in the letter. These procedures are consistent with 
international treaties; the accused was informed of the reasons for his arrest and, in 
accordance with article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, he was 
brought before the public prosecution service, which is the judicial authority in charge of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 14 
 
investigations. The accused was arrested for committing the offences of arson and rioting and 
not for exercising the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. 
These rights are guaranteed under articles 19 and 21 of the aforementioned international 
Covenant and the Kingdom strives earnestly to protect them and ensure that they are 
exercised fully and freely. The Government informed that on 8 June 2007, Mr. Al-Khabaz 
was released by the competent authorities. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 25 October 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
</b> 
36. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
the situation of Ms <b>Ghada Jamsheer</b>, a women's rights activist and president of the Bahrain 
Women's Petition. According to the information received, in early October 2007, a formal 
governmental decision had been revealed concerning a prohibition for Ms. Jamsheer to appear 
in the Bahraini press, including radio, television and all local newspapers. Allegedly, this 
prohibition may be related to a letter that she sent to His Highness the King of Bahrain calling 
for the dissolution of the Supreme Council for Women, which is chaired by Her Highness 
Sheikha Sabika Bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa. Ms. Jamsheer has already faced charges in the past 
related to her professional activities. In 2005, she was criminally prosecuted for allegedly 
criticizing family judges. These proceedings were later discontinued. This case was the 
subject of a joint Urgent Appeal sent on 13 June 2005 by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. Since 
2006, Ms. Jamsheer has allegedly been placed under surveillance, having her activities and 
movements monitored by security officials. Concern was expressed that the ban imposed on 
Ms. Jamsheer may be directly linked to her non-violent activities in defence of women's rights 
in the Kingdom of Bahrain. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 25 October 2007 
</b> 
37. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of 
<b>Mr Saleh Al-Amm</b>, a journalist, writer and the editor of the electronic journal &#8220;Al-Saheefa&#8221;; 
<b>Mr. Muath Al-Meshari</b>, a columnist for the &#8220;Al-wasat newspaper&#8221;; <b>Mr. Fareed Al-Shayeb</b>, 
a writer for &#8220;Al-Saheefa&#8221;; and <b>Mr. Hesham Al-Zayani</b>, editor-in-chief of &#8220;Akhbar Al-
Khaleej&#8221; newspaper. It was reported that, on 23 October 2007, Mr. Al-Amm, Mr. Al-Meshari 
and Mr. Al-Shayeb were convicted by the Higher Criminal Court of insult and defamation 
under Article 15 of the Penal Code, received a fine of 200 Bahraini Dinars and 51 BD in 
damages, in addition to court fees. The conviction is said to refer to the alleged defamation of 
the director of the Dar Al-Manar Elderly Care Center in an article published in the on-line 
journal &#8220;Al-Saheefa&#8221;. According to reports, 14 journalists, bloggers and website 
administrators were interrogated and prosecuted for insult and defamation under Article 15 of 
the Penal Code and Article 47 of the Press Code. 
 
38. In the same communication, the Rapporteur referred to another case, in which <b>Mr. Al-
Zayani</b> was reportedly convicted on 28 October 2007 by the Supreme Criminal Court of 
Appeals for insult and defamation against the President of Arabian University, receiving a 
1000 BD fine. </p>

<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
39. On 4 February 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 31 October 2006 concerning the reported blockage of the Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights&#8217; website. In its reply, the Government informed that on 4 October 
2006, the Higher Criminal Court of the Kingdom of Bahrain prohibited the press, websites 
and other media from discussing a matter that was being handled by the investigation or 
prosecuting authorities on the ground that it would influence the soundness of the 
investigations. As the website of the (dissolved) Bahrain Center for Human Rights violated 
this prohibition, the Minister of Information issued an order to the Batelco company to block 
the website. The so-called (dissolved) Bahrain Center for Human Rights is not at present 
registered as a civil association and hence is not permitted to engage in any activities under 
that name. The exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, as reflected in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and understood by the European Court of 
Human Rights entails obligations and responsibilities and may be subject to restrictions to 
protect the reputation of others. It has also held that freedom of expression is not impaired by 
regulations requiring the licensing of audio-visual media (European Court of Human Rights, 
De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, case No. 19923/92, 24 February 1997). It should, however, 
correspond to a pressing social need. It is for national authorities to assess the existence of 
such a need, which differs from case to case. This is also the approach that the European 
Court of Human Rights has adopted in its jurisprudence (European Court of Human Rights, 
Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981).Article 14 of the Covenant, which 
enshrines the principle of a public hearing, permits the exclusion of the press and the media 
from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national 
security. As the website of the (dissolved) Bahrain Center for Human Rights was blocked in 
response to and in implementation of the decision by the relevant judicial authorities to 
prohibit the media from disseminating any material that might influence the course of the 
investigation and the aforementioned website failed to comply with that ruling, the ensuing 
order was consistent with the conditions for lawful restriction of the right to freedom of 
expression set out in international instruments.

</b>41. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
the situation of Mr <b>Ranglai Mro</b>, an indigenous leader of the Mro indigenous community 
from Bandarban, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). Mr Ranglai Mro is the elected 
Chairman of the Suolak Union Parishad, a district leader of the Bangladesh Awami League, 
and the Bandarban unit president of the Land Rights Protection Committee. According to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 16 
 
information received, on 23 February 2007, in the early morning, Mr Ranglai Mro, aged 38, 
was forcefully taken away from his residence in Bandarb town by army lead-security forces. 
He was allegedly subject to torture in Bandarban Cantonment and handed over to the police 
station of Bandarban Sadar Thana. He was accused of possession of illegal weapons and of 
illegal grabbing of public and private lands. Mr Ranglai Mro was admitted to the Bandarban 
Sadar Hospital on the same day, to receive treatment for his injuries sustained through torture, 
and was subsequently transferred to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital. Concern was 
expressed that Mr Ranglai Mro&#8217;s detention could be linked to his vocal role in opposing the 
establishment of an Artillery Training Center in Sualok Union of Bandardan, which 
reportedly led to the uprooting of 400 indigenous families in 2005, and to his opposition 
against ongoing plans to create a training centre for the Bangladesh Air Force in Sualok 
Union, which would reportedly lead to further displacements.    
 
<b>Response from Government sent on 26 April 2007 
</b> 
42. The Government reported that Mr. <b>Ranglai Mro</b> was apprehended in the morning of 
23 March 2007. A large quantity of arms and ammunitions were found in his house. As he 
was unable to produce valid documents regarding these arms and ammunitions, the Joint 
Forces arrested him and logged a case against him under the Arms Act, according to which 
the unauthorized possession of arms and ammunitions is a punishable crime. During 
interrogation, Mr. Mro complained about his chest pain. He was then sent to Bandarban Sadar 
Hospital for treatment, and, on the advice of a local physician, he was subsequently shifted to 
Chittagong Medical College Hospital for better treatment. Law enforcement agencies denied 
any kind of torture during their custody. Mr. Mro was subsequently sent to the Special 
Tribunal Judge, Chittagong Hill Tracts, for trial. At the time that the communication from the 
Government was sent, he was in custody at the Chittagong Jail.

and has published several controversial reports of alleged cases of corruption and abuse by 
members of the security forces. According to information received, on 11 May 2007, at 
approximately midnight, four plain-clothed individuals, who identified themselves as being 
from the &#8216;joint task force&#8217;, visited Mr Khalil&#8217;s home in Dhaka. The four men stated that they 
were placing Mr Khalil under arrest and proceeded to search the house, confiscating his 
passport, two computers, documents and two mobile phones, before taking him to Sangsad 
Bhavan army camp outside the parliament building in the city. A warrant was not produced 
for Mr Khalil&#8217;s arrest nor was he informed of the reason for his detention. Mr Khalil was 
reportedly called for questioning by military intelligence during recent weeks.

and human rights defender. According to information received, in the evening of 3 May 2007, 
Mr Akash received a threatening call on his mobile phone from an individual who identified 
himself as Major Rashidul Hassan Rashid, an official from the Rapid Action Batallion 
(RAB)-5, in Rajsahi region. The alleged threats were in relation to a CSB broadcast the day 
before, in which RAB officials had raided a house in the city of Rajshai, shooting an alleged 
criminal in the presence of his wife and child.  Mr Akash had interviewed the victim&#8217;s wife a 
short time after the incident, and the report was aired later that evening. According to reports, 
the caller questioned Mr Akash as to why CSB News had broadcast the incident, claiming that 
he had acted against the State and that if Mr Akash or any of his colleagues attempt to cover 
any incidents involving RDB in the future, they would &#8216;suffer the consequences&#8217;.  
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 7 November 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the

Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers 
</b> 
46. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
the situation of Mr. <b>Jahangir Alam Akash</b>, journalist with CSB News Bangladesh and 
human rights defender. Mr. Alam Akash was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 22 May 2007. While we appreciate Your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
reply dated 23 May 2007, in which it is inter alia stated that the contents of the 
communication have been duly noted and forwarded to the concerned authorities in 
Bangladesh for necessary inquiry and action, we would like to draw your attention to new 
information we have received on Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash. According to the new 
information received, on 23 October 2007, a group of 10 -12 Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) 
agents in plain clothes went to the house of Mr. Alam Akash in Rajsh.  Reportedly, his wife 
did not let them in until they told her who they were; she asked for a search warrant but they 
refused to present one. Reportedly, the agents disclosed their identity and said that a reliable 
source had told them that there were some arms hidden in the house and alleged they had a 
search warrant issued by the concerned court. The RAB agents grabbed Mr. Alam Akash and 
began slapping him hard in the face. Then, they put him in handcuffs, wrapped a black cloth 
around this head and took him away. He was reportedly taken to a nearby army camp where 
he was severely beaten. It has been reported that he has suffered severe physical injuries and 
is unable to walk, having been moved to the Rajshahi hospital. Mr. Alam Akash remains 
detained on extortion charges and has not yet appeared in court.  Prior to these attacks, Mr. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 18 
 
Alam Akash had been broadcasting and publishing news on alleged abuses of power by the 
RAB. In particular, on 2 May 2007 Mr. Alam Akash presented a report on an attempted 
extrajudicial execution by RAB agents that had allegedly taken place in Rajshahi. He has also 
received numerous death threats due to his work and has suffered physical assaults in the past 
after publishing critical articles regarding local politicians. Concern was expressed that the 
alleged ill-treatment and detention of Mr. Alam Akash may be directly related to his peaceful 
activities in defence of human rights. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 27 November 2007 
</b> 
47. The Government stated that the Journalists Steering Committee of Rajshani declared 
Mr. <b>Jahangir Alam Akash</b> as persona non grata on 24 June 2003 for his corrupt practices 
and unethical activities. He has been one of the top toll collectors in Rajshashi and his lavish 
life style does not match his known income. Mr. Akash blackmails rich people of the society 
by resorting to yellow journalism. Such allegations against him were published in many 
newspapers. Many consider Mr. Akash published an article in the Daily Sangbad about 
&#8220;Collection of Toll under the disguise of Journalism&#8221; to cover his own misdeeds. In this 
regard Rajshahi Journalist Union asked a written explanation for his reporting in the Daily 
Sangbad, which was defamatory to the image of journalists. In the investigation, it has been 
revealed that an application accusing Mr. Akash of threats was addressed to the president of 
the Metropolitan Press Club on 11 June 2001. Two other persons accused him of threats and 
blackmailing on 24 February 2001. It has also been reviewed that, as son-in-law of a local 
Awami League (president) and former member of parliament, Mr. Akash has proved to be an 
AL biased journalist, which is contrary to journalistic ethics, publishing news that supports 
AL positions and actively participating in demonstrations and agistations against the RAB. 
On 2 May 2007, Mr. Akash has also tried to portray a terrorist whose house was raided by the 
RAB as a political leader. Mr. Akash has a record of toll collection, blackmailing and 
reporting false and fabricated stories. He is using his profession as a money-making tool. For 
such unethical activities, he was boycotted by his colleagues and was avoided by the local 
people. Mr. Akash has launched an international campaign just to draw sympathy in his 
favour so that the Government refrains from taking action against him according to the 
existing legislation. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 August 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special

</b> 
48. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
the situation of Mr <b>Rabindra Ghosh</b>, President of the Dhaka Chapter of the Human Rights 
Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM). An urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning Mr Ghosh was already sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders on 30 August 2005. According to 
information received, on 7 August 2007, police officers came to the home of Mr Ghosh in the 
Western Bazaar area of Moulovibazar town. They issued him with an arrest warrant, 
informing him that he had 24 hours to comply with the warrant and present himself at Bogra 
police station. The following day, Mr Ghosh proceeded to the station, but was not arrested; he 
was instead threatened to be arrested should he continue his work. It is alleged that the arrest 
warrant was ordered by Upazilla Nirbahi Officer, in reaction to Mr Ghosh&#8217;s campaigning for </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

the recovery of the historic Bhabani Temple at Bogora. The temple was reportedly destroyed 
by national armed forces on 13 February 2007, in violation of a High Court order to protect 
the building. The historic temple reportedly existed for hundred years and a minority 
community, including caretakers of the temple, lived in the premises for generations and were 
forcefully evicted when the building was demolished.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 15 January 2008 
</b> 
49. The Government stated that the allegations of curbing Mr. Ghosh&#8217;s right to freedom of 
expression as a journalist and torture upon him are not correct. Mr. Ghosh was not present, as 
claimed, during the eviction carried out by the Bhabanipur Temple areas under Sherpur Police 
Station in Bogra district in February 2007. A case was filed against the eviction activities of 
the Joint Forces at the Court of the Assistant Judge. It was subsequently dismissed by the 
Court after proper examination. There was no mention of torture against Mr. Ghosh in the 
case. Mr. Ghosh was arrested in connection with another incident. The local Upazilla Nirbahi 
Officer brought the charge against Mr. Ghosh of threatening him over the mobile phone. On 
completion of the investigation, Non-FIR Prosecution No. 31 dated 24 April 2007 as per 
Article 189 of the Penal Code was submitted to the Court. Mr. Gosh appeared before the 
Court voluntarily and was granted bail on his appeal. He was neither threatened nor arrested 
by law enforcement agencies, therefore the allegations are incorrect.

56. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr. <b>Antonio Santos do Carmo</b>, rural worker and member of the Movimiento de los 
Trabajadores Sin Tierra (MST), a movement which works for land rights and agrarian reform in 
Brazil. According to information received, on 2 May 2007, Mr. Santos do Carmo, along with a group 
of MST members, were ambushed by unknown individuals, in front of the Hacienda S&#227;o Felipe, near 
the motorway connecting Belem de Para with Brasilia. The assailants, some of them allegedly 
belonging to the military police, entered the MST camp and began to attack those inside.  Mr. Santos 
do Carmo was violently assaulted and died from bullet wounds to the chest and throat.  Other MST 
members were also injured in the attack. After the incident, MST members blocked the road between 
Belem and Brasilia as a form of protest and demanded that representatives from the National Institute 
for Agrarian Colonization and Reform, and the federal Government take action to resolve the 
situation in the area. The following day one a man suspected of having taken part in the attack on the

58. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of <b>Mr. Annadurdy Khajiev</b>, journalist, senior member of the exiled opposition Watan 
party, which, inter alia, calls for democratic governance and observance of human rights in 
Turkmenistan, and a dual Turkmen and Russian national, who was reportedly arrested on 19 February 
2007 in the port city of Varna, by Police agents reportedly following a formal request for extradition 
from Turkmen authorities. Mr. Khajiev has been living in Bulgaria since 2001 and obtained refugee 
status in March 2004. The Government of Turkmenistan reportedly requested his extradition on 
charges of embezzlement and allegations of theft of 40 million US dollars in connection with Mr. 
Khajiev&#8217;s activities as a bank director in Turkmenistan.  
 
59. It was reported that a previous request for extradition in 2002 was declined by a Bulgarian 
court in May 2003 for the reason that Mr. Khajiev&#8217;s political activities had been the actual grounds 
for this request. Bulgarian authorities have interrogated him regarding members of the Turkmen 
opposition in exile. Reports indicate that, at the time the communication was sent, the decision to 
extend Mr. Khajiev&#8217;s detention and to extradite him was to be scrutinised by a Varna court on 23 
February 2007. Grave concerns were expressed that Mr. Annadurdy Khajiev&#8217;s physical integrity or </p>

Response from the Government sent on 3 April 2007 </b> 
 
60. The Government informed that after thorough investigation by the relevant Bulgarian 
authorities, Mr. <b>Annadurdy Khajiev </b>has a dual, Turkmen-Russian nationality. He has been living in 
Bulgaria since 2001. On 7 April 2004, the Police Department of the Ministry of Interior issued him a 
humanitarian status (ID No 850000546). He also possesses a humanitarian status certificate for 
travelling abroad (No 860002397). Mr. Khajiev was arrested in Varna on 20 February 2007, and 
detained for 72 hours, on the basis of ordinance of the Supreme Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Cassation 
following a letter from INTERPOL-Ashkhabad to INTERPOL-Sofia about the crime he was accused 
of and about the intention of the Turkmen authorities to request his extradition. On 21 February, the 
Prosecutor General of Bulgaria received a letter from the Prosecutor General of Turkmenistan with a 
request for extradition of Mr. Khajiev on charge of embezzlement and allegations of theft of some 
USD 40 million, under articles 229 and 187 of the Criminal Code of Turkmenistan. In connection 
with this, it has to be noted that on 22 May 2003, the District Court of Varna declined a previous 
request for extradition of Mr. Khajiev for the reason that the prosecution was based on political 
grounds. On 22 February, the District Court of Varna, following the request of the Varna District 
Prosecutor, prescribed the detention of Mr. Khajiev for 40 days (until 30 March). Mr. Khajiev lodged 
a complaint against the arrest which was confirmed by the Varna Court of Appeal on 27 February 27. 
The decision of the Court of Appeal regarding the detention of Mr. Khajiev is final and there is no 
further possibility of appeal. The Court of Appeal also specified that the Regional Court of Varna 
would consider the case in substance as a first instance. The above summary shows that the rights of 
Mr. Khajiev, more precisely the rights under Article 9 (Rights of Freedom and of Security) and 
Article 14 (Right of Equal treatment) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, were 
integrally safeguarded by the Bulgarian authorities. The measures taken by the Bulgarian authorities 
are lawful and legitimate and by no means intended to violate the rights of Mr. Khajiev under Article 
19 of the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The request of the Special Rapporteurs 
that all necessary measures be taken by the Government to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of 
the aforementioned person are respected and that the accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations is ensured will be dully noted.

wish to represent defendants before the ECCC. Regarding the decision made by the ECCC to expel </p>

the international non-governmental organisation OSIJ from all cooperation, according to the 
information received the OSIJ issued a press release on 14 February 2007, calling for a thorough 
investigation of allegations that Cambodian officials may be obliged to pay &#8220;kickbacks&#8221; in return for 
their positions at the ECCC. The press statement also called for any investigation on the case to be 
made public and, if the allegations proved true, that immediate measures were taken by the ECCC to 
address the problem. The release was based on information gathered over several months from 
sources both within and outside of the ECCC. 
 
63. On 16 February, the Deputy Prime Minister Sok An stated in the newspaper Agence France 
Press that Justice Initiative was no longer allowed to enter the court. Meanwhile, ECCC Deputy 
Administrator Michelle Lee and Public Affairs Officer Peter foster claimed that the OSIJ would still 
have full access to the tribunals. Later that same day, though, the ECCC Administrator Sean Visoth 
sent a letter to the OSIJ, which stated that, the Cambodian side of the ECCC&#8217;s Office of 
Administration would &#8220;have no further cooperation with the OSIJ&#8221;.  
 
64. On 9 March, OSIJ members were informed by two ECCC staff members that two weeks 
earlier, the Prime Minister Hun Sen had issued an oral order to expel the OSIJ from Cambodia and 
had asked for a list of the names of everyone associated with the OSIJ&#8217;s ECCC project. On the 11 
March, the OSIJ was told that the delivery of names to the Deputy Prime Minister might trigger a 
decision to execute the expulsion order. We understand that the OSIJ has served as a primary source 
of information about the ECCC and has provided a platform for Cambodian civil society to exchange 
views on the chambers. National and international non-governmental organizations have an essential 
role in scrutinizing the work of the courts and thereby ensuring that trial proceedings conform to 
international standards guaranteeing the right of defendants to a fair trial before a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal. We also understand that the reported action against OSIJ may be 
in response to the issued public statement mentioned above. The allegations, if proven true, would 
raise serious concerns as to the impartiality and independence of the Chambers and their ability to 
provide defendants with a fair trial in accordance with international standards. The expulsion of the 
OSIJ would also constitute a damning statement about the willingness of the Cambodian Government 
to allow the ECCC to proceed free of improper government influence and also hinder the cause of 
freedom of expression generally in Cambodia. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 2 August 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief 
</b> 
65. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal concerning the following case: 
According to information received, on 8 June 2007, the Ministry of Cult and Religion and the 
Buddhist patriarch Non Nget issued a directive which forbids all monks living in the Kingdom of 
Cambodia from organizing or participating in any demonstration or strike or carrying out Buddhist 
marches which affect public order.  The decision also bars monks from providing false information 
which may affect Buddhist religion. The directive states that monks who do not respect the 
instructions strictly will be punished in accordance to Buddhist norms and national law. The directive 
was adopted after Khmer Kampuchea Krom monks carried out a series of peaceful demonstrations in 
Phnom Penh in February and April 2007 to advocate for the protection of the rights of the Khmer 
Krom, particularly in Vietnam following the alleged defrocking and arrest of five Kampuchea Krom 
monks in that country. It has been reported that the monks who were defrocked and arrested in 
Vietnam were sentenced to 2 - 4 years of imprisonment for disturbing traffic when they organised 
demonstrations to advocate for the religious and cultural rights of the Khmer Krom in Vietnam to be </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 24 
 
respected. It was feared that the Cambodian authorities will use the directive of 8 June 2007 to 
prevent monks from continuing to carry out their peaceful protests in defence of human rights, and to 
crack down on them if they go ahead. Allegedly the directive is specifically aimed at restricting the 
activities of Khmer Kampuchea Krom monks who protest regularly and who are under particular 
focus at the moment because of their activities in Vietnam. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 23 August 2007

stories concerning illegal logging in the Bakan district. On 10 August 2007, after Mr. Phat received 
two threats by phone and his house was set on fire by unknown assaulters. Reportedly, the fire was 
quickly extinguished and Mr. Phat and his family were not injured. A local police chief allegedly 
stated that this attack was likely in revenge for Mr. Phat&#8217;s recent reporting of illegal logging and that 
the police was approaching the case as an attack on the free press. Mr. Phat reportedly lodged a 
complaint to the Pursat Prosecutor on 13 August. On the evening of 17 August, a group of three 
people, who names are known to the Rapporteur, allegedly tried to burn down Mr. Phat&#8217;s house again. 
Two of the men were reportedly arrested, whereas the third one escaped. The three men were using a 
car that belongs to a local wood businessman, who name is known to the Rapporteur. The two men 
detained were reportedly charged for attempted arson.

67. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Tim Sa Khorn</b>, chief monk in the North Phnom Denh temple, and member of the 
Khmer Krom community in Cambodia. Mr Tim Sa Khorn acquired Cambodian citizenship after he 
moved in 1979 to the commune of Phnom Denh in Kirivong District in Takeo Province because of 
acts of harassment against him.  According to the information received, in 2002, Mr. Khorn was 
appointed as chief monk of North Phnom-Denh temple. On 16 June 2007, Supreme Patriarch Tep 
Vong issued a religious decree in both Cambodian and Vietnamese languages to defrock Mr. Khorn, 
accusing him of conducting activities that were harmful to the Cambodia-Vietnam friendship. 
Subsequently, the Vietnamese authorities allegedly circulated this decree to Khmer Krom Buddhist 
temples. On 3 July 2007 a spokesperson of the Cambodian Minister of Foreign Affairs declared that 
Mr. Khorn &#8220;had returned to Vietnam&#8221; after reportedly being summoned to the office of the religious 
head of the Takeo Province in Cambodia and being forced to enter a car. On 2 August 2007 
Vietnamese authorities announced that he had been arrested for having illegally entered the country.

communication envoy&#233;e le 14 novembre 2006 sur Mme. Agn&#232;s Tail&#233;, animatrice de 
l&#8217;&#233;mission radion &#171; &#192; vous la parole &#187; de la radio Sweet FM, qu&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; enlev&#233;e &#224; son 
domicile par trois hommes qui l&#8217;auraient ensuite brutalement agress&#233;e. Le Gouvernement a 
inform&#233; que les Autorit&#233;s camerounaises ont aussit&#244;t engag&#233; sur le cas les investigations 
n&#233;cessaires. Les services comp&#233;tents de la Police Judiciaire camerounaise, notamment du 
Commissariat no 2 de la ville de Douala, qui ont &#233;t&#233; saisis de la plainte introduite au nom de 
l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;e, m&#232;nent depuis lors des enqu&#234;tes pour la manifestation de la v&#233;rit&#233; et la poursuite 
des auteurs de ces faits. Mme. Taile a aussi re&#231;u le r&#233;confort du Ministre de la 
Communication. Il appara&#238;t que les informations contenues dans la correspondance du 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sont disproportion&#233;es. Il y aurait lieu de se demander si l&#8217;agression dont 
Mme. Taile a &#233;t&#233; victime est directement li&#233;e &#224; son activit&#233; de journaliste, dans la mesure o&#249; 
existent une tr&#232;s grande libert&#233; des m&#233;dias camerounais. La s&#233;curit&#233; des m&#233;dias fait l&#8217;objet 
d&#8217;une large protection en droit camerounais, y compris des normes constitutionelles.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 4 January 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</b> 
76. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
the situation of <b>Mr Jigme Gyatso</b>, detained at Qushui Prison on the outskirts of Lhasa. Mr 
Jigme Gyatso was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of 
political rights by the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court on 25 November 1996 on 
charges of &#8220;planning to found an illegal organization and to seek to divide the country and to 
damage its unity&#8221;. During the meeting with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
on the occasion of his visit to Qushui Prison, Mr Gyatso, inter alia, explained that, in May 
2004, his sentence was extended by two years after shouting pro-Dalai Lama slogans at the 
Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) Prison, upon which he was reportedly also kicked and 
beaten and treated with electric batons.According to new allegations received, since meeting 
with the Special Rapporteur on torture, Mr Gyatso has been illtreated and held in solitary 
confinement in particularly restricted conditions. Moreover, it has been suggested that further 
restrictions have been placed upon Mr Gyatso regarding his monthly family visits rights and 
that his health is rapidly deteriorating. Earlier in the year 2006 he was reportedly hospitalized 
for several weeks and was unable to walk normally due to a leg injury. Also, contrary to 
information provided by Mr. Gyatso during his meeting with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture, it is alleged that Mr Gyatso&#8217;s prison term was actually extended by three years for 
&#8220;inciting splittism&#8221; following the incident at TAR Prison. In connection with Mr. Gyatso&#8217;s 
solitary confinement, concerns were expressed that he might be at risk of ill-treatment. 
Concern was particulary expressed for his deteriorating health. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 9 March 2007 
</b> 
77. In its response, the Government stated that it has carefully investigated the matters 
referred to in this letter and wishes to make the following reply: <b>Jinmei Jiacuo (Jigme 
Gyatso)</b>, also known as <b>Yideng Ciren (Yidem Tsering)</b>, who was sentenced by the Lhasa 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment and 5 years&#8217; deprivation of political 
rights for the crime of seeking to divide the State. He accepted the judgement and did not file 
an appeal. In March 2004, while serving his sentence, Jinmei Jiacuo became involved in 
activities aimed at inciting separation of the State, for which he was indicted by the 
procuratorial authorities. On 18 May 2004 the Lhasa Intermediate People&#8217;s Court sentenced 
him to 3 years&#8217; imprisonment for the crime of inciting separation of the State, to be added on 
to the 7 years and 27 days remaining from his original sentence; he was thus ordered to serve 
a further 9 years and 27 days, with the expiry of his sentence to fall on 30 March 2014. Mr. 
Jiacuo accepted the judgement and did not file an appeal; he is currently serving his sentence 
in the Qushui prison in Tibet Autonomous Region. According to article 71 of the Criminal 
Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, if a convicted criminal, having been sentenced but not 
having served the sentence in its entirety, commits a new crime, a judgement shall be 
rendered in respect of the new offence; taking the crime into account, the duration of the 
combined punishment shall not exceed the length of the individual sentences taken together, 
nor shall it be any shorter than the longest of the individual sentences. It was pursuant to this 
provision that the Lhasa Intermediate People&#8217;s Court issued the above-mentioned sentence in 
respect of Jinmei Jiacuo. After entering prison, Jinmei Jiacuo enjoyed the same rights and </p>

treatment as other criminals. From November 2005, before he met with the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture in November 2005, until the present he has remained in 
a double cell, and his conditions of detention have not changed; there is no substance to the 
allegation in the letter that &#8220;since meeting with the Special Rapporteur [he] has been ill-
treated and held in solitary confinement in particularly restricted conditions&#8221;. Jinmei Jiacuo is 
currently in excellent health and receives regular visits from family members, and the 
allegations in the letter that &#8220;restrictions have been placed on [him] regarding his &#8230; family 
visits and that his health is rapidly deteriorating&#8221; are not true. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 January 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom 
of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
 
</b>78. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr. <b>Jamyang Gyatso</b>, a monk at Bora Monastery in Xiahe, Northwest Gansu. 
According to the information received, he was arrested on 8 January 2007, by plain clothed 
Chinese security officials outside Bora Monastery. Officials at the Monastery later discovered 
that Mr. Gyatso&#8217;s room had been searched and that a bag full of religious scriptures, including 
CDs, had been removed. Several calls made to the publicly listed number for the local police 
were dismissed as a wrong number or the recipient hung up when enquiries were made as to 
Mr. Gyatso&#8217;s whereabouts. Mr Gyatso was detained at an unknown location at the time the 
communication was sent. 
 
79. Before his arrest Mr. Gyatso had served as custodian of the gardens and forests in Bora 
Monastery and encouraged local Tibetans to listen to foreign radio broadcasts. He had also 
worked on making copies of a book written by a Tibetan poet, Hortsang Jigme, who lives 
abroad. His work as a human rights defender was carried out peacefully in the form of 
religious teachings and providing information to local Tibetans on how to receive images and 
writings of Tibetans living abroad. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of 
Mr. Gyatso forms part of an ongoing campaign against Tibetans advocating for the human 
rights of Tibetans, such as the right to freedom of expression and freedom of religion. In view 
of the reported detention at an undisclosed location, further concern is expressed that Mr. 
Gyatso might be at risk of ill-treatment. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 23 March 2007</b> 
 
80. In its reply, the Chinese Government informed that Mr. Jamyang Gyatso is a male 
Tibetan, born 30 April 1981, and is a monk at Bora monastery in Gansu province. The 
Government stated that on 9 January 2007, in accordance with the law, Mr. Gyatso was 
placed under investigation by the State security authorities, on suspicion of having conducted 
unlawful acts which endangered State security. In the course of the investigation Mr. Gyatso 
confessed in full to having committed the offence of incitement to separatism. On 3 February 
2007, the Chinese security authorities ordered that he be placed under restricted freedom of 
movement, on his own recognizance, pending trial.

81. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Ablikim Abdiriyim</b>, third son of the human rights defender for the minority 
Uighur community in the northwest region of Xinjiang, Ms Rebiya Kadeer. He is currently 
being detained at Tianshan Detention Centre in Urumchi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uighur 
Autonomous Region (XUAR).  Mr Abdiriyim was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 1 July 2005 and of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 29 June 2006. According to 
the information received, Mr Abdiriyim was arrested on 13 June 2006, along with his brothers 
Mr Alim Abduriyim and Mr Kahar Abduriyim.  Subsequently, Mr Ablikim Abdiriyim was 
subjected to prolonged interrogations and beatings whilst awaiting trial. As a result of this 
treatment and the detention conditions, he is suffering from ill health. However, he is being 
denied access to medical treatment. He has also been prevented from wearing warm clothes 
provided by his family.  Furthermore, on 26 November 2006, Mr Ablikim Adiriym was seen 
being carried out of Tianshan Detention Centre on a stretcher. On 28 January 2007, Mr 
Abdiriyim was charged and tried with &quot;subversion of state power&quot;, &quot;ethnic separatism&quot; and 
&quot;sending information over the internet to Ms Kadeer&quot;.   
 
82. Before their arrest, on 1 June 2006, both Mr Ablikim Abdureyim and his brother Mr 
Alim Abduriyim had been beaten by police in front of their children and their sister. Mr 
Ablikim Abdureyim was beaten unconscious and later hopitalised. His sister was then given a 
mobile phone by the perpetrators and told to call their mother, Rebiya Kadeer, who was in the 
United States at the time and to inform her about what was happening. She was later taken to 
hospital and treated for symptoms of stress and shock. Since 1999, when Ms Kadeer was first 
detained as a prisoner of conscience, members of her family have been subjected to ongoing 
harassment and intimidation. After her release on medical parole on 17 March 2005, when she 
left China for the USA, the intimidation of Ms Kadeer&#8217;s family intensified.   Prior to her 
release she had been warned that if she engaged with members of the Uighur ethnic 
community or spoke publicly about &quot;sensitive issues&quot; after her release, her &quot;businesses and 
children will be finished&quot;. The &quot;Kadeer Working Group&quot;, has been established by the 
authorities to handle the state's actions against the family and its businesses. Members of the 
Kadeer family have been informed that they should find new residences as the court would be 
confiscating their properties around or after the Chinese New Year, in February 2007, as 
partial payment for the heavy fines levied on the family business. On 27 November 2006, the 
day following Ms Rebiya Kadeer's election as president of the World Uyghur Congress 
(WUC), Mr Alim Abdiriyim and his brother Mr Kahar Abdiriyim were subjected to fines 
amounting to millions of US dollars and Mr Alim Abdiriyim was sentenced to seven years of 
imprisonment on charges of tax evasion.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 17 July 2007 
</b> 
83. The Government informed that on 13 June 2006, Ablikim Abdureyim was taken into 
custody. The Urumchi city people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s office in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous 
Region laid charges against the defendant Ablikim Abdureyim for the offence of incitement to 
separatism and instituted proceedings against him with the Urumchi city people&#8217;s 
intermediate court. Following proceedings in open court, the Urumchi city people&#8217;s </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 30 
 
intermediate court determined that on 21 April 2004, in the course of operations by the fire 
protection department of the Tianshan district public security bureau in Urumchi to check and 
rectify the fire protection facilities in the Rebiya Kadeer office building, Ablikim Abdureyim, 
acting under instructions from his mother Rebiya Kadeer, together with Alim Abdureyim, 
Rushangul Kadeer and others, started spreading rumours to the effect that the Government 
was going to prohibit and to close down the businesses operating in the Rebiya Kadeer office 
building, and other such allegations, printed 450 inflammatory leaflets, purchased cotton 
sheeting and started to prepare banners, with the intention of stirring people up to march on 
the government offices.  
</p><p> 
84. On 17 July 2004, Ablikim Abdureyim downloaded from the Internet two articles 
containing separatist material, entitled &#8220;Issues to be on guard against and to prohibit in jihad&#8221; 
and &#8220;Struggle towards independence&#8221;, and sent these to the Yahoo Uighur language website, 
requesting the dissemination of the articles on the Internet.  
 
85. On 15 May 2006, after gleaning from the Internet the news that the United States 
Government had refused to hand over to the Chinese Government five East Turkestan 
terrorists who were Chinese nationals and was preparing to hand them over to the Albanian 
Government, Ablikim Abdureyim posted under that article such comments as &#8220;Long live East 
Turkestan! &#8230; What we are doing in our own land to repel the alien invaders is not terrorism: 
it is revolution, we are making revolution! ...&#8221; and so forth. On 28 May 2006, acting under 
instructions from his mother Rebiya Kadeer and stepfather, Sidikaji Rozi, and together with 
Alim Abdureyim, Rushangul Kadeer and others, Ablikim Abdureyim concocted an article 
giving a distorted picture of the Chinese human rights system and nationalities policy, 
entitled: &#8220;Are we the criminals?&#8221; and, by use of the Internet, sent it to Rebiya Kadeer, Sidikaji 
Rozi and others in the United States of America and, after further amending this material, 
prepared to send it to people from Xinjiang who were out of the country at that time. The 
Urumchi city people&#8217;s intermediate court found that Ablikim Abdureyim had engaged in 
separatist activities and had violated the unity of the State and that his conduct constituted the 
offence of incitement to separatism. This conduct clearly does not fall within the scope of 
exercise of the freedom of expression and opinion; not only is it in breach of criminal law, it 
also violates the Constitution.  
 
86. On 17 April 2007, the Urumchi city people&#8217;s intermediate level court handed down its 
judgement and published its verdict: pursuant to the provisions of article 103, paragraph 2, 
article 56, article 55, paragraph 1, and article 106 of the Criminal Code of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China, Ablikim Abdureyim was sentenced to nine years&#8217; fixed term 
imprisonment and stripped of his political rights for three years, for the offence of incitement 
to separatism. In the course of this case, the courts, in accordance with the law, safeguarded 
Ablikim Abdureyim&#8217;s lawful rights. Ablikim Abdureyim did not appoint defence counsel, nor 
did he request the court to assign a defence lawyer on his behalf. Article 34 of the Chinese 
Code of Criminal Procedure provides that, &#8220;if a defendant is blind, deaf or mute, or is a minor, 
and has not appointed defence counsel,&#8221; or &#8220;could be sentenced to death, but has not 
appointed defence counsel, the people&#8217;s court shall designate a lawyer to undertake the duty 
of providing legal assistance&#8221;. As in this case there was no duly appointed defence counsel, as 
stipulated by law, thus during the trial at first instance there was no defence counsel 
participating in the proceedings. During the trial, the defendant Ablikim Abdureyim made a 
full confession to having perpetrated a criminal offence. Three days before the trial opened, 
the court of first instance, as prescribed by law, posted an advance announcement of the date </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 31 
 
and venue of the trial on the bulletin board and notified the procuratorial authorities and the 
defence thereof. Following the proceedings at first instance, Ablikim Abdureyim did not 
lodge an appeal and the judgement has since become enforceable. During the period over 
which Ablikim Abdureyim has been held in custody, the Chinese public security authorities 
have conducted all proceedings in strict compliance with the law and there have been no 
instances of intimidation, excessively long custody, use of torture to extract confessions or 
other such practices being used against him. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 19 June 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the right to the 
highest standard of health  
 
</b>87. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of <b>Mr. Peng Ming</b> detained at Han Yang Prison No. 16 in Wu Han City, Hu Bei 
province. The case of Mr. Peng Ming is the subject matter of Opinion no. 43/2005 of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, adopted on 29 November 2005. In that Opinion, the 
Working Group finds that &#8220;any limitation of Mr. Peng Ming&#8217;s legitimate political and non-
violent activities carried out peacefully and in exercise of his rights to freedom of association 
and expression would be contrary to the international human rights law enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#8221;. The Working Group concludes that Mr. Peng 
Ming&#8217;s detention, which lasts since 28 May 2004, is &#8220;arbitrary, being in contravention of 
articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#8221;. 
 
88. In the course of the last year, the independent experts received reports that Mr. Peng 
Ming, who continued to be detained in spite of the Working Group&#8217;s Opinion, was suffering 
from serious health problems, as well as allegations that the prison authorities were denying 
him adequate medical care. 
 
89. The Working Group and the Rapporteurs report that they received information that Mr. 
Peng Ming, who continued to be detained in spite of the Working Group&#8217;s Opinion, was 
suffering from serious health problems, including kidney stones, infections, swelling and open 
wounds on arms and legs, and that the prison authorities were denying him adequate medical 
care. On 14 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to freedom of religion or belief, an allegation letter concerning <b>Mr. Runggye Adak</b>, 
of the Yonru nomadic group, as well as reportedly <b>200 people</b> allegedly involved in a protest 
to release him from prison. According to the information received, on 1 August 2007, Mr. 
Adak took the stage during the annual horse racing festival in Lithang, in the Kanze 
autonomous prefecture in the Suchuan province. He allegedly made a statement defending the 
Dalai Lama&#8217;s return and the release of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima who has been recognized as 
the eleventh reincarnation of the Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama. Furthermore, he stated 
that the people of Lithang should have freedom of religion or belief. Mr. Adak was reportedly 
arrested by the People&#8217;s Armed Police as soon as he made these comments and subsequently 
taken into custody. According to the reports received, a large crowd proceeded to the police 
station and gained access to the compound. The crowd was dispersed after the authorities 
assured that Mr. Adak would be released the following day. On 2 August 2007, as people 
gathered in the police station again to demand the release of Mr. Adak, 200 protesters were 
allegedly taken into custody by the People&#8217;s Armed Police, including several other members 
of the Yonru nomadic group.

<b>Response from the Government sent on 31 July 2007 
</b> 
90. The Government indicated that <b>Peng Ming</b>, male, born 11 October 1956, ethnic Han 
Chinese, university graduate, unemployed, was arrested on 17 June 2004 on suspicion of the 
offence of kidnapping and on 23 June was remanded in custody. On 20 July 2005, the Wuhan 
city people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s office in Hubei province laid charges against the defendant Peng 
Ming for the offences of setting up and directing a terrorist organization, kidnapping, and 
possession of counterfeit currency and instituted proceedings against him with the Wuhan city 
intermediate people&#8217;s court. 
 
91. Following proceedings held in open court, the Wuhan city intermediate people&#8217;s court 
determined the following: since November 2000, through such means as composing and 
publishing written materials, devising training courses in terrorism, disseminating materials 
over the Internet, and others, Peng Ming had propagated and promoted views advocating 
violence and terror, recruited members of his terrorist organization, and incited others to carry 
out violent and terrorist criminal activities, including kidnapping and murder. To raise funds, 
from early 2002 to May 2004 in Wuhan, Changsha, Beijing and other places, Peng Ming had 
plotted, organized and directed criminal activities involving kidnappings. Between June 2003 
and early 2004, Peng Ming had masterminded the setting up of a training base in Myanmar, 
for which he had enlisted recruits, and had instructed others in Myanmar to train these 
recruits, to teach them how to carry out kidnappings, murders and other crimes of violence 
and terror, and had then directed these trained recruits, after their return to their homeland, to 
enlist more recruits and to carry out acts of violence and terror. 
 
92. On 22 May 2004, Peng Ming had knowingly carried forged renminbi banknotes across 
the border from Thailand into Myanmar, and was arrested by the Burmese police, who found 
on his person a total of 108 hundred-yuan banknotes, totalling 10,800 yuan in value. The 
Tachilek district court in Myanmar had sentenced Peng Ming to seven years&#8217; fixed-term 
imprisonment. Subsequently, the Myanmar authorities, in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of the China Myanmar frontier control and cooperation agreement between the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Myanmar, had handed Peng 
Ming over to the Chinese judicial authorities. 
 
93. The Wuhan city people&#8217;s intermediate court passed down the following judgement: 
Peng Ming had disseminated and put into effect ideas advocating violence and terror, as a 
ringleader he had actively recruited and organized members, had established a training base 
for violence and terrorism, had trained operatives in violence and terror, and had organized, 
planned and carried out acts of violence and terror involving, among other things, kidnapping, 
thereby seriously endangering public security, and his actions had therefore constituted the 
offence of setting up and directing a terrorist organization. For the purpose of raising funds, 
Peng Ming had on many occasions also prepared acts of kidnapping involving the use of 
explosives, coercion and other methods, which acts constituted the offence of kidnapping. 
Peng Ming had also knowingly been in possession of forged renminbi currency, furthermore 
in a relatively large amount, and these actions constituted the offence of being in possession 
of counterfeit currency. The kidnapping activities directed and put into effect by Peng Ming 
were categorized as the preparation of the instruments and creation of the necessary 
conditions for the perpetration of an offence, and his acts of kidnapping were categorized as 
the preparations for an offence and, in accordance with the law, were subject to the imposition 
of lighter sentences. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

94. On 13 October 2005, the Wuhan city people&#8217;s intermediate court, passing judgement at 
first instance, sentenced Peng Ming to life imprisonment for the offence of setting up and 
directing a terrorist organization and stripped him of his political rights in perpetuity; for the 
offence of kidnapping, it sentenced him to 13 years&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment, stripping him 
of his political rights for two years; and fining him the amount of 20,000 yuan; for the offence 
of possession of counterfeit currency, it sentenced him to six years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment, 
and fined him the amount of 15,000 yuan. The court ruled that the final consolidated sentence 
should be life imprisonment, with the deprivation of his political rights in perpetuity and a 
fine of 35,000 yuan. 
 
95. Following his sentencing at first instance, Peng Ming refused to accept the court&#8217;s 
verdict and lodged an appeal. The Hubei provincial people&#8217;s high court, after hearing the case 
at second instance, found that the determination of the offences by the court of first instance 
had been based on clearly established facts, the evidence had been sound and ample, the 
classification of the offences had been accurate, the sentence was commensurate with the 
offences and the trial proceedings had followed due process. Accordingly, on 15 December 
2005, the court reached its ruling at second instance and, on 23 December, made public its 
judgement, that Peng Ming&#8217;s appeal was dismissed and that the original judgement should 
stand. 
 
96. Upon entering prison, the results of Peng Ming&#8217;s physical examination showed that he 
was suffering from high blood pressure, kidney stones in his right kidney, and hepatitis. 
Following medication and treatment over the course of nearly one year, his state of health 
improved demonstrably. In December 2006, the results of his medical examination clearly 
showed that, apart from a slight kidney stone problem, all other results were normal and he is 
continuing with his treatment as before. The allegations in the communication that we have 
received, including that &#8220;he suffers from serious health problems &#8230; infections&#8221;, and that &#8220;the 
prison authorities are denying him adequate medical care&#8221;, are completely groundless.  
<b> 
Letter of allegations sent on 14 August 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief </b> 
 
97. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they 
had received concerning Mr. <b>Runggye Adak</b>, of the Yonru nomadic group, as well as 
reportedly 200 people allegedly involved in a protest to release him from prison. According to 
the information received, on 1 August 2007, Mr. Adak took the stage during the annual horse 
racing festival in Lithang, in the Kanze autonomous prefecture in the Suchuan province. He 
allegedly made a statement defending the Dalai Lama&#8217;s return and the release of Gedhun 
Choekyi Nyima who has been recognized as the eleventh reincarnation of the Panchen Lama 
by the Dalai Lama. Furthermore, he stated that the people of Lithang should have freedom of 
religion or belief. Mr. Adak was reportedly arrested by the People&#8217;s Armed Police as soon as 
he made these comments and subsequently taken into custody. According to the reports 
received, a large crowd proceeded to the police station and gained access to the compound. 
The crowd was dispersed after the authorities assured that Mr. Adak would be released the 
following day. On 2 August 2007, as people gathered in the police station again to demand 
the release of Mr. Adak, 200 protesters were allegedly taken into custody by the People&#8217;s 
Armed Police, including several other members of the Yonru nomadic group.

<b>Response from the Government sent on 20 November 2007 
</b> 
98. The Government informed that Mr. <b>Runggye Adak</b>, aged 53, is an ethnic Tibetan and 
farmer from Kahui village in Benge rural district, Lithang county, Garz&#234; prefecture. On 1 
August 2007, he was taken into criminal custody, in accordance with the law, by the Lithang 
county public security bureau on suspicion of unlawful activities intended to foment the 
division of the State. On 25 August, in accordance with the provisions of article 103, 
paragraph 23, of the Criminal Code of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, his detention was 
authorized by Garz&#234; prefecture people&#8217;s procuratorate. After measures of restraint had been 
imposed against Runggye Adak by the public security bureau, he did not submit any 
complaint to the judicial authorities. The case is still at the pretrial inquiry and preliminary 
investigation stage and has not yet been referred to the procurator&#8217;s office.  
 
99. The Chinese Constitution protects citizens&#8217; freedom of religious belief and freedom of 
expression. No one may be prosecuted because of their expression of their views or the 
legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of religious belief. The Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, together with 
other international human rights instruments, clearly stipulate that the exercise of rights and 
freedoms must be subject to restrictions under the law. In accordance with its law, China 
punishes actions intended to divide the country and other illegal and criminal activities, in 
conformity with the relevant provisions of international human rights conventions.  
 
100. In the present case, there was no statement by Runggye Adak, as alleged, demanding 
steps by the Chinese Government to guarantee the safety of the Dalai Lama&#8217;s return to China 
and the release of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, appointed by the Dalai Lama as the eleventh 
Panchen Lama, or that the people of Lithang should have freedom of religion or belief, nor is 
it true that assurances were given that Runggye Adak would be released the following day or 
that some 200 protesters were taken into custody by the armed police. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 21 August 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of

101. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government information they had received concerning <b>Melanie Raoul</b>, <b>Sam Price</b>, <b>Leslie 
Kaup</b>, <b>Nupur Modi</b>, <b>Duane Martinez</b>, <b>Pete Speller</b>, <b>Lhadon Tethong</b> and <b>Paul Golding</b>, 
human rights activists. According to the information received, Melanie Raoul, Sam Price, 
Leslie Kaup, Nupur Modi, Duane Martinez and Pete Speller, citizens of Canada, the United 
State and the United Kindom, were arrested by the Chinese Police on 7 August 2007 during a 
demonstration at the Great Wall of China. Reportedly, the protesters displayed banners calling 
for Tibet&#8217;s independence. On a related manifestation, Lhadon Tethong, Executive-Director of 
the organization Students for a Free Tibet, and Paul Golding were detained in Beijing on the 
same day. Allegedly, they had been manifesting for the independence of Tibet during the 
celebrations on the countdown to the Olympic Games in Beijing. According to the 
information received, the eight human rights activists were released from prison on 8 August 
2007 and deported to Hong Kong on the same day.

<b>Letter of allegations sent on 30 August 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
</b> 
103. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative sent a letter of allegations 
concerning  the <b>Asia Catalyst Group</b>, a New York-based non-governmental organisation 
collaborating with local partners to foster respect for human rights and social justice; the 
China Orchid AIDS Project (COAP), a Beijing-based support group for those suffering from 
HIV/ AIDS as well as the families and orphans of those killed by HIV/ AIDS; human rights 
defender Mr Zhu Zhaowu, director of the COAP&#8217;s office in Kaifeng in Henan province; 
Yirenping, an Information and Counselling Centre for those suffering from HIV/AIDS based 
in Beijing; the Alliance of People Living with HIV/AIDS; CAP+, a network of organisations 
of people living with HIV, and Mr Duan Jun, Head of the Henan Zhumadian PLWHA Self-
Help Group, 
 
104. According to information received, Chinese authorities allegedly called for the 
cancellation of a meeting organised by the Asia Catalyst Group and the China Orchid AIDS 
Project (COAP) to be held at the beginning of August 2007 in the city of Guangzhou in 
Guangdong province. The meeting was to involve a discussion with Chinese and foreign 
experts on how people living with HIV can best exercise their legal rights. The authorities 
reportedly said that they considered such issues to be too sensitive for public discussion. 
 
105. In addition, on 15 August 2007, officers of the Kaifeng Public Security Bureau ordered 
the temporary closure for two provincial offices of COAP in Henan province. On 16 August 
2007, Mr Zhu Zhaowu, the director of COAP&#8217;s Kaifeng office, was allegedly instructed to 
clear out the office by midday of the following day or risk his own personal safety. The 
authorities in Henan are reportedly acting as an obstacle to Mr Zhu Zhaowu&#8217;s attempts to 
secure alternative premises for COAP offices. 
 
106. Yirenping was reportedly informed by local authorities that it could not hold a meeting 
planned for 4 August 2007 in Guangzhou. A meeting organised by the China Alliance of 
People Living with HIV/ AIDS to be held on August 19-20 2007 in Kaifeng was also 
cancelled by members of Kaifeng police, on the grounds that the organisation was 
unregistered and therefore illegal. 
 
107. Similarly, CAP+ planned to hold a training in August for organisations of people living 
with HIV in Henan in collaboration with among others Henan Zhumadian PLWHA Self-Help 
Group. The organisations were given the permission to organise the meeting by the health 
authorities. However, the organisations were contacted by the Bureau of Public Security and 
summoned to cancel the meeting. As a result, Mr Duan Jun, who was supposed to participate 
in the training, is reportedly under constant police surveillance.

apparent order of the Ministry of Public Security. Mr Yang is reportedly detained at Heitong 
Detention Center in Heilongjiang with no access to his family. It is not clear whether he has 
access to a lawyer. It is believed that Mr Yang was arrested because of his campaign in 
collecting signatures to support an open letter entitled &#8220;We want human rights, not the 
Olympics&#8221; in villages where he had been helping farmers who lost their land to seek legal 
redress. Mr Yang had reportedly collected more than 10,000 signatures, mostly by

<p>115. The Special Rapporteurs, the Chairperson-Rapporteur and the Special Representative 
sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr <b>Zheng Dajing</b>, a petitioner and human rights defender. 
According to the information received, Mr Zheng Dajing was arrested and detained on 9 
September 2007 by officials of the Public Security Bureau of Shiyan City, Yunxi County, 
Hubei Province, on criminal charges of &#8220;petitioning leading to disturbance of social order.&#8221; 
Mr Zheng was believed to be held at the Yunxi Detention Centre, however, on 18 September 
2007 it appeared that Mr Zheng is being detained at Yancao Station in Hongtai Yuansigou 
Village, where he has been beaten and subjected to other forms of ill-treatment. Yancao 
Station is an unofficial detention facility established by local authorities for the purpose of 
detaining petitioners. Local Government authorities allege that Yancao Station is in fact 
merely a &#8220;class for petitioners who have adopted unusual means to petition&#8221; and was set up 
following directives of the Central Government.  
 
116. Before Mr Zheng was arrested he had been forcibly returned from Beijing to his 
hometown on 7 September 2007 by unidentified officials believed to be from the Hubei 
Province. In Beijing he had met with other petitioners and received information about the 
destruction of a village where other petitioners were living. Local Government officials in 
Beijing also attempted to forcibly return Mr Zheng&#8217;s wife, Ms Cao Xiangzhen, to the Hubei </p>

Province. Earlier, on 5 September 2007, Mr Zheng published a letter addressing leaders at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting on 8 and 9 September 2007 about the 
human rights situation in the People&#8217;s Republic of China. His seven year old daughter and his 
wife were previously detained for 65 days in July 2006. Mr Zheng has been petitioning for 
several years because his house was seized by the local Government. Since early 2007, Mr 
Zheng has also actively helped hundreds of other petitioners and defended their rights.

of Article 61 of the PRC Criminal Procedure Law regarding the initial detention of &#8220;major 
suspects&#8221; or &#8220;active offenders&#8221;. Ms Liu Jie is currently detained at the Beian Nongken 
Detention Centre.  
 
119. Prior to her arrest, Ms Liu Jie had been the main coordinator in the presentation of a 
public letter, signed by over 12,000 petitioners, to the Chinese Communist Party leaders when 
they are to meet at the 17th Party Congress on 27 October 2007. The letter calls on party 
leaders to enact political and legal reforms and has been signed by victims of alleged 
harassment and brutality at the hands of the police and other state officials. Ms Liu Jie has 
been involved in such petitions to official Chinese Communist Party meetings since 2003. 
The other coordinators of the public letter have reportedly gone into hiding. It is believed that 
Mr Fu Jingjiang has also been arrested by police forces as he has not been seen since 
petitioners witnessed his arrest in Harbin on 15 October 2007.

protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders to which the Government 
had not responded at the time this report was prepared. 
 
127. According to the information received, on 26 October 2007 Liu Jie's husband was told 
by officers at the Beian City Nongken Detention Center, where Liu Jie was detained, that she 
would be released on that day. However, when he went to the detention center that afternoon, 
he was told that it had been decided to send Liu Jie to Re-education through Labor (RTL). 
RTL is an administrative detention measure, according to which, without any proper legal 
procedures or court proceedings, the Public Security Bureau can send individuals to detention 
facilities for a maximum of four years. Detainees sent to RTL are deprived of their rights to

128. Ms Liu Jie is now serving her 18-month RTL term in Qiqihaer, Heilongjiang province, 
where she has to work 14 hours a day, six days a week. According to a doctor who examined 
her on 20 December 2007, Ms Liu Jie will go blind if she does not receive proper treatment 
immediately. Reportedly, Liu Jie's eye injuries require treatment unavailable in Heilongjiang 
Province so she must be sent to Beijing for treatment. Her family has requested RTL 
authorities to grant her bail for medical treatment. Her lawyers have also filed a  request for 
an administrative review of the decision to send her to the RTL camp. The authorities have 
reportedly not responded to either of these requests. 
 
129. The eye injuries are said to be linked to beatings she suffered because of her petitioning 
and human rights activities. She was reportedly beaten a number of times by Heilongjiang 
Provincial Nongken (Military Farm Bureau) Public Security Bureau Beian Sub-division 
personnel. In March 2002, in one such beating, she suffered permanent eye injury and 
drastically reduced vision. While in detention, she was again beaten, which caused further 
injuries to her eyes. 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications</b> 
 
130. On 9 October 2006 and 4 January 2007, the Government replied to the letter sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 10 August 2006 concerning the case of Mr <b>Dolma Kyab </b>[Zhuo 
Shique], who was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment term for writing and maintaining a 
commentary manuscript on various socio-political issues in Tibet. According to the 
Government&#8217;s reply, Mr. Kyab was arrested on 27 May 2005 on suspicion of illegally 
crossing the State frontier and espionage. It was ascertained by the Lhasa people&#8217;s 
intermediate court that, between November 2003 and June 2004, without following the 
required legal formalities, the defendant had unlawfully departed from and re-entered the 
country at the Dram border crossing, actions which constituted the offence of illegally 
crossing the State frontier. Once out of the country, he actively contacted members of the 
intelligence agency in the so-called &#8220;Security Ministry&#8221; of the Dalai clique, to whom he </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 41 
 
proposed the formation of a purported &#8220;environmental protection organization&#8221;. He proceeded 
to enlist supporters to conduct separatist activities, obtained the backing of the &#8220;Security 
Ministry&#8221; of the Dalai clique and received first 12,400 Indian rupees and then 6,500 Nepalese 
rupees to fund activities. On the instructions of employees of the Dalai clique&#8217;s &#8220;Security 
Ministry&#8221;, Dolma Kyab added extensive separatist material to his book Restless Himalayas, 
including discussion of such issues as a &#8220;Tibetan State&#8221; flag, &#8220;sovereignty&#8221;, etc. He then burnt 
this on to CDs which he brought with him into the country, planning to disseminate them 
widely inside China, an act which constituted the offence of espionage. Dolma Kyab&#8217;s actions 
were in breach of the Chinese Criminal Code and manifestly did not fall within the scope of 
freedom of opinion and expression. He was thus sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, as well 
as the suspension of his political rights for 5 years, on the offence of espionage. Mr. Kyab 
refused to accept the court&#8217;s verdict and lodged an appeal. The people&#8217;s high court of the 
Tibetan Autonomous Region upheld the original verdict. In its final judgement, the court 
upheld the sentence passed at first instance, with the additional penalty of forfeiture by the 
defendant of all his personal assets. On its letter of 4 January 2007, the Government added 
that Mr. Kyab is currently serving his sentence in the Qushui prison in Tibet Autonomous 
Region.  His health is normal and the prison hospital has him under regular observation and 
has found that his normal cold-like condition is not susceptible to active treatment. <b> 
 
</b>131. On 4 January 2007, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent on 22 August 
2006 concerning the case of Ching Cheong, a reporter working for the Singapore daily Straits 
Times who was convicted on espionage charges. The Government provided that On 31 
August 2006, the Beijing People&#8217;s Intermediate Court No. 2 publicly announced its verdict in 
the proceedings against Mr. <b>Ching Cheong</b> on charges of espionage. While stationed in 
Taiwan as a reporter with the Straits Times, through his participation in a current affairs 
seminar organized by a certain Taiwanese foundation, Ching had been introduced to a certain 
Xue and a certain Dai, agents working for the Taiwanese foundation, which was an espionage 
organization. From May 2004 to April 2005, in full awareness that the foundation was a 
Taiwanese espionage organization, and that Dai and Xue were agents, Ching had taken 
instructions from Xue and Dai and, with the use of fax, email and other means of 
communication, had sent them documents and written material containing State secrets and 
other intelligence from Beijing and other places and, operating under an assumed name, had 
received the sum of HK$ 300,000 as payment for services rendered. Beijing People&#8217;s 
Intermediate Court No. 2 found that the defendant Ching Cheong had acted on instructions 
from agents for a Taiwanese organization, had actively gathered State secrets and intelligence 
and had passed these on to the espionage organization, and ruled that his conduct constituted 
the offence of espionage. Mr. Cheong voluntarily confessed to the charges and was subject to 
a measure of clemency. He was convicted to five years&#8217; imprisonment, suspension of political 
rights for one year and seizure of personal assets to a total of 300,000 yuan. After hearing the 
case at second instance, the Beijing People&#8217;s High Court overturned his appeal and upheld the 
original sentence, publicly announcing its verdict on 24 November.<b>  
</b> 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>132. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s responses. At the time this 
report was prepared, the Special Rapporteur had not received responses to his 
communications of 25 October 2007 and 28 December 2007.

febrero de 2007, dos hombres armados se acercaron a las oficinas del peri&#243;dico La Raz&#243;n. Se 
alega que uno de los asaltantes habr&#237;a atacado al Sr. Gustavo Adolfo Alape, escolta del Sr. 
<b>&#201;dgar Buitrago</b>, y se produjo un intercambio de disparos tras el cual los agresores escaparan. 
El Sr. Alape result&#243; herido, al igual que un empleado del peri&#243;dico y un transe&#250;nte, estos 
&#250;ltimos  con heridas leves. Existir&#237;an serios indicios de que el ataque fuera en represalia a los 
reportajes cr&#237;ticos del Sr. Buitrago en La Raz&#243;n sobre la corrupci&#243;n existente en el gobierno 
local. Seg&#250;n fuentes, el 8 de febrero de 2007, el periodista hubiera recibido un mensaje 
electr&#243;nico an&#243;nimo en el que le advert&#237;an que de seguir informando, lo matar&#237;an. Tambi&#233;n en 
agosto y septiembre de 2006 el Sr. Buitrago habr&#237;a recibido varias llamadas de individuos no 
identificados a su tel&#233;fono celular, amenaz&#225;ndolo de muerte. Seg&#250;n las informaciones 
recibidas, en el 2004, el Ministerio del Interior habr&#237;a adjudicado protecci&#243;n policial al Sr. 
<b>&#201;dgar Buitrago</b>, despu&#233;s de que se hubiera visto obligado a huir dadas las amenazas de 
muerte recibidas. Anteriormente, en el 2002, el Sr. <b>&#201;dgar Buitrago</b> habr&#237;a huido de Cali tras

Respuesta del Gobierno enviada el 6 de julio de 2007 
 
</b>134. El Gobierno transmiti&#243; la informaci&#243;n siguiente en relaci&#243;n con la comunicaci&#243;n del 6 
de marzo de 2007 sobre la situaci&#243;n del Sr. <b>&#201;dgar Buitrago</b>. El Gobierno mencion&#243; que el 
caso se encontraba en etapa de verificaci&#243;n de informaci&#243;n, habi&#233;ndose practicado varias 
pruebas. Seg&#250;n las investigaciones, el atentado no fue dirigido contra el periodista sino contra 
su escolta, por razones de &#237;ndole personal. Se inform&#243; que en entrevistas del Jefe de la Oficina 
de Protecci&#243;n Especial del Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad con Jhony Rios 
Raigoza, integrate del esquema protectivo del periodista, se expres&#243; la probabilidad de que el 
ataque ocurrido no estubiera dirigido contra el periodista &#201;dgar Buitrago, sino contra su 
escolta Gustavo Alape, quien le hab&#237;a comentado al entrevistado acerca de sus problemas con 
un individuo, cuya esposa o compa&#241;era manten&#237;a una relaci&#243;n amorosa con &#233;l. Se conocia que 
en cierta oportunidad ese sujeto le reclam&#243; de manera airada y amenazante. El Sr. Alape 
tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a confirmado esta informaci&#243;n, considerando que el atentado iba dirigido 
exclusivamente en su contra y no de &#201;dgar Buitrago. Por estos hechos, el Departamento 
Administrativo de Seguridad concluy&#243; que los precipitados hechos no guardan relaci&#243;n 
alguna con las presuntas amenazas contra &#201;dgar Buitrago, sino que por el contrario se estar&#237;a 
frente a un caso de venganza personal por problemas sentimentales, en contra del Sr. Alape. 
No obstante, el Ministerio del Interior y de Justicia inform&#243; que el &#201;dgar Buitrago es 
beneficiario de un esquema individual de seguridad en el Programa de Protecci&#243;n a 
Periodistas y Comunicadores desde el a&#241;o 2003, el cual consta de un veh&#237;culo corriente, dos 
unidades de escolta, junto con sus respectivos elementos de dotaci&#243;n y medios de

En su respuesta, el Gobierno informa de que el Grupo de Derechos Humanos de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional disiente de lo expresado en la comunicaci&#243;n relativo a que &#8220;m&#225;s de 50.000 
persona1s de distintos sectores de la sociedad civil se habr&#237;an congregado en distintos puntos 
del pa&#237;s para protestar de manera pac&#237;fica contra et Tratado de Libre Comercio, la reelecci&#243;n 
presidencial de &#193;lvaro Uribe V&#233;lez y la adopci&#243;n de la Ley de justicia y paz&#8221;.  Seg&#250;n el 
Gobierno, los hechos difieren notoriamente de lo se&#241;alado  en la comunicaci&#243;n de los 
Relatores Especiales y de la Representante Especial, por cuanto las manifestaciones se 
caracterizaron por su violencia, al agredir los manifestantes a integrantes de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional. Entre 600 y 700 personas, miembros de las centrales obreras, campesinos 
desplazados y grupos ind&#237;genas, se concentraron frente a las instalaciones del SENA  y el 
barrio La Paz de Popay&#225;n (departamento del Cauca).  Los manifestantes habr&#237;an utilizado 
palos y piedras, y habr&#237;an hecho rodar un cilindro de gas encendido en contra de la polic&#237;a.  
El Gobierno inform&#243; de que la fiscal&#237;a quinta delegada ante los juzgados penales municipales 
de Popay&#225;n, estaba llevando a cabo una investigaci&#243;n contra 41 personas, pertenecientes en su 
mayor&#237;a a cabildos ind&#237;genas del Cauca, por el delito de lesiones personales y da&#241;o en bien 
ajeno.  
 
154. En relaci&#243;n con la finca La Mar&#237;a, municipio de Piendam&#243;, v&#237;a Panamericana 
(departamento del Cauca), el Gobierno manifestaba que los manifestantes habr&#237;an arrojado 
rocas y bombas incendiarias (c&#243;cteles molotov) contra una tanqueta policial, y que habr&#237;an 
secuestrado a tres patrulleros de la polic&#237;a.  Igualmente, el Gobierno inform&#243; que en la finca 
El Pital, v&#237;a Mondom&#243;, se agredi&#243; con palos, canicas, piedras, bombas molotov, y dem&#225;s 
elementos contundentes al cuerpo de polic&#237;a, y hubo dos casos de intento de incendio.En la 
localidad de Remolinos (departamento de Nari&#241;o), se incendi&#243; seg&#250;n inform&#243; el Gobierno, a 
tres veh&#237;culos de servicio p&#250;blico.  Los manifestantes utilizaron bombas molotov armadas con 
acido sulf&#250;rico con las cuales pretend&#237;an incinerar las instalaciones de la estaci&#243;n de polic&#237;a.  
El Gobierno informa de que resultaron gravemente heridos varios polic&#237;as, con quemaduras 
en el rostro. 
 
155. En vista de lo anterior, el Gobierno concluy&#243; que los hechos de los d&#237;as 14 y 15 de 
mayo de 2006 difirieron notoriamente de lo se&#241;alado en la comunicaci&#243;n de los Relatores 
Especiales y de la Representante Especial, por cuanto las manifestaciones se habr&#237;an 
caracterizado por la violencia y se habr&#237;an producido agresiones en contra de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional. 
 
156. Sobre el presunto homicidio y una desaparici&#243;n forzada, la Polic&#237;a Nacional inform&#243; 
de que tuvo conocimiento de la muerte de una persona ind&#237;gena de nombre <b>Jos&#233; Pedro

una carta de alegaciones enviada por la Representante Especial del Secretario-General para 
los defensores de los derechos humanos el 8 de diciembre de 2006. De acuerdo con la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, el 15 de enero de 2007, el director de inteligencia del Departamento de 
Seguridad del Estado en la provincia de Ciego de &#193;vila habr&#237;a amenazado con encarcelar al 
Sr. Gonz&#225;lez Leiva a menos que renuncie a su trabajo de defensa de los derechos humanos en 
Cuba. Seg&#250;n se informa, el Sr. Gonz&#225;lez Leiva habr&#237;a sido previamente encarcelado en marzo 
de 2002 y en abril de 2004 habr&#237;a sido condenado a cuatro a&#241;os de  arresto domiciliario. Se 
informa que el Sr. Gonz&#225;lez Leiva habr&#237;a sido sometido a una vigilancia persistente por parte 
de las autoridades as&#237; como al hostigamiento y agresiones violentas por grupos de ciudadanos, 
actuando supuestamente con el consentimiento de las autoridades cubanas. Adem&#225;s, el Sr. 
Gonz&#225;lez Leiva habr&#237;a denunciado que el tel&#233;fono de su casa se estar&#237;a interrumpiendo 
frecuentemente y pareciera que estuviese intervenido.

</b> 
164. El Gobierno inform&#243; de que<b> s</b>on falsas las alegaciones de hostigamiento, amenazos o 
agresiones al Sr. <b>Gonz&#225;lez Leiva</b>.<b> </b>Juan Carlos Gonzales no ha sido objecto de violaci&#243;n a sus 
derechos humanos y su vida no corre peligro alguno. El Sr. Gonz&#225;lez Leiva fue en el pasado 
responsable de actos graves de violaciones del orden p&#250;blico y obstrucci&#243;n de servicios 
m&#233;dicos en instalaciones hospitalarias en Cuba. Por estos delitos, fue condenado a 4 anos de 
arresto domicilario; esto ultimo atendiendo a su condici&#243;n de discapacitado f&#237;sico. El Sr. </p>

Gonz&#225;lez Leiva no es en lo absoluto un defensor de derechos humanos. No ha sido

Guerra P&#233;rez</b>, corresponsal de los sitios Payolibre y Nueva Prensa Cubana, y de la emisora 
Radio Mart&#237;. El 27 de febrero de 2007, el Sr. Guerra P&#233;rez habr&#237;a sido condenado a 22 meses 
de c&#225;rcel por &quot;alteraci&#243;n del orden p&#250;blico&quot;. El 13 de julio de 2005, el Sr. Guerra P&#233;rez habr&#237;a 
participado en una manifestaci&#243;n pac&#237;fica que conmemoraba el naufragio, 11 a&#241;os antes, de 
una embarcaci&#243;n de &quot;balseros&quot;. Inmediatamente despu&#233;s fue detenido, junto con otras cuatro 
personas,  por las fuerzas de Seguridad del Estado, permaneciendo en prisi&#243;n desde entonces, 
inicialmente en una celda de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Revolucionaria (PNR), y posteriormente en 
el Departamento T&#233;cnico de Investigaci&#243;n (DTI) de La Habana. Teniendo en cuenta que el 
periodista ya ha permanecido preso 19 meses, se entiende que su puesta en libertad deber&#237;a 
tener lugar el 13 de abril 2007, fecha en la que habr&#237;a terminado de cumplir 22 meses de 
c&#225;rcel desde su detenci&#243;n el 13 de julio de 2005. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en octubre y 
noviembre de 2005 el Sr. Guerra P&#233;rez fue hospitalizado en varias ocasiones a consecuencia 
de las huelgas de hambre que llev&#243; a cabo, siendo despu&#233;s reenviado a la c&#225;rcel. Durante su 
internamiento, el periodista ha sufrido una infecci&#243;n renal y padece frecuentes crisis de asma.

</b> 
166. El Gobierno transmiti&#243; la siguiente informaci&#243;n en el caso del Sr. <b>Jes&#250;s Guerra

asalariado de la Secci&#243;n de Interesese de los Estados Unidos en La Habana, que se prestar&#237;a 
para la realizaci&#243;n de actos de desorden p&#250;blico en Cuba. Por estos actos, &#233;l habr&#237;a sido 
condenado a cumplir sentencia en prisi&#243;n. Se inform&#243; que en Cuba, desde 1959, nunca se ha 
sancionado a alguien por la simple expresi&#243;n de opiniones o puntos de vista diferentes, e 
incluso contrarios, a los de las autoridades.

mientras cubr&#237;a un desalojo, sin haberse formulado una acusaci&#243;n oficial hasta el d&#237;a del 
juicio. El juicio, seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, habr&#237;a durado unas cinco horas. El Sr. 
Betancourt habr&#237;a sido sentenciado a 15 meses de prisi&#243;n. El tiempo que el Sr. Betancourt ha

Gouvernement sur la situation de <b>M. Ernest Che Guevara Bosange</b>, reporter au journal 
&#171; Alerte Plus &#187; paraissant &#224; Kinshasa, d&#233;tenu &#224; la prison Makala de Kinshasa. Selon les 
informations re&#231;ues, M. Bosange se serait rendu le 21 novembre 2006 &#224; la Cour supr&#234;me de 
justice pour couvrir le proc&#232;s en contestation des r&#233;sultats du second tour de l&#8217;&#233;lection 
pr&#233;sidentielle ainsi que la manifestation violente du 21 novembre 2006, au cours de laquelle 
une partie du b&#226;timent de la Cour supr&#234;me a &#233;t&#233; incendi&#233;e. Le journaliste aurait &#233;t&#233; interpell&#233; 
pendant qu&#8217;il couvrait cette manifestation. 
 
171. Alors qu&#8217;il rentrait de la Cour, il aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; par des &#233;l&#233;ments de la Direction de 
renseignements g&#233;n&#233;raux et de s&#233;curit&#233; (DRGS) et des militaires de la Garde R&#233;publicaine, et 
conduit dans l&#8217;enceinte des locaux de la Police Nationale, o&#249; un commandant lui aurait 
demand&#233; s&#8217;il &#233;tait originaire de l&#8217;Equateur. M. Bosange aurait r&#233;pondu par l&#8217;affirmative. 
Quelques temps apr&#232;s, des agents de la DRGS seraient venus le chercher pour l&#8217;emmener 
dans leurs locaux, o&#249; il aurait &#233;t&#233; interrog&#233; par un colonel et deux majors (dont les noms sont 
connus des rapporteurs). Le colonel  lui aurait dit &#171; tu es originaire de l&#8217;Equateur, tu es un 
espion de Bemba, tu vas tout nous dire, tu vas souffrir &#187;. Ensuite, M. Bosange aurait &#233;t&#233; 
frapp&#233;, ses mains et ses pieds auraient &#233;t&#233; menott&#233;s avec un engin d&#233;nomm&#233; &#171; mangozo &#187; et il 
aurait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;shabill&#233; pour subir un &#233;lectrochoc. Le colonel et les majors l&#8217;auraient ensuite 
remis &#224; un capitaine qui l&#8217;aurait menac&#233; avec une arme en disant qu&#8217;il &#233;tait un espion du 
Mouvement pour la Lib&#233;ration du Congo. Finalement, M. Bosange se serait &#233;vanoui. Il se 
serait r&#233;veill&#233; dans une salle qui ressemblait &#224; un cachot et qui &#233;tait occup&#233;e par une centaine

d&#8217;audition. M. Bosange aurait refus&#233; de r&#233;pondre, mais il aurait &#233;t&#233; forc&#233; de signer un proc&#232;s 
verbal r&#233;dig&#233; sur la base de d&#233;clarations faites par le colonel &#224; sa place. M. Bosange serait 
rest&#233; un mois et demi &#224; Kin-Maziere. Sa famille aurait &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;e de sa d&#233;tention par un 
voisin qui y travaille. 
 
172. Il aurait &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233; &#224; la prison Makala CPRK (Centre P&#233;nitentiaire et de R&#233;&#233;ducation 
de Kinshasa) le 27 d&#233;cembre 2006 et son dossier se trouverait aupr&#232;s de l&#8217;Auditorat de 
Garnison de la Gombe. Cependant, il n&#8217;aurait jamais &#233;t&#233; entendu par un magistrat. En effet, le 
magistrat en charge de son dossier exigerait la somme de 200$ pour le faire.  
 
<b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement envoy&#233;e le 7 juin 2007  
</b> 
173. Le Gouvernement a inform&#233; que M. <b>Ernest Bosange</b> a precis&#233; qu'il est journaliste non 
te l'organe &#171; Alerte Plus &#187; mais plut&#244;t du journal &#171; Mambenga &#187; paraissant a Kinshasa. 
L'int&#233;ress&#233; a pr&#233;sent&#233; au Minist&#232;re des Droits Humains une version des faits proche de celle 
pr&#233;sent&#233;e dans la communication envoy&#233;e. Cependant, les recherches men&#233;es par mes 
collaborateurs ont &#233;tabli que M. Bosange est poursuivi par le Tribunal Militaire de garnison 
de Kinshasa-Gombe pour vol d'effets militaires. Son proc&#232;s est donc en cours devant cette 
juridiction qui va bient&#244;t statuer sur le fond.  
 
174. Pour ce qui est de l'exactitude des faits tels qu&#8217;ils ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;sum&#233;s, le Gouvernement a 
pr&#233;cis&#233; qu&#8217;en dehors des all&#233;gations de l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;, il ne dispose d'aucun &#233;l&#233;ment pour 
confirmer ou infirmer lesdites all&#233;gations. Toutefois, le Minist&#232;re des Droits Humains fait foi 
en la Justice congolaise qui r&#233;tablira la v&#233;rit&#233;. &#192; la connaissance du Gouvernement, aucune 
plainte n'a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e par la victime ou en son nom. En effet, se trouvant actuellement sous 
le coup des poursuites judiciaires, il lui est difficile d'entreprendre une telle action. Il faudra 
attendre l'issue du proc&#232;s pour pouvoir donner suite aux autres pr&#233;occupations adress&#233;es dans 
la communication.

ocurridos en la regi&#243;n donde trabaja, lo que podr&#237;a haber motivado el ataque. Asimismo, el Sr.

189. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n 5 de abril de 2007 el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento 
urgente enviado 28 de junio de 2006. El Gobierno informa que la comunicaci&#243;n de 28 de

Dicha medida fue tomada por el Gobierno del Ecuador en cumplimiento de su obligaci&#243;n de 
garantizar la seguridad e integridad ciudadana, preservar el orden p&#250;blico, y proteger los 
bienes del Estado. El dia 19 de junio del 2006, mientras el Estado de Emergencia se

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 1 March 2007 
</b> 
191. The Special Raporteur brought to the attention of the Government information 
concerning <b>Mr. Abdel Kareem Nabil Seliman</b>, also known as Karim Amer, former student 
of the al-Azhar University. According to reports, on 22 February 2007, Karim Amer was 
sentenced to a four-year prison term by a Court in Alexandria on charges of &quot;spreading 
information disruptive of public order and damaging to the country's reputation&quot;, &quot;incitement 
to hate Islam&quot; and &quot;defaming the President of the Republic&quot;, because of articles he had 
published on his blog concerning the al-Azhar University, religious riots and President 
Mubarak. Owing to his writings, it is alleged that Karim Amer was first arrested in October 
2005, detained for a few days and subsequently released without charge.  On 7 November 
2006, he reportedly appeared before the Public Prosecutor of Alexandria, following a 
complaint lodged against him by the al-Azhar University, and detained since then. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 12 March 2007 
</b> 
192. The Government indicated that article 47 of the Egyptian Constitution guarantees 
freedom of opinion and expression. The Egyptian laws and legislation comply with this article 
of the Constitution. The Egyptian legislature places appropriate restrictions on the exercise of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression in order to guarantee and safeguard the rights 
and freedoms of others and to satisfy the just requirements of public order, the public interest 
and the security, integrity and stability of society. In this regard, the law criminalizes a 
number of acts relating to public insults and defamation, such as disparagement of religions, 
misrepresentation of divine scriptures, attacks upon religious symbols or places, and 
vilification of religious rituals. These provisions have been invoked in a number of complaints 
brought before the courts concerning the offence of disparagement of the Muslim or the 
Christian religion. 
 
193. With regard to <b>Mr. Abd al-Karim Sulayman</b>, the Department of Public Prosecutions 
investigated allegations that he had attacked, and incited hatred for, the Muslim religion by 
claiming that the Prophet Mohammed and the Companions were symbols of terrorism, that 
the Muslim religion advocates murder and robbery, and by denying the existence of God. In 
addition, he was accused of using terms offensive to the person of the President of the 
Republic in material published on the Internet. He was questioned at the offices of the 
Department of Public Prosecutions, where he made a confession and witnesses confirmed the 
charges against him. Accordingly, the Department of Public Prosecutions sent him for trial 
before the criminal court, in case No. 882 of 2007, pursuant to articles 98 (f), 102 bis and 179 
of the Criminal Code. He was tried on the following counts: (a) Fomenting discord and 
disparaging the Muslim religion through the allegations that he had made about Almighty 
God and the Prophet Mohammed (May peace be upon Him!), thereby damaging national 
unity and the Muslim religion; (b) Deliberately spreading information of a kind likely to </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 61 
 
disrupt public order and damage the public interest, and insulting the President of the 
Republic. 
 
194. The accused was represented in court by his defence counsel, and he confessed to the 
charges against him. His defence submitted a series of documents and pleadings to the court 
and the defendant was given full guarantees of a fair trial. On 22 February 2007, the court 
delivered its verdict, sentencing the defendant to three years in prison on the first count and 
one year on the second. The verdict rejected all the defence pleadings and modified the 
charges with respect to the offences under articles 171, 176 and 179 of the Criminal Code, as 
follows: firstly, incitement to hatred and disparagement of the Muslim community by 
publishing writings on the Internet describing the Prophet and the Companions as murderers 
and thereby inciting a breach of the peace; secondly, insulting the person of the President of 
the Republic by writing offensive remarks about him on the Internet. The Court concluded by 
convicting the defendant in light of his confession and by imposing the penalties described 
here above. It is worth noting that the verdict was delivered by a criminal court and that the 
accused appealed it before a lower court. The appeal hearing was scheduled for 12 March 
2007. The appeal court&#8217;s verdict can also be appealed before the Court of Cassation in 
accordance with Egyptian law. 
 
195. Under the Egyptian Constitution, the judiciary is independent and no State authority 
can interfere in matters of justice or decisions taken by the judicial authority, since this is an 
offence under the Egyptian Criminal Code. Egyptian law grants judges immunity and 
independence and provides legal guarantees for anyone subject to a criminal trial in 
accordance with the international norms established in this regard. Consequently, it is not 
acceptable for any individual or authority in the country, much less abroad, to comment on 
judgements and proceedings in cases which courts are still hearing or on which they have yet 
to take a decision. In conclusion, Egypt regards any interference in cases before its courts as 
an infringement of its national sovereignty and interference in its domestic affairs. It 
categorically rejects any interference in these matters on any grounds whatever, especially as 
Egypt clearly respects the sovereignty of other States and does not interfere in cases before 
their courts, even if it does have comments or observations to make on them. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 7 May 2007 
</b> 
196. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Abdel Moneim 
Mahmoud</b>, a correspondent for the Arabic language TV channel al-Hiwar (Dialogue). 
According to the information received, on 14 April 2007 Mr. Abdel Moneim Mahmoud was 
arrested on board a plane to depart from Cairo International Airport. The next day, Mr. Abdel 
Moneim Mahmoud was reportedly brought before the public prosecutor in Shubra al-Khima 
and was charged with membership of the Muslim Brotherhood organization, financing student 
political activities at the Institute of Agricultural Cooperation in Shubra al-Khima, inciting 
them to stage a quasi-militia style parade, and harming Egypt&#8217;s image by contacting foreign 
media and human rights groups to publicize reports of torture in police stations. It is reported 
that the Public Prosecutor extended his detention, first foreseen for 15 days, pending further 
investigation into those charges. Mr. Abdel Moneim Mahmoud was reported to remain in 
detention in Mahkoum prison in Tora, southeast of Cairo, at the time the communication was 
sent. In addition to his media work, Mr. Abdel Moneim Mahmoud also coordinated a 
campaign for the release of members of the Muslim Brotherhood whose trial started on 26 
April 2007 in Heikstep Military Court Complex outside Cairo. Mr. Abdel Moneim Mahmoud </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 62 
 
has helped the relatives of the defendants contact the media and national and international 
human rights organizations. Concern was expressed that his arrest and detention may be 
linked to his legitimate and peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in particular his 
role in denouncing and publicizing torture and other human rights violations in Egypt. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 September 2007 
</b> 
197. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of Mr.<b> 
Ibrahim Issa</b>, editor of the &#8220;Al-Dustour&#8221; newspaper, reporting that on 5 September 2007, 
state security prosecutors brought against Mr. Issa charges for publishing articles referring to 
rumours about the President&#8217;s health. Mr. Issa was allegedly accused of &#8220;spreading false 
reports likely to disturb public security and besmirch the country&#8217;s reputation&#8221;. According to 
reports, Mr. Issa was the only journalist who received formal charges, even though a number 
of news outlets reported the story. Mr. Issa will be tried by the state security court and can be 
condemned to up to 4 years in prison. Mr. Issa had previously been convicted of libelling the 
president in June 2006. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 11 October 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
</b> 
198. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr <b>Mohammed al-Dereini</b> who runs the Shiite Aal Beit 
research centre in Cairo and Mr Adhmad Sohb, who is the director of the Imam Ali Centre for 
Human Rights. Both advocate for the rights of Egypt's Shi`a minority. According to 
information received, mr Mohammed al-Dereini and Mr Adhmad Sohb were arrested on 8 
October and 28 August 2007 on charges of having published &#8220;false information aimed at 
agitating public opinion&#8221; relating to torture in Egyptian prisons. They are reportedly both 
currently being detained under a decree issued under Egypt&#8217;s Emergency Law, and are being 
held in solitary confinement in Tora Prison outside Cairo. It is further alleged that Mr al-
Dereini was arrested without a search warrant. Both Mr Mohammed al-Dereini and Mr 
Adhmad Sohb have been previously detained by the Egyptian authorities. Mr Sobh was 
released in 2005 following fifteen years&#8217; detention without trial on the basis of his alleged 
membership in an armed Islamic group. In 2004, Mr al-Dereini was detained without charges 
for fifteen months. In 2006, Mr al-Dereini published a book entitled &#8220;Hell&#8217;s Capital&#8221; (&#8220;Asimat 
Jahanam&#8221;) in which he detailed his experiences of torture while in detention. These claims of 
torture have reportedly not been investigated by the Public Prosecutor. Concern was 
expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr Mohammed al-Dereini and Mr Adhmad Sohb 
may be directly related to their human rights activities, in particular their work in defence of 
the victims of torture in Egypt. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 November 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
</b> 
199. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of  Mr <b>Kamal Abbas</b> and Mr <b>Mohamed Helmy</b>. Mr Kamal Abbas 
is the General Coordinator of the Centre for Trade Unions and Workers&#8217; Services (CTUWS) 
and Mr Mohamed Helmy is a lawyer who has worked to represent the CTUWS. The CTUWS 
was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders on 30 April 2007 when the Egyptian </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 63 
 
authorities ordered the closure of its headquarters in Cairo. According to information 
received, on 11 October 2007, Messrs. Abbas and Helmy were sentenced to one year&#8217;s 
imprisonment. Mr Kamal Abbas and Mr Mohamed Helmy were charged with slander and 
defamation of character after a lawsuit was filed against them by Mr Mohamed Ibrahim, the 
Chairman of the board of directors of a youth centre about which Mr Kamal Abbas and Mr 
Mohamed Helmy, through the CTUWS magazine Kalam Sinai&#8217;ia, had published a report 
detailing accusations of financial and administrative irregularities.  These accusations were 
reportedly corroborated by an internal investigation

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 9 March 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture 
</b>  
206. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government the situation of 
<b>Mr. &quot;Joshua&quot; Yohannes Fessehaye</b>, aged 48, poet, playwrighter and a journalist with the 
weekly &#8220;Setit&#8221;, who allegedly surrendered to the police in September 2001 in a wave of </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 65 
 
arrests of several other media professionals and opinion-makers. Around that time the popular 
weekly &#8220;Setit&#8221; was banned. Fessehaye Yohannes was first held at a police station in Asmara, 
then moved to a prison at Dongolo in April 2002. Finally he was transferred to a prison camp 
at Eiraeiro. Mr Fessehaye reportedly died on 11 January 2007 as a result of the treatment he 
had received under detention and of the very harsh conditions in the prison camp. According 
to the reports received, cells at Dongolo prison measure 1.5 metres by 1.5 metres by 2.5 
metres. They are lit by a bulb that is never turned off. The prisoners are chained to the wall by 
their feet. Their wrists are manacled. In the course of interrogations at Dongolo, Mr. 
Fessehaye&#8217;s fingernails were ripped out. At Eiraeiro, a prison camp in the desert of the Red 
Sea province, the detainees are permanently manacled. Their food consists of bread, lentils, 
spinach or potatoes. They sleep on the ground with two sheets. Any contact with other 
prisoners or with guards is absolutely forbidden. It is reported that in the course of 2005 and 
2006 several journalists, such as Said Abdulkader, co-founder and editor of the weekly 
Admas, Medhanie Haile, co-founder and deputy editor of the weekly Keste Debena, and 
Yusuf Mohamed Ali, the editor of the weekly Tsigenay, died in Eiraeiro prison camp as a 
result of the conditions.

Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</b> 
208. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information concerning the situation of Messrs <b>Tilahun Ayalew</b>, <b>Anteneh Getnet</b> and 
<b>Meqcha Mengistu</b>, prominent members of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association (ETA), 
Ethiopia's main teachers&#8217; trade union. Mr. Getnet was previously the subject of an urgent 
appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 28 September 2006. 
That communication, in which we brought to your Government&#8217;s attention allegations that 
Mr. Getnet was abducted and beaten by members of the security forces in May 2006 and 
again abducted and taken to an undisclosed location on 23 September 2006, has unfortunately 
remained without a reply from the Government.  
 
209. According to the information received, Mr Tilahun Ayalew was arrested on 14 
December 2006 and Mr Anteneh Getnet on 29 December 2006. Both have since been held 
incommunicado by police at the headquarters of the Central Investigation Bureau (Maikelawi) 
in Addis Ababa. Mr Tilahun Ayalew and Mr Anteneh Getnet appeared before a judge, but 
they were reportedly neither charged, nor given access to legal counsel or their relatives. 
Since 15 December 2006 Mr Meqcha Mengistu has reportedly been detained by the police at </p>

a secret location after being under police surveillance for several days. His exact whereabouts 
are not known and the authorities deny all knowledge about his whereabouts.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 24 January 2007 
</b> 
210. By letter sent on 24 January 2007, the Government informed that Messrs <b>Tilahun 
Ayalew</b>, <b>Anteneh Getnet</b> and <b>Meqcha Mengistu</b> were detained by Addis Ababa Police 
Commission for alleged violations of the criminal law in accordance with the Criminal 
Procedure Code and accepted international standards. Ethiopian law enforcement agencies 
have scrupulously followed appropriate legal procedures and due process rights while taking 
the aforementioned individuals to custody. Hence, the concern expressed regarding their 
physical integrity is unfounded. The detainees were brought before the Federal High Court 
within 48 hours. In accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code, the Court has allowed a 
remand period for police to undertake the necessary investigations. The men are now held at 
Addis Ababa Police Commission headquarters. The Government assures that they are being 
treated humanely and in accordance with international norms and standards. While in 
detention they are allowed visits by their family, friends and religious counselors. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 5 July 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the

211. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the following situation. On 11 June 2007, four editors, Andualem Ayele, editor 
of Ethiop, Mesfin Tesfaye, editor of Abay, Wonakseged Zeleke, editor of Asqual, and Dawit 
Fassil deputy editor of Satanaw, were found, by a court, guilty of political offences, including 
&quot;outrages against the constitution or constitutional order&quot; and &quot;impairment of the defensive 
power of the state&quot;. Reportedly, these charges are related to the publication of editorials on 
the parliamentary elections in 2005 and the Government's conduct in the electoral period.  
Three other journalists, Solomon Aregawi (Hadar), Dawit Kebede (Hadar) and Goshu Moges 
(Lisane Hezeb) and thirty-four opposition leaders and civil society activists were convicted in 
the same affair.  Among them, two academics:  Berhanu Nega, economist, vice chairman of 
the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy and elected mayor of Addis Ababa, and 
Mesfin Wolde Mariam, author and former chairperson of the Ethiopian Human Rights 
Council.  According to the information received, all the above-mentioned media professionals 
and academics were arrested in November 2005 and are presently detained. Moreover, it has 
been reported that Andualem Ayele and Mesfin Tesfaye, could face possible execution or life 
imprisonment for &#8220;outrages against the constitutional order&quot;. Wonakseged Zeleke, could be 
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison on similar charges and Dawit Fassil could be sentenced 
to up to three years for &#8220;inciting the public through false rumors&#8221;.

</b> 
213. The Special Rapporteurs and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr <b>Daniel Bekele</b>, Head of the Policy Research and Advocacy 
Department for ActionAid International in Ethiopia, and Mr Netsanet Demissie, human rights 
and environmental lawyer based in Addis Ababa, founder and director of the Organization for 
Social Justice in Ethiopia. Both men were arrested in November 2005, together with 
numerous human rights defenders and journalists, following demonstrations against alleged 
fraud in the general elections of May 2005 in which over 190 protestors were reportedly killed 
in clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement authorities. They are currently 
detained and are facing the charge of &#8220;crimes of outrage against the constitutional order&#8221; 
which carries a possible life sentence or death penalty.  
 
214. Mr Bekele was the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
25 October 2005. Both Mr Bekele and Mr Demissie were the subjects of a joint urgent appeal 
sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights

8 September 2006; and a joint urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 6 July 2007.   
 
215. According to the information received, in mid-July 2007, the 38 principal defendants in 
the trial were reportedly found guilty as charged, and most were sentenced to life 
imprisonment. Having signed a statement admitting their activities had been unconstitutional, 
they received a pardon and were freed with their civil rights restored. It is reported that 
international observers were barred from attending the trial. In August 2007, all the others </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

accused, still on trial in the same case, were freed having gone through the same procedure of 
conviction, sentencing, pardon and release. However, Mr Bekele and Mr Demissie declined to 
sign any kind of statement admitting guilt. They appealed for bail, but on 6 August the 
Supreme Court heard and rejected their bail appeal. Few days later, the Court closed the 
defence case, and a verdict was scheduled to be delivered when the Court resumed its sessions 
on 9 October 2007. On 9 October 2007, the Court adjourned its verdict for a further 46 days 
to consider the evidence. A verdict is then expected to be given on 22 November. The charge 
against Mr Bekele and Mr Demissie carries a possible life sentence or death penalty.

on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences 
</b> 
217. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information concerning Ms <b>Laisa Digitaki</b>, a Fijian businesswoman. Ms Digitaki is 
associated with the pro-democracy movement in Fiji for turning her own office into a 'Pro-
Democracy Shrine' that has featured quite often in the media. Banners covered the outside of 
her office with statements such as, &#8220;Democracy is our right&#8221;, &#8220;Yes to Democracy, No to 
guns&#8221;, &quot;Ballots not bullets&quot; and &quot;By the vote we elect the government by the vote we remove 
the government&quot;.  
 
218. According to information received, on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2006, at 
approximately 23:20, Ms Digitaki&#8217;s home was visited by a group of military soldiers.  The 
soldiers requested that Ms Digitaki accompany them to a military camp for questioning.  She 
was told that if she did not comply with their request she would be taken by force.  On arrival 
at the camp Ms Digitaki was escorted through a passageway lined with cells, one of which 
contained her business partner Mr Imraz Iqbal. Ms Digitaki was subsequently detained in a 
dark cell.  After a period of 20 minutes she was taken from the cell and asked to accompany a 
number of soldiers to Mr Pita Waqavonovono&#8217;s house, a friend and fellow pro-democracy 
supporter.  Ms Digitaki complied with the request. On her return to the camp, Ms Digitaki 
was led to a dark hall where Ms Virisila Baudromo, Executive Director of the Fiji Women&#8217;s 
Rights Movement (FWRM) was waiting. Ms Baudromo was the subject of an urgent appeal 
sent on 25 January 2007 by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders. Ms Digitaki and Ms Baudromo were subsequently subjected to a 
barrage of verbal abuse and torture, during which Ms Digitaki was threatened at gunpoint and 
made to lie face down on the ground. After enquiring if she was pregnant, one of the soldiers 
proceeded to jump on her back.  The ordeal lasted approximately 45 minutes, after which Ms 
Digitaki and Ms Baudromo, along with four other pro-democracy activists, including Mr 
Iqbal and Mr Waqavonovono, were ordered to run to the camp gate.  The group was followed </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 69 
 
outside the camp by two military trucks and they were forced to run some distance by the 
soldiers. Before returning home, Ms Digitaki passed by her office in.  The office had been 
trashed and raided and the pro-democracy banners were removed. Graffiti was on the wall 
saying &quot;Merry Xmas Happy New Year Laisa Chang&quot;. (The reference is a derogatory one, 
referring to one of her male business clients. Ms Digitaki is one of the few businesswomen 
dealing in a male dominated corporate world in Fiji and she is often accused of sleeping with 
all her male associates. Similar comments were made by officers while she was in detention 
on 24-25 December 2006). Previously on 9 December 2006, a group of armed men broke into 
the pro- democracy shrine, tearing down banners and damaging the property. Ms Digitaki is 
currently in hiding, in order to protect herself from arrest after a statement she made outlining 
the events of 24 December 2006, was made public, and fears for her physical integrity.  
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 29 January 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
</b> 
219. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Ms <b>Angelina Heffernan</b>, Executive Director of the Pacific 
Centre for Public Integrity (PCPI), an NGO which monitors, investigates and documents 
human rights abuses in Fiji. According to information received, on 11 December 2006, Ms 
Heffernan received an anonymous threatening phone call which, it is believed, came from 
military sources. Ms Imrana Jalal, an international lawyer, former Commissioner of the Fiji 
Human Rights Commission and Board member of the Fiji Women&#8217;s Rights Movement 
(FWRM), also received a phone call threatening her with rape. According to reports the call 
was traced to a phone booth outside the military barracks in Nabua, Suva. Ms Jalal was the 
subject of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 25 January 2007. 
 
220. In January 2007, Lt. Colonel Pita Drita, Land Force Commander of the Fiji Defence 
Force, confirmed that the military is actively seeking the whereabouts of Ms Heffernan, along 
with Ms Laisa Digitaki who was the subject of a communication sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders on 29 January 2007. Lt. Colonel Pita Drita stated 
that both women need to be cautioned against making public statements against the President, 
the interim government and the military as they are detrimental to the security situation in the 
country.  
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 19 July 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers 
</b> 
221. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
concerning <b>Ms. Tupou Draunidalo</b>, vice-president of the Fiji Law Society. According to the 
information received, the Interim Attorney General took legal action against Ms. Tupou 
Draunidalo concerning a statement she made in May 2007, when she allegedly said that &#8220;the 
confidence of lawyers in the judicial system, let alone the public, is shattered&#8221;. The Interim 
Attorney General allegedly said that in bringing this proceeding, he was acting in the public </p>

interest to protect the integrity and authority of the judiciary, which may be undermined by 
such statements. The High Court was to hear the case on August 16. 
 
222. In the same communication, the Rapporteurs referred to the case of <b>M. Graham 
Leung</b>, a lawyer, who was reportedly banned from travelling by the Home Affairs Ministry. 
On 16 July, the lawyer was barred from leaving Fiji and travelling to Australia and New 
Zealand. The Military spokesman allegedly said that Mr. Leung was stopped from leaving the 
country because he had made misrepresenting statements about the interim Government 
abroad, and that at the Law Asia conference he had made a number of misrepresentations in 
his paper which was printed in The Fiji Times. He indicated that Mr. Leung misinformed the 
gathering by stating that members of the legal profession representing clients in constitutional 
matters were being silenced. Finally, it is reported that on 18 July, the travel ban against Mr 
Leung was lifted. Mr Leung&#8217;s lawyer indicated that he was still pursuing a judicial review of 
the matter, which was before a judge. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 31 October 2007 
</b> 
223. In its response, the Government stated that the information contained in the 
communication concerning the case of Ms. <b>Tupou Draunidalo</b> is in the main correct, except 
for reference to hearing date which is set for 19 November instead of 16 November 2007 as 
reported. The Government further stated that the legal proceeding against Ms. Draunidalo is 
an action for &#8220;Contempt of Court&#8221;. The principle of judicial independence implies an 
obligation on the Attorney-Cieneral to defend the Courts. The Attorney General&#8217;s intervention 
ensures that attacks on the judiciary are responded to and ensures that the judges are not 
forced to descend down a path where they feel obliged to defend themselves. The role of the 
Attorney General in contempt proceedings and as defender of the judiciary is well traversed at 
common law.  In instituting Contempt of Court proceedings against Ms. Draunidalo, the 
Interim Attorney General of Fiji was merely exercising a duty bestowed upon him at common 
law and by convention to protect the integrity and authority of the judiciary.  
 
224. Regarding the case of Mr. <b>Graham Leung</b>, the Government stated that it is not in the 
position to comment on whether the information regarding Mr. Leung as contained in the 
Special Rapporteurs&#8217; note is substantiated. The Government further informed that the matter 
is currently before the courts and the facts in the case are disputed and are still to be 
determined. It can be confirmed however, that there are currently no bans or restriction 
imposed on Mr. Leung&#8217;s movement or travel. 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 14 August 2007</b> 
 
225. On 14 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter in relation to 
<b>Taniela Tabu</b>, the Secretary-General of the Viti National Union of Taukei Workers. 
According to the information received, on 1 August 2007, Mr. Taniela Tabu was taken into 
military custody on the early hours of the day. He was allegedly taken to military barracks, 
where he underwent physical and psychological abuse. He was later summoned before a 
military body, which threatened that he would be killed if he continued to make statements 
against the Army Commander. He was allegedly released at 7 p.m. on the same day.

230. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning the police actions in connection to mass protests in Tbilisi as well as the 
declaration of state of emergency and suspension of some fundamental rights. According to 
the information received, on 7 November, peaceful anti-government demonstrations in Tbilisi 
were violently curtailed by the riot police. Protesting crowds were dispersed by water 
cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets. Police officers allegedly chased various protestors and 
physically attacked them using rubber truncheons and by firing rubber bullets. Mr. Koba 
Davitashvili, the leader of the opposition People&#8217;s Party, was severely beaten and, at time of </p>

writing, was hospitalized in critical condition. According to reports, the police also targeted 
journalists covering the events as well as independent observers. Two cameramen from Imedi 
TV were also hospitalized after reportedly being assaulted by the police.  
 
231. The Public Defender (Ombudsman) of Georgia, Mr. Sozar Subari, was also attacked by 
the riot police with rubber truncheons. He was present in the protest to document the police 
actions. Mr. Subari has been a regular critic of the Georgian government&#8217;s human rights 
record. The Riot Police also raided the offices of two television stations, Imedi TV and 
Kavkasia, taking them off the air. Imedi radio station and internet website were also 
suspended. Demonstrators who gathered outside Imedi TV headquarters to protest its 
suspension were dispersed by the police with tear gas and physical attacks. Later in the 
evening of 7 November, the Georgian Government declared a state of emergency for 48 
hours, suspending a number of fundamental rights. The state of emergency was later extended 
to 15 days. In particular, all public demonstrations in the country were banned and only the 
state television is allowed to broadcast news. It is believed that around 500 protesters were 
injured, 100 of whom remain hospitalized.

</b> 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 2 August 2007 
</b> 
250. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the case of <b>Mr 
Mario S&#225; Gomes</b>, Chairperson of the human rights non-governmental organization Guinea 
Association of Solidarity with victims of miscarriage of justice (AGSOVEJ), who was 
reportedly in hiding since early July 2007, when agents of the national armed forces came to 
his home with a warrant to arrest him. The presumed reason of Mr S&#225; Gomes&#8217; arrest was a 
statement he made earlier to a local radio station, Pindjiquiti, in which he would have 
affirmed that the solution to the problem of drug trafficking in Guinea Bissau was the 
dismissal of  high-ranking officials of the armed forces. These events are occurring against a 
background where information has also been received in relation to alleged harassment of 
journalists who have been investigating the emerging drug problem. The Special Rapporteur 
expressed concern that the order for the arrest of Mr S&#225; Gomes may have been related to his 
legitimate activities in defence of human rights. Further concern is expressed for the physical 
and psychological integrity of Mr S&#225; Gomes and his family.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 26 June 2007 
</b> 
255. On 26 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning <b>Ms. Iren Karmen</b>, an investigative journalist, who was reportedly assaulted by 
two men who left her unconscious on the banks of the Danube River on 22 June. She was 
reportedly found tied up and beaten the next morning and had to be hospitalized in Budapest 
with serious head injuries. It seems that Ms. Karmen had received several e-mails and 
telephone threats the previous winter, apparently prompted by her investigation into 
fraudulent dealings in petroleum products and other cases of corruption in the early 1990s.  
Ms. Karman published a book and made a documentary film in 2006, both of which 
suggested that law enforcement agencies officials and political representatives were involved 
in the oil scams. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 29 June 2007 
</b> 
256. The Government transmitted the preliminary information that the case is under 
investigation by the relevant authorities, in accordance with the well-established legal 
regulations of Hungary. The investigation into the case has been taken over by the National 
Investigation Office, and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has also been involved. 
<b>

</b> 
258.  The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
the situation concerning Mr. <b>Gopen Sharma</b>, District Human Rights Officer in the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 79 
 
Murshidabad District of West Bengal of a non governmental organisation called People&#8217;s 
Watch, which is implementing an European Union funded &#8220;National Project on Prevention of 
Torture in India&#8221; (NPPT) in West Bengal in collaboration with a non governmental 
organisation Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM). Mr Sharma was already the subject 
of an urgent appeal of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 8 December 2006.  
 
259. According to further information received, Mr Gopen Sharma was arrested by police 
officers on 8 February 2007 during his visit to the Kaharpara Border Outpost of the Border 
Security Force (BSF) camp in order to collect information on three cases of human rights 
violations alleged committed by the BSF following complaints lodged with the National 
Human Rights Commission (NHRC). At Outpost No. 1 he was approached and assaulted by 
an individual not known to Mr Sharma with the name of Achinto Sarkar, who alleged that one 
of his co-villagers owed him money. When Mr Sharma asked for protection by the local BSF 
he was taken into custody instead and transferred to Ranninagar Police Station. Mr Sharma 
was not provided with an arrest warrant. Upon arrest Mr Sharma was threatened and insulted 
by a police officer, who accused him of filing complaints with human rights organisations 
against the police and the BSF. Police officers seized his mobile phone and all documents 
related to the complaints to the NHRC Mr Sharma had been investigating. 
 
260.  Mr Sharma was charged pursuant to sections 420, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal 
Code on allegations of fraud and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, forgery for the 
purpose of fraud and using as genuine a forged document, respectively. On 9 February 2007 
Mr Sharma was summoned before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate of Lalbagh, 
Murshidabad, who decided to remand him until 22 February 2007. The application for bail 
filed by Mr Sharma&#8217;s lawyer was also rejected by the court. These events followed Mr 
Sharma&#8217;s participation in a fact-finding mission to the BSF Khayer Tala Border Outpost that 
the NPPT undertook on 1 February 2007.  
 
261. The other members of the fact-finding mission were Mr Henri Tiphagne, Executive 
Director of People&#8217;s Watch, Mr Biplap Mukherjee, State Programme Coordinator for the 
NPPT for West Bengal, and Mr Kirity Roy, President of MASUM, who was already the 
subject of a letter of allegation by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 9 January 2007, an urgent appeal by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 25 
January 2006 and a joint allegation letter by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 14 December 2005. 
When the fact-finding mission reached the area it was threatened and harassed by BSF 
officers at BSF Khayer Tala Border Outpost. The fact-finding mission was related to alleged 
human rights violations by police officers committed against local villagers.  
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 18 May

of Tamil Nadu chief minister K. Karunanidhi. Mr. Kumar and Mr. Gopinath would have died 
of smoke inhalation after going into the building to try to save the computers. Reportedly, 
M.K. Azhagiri's supporters were angry about the publication of a poll tipping another son as 
his likeliest successor. According to information, hundreds of supporters of M.K. Azhagiri, 
one of the leaders of the state's ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhgam (DMK) party, attacked 
Dinakaran's offices in broad daylight, setting fire to its building along with two other news 
organisations, Sun TV and the newspaper Tamil Murasu.Dinakaran is one of the region's most 
popular Tamil-langauge dailies and is part of the Sun press group, owned by a relative of the 
chief minister.

263. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information 
concerning reports of an assault against the <b>Mumbai office of the weekly magazine 
&#8220;Outlook&#8221;</b>, on 14 August 2007 by six men who identified themselves as members of the Shiv 
Sena, a Hindu nationalist party. After gaining forced entry to the magazine&#8217;s office, the men 
reportedly demanded to speak to the editor and, when informed that he was not available, 
started to ravage the premises, destroying windows, computer equipment and furniture. The 
Outlook magazine had recently published a news report where the founder of the Shiv Sena, 
Bal Thackeray, is allegedly portrayed as one of the &#8220;villains&#8221; in Indian history and criticized 
due to his alleged incitement of hatred against Muslims.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 January 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the

265. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of <b>Ali Farahbakhsh</b>, former reporter of the banned dailies Yas-e No and Shargh, 
who was reportedly detained in November 2006 by security officers after he returned from a 
civil society conference in Bangkok about &#8220;Media and the Government&#8221;. Since then and for 
more than 40 days, Mr. Farahbakhsh has been reportedly detained under the suspicion of 
espionage, though no charges were filed against him. The Director of prisons in Teheran 
province allegedly confirmed that Mr. Farahbakhsh was still in custody at the time the 
communication was sent.  
 
266. In the same communication, the independent experts referred to the case of <b>Mr. 
Javanmard</b>, a journalist of the daily &#8220;Krafto&#8221;, based in the capital of the Kurdish region

267. Finally, the independent experts also referred to the case of <b>Mr. Hesen Rashidi</b>, a 
journalist and writer, who was reportedly sentenced on 27 October 2006 to one year 
imprisonment and 5 years of suspended sentence. Mr. Rashidi appealed the sentence during 
the first week of November 2006. Reportedly the charges and the sentence brought against 
him related to his activities on the promotion of the Azerbaijani identity, his engagement in 
research about Southern Azerbaijani history and culture and his articles and conferences on 
this question. It was reported that Mr. Rashidi had no access to a lawyer during the 
interrogations and the proceedings, and that the court hearings were held in closed sessions. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 28 February 2007 
</b> 
268. In its reply, the Government tranmitted the following information. According to 
information received from the Judiciary of the Islarnic Republic of Iran Mr. <b>Ali Farahbakhsh</b> 
has been charged with &quot;espionage. His legal dossier has been examined by the Office of 
Public Prosecutor and has been sent to the relevant court. 
 
269. Regarding Mr. <b>Javanmard</b>, he has been charged with &#8220;measures against the security of 
the country&quot; by participating in the riots in the City of Sanandaj (Western Iran) on 1 August 
2005. He has been sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment. This sentence has been commuted 
by the appellate court to 2 years. It is important to note that the above mentioned person 
continued his actions against the country even during the period of his trial and was detained 
again for his second charge. He is serving his prison term for his first sentence.

situation of Ms. <b>Mansoureh Shojaei</b>, Ms. <b>Sedigheh Taghinia</b> (alias Tal&#8217;at Taghinia) and Ms. 
<b>Farnaz Seifi</b>, three journalists and women rights activists. They were at the forefront of an 
on-line campaign launched by Iranian feminist groups in August 2006 for the elimination of 
all forms of legal discrimination against women in Iranian law, and inviting legislators to 
review and reform existing laws to ensure the conformity of Government&#8217;s commitments with 
international human rights instruments.  
 
272. According to the information received, on 27 January 2007, Ms. Mansoureh Shojaei, 
Ms. Sedigheh Taghinia and Ms. Farnaz Seifi were reportedly arrested at the Imam Khomeini 
Airport while on their way to India to participate in a training course in journalism organised

275. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of at least 24 women human rights defenders reportedly arrested while holding a 
peaceful demonstration in front of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran. 
 
276. According to the information received, on 4 March 2007, the Iranian authorities 
arrested at least 31 women, seven of whom were released on bail on 6 March 2007. Ms.

A number of these women had allegedly gone on a hunger strike. The women had staged a 
peaceful demonstration against the prosecution of several women, who had been charged with 
criminal offences against public order and security for having organized a peaceful women&#8217;s 
demonstration in Haft-e Tir Square of Tehran on 12 June 2006. Many of the detained women 
were well-known women&#8217;s rights defenders who have publicly expressed their views on 
numerous occasions. All of the detained women had reportedly been transferred to Ward 209 
of the Evin Prison in Teheran. Allegedly, police officers had also broken the teeth of Ms. 
Nahid Jaafari by banging her head against the door of a police bus.

277. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr<b>. Esma&#8217;il Javadi</b>, aged 31, journalist, Mr. <b>Ebulfezl Alilu</b>, shopkeeper, and Mr. 
<b>Ramin Sadeghi</b>. All men are Iranian Azeri Turks and linguistic rights activists.  
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

278. According to the information received, the three men named above were arrested at 
around the time of several peaceful demonstrations marking International Mother Language 
Day on 21 February 2007. The assemblies were intended to celebrate linguistic diversity and 
called for education in Azeri Turkish in the Islamic Republic of Iran. They were arrested in 
the cities of Orumiyeh and Ardabil in north-western Iran. Mr. Esma&#8217;il Javadi was arrested on 
18 February 2007 in the city of Orumiyeh. He was being detained in a detention facility under 
the auspices of the Ministry of Intelligence in the Dokkuz Pille area of Orumiyeh and had 
been reportedly ill-treated in detention. Mr. Javadi was in poor health and in urgent need of 
medical care. Family members who were permitted to meet with him had been threatened by 
security officials and told that they should not speak about Mr. Javadi to anyone.  
 
279. Mr. Ebulfezl Alilu was in a group of around 50 people who were arrested in Orumiyeh 
on 21 February 2007. Authorities had closed his shop at Orumiyeh Bazaar. Mr. Alilu was 
being detained at Dokkuz Pille detention facility, where he had been reportedly ill-treated. 
Mr. Ramin Sadeghi was arrested in the city of Ardabil on 19 February 2007 together with 
around 20 other persons. He was first held in a detention facility of the Ministry of 
Intelligence and then transferred to Section 1 of Ardabil prison on 3 March 2007. Authorities 
had denied him any visits. He had gone on hunger strike and was in poor health, and thus in 
urgent need of medical care. 
 
280. Concern was expressed that the arrests and detention of the persons named above may 
have been related to their peaceful activities on behalf of the cultural and linguistic rights of 
the Azeri-Turkish community, and that these measures may have formed part of a pattern of 
harassment and intimidation against members of the Azeri-Turkish community in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Further concern was expressed with respect to the health and well-being of 
Mr. Ramin Sadeghi and Mr. Esma&#8217;il Javadi, who reportedly requires urgent medical attention. 
Concern was also expressed regarding the physical integrity of Mr. Esma&#8217;il Javadi and Mr. 
Ebulfezl Alilu, who have reportedly been ill-treated while in detention. Finally, in view of his 
incommunicado detention, further concern was expressed that Mr. Ramin Sadeghi might be at 
risk of ill-treatment. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 5 April 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the

situation of Ms Nahid Keshavarz and Ms Mahboubeh Hoseinzadeh. According to information 
received, Iranian security agents arrested the two women on 3 April 2007 in Laleh Park 
(Tehran) while they were collecting signatures for a campaign to change Iranian laws that 
discriminate against women.  
 
282. It was reported that Ms. Nahid Keshavarz and Ms. Mahboubeh Hoseinzadeh remained 
in detention and had been transferred to Evin Prison. Three other persons, Ms. Saiideh Amin, 
Ms. Sarah Imanian and her husband Mr. Homayoon Nami, who were arrested on the same 
occasion, had since been released on bail. The charges against the five persons were not 
known. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Nahid Keshavarz and Ms. 
Mahboubeh Hoseinzadeh may have been related to their peaceful activities in defence of 
women's human rights.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 May 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention</b> 
 
283. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Dr. <b>Haleh Esfandiari</b>, aged 67, a dual United States and Iranian citizen, who has 
worked as a journalist and has been a frequent lecturer on Iranian and United States affairs. 
According to the information received, Dr. Haleh Esfandiari was arrested in Tehran on 8 May 
2007 after having been summoned for questioning by officials from the Iranian Ministry of 
Intelligence. She was being detained without charge in Section 209 of Evin Prison, which is 
run by the Ministry. Dr. Esfandiari was allowed only to make one phone call to her elderly 
mother on the day of her arrest, but had not been permitted any visits or contacts since then 
while in detention in solitary confinement.   
 
284. Dr. Esfandiari travelled from the United States to Iran in December 2006 to visit her 
93-year-old mother. On 30 December 2006, while on her way to the airport to return to the 
United States, her taxi was stopped by three masked men wielding knifes, who took her 
Iranian and U.S.-American passports and belongings. Since then, Iranian authorities have 
failed to replace her passport. Four days later she was summoned by officials from the 
Military Intelligence Service to two different offices in Tehran for interrogation sessions 
totalling over 50 hours and stretching out over six weeks. The questions focussed almost 
exclusively on the activities and programs of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow 
Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington D.C., which she is heading. Dr. Esfandiari was 
repeatedly pressured, apparently in order to obtain false confessions or to make her falsely 
implicate the Wilson Center in activities in which it had not taken part.  
 
285. Concern was expressed that Dr. Haleh Esfandiari&#8217;s arrest and detention might have 
been connected solely to her peaceful exercise of her rights to freedom of opinion and 
expression. In view of her incommunicado detention further concerns were expressed that she 
might be at risk of ill-treatment. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 May 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the

situation of the following women&#8217;s rights activists: Ms. <b>Zeynab Peihgambarzadeh</b>, Ms. 
<b>Maryam Hoseinkhah</b>, Ms. <b>Fatemeh Govarayi</b>, Ms. <b>Nusheen Ahmadi Khorasani</b>, Ms. 
<b>Shahla Entesari</b>, Ms. <b>Parvin Ardalan</b>, Ms. <b>Fariba Davoudi Mohajer</b>, Ms. <b>Sussan 
Tahmassebi</b>, Ms. <b>Behareh Hedayat</b>, Ms. <b>Azadeh Forghaani</b>, Ms. <b>Mahboubeh Hossein 
Zadeh</b> and Ms. <b>Nahid Keshavarz</b>. Several of these women&#8217;s rights activists had already been 
subject to an urgent appeal, sent on 7 March 2007, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.  
 
287. According to the latest information received, on 7 May 2007, Ms. Zeynab 
Peyqambarzadeh, Ms. Maryam Hosseinhkah and Ms. Fatemeh Govarayi were summoned to 
court for their participation in a peaceful demonstration on 4 March 2007. The demonstration 
was directed against the prosecution of women activists in connection with a peaceful 
women&#8217;s demonstration that took place on 12 June 2006 in Haft-e Tir Square of Tehran and </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

was addressed in an urgent appeal transmitted on 16 June 2006. Ms. Zeynab Peyqambarzadeh 
reported to the Revolutionary Court after receiving a summons, where she was then arrested 
and transferred to Evin prison. Ms. Zeynab Peyqambarzadeh was released on bail on 17 May 
2007.  
 
288. On 24 April 2007, the Sixth Branch of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran sentenced 
Ms. Nusheen Ahmadi Khorasani, Ms. Shahla Entesari and Ms. Parvin Ardalan in connection 
with the peaceful demonstration of 12 June 2006 to three years&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;collusion 
and assembly to endanger the national security,&#8221; under article 610 of the Islamic Penal Code. 
The court ordered Khorasani, Entesari, and Ardalan to serve six months in prison, but 
suspended the remaining two-and-half years of their sentences. The same court sentenced two 
other women&#8217;s rights advocates to prison terms on 18 April 2007 in relation to same 
demonstration. Ms. Fariba Davoudi Mohajer was sentenced to four years imprisonment, of 
which three years were suspended, and Ms. Sussan Tahmassebi was sentenced to two years 
imprisonment, of which 18 months were suspended. The women, currently free, are expected 
to appeal against their sentences.  
 
289. The same day, Ms. Behareh Hedayat, a university student, was reportedly also tried 
without the presence of her lawyer due to her participation in the demonstration of 12 June 
2006. On 26 May 2007, she was reportedly sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence for 
&#8220;acting against national security by participating in an illegal gathering.&#8221; On 11 April 2007, 
Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran gave Ms. Azadeh Forghani, a university 
student, a two-year suspended sentence in connection with the demonstration of 12 June 2006 
for &#8220;acting against national security by participating in an illegal gathering.&#8221; Several days 
later, she was summoned to court where she was questioned and informed that she was facing 
new charges in connection with a peaceful gathering on 4 March 2007 held to protest against 
the prosecution of activists in connection with the demonstration in June 2006.  
 
290. Appreciation was expressed that Ms. Mahboubeh Hossein Zadeh and Ms. Nahid 
Keshavarz have been released on bail on 15 April 2007 but the Special Representative 
remained concerned that the charges against the two women had reportedly not been dropped 
and that they might be prosecuted at a future point in time. Concern was expressed that the 
arrests and sentencing of the aforementioned activists may have been solely related to their 
peaceful activities in defence of women rights and could form part of wider pattern of 
harassment against women rights activists. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 7 June 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right 
to education 
 
</b>291. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government the case of 
teachers, mostly members of local teachers&#8217; Associations or of the National Council of 
Teachers&#8217; Association, who were reportedly targeted after they initiated a series of protest in 
March 2007, demanding the improvement of the salary scales and teacher&#8217;s welfare. It is 
reported that hundreds of teachers were arrested across the country, some of them several 
times, and in some cases, subsequently released. According to the information received, on 7 
April 2007, 45 teachers were arrested in Hamedan, including the entire board of the Hamedan 
Teacher&#8217;s association, which was afterwards banned by the authorities. On 12, 14, 16 and 17 
April, at least a dozen teachers were allegedly detained across the country in connection with </p>

these protests. Moreover, it is alleged that more teachers have been arrested during the 
demonstrations held on 2 May which is Iran&#8217;s National Teacher&#8217;s day. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 27 June 2007</b> 
 
292. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter in relation to the case of <b>Ms. Parnaz 
Azima</b>, a translator and a journalist with Radio Farda, the Persian-language service of Radio 
Free Europe based in the Czech Republic, who is reported to have had her passport 
confiscated upon her arrival at the airport in Tehran on 25 January 2007. On 15 May, Ms. 
Azima reportedly appeared before the Special Security Bureau of the Revolutionary Court&#8217;s 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office, where she was allegedly charged with &quot;anti-regime propaganda&#8221; 
because of her work with Radio Farda.  The bail was subsequently set at 400 million Tomans, 
but in spite of the posting of the bail by Ms. Azima&#8217;s lawyer on 21 May 2007, authorities 
apparently decided to retain her passport.  Reportedly, Iranian authorities had already 
confiscated Ms. Azima&#8217;s passport from March to May 2006. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 5 July 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</b> 
293. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Ms. <b>Delaram Ali</b>, a women's rights defender from Tehran University. According 
to information received, the Tehran Revolutionary Court convicted Ms Delaram Ali on 
charges of &#8220;Propaganda against the System&#8221; and &#8220;Disturbing Public Order&#8221; for having 
participated in a peaceful demonstration for a better recognition of women's rights and to 
remove discriminatory clauses against women from Iranian law, which took place in Haft Tir 
Square on 12 June 2006. Ms. Delaram Ali was sentenced to two years and 10 months 
imprisonment and 10 lashes. The sentence had not been suspended and could be carried out at 
any time. Reportedly, several other persons arrested during the demonstration had also been 
convicted and sentenced, but had their sentence suspended.  
 
294. In an urgent appeal dated 16 June 2006, to which the Iranian government responded by 
letter, dated 15 August 2006, the mandate holders had already expressed their concern that 
Iranian security forces had arrested Ms. Delaram Ali and others during the demonstration of 
12 June 2006. Concern was reiterated that the sentencing of Ms Delaram Ali may be related to 
her peaceful activities in defence of women's rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 
government was urged to ensure that Ms. Delaram Ali would not be subjected to any 
punishment, including the cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment of lashing, for having 
exercised her right to freedom of expression. Particular concern was expressed that the 
execution of the lashing sentence could be imminent. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 July 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention</b> 
 
295. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Mohammad Sadiq Kabudvand</b>, Chair of the Kurdish Human Rights 
Organization (RMMK) based in Tehran, and editor of Payam-e Mardom-e Kurdestan 
(Kurdistan People&#8217;s Message) a weekly published in Kurdish and Persian and suspended in </p>

June 2004 for &#8220;disseminating separatist ideas and publishing false reports&#8221;. Mr Sadiq 
Kabudvand was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 22 September 
2006.  
 
296. According to the information received, on 1 July 2007, Mr Sadiq Kabudvand was 
reportedly arrested at his place of work in Tehran by plainclothes security officers. He was 
taken to his house where the security officers confiscated several personal belongings, 
including three computers, personal documents, books, photographs and family films. He was 
then taken to ward 209 of Evin prison where he was being detained and denied access to a 
lawyer. The date of his arrest coincides with the last day of suspension of the Payam-e 
Mardom-e Kurdestan newspaper.  
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 12 July 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention</b> 
 
297. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Mohammad Hashemi</b>, Mr <b>Ali Nikou Nesbati</b>, Mr <b>Mehdi Arabshahi</b>, Ms 
<b>Bahareh Hedayat</b>, Mr <b>Hanif Yazdani</b>, Mr <b>Ali Vefqi</b>, Mr <b>Abdollah Momeni</b>, Mr <b>Bahram 
Fayazi</b>, Ms <b>Hashemi</b>, Mr <b>Morteza Eslahchi</b>, Mr <b>Mojtaba Bayat</b>, Mr <b>Ezzatollah 
Ghalandari</b>, Mr <b>Habib Haj Heydari</b>, Mr <b>Massud Habibi</b>, Mr <b>Sayid Hosseiniya</b> and Mr<b> 
Arash Khandel</b>, all members of the High Council of the Office for the Consolidating Unity 
(HCOCU) and the Advar Centre. The HCOCU is a non-governmental organisation dedicated 
to the defence and promotion of student rights. The Advar Centre is a branch of the HCOCU 
founded by its alumni members.  
 
298. According to information received, on 9 July 2007, at approximately 7.30am, national 
security forces attacked the Abir Kabir University in Tehran, Iran and arrested Mr 
Mohammad Hashemi, Mr Ali Nikou Nesbati, Mr Mehdi Arabshahi, Ms Bahareh Hedayat, Mr 
Hanif Yazdani, and Mr Ali Vefqi who were participating in a sit-in protest at the main 
entrance of the university. The protest was intended to mark the eighth anniversary of the 
student uprising of 1999 as well as to raise concern in relation to the continued detention of 
eight students of the university, arrested two months ago on charges of having published 
offensive material in university publications. The university was closed down later that day, 
allegedly due to problems with electricity. Immediately after the arrests were made at the 
university, security forces allegedly attacked the offices of the Advar Centre.  
 
299. According to reports, the security forces broke down the doors and arrested everyone at 
gunpoint. Security forces were said to have opened fire although the shots fired were blank 
shots and there were no injuries. Among those named in reports as having been arrested were 
the aforementioned. Concern was expressed that the arrests of the aforementioned individuals 
may be directly related to their peaceful work in the defence of human rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, in particular students&#8217; rights, and that their arrests may form part of a pattern 
of harassment against human rights defenders in the country. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 13 July 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the

Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

300. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Mansour Osanloo</b> (Ossanlu), President of the Syndicate of Workers of 
Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company (Sandikaye Kargarane Sherkat-e Vahed). Mr Osanloo was 
the subject of two urgent appeals sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression on 16 January 2006 and on 4 December 2006.  
 
301. According to information received, on 10 July 2007, at approximately 7pm, Mr 
Osanloo was abducted by unidentified individuals as he was getting off a bus on his way 
home. According to eye-witnesses who viewed the attack from the bus, Mr Osanloo was the 
subject of a severe beating and his attackers were still beating him as they forced him into an 
unregistered car and drove away to an undisclosed location. He had allegedly been followed 
all that day by the same car. His family appealed to the police for information, but did not 
receive any helpful feedback. Since April 2006, Mr Osanloo had been detained 
incommunicado twice and arrested on one occasion by police and national security forces.  
 
302. Concern was expressed that the abduction of Mr Mansour Osanloo may be related to 
his peaceful work in the defence of human rights, in particular his trade union activities, and 
may form part of an ongoing pattern of intimidation against human rights defenders in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Further concern was expressed for the physical integrity of Mr 
Osanloo.  
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 26 July 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention</b> 
 
303. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Adnan Hassanpour</b> and his cousin, Mr <b>Abdolwahed Butimar</b> who have 
been sentenced to death. Mr Hassanpour is a Kurdish journalist and an advocate of cultural 
rights for members of the Kurdish-Iranian community residing in Iran. He is also a former 
member of the editorial board of the Kurdish-Persian journal Aso (Horizon) which was shut 
down by the Iranian authorities in August 2005. Mr Butimar is an environmental activist and 
director of the environmental organisation, The Green Mountain Society. 
 
304. According to information received, Mr Butimar and Mr Hassanpour were arrested in 
Marivan, in the province of Kordestan, on 23 December 2006 and 25 January 2007 
respectively. They were reportedly detained incommunicado in a Ministry of Intelligence 
facility in Marivan before being transferred to Marivan Prison on 26 March, 2007. Members 
of the Iranian Intelligence Service searched the home of Mr Butimar following his arrest. 
They allegedly found items relating to Kurdish identity such as flags, videos, and family 
photos. These items were confiscated and later used as evidence against Mr Hassanpour and 
Mr Butimar in their trial at the Revolutionary Court in Sanandaj on 12 June 2007 on charges 
of espionage and the crime of &#8220;Moharebeh&#8221; (being an enemy of God). On 17 July 2007, the 
two men were informed that they had been sentenced to death. 
 
305. According to their lawyer, Mr Saleh Nikbakht, Mr Hassanpour&#8217;s charges were linked to 
a phone exchange he had with a staff-member of Radio Voice of America. Mr Butimar was </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 89 
 
also charged with carrying a lethal weapon although Mr Nikbakht had said that this charge 
was without any supporting evidence. The Mehr News Agency had also alleged the 
involvement of Mr Hassanpour with Kurdish opposition groups and had reportedly implied 
that he assisted two known Kurdish activists, wanted by the Iranian authorities, to flee Iran.  
 
306. Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be 
interpreted in the most restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, to which Iran is a party, provides that the &#8220;sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. Moreover, when the HRC for the last time 
considered a report presented by the Iranian government, it expressly stated in its concluding 
observations that it &quot;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not 
result in loss of life, as being contrary to the Covenant&quot; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9).  
 
307. According to the information received, the offences for which the above two persons 
have been convicted were not intended to result in any killings and did not result in loss of 
life. Moreover, regarding the charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221;, we would like to draw attention to 
concerns already raised in correspondence with the government as well as in general reports. 
In a communication of 31 August 2006 concerning the imposition of the death penalty against 
Ali Motirijejad and others (reproduced in A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, pages 165f) similar concerns 
were raised with regard to the charge of &#8220;mohareb&#8221;: The Special Representative was 
concerned that this charge, which according to her information, in Iran is brought against 
political dissidents, critics of the Government and persons accused of espionage, might not be 
sufficiently well defined to satisfy the very strict standards of legality set by Article 6(2) 
ICCPR for the imposition and execution of the death penalty. Indeed, in order for sentence of 
death to be imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law in question must be sufficiently 
precise to clearly allow distinction between conduct punishable with the capital sentence and 
conduct not so punishable.  
 
308. The concept of a &#8220;fair trial&#8221; similarly requires that the elements of the crime charged be 
known in sufficient detail to the defendant for him to be able to effectively address them.&#8221; 
The query to the government to provide the definition of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; under Iranian law has 
unfortunately remained without a reply as of to date. Concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned sentence of the death penalty imposed against Mr Hassanpour and Mr 
Butimar may be related to their peaceful work in the defence of human rights, in particular 
Kurds&#8217; rights. Further concern was expressed due to fears of the ill-treatment of Mr 
Hassanpour and Mr Butimar while in detention. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 23 August 2007 
</b> 
309. The Iranian government responded to the above communication, stating that Mr 
Abolwahed Butimar was charged with actions against national security through the purchase 
and possession of war arms and munitions and that he had been arrested while delivering 
weapons to a terrorist group PEJAK. Mr Adnan Hassanpour was charged with espionage in 
favour of aliens through mapping military and police sites and their transfer to aliens. He was 
also charged with cooperation and organizational relations with PEJAK, receiving money 
from terrorists groups and their delivery to newspapers. They had been sentenced to death and 
the verdict had been presented to the Supreme court for a final decision. The charges had no 
connection with journalism. </p>

<b>Letter of allegations sent on 21 August 
</b> 
310. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of Mr. 
<b>Emadoldin Baghi</b>, former editor of &#8220;Jomhouriat&#8221;, a daily newspaper that was closed by the 
authorities in July 2004, who was reportedly sentenced on 31 July 2007 to three years in 
prison by a Tehran revolutionary court for allegedly writing articles defending persons who 
were sentenced to death in the southern Khozestan region. The charges against him were 
&#8220;activities against national security&#8221; and &#8220;publicity in favor of the regime&#8217;s opponents&#8221;. The 
court is reported to have also passed suspended sentences on his wife, Fatemeh Kamali 
Ahmad Sarahi, editor of the &#8220;Jameh-e-no&#8221; and his daughter, Mary Baghi. Mr Baghi has 
allegedly filed an appeal and is currently waiting for a final decision on his sentence. 
 
311. In the same letter, the Rapporteur referred to the case of <b>Farshad Ghorbanipour</b>, 
<b>Soheil Assefi</b> and <b>Masoud Bastani</b>, three contributors to the online newspaper &#8220;Roozonline&#8221;, 
who were reportedly detained on 31 July 2007. Although the charges against them were 
allegedly not revealed when they were arrested, they appeared before the court on 5 August 
2007. According to the information received, a bail of 2,000 million Rials was set for Mr. 
Ghorbanipour&#8217;s release, which is allegedly an unusually high value. He was reportedly unable 
to pay this amount and remained in prison at the time the communication was sent. Mr. Assefi 
was reportedly convicted and transferred to prison without further information given to his 
family. Mr. Bastani was sentenced to six months imprisonment and sixty lashes for &#8220;libel and 
slander&#8221; and was in prison when the communication was sent. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 October 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the

312. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Emadeddin Baghi</b>, President of the Society for Defending Prisoners&#8217; Rights, 
a non-governmental human rights organization founded in 2003, and former editor of 
Jomhouriat, a daily newspaper closed by the authorities in July 2004. Mr Baghi&#8217;s case was the 
subject of an allegation letter sent on 21 August 2007 by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  
 
313. According to the information received, on 14 October 2007, Mr Baghi was sentenced to 
one-year imprisonment by the Security Unit of the General and Revolutionary Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Teheran for &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; and &#8220;publishing secret 
government documents&#8221; obtained from prisoners detained in security prisons. Mr Baghi was 
set to be released on bail, but was transferred to Evin prison to serve another one-year 
sentence from a previous conviction in 2003. Concern was expressed that the prison sentence 
for Mr Baghi may have been related to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular prisoners&#8217; rights, and his defence of persons sentenced to death in the Khozestan 
region.

of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers</b> 
 
314. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Abdolfattah Soltani</b>, a lawyer at the Bar of Tehran and a founding member of 
the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC). Mr Soltani was the subject of numerous 
urgent appeals sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges, Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 8 and 11 
August 2006, 31 March 2006 and 14 December 2005.  
 
315. According to the information received, Mr Soltani was invited by the non-governmental 
organisation International Federation of Human Rights to participate in a conference on 
&#8220;Freedom of expression in Iran&#8221; that was held at the Sorbonne university on 27 October 2007 
in Paris. However, Mr Soltani was unable to travel to France because his identity documents 
(i.e. passport and family record book) had not yet been returned to him after his acquittal on 
28 May 2007 of all charges that were pending against him since July 2005. Concern was 
expressed that the abovementioned interference with the freedom of movement of Mr Soltani 
may be linked to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 30 November 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences</b> 
 
316. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Ms <b>Maryam Hosseinkhah</b>, a journalist and activist for women&#8217;s rights. Ms 
Maryam Hosseinkhah is also a member of the Campaign for Equality which is leading the 
One Million Signatures campaign, which calls for an end to discriminatory laws against 
women in Iran. She was a member of the Women&#8217;s Cultural Centre prior to its closure by the 
Iranian authorities, days before her summons. Ms Maryam Hosseinkhah had been the subject 
of an urgent appeal sent by several mandate-holders on 7 March 2007.  
 
317. According to information received, on 18 November 2007, Ms Maryam Hosseinkhah 
was arrested when she reported to a branch of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran for 
questioning following a summons that had been issued to her. She had reportedly been 
accused of &#8220;disturbing public opinion&#8221;; &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221;; and &#8220;publication of 
lies&#8221;, as a result of articles posted on a website of which she is the editor. No date for trial had 
reportedly yet been set. Concern was expressed that the arrest of Ms Maryam Hosseinkhah 
and the accusations that have been made against her may have been directly related to her 
peaceful human rights activities, in particular her work to promote women&#8217;s rights in Iran. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 14 December 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on arbitrary detention</b> 
 
318. The Special Rapporteur and the Chairperson-Rapporteur brought to the attention of the 
Government allegations that between 20 and 30 students, including the persons mentioned 
below, were arrested on 7 December 2007 and were being detained without charges in Tehran </p>

and other cities. They had participated in demonstrations, marches and student sit-ins linked 
to the Iran&#8217;s University Students&#8217; Day. They are associated with the student group Freedom 
and Equality (Daneshjouyan-e Azadi Khah va Beraber Talab). Their names were given as 
follows: <b>Ms. Rosa &#8216;Essa&#8217;ie</b>, member of Iran's Armenian minority, student at Tehran&#8217;s Amir 
Kabir University; <b>Mr. Mehdi Geraylou</b>, student at Tehran University; <b>Ms. Anousheh 
Azadfar</b> , student at Tehran University; <b>Ms. Ilnaz Jamshidi</b> , student at Free University of 
Central Tehran; <b>Mr. Rouzbeh Safshekan</b> , student at Tehran University; <b>Mr. Nasim Soltan-
Beigi</b>  student at &#8216;Allameh Tabatabai University; <b>Mr. Yaser Pir Hayati</b> , student at Tehran&#8217;s 
Shahed University;  <b>Mr. Younes Mir Hosseini</b> , student at Shiraz University; and <b>Mr. Milad 
Moini</b>, student at Mazandaran University. 
 
319. These students were reportedly detained following protests against the replacement of 
scores of professors and other actions allegedly intended to limit of freedom of expression on 
university campuses, including the banning of a number of student publications, and 
suspensions and expulsions of students from their places of higher education. It was reported 
that activists from the students' groups, the Office for Strengthening Unity (Daftar-e Tahkim-e 
Vahdat) and Students For Freedom and Equality (Daneshjouyan-e Azadi Khah va Beraber 
Talab) were among those who took part in these demonstrations. Most of those detained in 
Tehran were said to be held in sections 209 and 240 of Evin Prison and others in a unit 
depending of the Ministry of Intelligence called Daftar-e Paygiri (Follow-up Office). It was 
further reported that the recent student demonstrations &#8211; often involving hundreds of students 
&#8211; took place in Shahroud, east of Tehran; at Mazandaran University in Babolsar in the north 
of the country; and in Shiraz, in the south. 
 
320. On 12 December, family members of those detained gathered outside Evin prison and 
outside Iran's Parliament building to protest against the incommunicado detention of their 
relatives. In April 2007, Minister of Intelligence Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejeie publicly 
accused student activists and campaigners for the rights of women in Iran of being part of an 
&quot;enemy conspiracy&quot;. 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>321. On 8 May 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 14 September 2006 concerning the Sharq newspaper, which was reportedly 
closed for failing to comply with an order of the Press and Supervisory Board. In its reply, the 
Government transmitted the information that Mr. Mehdi Rahmanian, manager of the said 
daily, was charged with &#8220;dissemination of materials against Islamic Sanctities&#8221; and 
&#8220;blasphemy to Islam&#8221;. He has been indicted on this basis and referred to court. After hearing 
the prosecutor and the defense team, the court based on articles 6 and 9 of the Law of the 
Press and articles 47 and 698 of the Islamic Penal Code, sentenced him to a fine in 
substitution of imprisonment. On other counts of charges such as &#8220;promoting illegal 
opposition groups&#8221; and &#8220;blasphemy to the President&#8221; he has been acquitted. Also, the Sharq 
Daily has been cleared from the ban and is free to publish. 
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>322. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response to his letters of 14 
September 2006 as well as 23 January, 6 February and 26 July 2007. He regrets that the 
Government has not replied to his other 16 communications sent in 2007. </p>

media professionals, <b>Mr. Muhammad al-Ban, Ms. Luma al-Karkhi, Mr. Nabil Ibrahim 
al-Dulaimi, Mr. Aswan Ahmed Lutfallah, Mr. Walid Hassan, Mr. Raad Jaafar Hamadi 
</b>and<b> Ms. Fadhila Abdelkarim</b>. 
 
324. On 13 November 2006, unidentified gunmen shot Mr. Muhammad al-Ban, a reporter 
and cameraman for Al-Sharqiya television station, as he was leaving his home in Mosul 
together with his wife who was wounded in the attack. Al-Ban, who had received several 
death threats warning him not to cover Kurdish activities, worked for three years at Al-
Sharqiya and had a reputation as a seasoned journalist. 
 
325. On 15 November 2006, several unknown gunmen in Baqubah killed Ms. Luma Al-
Karkhi, a reporter for the Baghdad daily Al-Dustour while she was on her way to work. Ms. 
Al-Karkhi had allegedly received several death threats from insurgents in Diyala province 
warning her to stop reporting. 
 
326. On 20 November 2006, comedian and TV producer Mr. Walid Hassan, was kidnapped 
and killed shortly afterwards in Baghdad. Under the previous regime, he took part in many 
entertainment programmes on public television. More recently, he ran a satirical programme 
on Al Sharqiya television station, in which he criticized the US army and Iraqi politicians, as 
well as Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias. 
 
327. On 22 and 26 November 2006, two employees of the state-owned Iraqi Media Network 
(IMN) were killed: Mr. Raad Jaafar Hamadi, a journalist with the daily Al Sabah, was shot 
dead in Baghdad and  Mr. Fadhila Abdelkarim, a member of the administrative staff of the 
local TV station Nainawa, was killed while leaving her home in Mosul. IMN was established 
by the coalition forces in 2003 and is the biggest media group in Iraq with more than 3,000 
employees. Many of them have received threatening letters telling them to quit the network or

</b> 
342. The Special Rapporteur referred to the following cases: 
 
343. On 5 April 2007, <b>Baghdad TV</b> was reportedly attacked by armed men who opened 
their way to the TV building with an explosive truck, and then killed deputy director <b>Thaer 
Ahmed Jabr</b> and one of his assistants, <b>Hussein Nizar</b>.  Nine other people were injured in the 
attack.  Following that aggression, the station, which is owed by Iraqi Vice-President Tareq 
al-Hashimi, was moved to the city of Sulaymaniyah, in the region of Kurdistan.  
 
344. On 8 June 2007, <b>Mohammed Hilal Karji</b>, Baghdad TV's correspondent in the Al-
Yusufia region, was allegedly kidnapped outside his home on his way to work.  The next day, 
relatives found his body in the morgue. 
 
345. On 27 June 2007, another Baghdad TV's journalist, <b>Sarmad Hamdi Al-Hassani</b>, was 
reportedly kidnapped at his home in the neighbourhood of Al-Jami'a of the capital. The next 
day, relatives found his body in the morgue. 
 
346. On 28 June 2007, the body of <b>Luay Suleiman</b>, a journalist with &quot;Nineveh&quot;, a local

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>348. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Rappresentative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr <b>Shawan Jabarin</b>, general Director of Al Haq and well 
known human rights defender in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Al Haq is an 
independent Palestinian non-governmental human rights organisation based in Ramallah, 
West Bank established in 1979 to protect and promote human rights and the rule of law in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT).  
 
349. According to information received, since 23 March 2006, Mr Jabarin had been 
prevented on several occasions, from leaving the country in order to attend events organised 
by international organisations abroad. In December 2006, Mr Jabarin was prevented from 
traveling to Egypt to attend a conference organized by Christian Aid. An appeal filed by Mr. 
Jabarin was later rejected by the High Court. The court ruling reportedly took into account 
information submitted by the authorities that neither Mr. Jabarin nor his counsel were 
permitted to access. In October 2006, Mr. Jabarin was again refused permission to travel to 
attend a conference in Spain.  
 
350. On 23 March 2006, Mr Jabarin attempted to cross from the West Bank to Jordan when 
he was presented with a police order to appear three days later at the Etsion Liaison Office, 
between Hebron and Bethlehem. On 26 March 2006, Mr Jabarin presented himself at the 
Liaison Office at the time requested.  After waiting outside the Office for four hours in 
uncomfortably cold conditions, and after refusing to remove the clothing from his torso before 
entering the compound, Mr Jabarin was informed by an Israeli official that he could go home. 
However, the official refused to return Mr Jamorin&#8217;s identification documents, thus 
preventing him from legally traveling within the West Bank until July 2006, when his 
documents were finally returned to him.  
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 August 2007 
</b> 
351. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning the case of <b>Ata Farahat</b>, a 
correspondent for the Syrian public television and for the daily newspaper &#8220;Al-Watan&#8221;. 
According to the information received, on 30 July 2007, members of the Israeli forces entered 
Mr. Farahat&#8217;s home in Buqata at around 3 a.m., carrying out a search and taking him in 
custody. It is reported that the authorities gave no explanation for his arrest nor provided 
information concerning the charges against him. Mr. Farahat appeared three times before a 
Tel Aviv judge, who renewed a provisional detention order on each occasion. It is alleged that 
he was detained in the Al-Jalama prison at the time the communication was sent. Mr. 
Farahat&#8217;s lawyers and the press have reportedly been prohibited by judicial authorities from </p>

addressing the case. According to information received, there has been a recent increase in the 
number of court orders limiting the scope of journalistic inquiry in similar cases. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 August 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention 
</b> 
352. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr. <b>Mohammad Bsharat</b>, Executive Director of the Nafha Society for the 
Defence of Prisoners and Human Rights in Nablus, legally established and registered with the 
Palestinian Authority in 2006. It is one of several NGOs representing Palestinian detainees in 
Israeli courts and advocating on behalf of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons and detention 
centres. According to the information received, Mr. Mohammad Bsharat was arrested in 
Nablus on the night of 2 August 2007 by Israeli soldiers and then interrogated at the Huwara 
detention centre in the city. No charges were been brought against him. He was reportedly 
questioned about his human rights activities. On 12 and 19 August 2007, Mr. Bsharat&#8217;s 
detention was extended. During the last hearing on 26 August 2007, the Salem Military court 
ordered that he be detained administratively, without any precise official reason. Concern was 
expressed that the detention of Mr. Bsharat may have been an attempt to sanction his human 
rights activities, and fears were also expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 21 September 2007 jointly with the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders  
</b> 
353. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Rappresentative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr <b>Raji Sourani</b>, Director of the Palestinian Centre for Human 
Rights, a non-governmental human rights organization. According to the information 
received, in late August 2007, Mr Sourani was reportedly prevented from travelling outside 
the Gaza Strip to attend the United Nations Conference of Civil Society in Support of Israeli-
Palestinian Peace organized by the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights 
of the Palestinian People and held in the European Parliament Building in Brussels on 30 and 
31 August. Mr Sourani was due to present a paper entitled &#8220;Enforcement of International Law 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory: The Only Real Roadmap for Peace&#8221; in which he 
denounced ongoing human rights violations and called for enforcing international human 
rights law in the OPT.  
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
354. On 20 March 2007, the Government replied to the letter sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on 4 September 2006 concerning Mr. <b>Sabbah Hmaida</b>, a Reuters reporter, and Mr. <b>Fadel 
Shana</b>, a Reuters cameraman. On 27 August 2006, Mr. Hmaida was seriously injured and Mr. 
Shana lost consciousness when Israeli aircraft fire two missiles during an incursion into the 
Gaza Strip. In its reply, the Government informed me that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) 
did not intentionally target the Reuters vehicle in the incident. IDF ground forces had entered 
the area near the Karni Crossing to uncover explosive devices planted along the security 
fances. The IDF has been operating in the area for three weeks and suffered various attacks by 
terrorist groups. The Reuters vehicle was first observed after midnight and advanced towards 
the soldiers in a suspicious manner. One of the passengers had left the car to speak with a man 
positioned on the rooftops of buildings, subsequently returning to the vehicle. While the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 98 
 
vehicle may have been marked as a media-owned vehicle, the darkness of the late hor did not 
allow it to be previously identified as such. When the vehicle was fired upon, the intention 
was to stop its advance rather than target its occupants, as photographs published by Reuters 
and IDF make clear. The area where the incident occured is a dangerous combat zone where 
terrorist groups are known to operate and target the IDF. While the IDF takes precautions to 
prevent injury of media personnel, those who choose to enter a combat zone do so at their 
own considerable risk. 
 
355. In a letter dated 23 April 2007, the Israeli government responded to an urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Representative on 14 March 2006, together with the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression concerning the 
continued administrative detention of Mr <b>Ziyad Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan</b>, human 
rights defender and fieldworker for Al-Haq, a Palestinian NGO and affiliate organization of 
the International Commission of Jurists. In the letter, the government stated that an 
administrative detention order had first been issued against the aforementioned in June 2005, 
for a period of six months, on grounds of endangering the public security, because of alleged 
involvement with the Popular Front, a well-known terrorist group, and that his detention was 
periodically reviewed in the intervening months, with each extension order judicially 
reviewed and approved by the courts. Mr Hmeidan had appealed his detention on 26 
December 2006. The Military Court of Appeals which examined the confidential evidence 
against Mr Hmeidan decided to extend his detention until 18 March 2007. When the 
administrative detention order expired on 18 March 2007, it had not been renewed and Mr 
Ziyad Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan had been released accordingly.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 August 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the

Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention 
</b> 
357. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Ahmad Oweidi Abbadi</b>, former Jordanian parliamentarian and human rights 
activist. According to the information received, on 3 May 2007, Mr. Ahmad Oweidi Abbadi 
was arrested after he had accused the Jordanian Government of &#8220;corruption, human rights 
abuses and attacks to the independence of the media&#8221; in an open letter posted in the Internet 
addressed to a US Congressman. Mr. Abbadi was reportedly prosecuted on charges of 
defamation, &#8220;violating laws governing the Internet&#8221; and &#8220;harming the State&#8217;s prestige and 
reputation&#8221;.  
 
358. Mr. Abbadi was a member of parliament from 1989 to 1993, and again from 1997 to 
2001. At the time of writing he headed the Jordanian National Movement, an organisation that 
supports democracy, human rights and political, economic and social reform. Mr. Ahmad </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 99 
 
Oweidi Abbadi was being held at Al-Jwaidah prison. Concern was expressed that his arrest 
may have been related to his legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular to 
his exercise of the rights to freedom of opinion and expression.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 22 June 2007 
 
</b>359. The Government stated that the case of Dr. <b>Ahmad Oweidi Abbadi </b>involved a 
criminal suit filed by an individual, that it was not a case about opinion or freedom of 
expression and that it was not political in nature. The letter further stated that the Minister for 
Internal Affairs had filed the suit in a personal capacity, not in his capacity as a government 
official. The complainant had filed the suit because of allegations which Dr. Ahmad Oweidi 
Abbadi had made against him personally, not because of matters pertaining to his ministerial 
work or the general policies of his Ministry.  
 
360. According to the government letter, the case before the courts was not based on the 
Publications Act, which prohibits detention, but rather on other laws such as the General 
Penal Code and the Electronic Data Act, and as such, it followed that the offence has nothing 
to do with freedom of opinion and of expression. The letter stated that full legal guarantees 
were afforded to this individual during the examination phase, his lawyer was present at all 
times and he was given the right to challenge the detention order before the highest judicial 
authority (the appeal court), which reviewed the case on more than one occasion and decided, 
on the basis of the evidence, that the order issued by the prosecutor general was in conformity 
with the law.  
 
361. Dr. Abbadi had submitted more than one complaint to the authorities, either through his 
lawyers or in person, but made no allegations about being subjected to any violence that 
would justify the conduct of a medical examination. In any case, the law stipulates that a 
medical examination must be given to anyone entering a detention centre: this was done in 
this case; as for the results of the examination, any interested party, including the lawyer for 
the accused, can ask for a copy of the investigation file. 
 
362. The Government further stated that it had no involvement of any kind in the case before 
the judicial authorities. In their view, the detention was not arbitrary; it was lawful, and the 
place of detention was a facility reserved for detainees in which no convicted persons are 
being held. The case was being considered by the courts, which have competence for deciding 
on its merits. No influence was being brought to bear on the conduct of the proceedings

two articles published by Toguzbayev on the site www.kub.kz, to be insulting the honor and 
dignity of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
 
366. In a separate case, the the <b>bi-weekly Uralskaya Nedelya</b> had been unable to find a 
printing house willing to produce the newspaper after the printing company that had printed 
Uralskaya Nedelya since 2001, informed editor-in-chief Tamara Yeslyamova in December 
2006 that they were obliged to rescind the contract, allegedly owing to pressure exercised by

Birimkulov</b>, a TV presenter of programmes &#8220;Journalistic investigation&#8221; and &#8220;Society and 
Law&#8221;, which are broadcasted on the Kyrgyz State TV Channel, who was reportedly assaulted 
on 16 March 2007 by two unknown men who severely beat him with a metal object and 
knuckleduster.  He was left unconscious and later hospitalized in the Chui regional hospital 
and diagnosed with concussion, left arm bone fracture and numerous bruises. The assaulters 
would have taken away the digital camcorder, dictaphone and documents belonging to Mr. 
Birimkulov.  It is reported that on 4 March 2007 Mr. Birimkulov's TV programme focused on 
his investigation about corruption schemes at the Kyrgyz State Railroad Enterprise (KSRE).  
It is also reported that both before and after the assault, Mr. Birimkulov received threats by 
telephone. In addition, two unidentified men in plain clothing would have come to Mr. 
Birimkulov&#8217;s spouse&#8217;s place of employment and told her that if her husband did not quit his 
journalistic activities, their family would be in danger. The two men would have told his 
spouse that they know where their daughters (aged 10 and 8) were studying. Concern was 
expressed that Mr. Birimkulov's assault and further threats to him and his family are directly 
related to Mr. Birimkulov's professional activities as a journalist. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 23 October 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of

Kuleshov was sentenced to 10 days&#8217; imprisonment by the Tokmok city Court for recording 
open discussions that were organised in the local assembly of the city of Tokmok concerning 
a new draft Constitution that will be submitted to referendum on 21 October 2007, and for 
taking photos at this event. Mr. Kuleshov was asked by the Mayor of the city of Tokmok to 
stop taking pictures and recording his speech, stating that he had no right to do it. Mr. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

Kuleshov was removed from the meeting hall by employees of the city hall and arrested by 
plain-clothes officers. Mr. Kuleshov spent three days in detention in Tokmok, but was 
released whe the rest of the sentence was suspended following the filing of a complaint by his 
lawyer before the Tchuyski Regional Court.  
 
370. On 17 October 2007, this same court confirmed the sentence pronounced by the 
Tokmok city Court. Mr. Kuleshov's lawyer filed a new writ before the Supreme Court in 
order for his case to be re-examined. It was reported that Mr. Kuleshov had been defending 
human rights for several years, bringing cases of abuses perpetrated by Tokmok officials to 
administrative justice and cases of torture and ill-treatment to criminal courts. In 2006, he was 
prosecuted for defamation by a representative of the local authorities after organising a public 
awareness campaign against torture. On 12 September 2007, Mr. Kuleshov was informed that 
a litigation case against him had begun, when a deputy of the Tokmok city hall initiated 
judicial proceedings against him accusing Mr. Kuleshov of harming his honour and 
professional reputation. Mr. Kuleshov had lodged a complaint some months ago accusing Mr. 
Kadyrkulov of breaching the Kyrgyz law on freedom of access to information.

political demonstration in Tripoli, as well as `<b>Abd al-Rahman al-Qotaiwi </b>and<b> Jum`a 
Boufayed</b>, who had disappeared since their arrest in connection with the same demonstration. 
According to the information received, the fourteen men listed above were arrested on 15 and 
16 February 2007 for organizing a demonstration in Tripoli, aiming at marking the first 
anniversary of the death of eleven people in a clash with the police on 17 February 2006 
during a protest against the publication of the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a Danish 
newspaper. Twelve of the fourteen men detained were on trial for planning to overthrow the 
government, possession of arms, and meeting with an official from a foreign government. 
According to Articles 166, 167 and 206 of the Libyan Constitution, these men could be 
sentenced to death. `Abd al-Rahman al-Qotaiwi and Jum`a Boufayed, who were arrested as 
organizers of the demonstration, had disappeared since their arrest and not been brought to 
court. The Rapporteurs expressed concerns that the arrest and disappearance of the above 
mentioned persons might be linked to their activities in defense of human rights. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 5 November 2007 
 
</b>378. In its response, the Government informs that the persons mentioned in the 
communication were accused of committing acts that are punishable under Libyan law. They 
were charged and brought before the competent court of appeal to be tried pursuant to article 
2, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), of Revolution Command Council Decree No. 71 of 1972, 
concerning unlawful political activities; articles 178, 196, 206 (32), 207, 211 (1), (2) and (3), 
and 345 (1), of the Libyan Criminal Code; article 195, as amended, of Act No. 80 of the year 
1327 MWR (from the death of the Prophet); articles 1, 2, and 3 (1), of Act No. 7 of 1981, </p>

1423 MWR, concerning the prohibition of alcohol, as amended in 1425 MWR. The case was 
heard by the court during four sessions, the last of which was held on 4 August 2007. No 
criminal verdict was handed down in the case. The court applies the Code of Criminal 
Procedures and the Libyan Criminal Code to the defendants.  
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
379. On 11 October 2007, the Government replied to an allegation letter sent on 3 February 
2006 by the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the 
Independent Expert on minority issues concerning legislation that allegedly prevents people 
from using any language other than Arabic, tribal names and forbids all literature and writings 
that are not in Arabic. In its reply, the Government that the information provided is an 
unreliable account devoid of objectivity and impartiality provided by some individuals. The 
Government further noted that it is untrue that people are prevented from using their tribal 
names. According to Decision No. 3 of 2007 issued by the Secretariat of the General People&#8217;s 
Committee and judgments handed down in implementation of Act No. (24) 1369 MWR [from 
the death of the Prophet], it is permitted to register the names of ascendants, names conveying 
meanings that are authentically Libyan or names that are passed down from ascendants to 
descendants in keeping with recognized Libyan traditions and customs.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 21 June 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders  
</b> 
381. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr <b>Nyam Kee Han</b>, Coordinator and Mr <b>See Siew Min</b>, member 
of the secretariat of Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM) in Johor. SURAM is a well known 
human rights organization which monitors and documents human rights violations. According 
to information received, on 17 June 2007, at approximately 11:30am, Mr Nyam and Mr See 
were arrested by members of the Johor Bahru police force during a peaceful demonstration 
outside the residence of the Chief Minister (Menteri Besar) of Jahor State, calling on the 
government official to take measures to reduce crime rates in the State. At the time of their 
arrest, Mr Nyam and Mr See were distributing leaflets to encourage the immediate 
establishment of an Independent Police Complaint and Misconduct Commission, in line with 
one of 125 recommendations put forward by the Royal Commission on police reform.  
 
382. According to reports, Mr Nyam and Mr See appeared before the Magistrates Court on 
18 June 2007 where the police were granted a 24-hour remand order. Mr Nyam and Mr See 
were being detained at Johor Bahru (Selatan) Police Station and at time of writing, no official 
charges had been issued against them.  </p>

<b>Response from the Government sent on 8 August 2007 
 
</b>383. In its response, the Government stated that the aforementioned persons had been 
arrested during an assembly which was unlawful, as no permit to hold a gathering had been 
obtained. The two activists had been arrested on suspicion of distribution of leaflets of a 
seditious nature and were and upon arrest, these documents were seized from them. The 
government letter further stated that the participants had been instructed to disperse shortly 
before being arrested. Following their 24 &#8211;hour remand, both men were released and no 
charges were brought against them. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 27 December 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders 
</b> 
384. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information concerning the recent wave of arrests and detention of a number of ethnic Indian 
human rights defenders. According to information received, on 13 December 2007, five ethnic 
Indian human rights defenders members of the Hindu Human Rights Action Force 
(HINDRAF) &#8211;<b> P. Uthayakumar</b>, <b>M. Manoharan</b>, <b>R. Kenghadharan</b>, <b>V. Ganabatirau</b> and 
<b>T. Vasanthakumar</b> &#8211; were arrested by Special Branch police officers while carrying out non-
violent demonstrations at various locations in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Seremban. Their 
arrests were carried out on the basis of Section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act (ISA) for 
allegedly carrying out activities that threaten national security. They are currently being 
detained in Kamunting Detention Centre in Perak in Bukit Aman. The ISA allows persons to 
be detained for any period not exceeding two years. The five human rights defenders 
concerned were not presented with an arrest warrant; neither were they brought before a 
tribunal or given access to legal counsel.  
 
385. Moreover, on 25 November, police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse between 
8,000 and 10,000 persons of Indian ethnic origin attending a peaceful rally organized by 
HINDRAF to protest against alleged discrimination practices against ethnic Indians in 
Malaysia. The objective of this rally was also to request compensation for the suffering 
caused to their ancestors who were brought from India as labourers in the 19th century. Thirty 
one of the protestors were charged with attempted murder and causing mischief while others 
were charged with illegal assembly.  
 
386. On the eve of this rally, over 2,000 persons of ethnic Indian origin who were assembled 
in a Hindu temple in Batu Caves on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, were reportedly beaten by 
approximately 300 police officers with a view to dissuading those assembled from attending 
the rally being organized by HINDRAF on 25 November 2007. The police officers also used 
tear gas and water cannons, spraying a liquid chemical irritating to the eyes and skin. Around 
70 persons who attempted to escape were arrested. Many were charged with attending an 
illegal assembly and failing to obey police orders. 
 
387. In addition, on 23 November, V. Ganapathy Rao, P.Uthayakumar, and P. Wyatha 
Moorthy, all HINDRAF officials, were arrested and charged with sedition for speeches 
allegedly inciting hatred delivered in a restaurant in Batang Berjuntai, Selangor, on 16 
November. P. Wyatha Moorthy was remanded in custody while V. Ganapathy Rao, and P. 
Uthayakumar were released on bail. Finally, on 21 November 2007, again reportedly with the </p>

objective of preventing HINDRAF&#8217;s plans to organize the same rally of 25 November 2007, 
police officers set up checkpoints on all roads leading to Kuala Lumpur and prevented many 
ethnic Indians, who are not residents of the capital, from entering the city. 
 
<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications</b> 
 
388. On 10 January 2007, the Government replied to the communication of 4 March 2005 
concerning the investigation of Mr. <b>Jeff Ooi</b>, a blogger who was reportedly under 
investigation for fostering religious disunity due to a posting on his Screenshots blog. The 
Government informed that the investigation carried out in this case was related to a person 
referred to as &#8220;Anwar&#8221; who posted offensive comments in Mr. Ooi&#8217;s blog. Interrogations 
carried out on Mr. Ooe were only insofar as to assist in investigations and he was never 
detained. Due to insufficient evidence linking the comments with Mr. Ooi, he was not charged 
with any offence. 
 
389. On 29 May 2007, the Government replied to the communication of 30 June 2005 
concerning the arrest of 64 Myanmar nationals outside the compound of the Embassy of 
Myanmar in Kuala Lumpur on 16 June 2005. The Government informed that on the date in 
question, 64 Myanmar citizens staged a demonstration without permit in front of the 
Myanmar Embassy, calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and shouting in the direction 
of the Embassy. The Officer-in-Charge of the Pudu Police Station (OCS)  informed the 
protesters that they could submit any protest note or request to the Embassy within the 
following 15 to 20 minutes. After 20 minutes had passed, the OCS warned the protestors to 
disperse or to face arrest. Since there was no cooperation by the protestors and the protest 
took place without there being a valid license to hold such an assembly, as stipulated under 
Section 27(2) of the Police Act of 1967, the protesters were arrested and taken to the Pudu 
Police Station for further investigation. Four other citizens who were behaving suspiciously in 
front of the Police Station were detained and found to be in possession of t-shirts calling for 
the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. As the police was unable to complete the investigation 
within 24 hours, an order of further detention was granted by a Magistrate for a period of 14 
days, under Section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Code. On 28 June 2005, the 64 protestors 
were charged under section 27(4) and 27(5) of the Police Act 1967 and section 6(19)(c) of the 
Immigration Act 1959/63. On 21 December 2005, 27 of the accused pleaded guilty to all 
charges and were sentenced to three months imprisonment. The remaining persons were 
charged on 7 March before the Magistrate&#8217;s Court and two of them before the Juvenile Court. 
With regard to another two persons, an order was given to the Investigating Officer to get 
validation from UNHCR on their status as they were holders of UNHCR cards. 
 
390. On 29 May 2007, the Government also responded to a communication sent jointly by 
the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human 
rights defenders on 18 July 2006. The Government informed that the right of every Malaysian 
citizen to freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed by article 10(1) of the Federal 
Constitution, the highest authority and source of law in Malaysia. This provision is in line 
with Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. When elaborated in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression was subject to the following limitation, that &#8220;&#8230; in the exercise of his rights and 
freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely 
for the purpose of &#8230; meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general 
welfare in a democratic society&#8221;. In line with this, the Constitutional guarantee of the right to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 106 
 
freedom of opinion and expression in Malaysia is subjected to the same limitations. Article 
10(2) of the Constitution states that Parliament may by law impose restrictions on these rights 
in the interest of the security of the Federation, friendly relations with other countries, public 
order and morality. 
 
391. In Malaysia, all matters relating to the use of printing presses and the printing, 
importation, production, publishing and distribution of materials are regulated by the Printing 
Presses and Publications Act 1984 (hereinafter referred to as the PPPA). Under Section 7(1) 
of the PPPA, it allows for the banning of a publication which is prejudicial or likely to be 
prejudicial to public order, morality, security, the relationship with any foreign country or 
government, or which is likely to alarm public opinion, or which is likely to be contrary to 
any law or is otherwise prejudicial to public or national interest. 
 
392. The publication of 18 books of various titles was banned by the Malaysian authorities 
as the content of the books were found to be inaccurate and contradicting the true teaching of 
Islam. Such deviations may be prejudicial to public order and security. The Government also 
attached a list of the banned publications. In essence, these publications contain one or more 
of the following elements: (a) Theories, ideologies, statements or opinions with the purpose to 
influence readers on their aqidah (faith), laws and teachings which contradict with the Ahl 
Sunnah Wal-Jamaah, observed by Muslims in Malaysia; (b) Caricatures or illustrations of 
Prophets, the Four Caliphs and Angels, which are forbidden in Islam; (c) Articles and alleged 
facts which conflict with the historical facts of Islam and its Ummah, as agreed by Islamic 
historians; (d) Elements of Isra&#8217;iliyat &#8211; tales with ludicrous cultures, which are forbidden in 
Islam; (e) Quranic writings in languages other than Arabic, which may lead to different 
interpretations of their true meaning. 
 
393. The Government stated that publications which are in conflict with the true teachings of 
Islam, if it is made available to the public without a certain amount of regulation, would 
create confusion and misunderstanding about the religion. This could lead to the 
establishment of deviant movements, which in turn could cause apprehension, stir strong 
emotional reactions and create a detrimental environment within a plural society. The 
provisions contained in relevant domestic legislation seek to ensure that Malaysia&#8217;s multi-
ethnic and multi-religious society continues to grow and thrive without unnecessary friction 
caused by virtue of insensitive and irresponsible publications. The Government maintained 
that the action it has taken in this matter is in full compliance with the provisions of relevant 
domestic legislation and in keeping with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights.

</p>
<p>mensajes solicitando que se cerrara la Radio Calenda por la cobertura informativa que 
lleva a cabo sobre el conflicto de la entidad. Seg&#250;n informes, Radio Ciudadana es una 
estaci&#243;n de radio que transmite sin autorizaci&#243;n de la Secretar&#237;a de Comunicaciones y 
Transportes en la Ciudad de Oaxaca, y que supuestamente se ha dedicado a incitar a  
militantes del Partido Institucional Revolucionario (PRI) y otros a agredir a los 
simpatizantes de la APPO. Entre la noche del 24 y la madrugada del 25 de enero de 
2007, se suscit&#243; un enfrentamiento entre un grupo de militantes del PRI e integrantes 
del ayuntamiento popular de San Antonino de Velasco, en el estado de Oaxaca. 
Durante los hechos, el Sr. Ambrosio y el Sr. Campos fueron fuertemente golpeados y 
uno de ellos detenido, a pesar de que se identificaron plenamente como periodistas en 
funciones. Asimismo otras doce personas de la comunidad fueron detenidas. Seg&#250;n 
informes, el periodista detenido fue puesto en libertad. Se teme que el Sr. Santiago 
pueda perder un ojo debido a las lesiones recibidas. Al parecer, la represi&#243;n la llevaron 
a cabo personas cercanas al presidente municipal y polic&#237;as ministeriales. Existen 
serios temores por la seguridad e integridad f&#237;sica de los periodistas miembros de la 
Radio Calenda y se teme que las amenazas y agresiones sufridas est&#225;n relacionadas 
con su trabajo como periodistas. 
</p>
<p> 
- En un incidente separado, el 20 de Enero de 2007, el periodista Rodolfo Rinc&#243;n 
</p>
<p>Taracena desapareci&#243; en Villahermosa. Se teme que su desaparici&#243;n est&#233; relacionada 
con su trabajo como periodista, principalmente con dos reportajes que el periodista 
acababa de firmar, uno sobre los puntos de venta de droga en los barrios de Atasta y 
Tamult&#233;, en Villahermosa a ra&#237;z de los cuales hab&#237;a dado los nombres de algunos 
traficantes, y el otro sobre los atracos de bancos.

Ortega</b>, periodista mexicano y editor del peri&#243;dico Interdiario de Agua Prieta. El 23 de abril 
de 2007, el Sr. Mart&#237;nez Ortega fue hallado muerto en el estado de Chihuahua. Seg&#250;n 
informes, &#233;l hab&#237;a sido secuestrado durante la noche del 16 de abril de 2007 a la entrada del 
edificio de la polic&#237;a municipal de Agua Prieta, una ciudad en el estado de Sonora cerca a la </p>

frontera con Arizona. El Sr. Mart&#237;nez Ortega habr&#237;a estado investigando la desaparici&#243;n de un 
amigo quien entregaba informes a la polic&#237;a municipal. Se teme que su muerte est&#233; 
relacionada con su trabajo period&#237;stico sobre este caso. 
 
<b>Respuesta del Gobierno enviada el 5 de julio 
</b> 
403. El Gobierno inform&#243; que las investigaciones de este caso a&#250;n se encontraban abiertas, 
sendo imposible determinar si la muerte del Sr. Mart&#237;nez Ortega se encuentra relacionada con 
su trabajo period&#237;stico. El Gobierno transmiti&#243; informaciones detalladas sobre las 
circunstancias de la desaparici&#243;n del Sr. Mart&#237;nez Ortega. Su esposa inform&#243; que el Sr. 
Mart&#237;nez Ortega era el &#250;nico periodista que investigaba la desaparici&#243;n de su amigo Juan 
Carlos &#193;lvarez S&#225;nchez y que no ten&#237;a conocimiento de que le hubieran amenazado con 
anterioridad, pero que a partir de la desaparici&#243;n de su amigo, no quer&#237;a que su familia 
anduviera con &#233;l. Diversas diligencias est&#225;n previstas para la investigaci&#243;n del caso. El 18 de 
abril de 2007, se envi&#243; copia de la Averiguaci&#243;n Previa al Agente de Ministerio Publico 
especializado en los delitos cometidos contra periodistas. Los familiares no hab&#237;an solicitado 
ni recibido compensaci&#243;n a modo de indemnizaci&#243;n. 
 
<b>Llamamiento urgente enviado el 31 de mayo

404. El 31 de mayo de 2007, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con el 
Sr. <b>Terencio Sastr&#233; Hidalgo</b>, delegado municipal de El Cedro, y el diario Tabasco Hoy, de 
Villahermosa. El 27 de mayo de 2007 unos individuos depositaron la cabeza cortada del Sr. 
Hidalgo, delegado municipal del El Cedro, municipio de Nacajuca dentro de una nevera frente 
a la puerta del diario Tabasco Hoy. El Sr. Hidalgo, seg&#250;n informaciones, habr&#237;a sido 
asesinado el 25 de mayo de 2007 por un comando armado. Seg&#250;n parece, el Sr. Sastr&#233; habr&#237;a 
denunciado a un asesino a sueldo relacionado con el grupo de narcotraficantes &#8220;Los Zetas&#8221;. 
Se teme que esta amenaza contra el diario Tabasco Hoy pueda estar relacionada con ciertos 
art&#237;culos publicados sobre el tr&#225;fico de drogas. 
 
<b>Carta de alegaciones enviada el 5 de septiembre de 2007 
</b> 
405. El Relator Especial envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con el Sr. <b>Reynaldo 
Hern&#225;ndez</b> y otros miembros del Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores Mineros Metal&#250;rgicos 
de M&#233;xico (SNTMM). Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 11 de agosto de 2007, un grupo 
de ex-mineros de la mina &#8220;La Caridad&#8221; de Nacozari, Sonora, pertenecientes a SNTMM, 
habr&#237;an sido atacados con golpes y armas de fuego en la carretera de Nacozari, en las 
inmediaciones de la empresa &#8220;Mexicana de Cobre&#8221;, propietaria de dicha mina. El grupo de 
ex-mineros, despedidos a ra&#237;z de una huelga ocurrida en el a&#241;o 2006, se dirig&#237;a a una 
manifestaci&#243;n por la reinstalaci&#243;n de la mina cuando habr&#237;an sido atacados por trabajadores 
de la empresa Mexicana de Cobre. Como resultado de las agresiones, el Sr. Hern&#225;ndez, uno 
de los manifestantes, habr&#237;a resultado muerto. Al parecer, los agresores golpearon a los 
manifestantes con distintos instrumentos y les cortaron el paso con varios veh&#237;culos cuando 
aqu&#233;llos intentaban huir. Uno o varios agresores habr&#237;an disparado contra los ex trabajadores, 
habiendo alcanzado quedando &#233;ste muerto. La persecuci&#243;n habr&#237;a continuado hasta el rancho 
de Agua Zarca, donde vecinos y familiares habr&#237;an intentado auxiliar a los agredidos, 
llamando a los n&#250;meros de emergencia. Seg&#250;n fuentes, las autoridades policiales no tomaron 
ninguna medida, siendo que en la comandancia de Barandilla habr&#237;an negado el env&#237;o de 
patrullas. Autoridades pol&#237;ticas interpeladas se habr&#237;an negado a recibir a los familiares. </p>

<b>Respuesta del Gobierno enviada el 31 de octubre de 2007 
</b> 
406. El Gobierno inform&#243; que el 11 de agosto de 2007, la Procuradoria General de Justicia 
del estado de Sonora inici&#243; la averiguaci&#243;n por el delito de homicidio simple doloso con 
motivo de muerte del Sr. Gonz&#225;lez. De las testimoniales, se desprende que tres 
enfrentamientos diferentes ocurrieron alrededor de las instalaciones de la mina &#8220;La Caridad&#8221;, 
entre grupos de obreros y ex-obreros. Las lesiones que originaron que el Sr. Hern&#225;ndez 
perdiera la vida fueron ocasionadas en el tercer enfrentamiento, cuando otras 30 personas 
resultaran heridas. No habr&#237;a existido actos de omisi&#243;n de las autoridades p&#250;blicas, una vez 
que los cuerpos de emergencia de Nacozari de Garc&#237;a, en Sonora, intervinieron en la atenci&#243;n 
de los de los lesionados una vez que la polic&#237;a municipal tuvo controlada la situaci&#243;n. 
Asimismo, la poblaci&#243;n m&#225;s cercana al lugar de los hechos est&#225; a 23 kil&#243;metros, y la Agencia 
del Ministerio P&#250;blico m&#225;s cercana est&#225; a 66 kil&#243;metros del lugar de los hechos. Ser&#237;a falso el 
hecho de que el Sr. Gonz&#225;lez hubiera fallecido por un disparo de arma de fuego de la 
autoridad polic&#237;aca, toda vez que su muerte, como indico la necropsia, se origin&#243; por el 
impacto de un objeto o proyectil irregular, probablemente una piedra. El Gobernador del 
estado de Sonora solicit&#243; la intervenci&#243;n de la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos 
(CNDH) para las diversas diligencias.

<b>Llamamiento urgente enviado el 26 de noviembre de 2007 con la Representante Especial del 
Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos  
</b> 
409. El Relator Especial y la Representante Especial se&#241;alaron a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su 
Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con graduados de una escuela universitaria de 
magisterio con sede en Ayotzinapa, municipio de Tuxtla, estado de Guerrero, y miembros de 
la Federaci&#243;n de Estudiantes Campesinos Socialistas de M&#233;xico (FECSM), una organizaci&#243;n 
no gubernamental que se dedica a la promoci&#243;n y la protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos de 
estudiantes y campesinos. 
 
410. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el d&#237;a 14 de noviembre del 2007, alrededor de 800 
manifestantes habr&#237;an caminado hasta el edificio del Congreso estatal de Guerrero, en la 
capital, para protestar contra violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas hacia estudiantes y 
campesinos. Seg&#250;n fuentes, los manifestantes habr&#237;an permanecido enfrente del edificio del 
Congreso hasta las cinco de la tarde. Las autoridades habr&#237;an considerado la protesta como un 
obst&#225;culo al acceso al edificio y, a las cinco de la tarde, centenares de polic&#237;as estatales 
habr&#237;an rodeado la zona  y habr&#237;an dispersado a los manifestantes de forma brusca. Algunos 
de los manifestantes se refugiaron en el interior del Congreso y otros huyeron, mientras la 
polic&#237;a, seg&#250;n los informes, les echaba gas lacrim&#243;geno y los golpeaba con porras. Se alega 
que m&#225;s de 200 manifestantes habr&#237;an resultado heridos y que al menos una persona habr&#237;a 
sufrido lesiones graves en la cabeza. Seg&#250;n fuentes, seis manifestantes habr&#237;an sido detenidos 
y, posteriormente, liberados sin cargos el mismo d&#237;a. Un reducido n&#250;mero de personas que 
participaban en la manifestaci&#243;n se habr&#237;a comportado de forma violencia durante la misma, 
echando piedras y c&#243;cteles molotov, aunque la mayor&#237;a participaba de forma pac&#237;fica.

</b> 
411. Por carta del 7 de mayo de 2007, el Gobierno transmiti&#243; la siguiente informaci&#243;n en 
relaci&#243;n con la Sra. Mar&#237;a del Carmen L&#243;pez Vel&#225;squez, locutora de la Radio Universidad en 
Oaxaca, que habr&#237;a sido atacada por hombres armados el 22 de Julio de 2006. Las protestas 
para aumento salarial, organizadas por la Secci&#243;n XXII-SNTE y la Asamblea Popular de los 
Pueblos de Oaxaca (APPO), pasaron a ser actos primordialmente pol&#237;ticos, con la exigencia 
de destituir el gobernador. Los actos de protesta de las dos organizaciones se radicalizaron y 
transgredieron a la ley, y en este contexto ocurri&#243; el ataque en contra la Sra. Vel&#225;squez. 
Conforme al ordenamiento legal aplicable en el Estado de Oaxaca, son los directamente 
afectados por este tipo de hechos quienes pueden denunciarlos ante la autoridad ministerial, 
situaci&#243;n que no ocurri&#243; en este caso. El 22 de julio de 2006, se inici&#243; de oficio una 
averiguaci&#243;n previa (1296/PME/2006) y se determin&#243; la realizaci&#243;n de una diligencia de 
inspecci&#243;n ocular, la cual no se pudo concretar debido a la presencia de manifestantes en el 
local. Para continuar las investigaciones, la autoridad ministerial cit&#243; al Subdirector de la 
Radio Universidad y al Rector de la Universidad Aut&#243;noma Benito Ju&#225;rez de Oaxaca para que 
se declaren con relaci&#243;n a estos hechos. Las investigaciones contin&#250;an en tr&#225;mite. Cuando se 
concluyan, ser&#225; posible determinar lo conducente en lo que se refiere a la compensaci&#243;n a las

proporcionar los n&#250;meros de las patrullas o la media filiaci&#243;n de las personas que los 
agredieron, lo que ha complicado la identificaci&#243;n de los presuntos culpables. La Secretar&#237;a de

</b>quienes habr&#237;an sido detenidos el 2 de noviembre de 2006 en la ciudad de Oaxaca. El contexto 
en que se suscitaron los hechos tuvo sus or&#237;genes en mayo de 2006, con una petici&#243;n de 
aumento salarial planteada por la Secci&#243;n XXII-SNTE y m&#225;s tarde apoyada por la Asamblea

conmin&#243; las organizaciones  Secci&#243;n XII y APPO a cumplir los compromisos adquiridos para 
alcanzar la normalidad en la capital de Oaxaca mediante la acci&#243;n de la polic&#237;a local bajo un 
mando federal. Ante el incumpliendo de dichos acuerdos, el Gobierno Federal exigi&#243; la 
entrega inmediata de las zonas bajo el control de dichas organizaciones para preservar el 
pleno respeto a las garant&#237;as individuales de la poblaci&#243;n de Oaxaca. El 28 de octubre de 
2006, el Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica orden&#243; la movilizaci&#243;n de fuerzas federales a esa ciudad, 
fundament&#225;ndose, entre otras razones, en la necesidad de restablecer el orden, la solicitud de 
apoyo de la fuerza p&#250;blica por las autoridades locales, la presencia de grupos radicales que 
pusieron en riesgo la tranquilidad de la ciudadan&#237;a y la necesidad de brindar protecci&#243;n 
suficiente a los ni&#241;os, ni&#241;as y maestros que ratificaron su decisi&#243;n de regresar a clases. El 
Gobierno federal determin&#243; que la presencia de las fuerzas federales solo ser&#237;a por el tiempo 
que fuere necesario, sin apoyar a ninguna de las partes en conflicto y para restablecer el 
orden. El empleo de la fuerza p&#250;blica es un recurso leg&#237;timo que no implica coartar la libertad 
de expresi&#243;n y el derecho de manifestarse. En las fuerzas federales no hubo elementos 
militares ni se utilizaron tanquetas. Las detenciones efectuadas estuvieron fundadas en la

situation of <b>Mr. Min Kyi, Mr. Myint Oo, Maw Si, Mr. Naing Oo (a) Tote Gyi, and four 
other persons</b>, whose identities have yet to be established, who organised a public literacy 
seminar in a Buddhist monastery in the city of Paungtalei, were arrested under Emergency

the seminar. They were detained at the Sitlone military security camp in the city of 
Mingyitaung near Pyi at the time the communication was sent and no charges had been made 
against them. Concern was expressed that the above mentioned persons have solely been 
arrested and detained in connection with the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of 
opinion and expression. 
 
428. Mr. Min Kyi was already the subject of a letter of allegation sent on 21 July 2004 by

appeals have remained without a reply from your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 18 May 2007 with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working 
Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
in Myanmar and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights

429. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of 38 human rights defenders, <b>Mr Thant Zin Myo, Ms Hla Hla Maw, Mr Yan

the subject matter of Opinion No. 4/2006 adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention on 9 May 2006, in which it held upon the facts of the matter that had been 
submitted that &#8220;[t]he detention of Ms. Su Su Nway is arbitrary, being in contravention of 
articles 9, 10 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and falls within 
categories II and III of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases submitted to the 
Working Group.&#8221;  
 
430. According to the information received, on 15 May 2007, 38 human rights defenders 
were reportedly arrested -and some physically assaulted- in Yangon by members of the police 
force, members of the Union Solidarity and Development Association and members of the 
Swann Arr Shin, while demonstrating for the release from house arrest of Ms Aung San Suu 
Kyi. Some of the aforementioned were arrested at Mikwet Market, Tadaphyu bus station in 
Hlaingthaya on their way to Shwedagon Pagoda; others were arrested at Arlein Ngasint 
Pagoda on their way to Kyauktawgyi Pagoda.  
 
431. According to reports, all these persons were being held at the Kyaik Ka San 
interrogation camp in Tharmwe Township. Serious concern was expressed that the arrest and 
detention of the aforementioned persons may have been solely related to their non-violent 
activities in defence of human rights in Myanmar.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 9 July 2007 
 
</b>432. The Government stated that on 15 May 2007 at 07.00, Maung Thant Zin Myo was 
walking from Bo Aung Kyaw Road, Hlaing Thar Yar Township, toward Shwe Dagon Pagoda, 
along with 11 other people, all of whom were wearing red t-shirts and holding red roses and 
other flowers. The letter further stated that while. on their way, a group wishing to avoid 
violence attempted to stop them. However, they refused to stop and were eventually taken by 
the same group and handed over to the relevant authorities.  </p>

433. On the same day, at 09.30, Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min as well as other members of NLD 
gathered in front of a motel in Insein Township. They were wearing t-shirts with Daw Aung 
San Suu Kyi&#8217;s photo. Su Su New later joined them. There followed a quarrel between 
photographers and cameramen wishing to record the event and NLD members. Then Su Su 
Nwe and the rest of the group walked to Kyauktawgyi Pagoda. They were again stopped by

</b>434. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Ms <b>Phyu Phyu Thin</b>, a prominent HIV/AIDS activist and member of the 
National League for Democracy (NLD), founded by Nobel Peace Laureate, Ms Aung San Suu 
Kyi. Ms Phyu Phyu Thin also dedicates much of her time to caring for those with HIV/AIDS 
at her home in Yangon, Rangoon and assists with counseling, housing and arranging access to 
medical treatment. According to information received, on 21 May 2007, Ms Phyu Phyu Thin 
was arrested whilst attending a prayer service for the release of NLD leader Ms Aung San Suu 
Kyi in Yangon. Ms Phyu Phyu Thin&#8217;s family was apparently informed by sources of where 
she was being detained and of the fact that she had initiated a hunger strike on 18 June 2007, 
however authorities had refused to divulge the exact location of her detention.. Ms Phyu Phyu 
Thin suffers from asthma and her family had been unable to contact her directly since her 
arrest. She had reportedly also been denied medical assistance.  
 
435. According to reports, in January 2007, Ms Phyu Phyu Thin publicly protested against 
the lack of antiretroviral drugs being administered to HIV/AIDS patients in Rangoon 
hospitals. In an interview prior to her detention she also suggested that mortality rates among 
HIV/AIDS patients in Myanmar were much higher than official statistics claimed. In 2000, 
Ms Phyu Phyu Thin was arrested and detained during a period of four months whilst traveling 
with NLD leader Ms Aung San Suu Kyi. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned 
events form part of an ongoing campaign against human rights defenders in Myanmar. 
Further concern was expressed for the health of Ms Phyu Phyu Thin, in light of reports that 
she had been on hunger strike since 18 June 2007 and that she had been denied medical 
assistance.<b>

activists and members of the 1988 Generation Students Group.  
 
442. According to information received, on 13 October 2007, in the early hours of the 
morning, approximately seventy members of the security forces reportedly broke into the 
house where Mr Htay Kywe, Ms Mie Mie and Mr Aung Thu were staying. The officers 
arrested all three, as well as the owner of the house and two other members of the 1988 
Generation Students Group who were also present. Mr Htay Kywe, Ms Mie Mie and Mr 
Aung Thu were initially involved in protests in August 2007. However, once the authorities 
began searching for the members of the 1988 Generation Students Group, they went into 
hiding.  
 
443. On 21 August 2007, thirteen activists who were members of the 1988 Generation

are unknown. Before his arrest Mr Htay Kywe was in poor health. Mr Htay Kywe, Ms Mie 
Mie and Mr Aung Thu had all been previously arrested by the authorities under national 
security provisions criminalizing peaceful protest. Concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned arrest and subsequent detention of Mr Htay Kywe, Ms Mie Mie and Mr Aung 
Thu may have been directly related to their human rights activities, in particular their criticism 
of the current regime in Myanmar through peaceful protest. In view of the alleged detention

Lwin are, respectively, the brother and father, of Mr U Gambira. Ms Su Su Nway is also a 
human rights activist, campaigning for workers&#8217; rights in Myanmar.  
 
446. According to reports received, Mr U Gambira was allegedly charged with treason due 
to his leading role in the August demonstrations, for which he faced either life imprisonment 
or the death penalty. His name also reportedly appeared on a list of individuals wanted by the 
authoritiesand so, he consequently went into hiding. He then published an article indicating 
that hundreds of monks and nuns have been beaten and arrested, that thousands of clergy have </p>

Lwin, were arrested in October 2007 in an attempt to force him out of his hiding. Both Mr 
Aung Kyaw Kyaw and Mr Min Lwin were still being detained at time of writing. Ms Su Su 
Nway was arrested on 13 November 2007, during the visit of the UN Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in Myanmar. Ms Su Su Nway was reportedly arrested in the city 
of Yangon following an attempt to distribute leaflets near the hotel where the Special

50-51). Ms Su Su Nway was released in June 2006. Concern was expressed that the arrests of 
Mr U Gambira, Mr Aung Kyaw Kyaw, Mr Min Lwin and Ms Su Su Nway were a result of 
the human rights activities of Mr U Gambira and Ms Su Su Nway, in particular their work to 
defend the right to freedom of expression in Myanmar. Further concern was expressed for the

member of the Central Committee of the Press Chautari Nepal and a correspondent for Nepal 
FM, the Drishti Weekly and Avenues TV; as well as regarding the abduction of Mr Ram Dev 
Das, the editor of the Terai Khabar Weekly magazine. The letter was also sent in relation to 
information received regarding fourteen journalists who were allegedly arrested in a

463. According to information received, on 5 October 2007, at approximately 5.30 pm, Mr. 
Birendra Shah and Mr. Ram Dev Das were driving a motorcycle in the Bara district when 
they were stopped by unidentified men and taken to an unknown location near the Tripura 
Bazaar, where they were detained. On 8 October, Mr. Ram Dev Das was released alone from 
the location and moved to Kathmandu. He was subsequently the subject of death threats, 
allegedly due to speaking publicly about his abduction. Mr. Birendra Shah and his family had 
reportedly received death threats from members of the CPN-Maoist in August 2007. He has 
been very active in documenting human rights violations carried out by extremist Maoist 
groups in Nepal and has written several reports on the subject. According to the information 
received, a report that was released on 5 November by a Maoist committee investigating the </p>

abduction claimed that Mr. Birendra Shah had been killed on the day of his abduction. 
According to the report, the perpetrators and organizers of said abduction and subsequent 
murder were known. It was reported that Mr. Birendra Shah&#8217;s body was found on 8 
November at the Dumarwana village, near Tangiya colony at Bara district, about 160 
kilometers south of Kathmandu. Information was also received of arrests conducted during a 
peaceful sit-in organized prior to the announcement of Mr. Birendra Shah&#8217;s death.

arrested the aforementioned fourteen participating journalists, who were reportedly injured 
during the police actions. The fourteen journalists were detained at the Mahendra Police Club 
in Kathmandu and released later that day. Concern was expressed that the reported killing of 
Mr. Birendra Sah and the abduction of Mr Ram Dev Das may have been directly related to 
their human rights activities, in particular Mr Birendra Sah&#8217;s work to defend the freedom of 
the press and report human rights violations in Nepal. Further concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr Birendra Sah&#8217;s family members.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 9 March 2007 with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on human rights defenders 
</b> 
474. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr. <b>Anyakwee Nsirimovu</b>, Executive Director of the Institute 
for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law (IHRHL) in Rivers State. IHRHL works to promote 
human rights, democracy and social justice in local communities of the Niger delta region. 
According to the information received, on 2 March 2007, Mr Nsirimovu reportedly received 
anonymous text messages on his mobile, threatening him and his family and urging him to 
stop his human rights activities. The messages stated &#8220;&quot;Did I steal your money? Did I kill 
your wife? Did I kill your children? Stop doing what you are doing&#8221; and &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to 
talk to you, you either repent or not&#8221;. These threats were believed to be related to the 
publication in February 2007 by IHRHL of a document in which it questioned the state 
government's allocation of funds with regards to the Rivers State budget expenditure. 
Moreover, IHRHL published a newsletter which presented the report of the international non-
governmental organization Human Rights Watch, entitled Chop Fine: The Human Rights 
Impact of Local Government Corruption and Mismanagement in Rivers State, Nigeria.  
 
475. On 4 March, Mr Nsirimovu was reportedly attacked by unknown assailants near the 
city of Port Harcourt when driving back from a meeting during which he referred to the 
threats that he had received. When attempting to stop the car, the assailants smashed the rear 
windscreen. Mr Nsirimovu managed to drive away and neither he nor his passenger was 
injured. This attack was reportedly premeditated since Mr Nsirimovu&#8217;s car was the only one 
targeted on the busy street where the incident occurred. Concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned acts of intimation against Mr Nsirimovu may have been related to his 
peaceful and legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular his public 
denunciation of alleged corruption in the state government. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 25 May 2007 with the Special Representative of the Secretary-

</b> 
476. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr. <b>Kola Olabisi</b>, editor of the privately-owned weekly Osun 
Defender, Mr. <b>Sola Jacobs</b>, reporter, and Mr. <b>Amitolu Shittu</b>, a human rights activist and 
president of the Committee for Democracy and Rights of the People. According to the 
information received, on 16 May 2007, warrants for the arrest of the aforementioned were 
issued by a court in Oshogbo. Reportedly, these warrants were in response to a 14 May 2007 
report in the Osun Defender about a news conference that Mr. Shittu gave in which he 
condemned irregularities in a trial of demonstrators who had protested against the alleged 
rigging of the 14 April 2007 presidential election. According to information, all three men had 
been in hiding since the warrants were issued.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 March 2007 with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</b></p>
<p> 
478. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of demonstrators, including <b>lawyers</b> from the prime bar associations,<b> political 
activists, civil society actors </b>and<b> members of the public</b>, engaged since 13 March 2007 in 
protests against the decision of the President of Pakistan to suspend the Chief Justice. 
According to the information received, on 16 March 2007, law enforcement authorities used 
force in an excessive manner against peaceful protestors in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. 
Several of these protesters, including lawyers from the prime bar associations, political 
activists, civil society actors and members of the public, were physically assaulted by the 
forces, and subsequently arrested. According to reports, in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, 
law enforcement authorities fired tear gas shells at the protesters leading to several injuries. 
Rubber bullets were also used in Islamabad to disperse the demonstrators in different parts of 
the city.  
 
479. Furthermore, journalists were denied access to key points from where the public 
protests could be covered. Several of them were physically and verbally abused, and their 
cameras and other equipment damaged by the police. Finally, law enforcement authorities 
raided the premises of the private GEO TV station, using tear gas and beating up the 
journalists present inside. Serious concern was expressed that the excessive use of force 
against the protestors and the subsequent arrests of some of them may have been related to 
their legitimate and peaceful activities in defence of human rights and their attempts to 
safeguard the independence of the judiciary in Pakistan.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 23 March 2007 
</b> 
480. The Government informed that all decisions regarding the Supreme Court Justice had 
been filed in accordance with the Pakistani Constitution. With regard to the street protest and 
civil unrest, the government conceded that there had been some &#8216;unfortunate mishandling&#8217; of 
protesters, including lawyers, journalists and political activists, as well as the incident in the 
private television station, however it denied that rubber bullets had been used on protesters 
and maintained that tear gas shells were only used to disperse &#8216;violent and unruly&#8217; crowds and 
not to inflict harm. The government further stated that it had instructed law enforcement 
agencies not to obstruct peaceful protests and that the government of Pakistan remained 
committed to freedom of the press and to addressing the current situation in a legal and 
constitutional manner.

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 June 2007 
</b> 
481. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Mazhar Abbas</b>, 
correspondent for the French news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) and Secretary 
General of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, <b>Mr. Zarrah Khan</b>, correspondent and 
photographer for the US news agency Associated Press, and <b>Mr. Asif Hassan</b>, AFP 
photographer.  According to the information received, on 29 May 2007, Mr. Mazhar Abbas, 
Mr. Zarrah Khan and Mr. Asif Hassan were threatened by several bullets placed in their cars&#8217; 
seats in the city of Karachi. It is reported that on 22 May 2007, a fax with their names and ten 
other names (<b>Mr. Azhar Abbas</b> of Dawn TV; <b>Mr. Zafar Abbas</b> of the daily newspaper 
Dawn; <b>Mr. Aneeq Ahmed</b> and <b>Mr. Shaheen Sehbai</b> of ARY TV; <b>Mr. Ayaz Amir,</b>

was sent from the headquarters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), a coalition 
partner of the Government, warning them to change their critical views of the Government. It 
would seem that the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan secretary general, <b>Mr. Iqbal 
Haider</b>, was also named on the list. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 14 June 2007 
</b> 
482. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of <b>Mr. 
Noor Hakim</b>, reporter for the Urdu-language daily Pakistan and vice-president of the Tribal 
Union of Journalists, who was reportedly killed on 2 June in a bombing in Bajaur, in the north 
western Tribal Areas region, close to the border with Afghanistan. He was reportedly 
traveling with a tribal chief in a vehicle that was blown up by a remote-controlled bomb, 
killing all the occupants. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 2 August 2007 
</b> 
483. The Government informed that the facts of the case, as confirmed by the authorities in 
Pakistan, are that on 2 June 2007, a remote controlled bomb went off in village Dara of Tehsil 
Salarzai, killing Mr. <b>Noor Hakim</b> along with four others, includin Mr. Wisal Khan 
(Tehsildar, an administrative officer) Mr. Nazakai Malilm Mr. Pervez and Mr. Hassan 
Muhammad (a Levy Sepoy). The Government has strongly condemned the incident and 
granted Rupee 500,000/- to the family of Mr. Noor Hakim. It has also given employment to 
his son in Bajaur Levies through special quota. The law enforcement agencies have 
intensified their search for the culprits whose identity has not yet been determined.

</b> 
484. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal concerning the 
imposition of the state of emergency by the President of Pakistan on 3 November 2007 and 
the suspension of fundamental freedoms, including the right not to be deprived of one's 
liberty, save in accordance with the law and to the enjoyment of safeguards as to arrest and </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 132 
 
detention, the right to freedom of movement, the right to assemble in public and the freedom 
of expression. Furthermore, the proclaimed state of emergency entailed an attack on the 
independence of the judiciary. The State of Emergency declared by President Musharraf was 
said not to be a constitutional emergency envisaged in the Constitution, which has now been 
declared to remain in abeyance and replaced by a &quot;Provisional Constitution Order&quot;. 
According to the information received, seven members of the Supreme Court issued a 
declaration against the emergency rule order stating that it appeared not to be legal, neither 
under the Constitution nor under international law. <b> 
 
</b>485. In particular, the mandate-holders were concerned about the situation of some 70 
human rights defenders arrested during a meeting inside the premises of the NGO Human 
Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) in Lahore. They were initially taken to the police, 
and requested to sign a declaration not to engage in any human rights activities. They all 
refused to sign it and were verbally abused by police officers. Those arrested on 4 November 
include the following 55 human rights activists (31 male and 24 female): Mr.<b> I.A. Reham</b>, 
Director of HRCP, Mr.<b> Syed Iqbal Haider, </b>Secretary General of HRCP, Ms.<b> Shahtaj 
Qazalbash, </b>Mr.<b> Mehboob Khan, </b>Mr.<b> Nadeem Anthony, </b>Ms.<b> Saleema Hashmi, </b>Ms.<b> 
Rubina Saigol, </b>Ms.<b> Samina Rehman, Brig Rao, Abid Hameed, Faisal Akhtar, Waseem

486. All 55 human rights activists were brought before the Judicial Magistrate on 5 
November 2007 and were sent to Kot Lakhpat Jail Lahore. A hearing took place on 6 
November 2007 and these 55 activists have reportedly been released on bail. The practising 
lawyer and United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Ms <b>Asma 
Jahangir</b>, has been placed under house arrest for a period of 90 days, and her house has been 
declared a sub-jail were some of the activists mentioned above are currently detained. Two 
women defenders, Ms Shahtaj Qazalbash and Ms Saleema Hashmi, were transferred to a 
police-owned residence at an unknown location. None of them have been charged. Neither a 
warrant nor judicial order was issued. The activists had not had access to lawyers or to their 
families and were detained for several hours without receiving food.  
 
487. Concern was expressed at the health of some of these leaders who are rather elderly. 
One of the detained activists, Mr. Ashtar Ausaf Ali advocate was sent to hospital after 
suffering a heart attack in police custody. The Proclamation of Emergency states that some 
members of the judiciary have undermined the executive and legislative branches in the fight 
against terrorism and extremism, thereby weakening the Government&#8217;s ability to address this 
grave threat. Immediately after the imposition of the State of Emergency judges were required 
to take an oath of allegiance to the Provisional Constitutional Order to continue exercising 
their functions as judges. A high number of the judges refused to take the oath, as they refused 
to accept the state of emergency order, declaring it unconstitutional. In particular, only four 
out of the 17 judges of the Supreme Court took the oath. The Chief Justice of the Supreme </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 133 
 
Court was among those who did not agree to take the oath. All the judges of the Supreme 
Court who refused to take oath had been immediately replaced by new judges. They were not 
allowed to leave their homes, being prevented by Government forces from doing so. Eight out 
of the 27 judges of the High Court of the Sindh Province took oath, while the other, including 
the Chief Judge, refused. In Balochistan, all five judges of the High Court agreed to take the 
oath. In Punjab Province, 17 out of the 31 judges of the High Court, including the Chief 
Judge, took oath. The most senior judge among those who refused to take oath, Mr Bokhari, 
was under house arrest. In the North West Frontier Province, around half of the 17 judges had 
not taken the oath.  
 
488. On 5 November 2007, lawyers protested against the declaration of the state of 
emergency. There were indications of extreme brutality in the repression by the police and 
extensive arrests of lawyers. Some 150 lawyers had been arrested in Karachi and 50 in 
Lahore, including Ms Hifza Aziz and Ms Abid Saqi. Lawyers had also been attacked by the 
police inside the Court and the bar premises and all office bearers of the Bar Associations had 
been arrested. The Government had suspended the transmission of privately owned local and 
international television channels, in particular news stations. Agents of the Electronic Media 
Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) alongside police officers raided the premises of television 
and radio channels to confiscate equipment. Internet service providers were also ordered to 
stop their service, interrupting Internet access for a large number of users. The President 
promulgated a new ordinance under which the print and electronic media had been barred 
from printing and broadcasting &#8220;anything which defames or brings into ridicule the head of 
state, or members of the armed forces, or executive, legislative or judicial organ of the state&#8221;. 
The ordinance stipulated up to 3 years in prison as punishment for non-compliance. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 November 2007 with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</b> 
489. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation 
of lawyers, judges and human rights activists in Pakistan, including the lawyers Mr. <b>Munir A. 
Malik</b>, Mr. <b>Aitzaz Ahsan</b>, Mr. <b>Tariq Mahmood</b>, Mr. <b>Ali Ahmed Kurd</b>, Mr. <b>Abrar Hassan</b> 
and Mr. <b>Ahsan Bhoon</b>, and Mr. <b>Ifetkhar Choudhry</b>, chief justice of Pakistan, other judges 
of the Supreme Court, Mr. <b>Sabih Uddin</b> <b>Ahmed</b>, Chief Justice of Sindh, Mr. <b>Justice 
Shahani</b>, and Mr. <b>Justice Musheer</b> <b>Alam</b>, judges of the Sindh High Court. Mr. Malik and 
Mr. Kurd have been subject to previous communications sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders on 14 May and 7 May 2007 respectively. 
No reply to these communications had been received as of yet.  
 
490. The situation of lawyers and judges, including the judges of the Supreme Court, had 
also been addressed by an urgent appeal sent by several mandate-holders on 6 November 
2007. According to the information received, since 3 November 2007, when President 
Musharraf declared the state of emergency, thousands of lawyers had been arrested and 
detained in all provinces of Pakistan. These arrests and detentions constituted an 
unprecedented attack to the legal profession in Pakistan. Many of them were being held for up 
to 90 days under the Maintenance of Public Order law. Among them were numerous lawyers 
affiliated with political movements striving for the restoration of the constitution. It was </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 134 
 
reported that these lawyers had been arrested and put in detention without having committed 
any offense, for the sole fact of having expressed their opinion about the recently declared 
state of emergency.  
</p><p> 
491. Furthermore, it was reported that a new professional ordinance was to be passed giving 
the High Courts and the Supreme Court the power to remove the licences of practicing 
lawyers, which would be in violation of the independence of lawyers and their right to 
exercise their functions without interference. In this context, information was received 
regarding senior lawyers Mr. Munir A. Malik, Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan, Mr. Tariq Mahmood, Mr. 
Ali Ahmed Kurd, Mr. Abrar Hassan and Mr. Ahsan Bhoon. It was reported that Mr. Munir A. 
Malik, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), was being held in 
Attock Fort under the custody of the military intelligence service. Numerous instances of 
torture are said to have occurred at Attock Fort in recent months. Munir A. Malik, who is 
known to suffer from a heart condition, had been reportedly visited by government doctors on 
10 November. There had been no further reports on his current condition.  
 
492. Aitzaz Ahsan, current president of the SCBA, was being held in Adiala prison in 
Rawalpindi. His lawyer had repeatedly been denied access to him. On 6 November, the 
authorities at the Adiala prison were said not to have admitted Atizaz Ahsan's lawyer, even 
though the Deputy Commissioner of Islamabad Administration had given permission for the 
visit. Mr. Tariq Mahmood, former President of the Supreme Court Bar Association had 
allegedly also been imprisoned in Adiala prison. No one had been allowed to see him and it 
was reported that he had been transferred to an unknown place. The whereabouts of Ali 
Ahmed Kurd, former Vice Chair of the Pakistan Bar Council, who was also detained on 3 
November, continued to be unknown.  
 
493. Information received suggested that Mr. Ali Ahmed Kurd had been handed over to 
intelligence agencies and had been maltreated. Mr. Abrar Hassan and Mr. Ahsan Bhoon were 
said to have been held incommunicado since their arrest on 3 November. Although some 
lawyers had been freed around 20 November, it appeared that many of them had been re-
arrested, and that the vast majority still remained in detention. It was also reported that 
lawyers, including women lawyers, had been severely beaten during demonstrations, and that 
they would be subjected to cruel and degrading treatment while in detention.  
 
494. Concerning the situation of judges, it was reported that Mr. Ifetkhar Choudhry, Chief 
Justice of Pakistan, remained in detention, as well as other judges of the Supreme Court who 
had refused to take the new Oath under the new state of emergency regulations. Other judges 
were detained in the country, including the following judges of the Sindh High Court who had 
been put under house arrest: Mr. Sabih Uddin Ahmed, Chief Justice of Sindh, Mr. Justice 
Shahani, Mr. Justice Musheer Alam and Ms. Noor Naz Agha. The aforementioned judges had 
been dismissed in violation of the Pakistan Constitution and legislation guaranteeing the 
security of tenure of judges, in particular of Supreme Court judges, and which does not 
provide the President of Pakistan with the authority to dismiss judges. Grave concern was 
expressed at the numerous arrests and detentions of lawyers and judges under provisions that 
allow detention without charge or trial. Of further concern was the reported frequent 
incommunicado detention, which included denial of visits by family and lawyers.  
 
495. With respect to the lawyers and judges mentioned above and in the annex, grave 
concern was expressed that they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. As regards Mr. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 135 
 
Malik, concern was expressed with regard to his health. Great concern was also expressed at 
the dismissal of judges. In this regard, the mandate-holders called upon the Government to 
reinstate all judges that have been illegally dismissed. They expressed their deepest concern at 
the arrests and detentions of human rights activists who had been arrested in connection with 
their peaceful protests to oppose the suspension of the Constitution and to support the 
independence of the judiciary. Many activists were reportedly arrested to prevent them from 
undertaking such activities.  
 
496. Annexed to this letter were lists of lawyers, judges and human rights activists who had 
been arrested in the aftermath of the imposition of the state of emergency. These lists 
contained the names of those about whom information has been received but did not reflect 
the total number of those arrested. In list A, the mandate-holders included information on 
lawyers who had been released when this information had been made available to them. The 
mandate-holders regretted that the Government had not publicly released either the names of 
those arrested or those released.

sindicalista fue asesinado por un disparo de un trabajador contratado por la empresa para 
reprimir una manifestaci&#243;n contra el despido de un centenar de trabajadores. Otros 
manifestantes tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an resultado heridos. El 16 de agosto de 2007, el Sr. Arg&#252;eles 
habr&#237;a fallecido de un disparo propinado por un agente de la Polic&#237;a Nacional  en la Isla 
Viveros, sobre el Archipi&#233;lago de San Miguel. El Sr. Arg&#252;elles participaba de una 
manifestaci&#243;n para exigir el cierre de la empresa MAQTEC, ordenada por la Alcald&#237;a de 
Balboa, as&#237; como los salarios no pagados por la empresa. Al parecer, los agentes policiales 
habr&#237;an impedido el acceso a los trabajadores lanzando bombas lacrim&#243;genas y dsparos de 
perdigones. Otro dirigente sindical, Raymundo Garc&#233;s, secretario de prensa y propaganda del 
SUNTRACS, habr&#237;a sido retenido durante la manifestaci&#243;n y se le habr&#237;a decomisado un

500. El Relator Especial envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con el Sr. <b>&#211;scar 
Bogado</b>, periodista del diario &#218;ltima Hora. El d&#237;a 24 de abril de 2007, al parecer, unos 
individuos habr&#237;an entrado en su domicilio, en la ciudad de Encarnaci&#243;n, sin sustraer nada y 
dejando la puerta abierta al marchar. Seg&#250;n fuentes, el Sr. Bogado habr&#237;a sido objeto de 
continuas amenazas telef&#243;nicas desde marzo de 2006 cuando public&#243;, por primera vez, un 
art&#237;culo sobre corrupci&#243;n local y producci&#243;n de marihuana a lo largo de la frontera sur de 
Paraguay. Seg&#250;n fuentes, una de las llamadas an&#243;nimas dec&#237;a &quot;si quieres ver a tu hijo crecer, 
no contin&#250;es con estos temas&quot; y &quot;cuando queramos, te podemos matar&quot;.  Al parecer, el 18 de 
abril de 2007 un coche sigui&#243; al Sr. Bogado durante m&#225;s de 100 kil&#243;metros, recorrido entre su 
casa y la oficina de su mujer. Desde entonces, el Sr. Bogado, habr&#237;a estado recibiendo 
llamadas no identificadas que le indicaban detalles de su itinerario diario.  Se teme que las 
amenazas hacia el Sr. Bogado est&#233;n relacionadas con sus art&#237;culos sobre el narcotr&#225;fico en el 
departamento de Itap&#250;a. Se expresa, asimismo, profunda preocupaci&#243;n a cerca de la integridad

municipales de Chosica, cuyos nombres son conocidos por el Relator Especial, quienes, seg&#250;n 
informes, les exigieron que dejaran de investigar la gesti&#243;n del alcalde de Chosica e intentaron 
apoderarse de la grabadora de mano y c&#225;mara fotogr&#225;fica que portaban. Seg&#250;n informaciones

Reynaga denunci&#243; que, desde el 12 de febrero, habr&#237;a recibido amenazas de muerte an&#243;nimas 
en su tel&#233;fono. El periodista afirm&#243; que en dichas amenazas se le advert&#237;a de que le quedan 
pocos d&#237;as de vida. En opini&#243;n del propio periodista, las amenazas est&#225;n relacionadas con sus 
dos recientes denuncias period&#237;sticas, emitidas a inicios de febrero, sobre los presuntos actos 
de corrupci&#243;n en la polic&#237;a municipal y en el Frente de Defensa de los Intereses de Huaraz.

urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on 5 September 2006. According to the 
information received, on 26 January 2007, a judge issued warrants for the arrest of the three 
journalists, accused of libel by the Assistant Prosecutor of Quezon City, following a </p>

complaint filed by Mr. Jose Miguel Arroyo, the husband of President Gloria Macapagal 
Arroyo. The three journalists were subsequently released on bail. The three presented a TV 
programme, Isumbong Mo, Tulfo Brothers, on the TV station RPN 9, which was cancelled in 
August 2006. In a press conference, the Tulfo brothers stated that Mr. Arroyo was behind the 
cancellation of the programme because of their reports on the alleged illegal activities of two 
persons who were presumed to have links with Arroyo. The trial of the three journalists was 
expected to start on 28 February 2007. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 8 August 2007. 
</b> 
516. The Government informed that the case is <i>sub judice</i>, as it is currently being heard by 
the trial court. On 22 January 2007 a criminal case of libel was filed against the <b>Tulfo 
brothers</b> in connection with a statement which they made against Mr. Jose Miguel T. Arroyo. 
The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. Q-07-144890 before Branch 83, Regional Trial 
Court of Quezon City. The facts as indicated in the criminal complaint for libel provides that 
the accused &#8220;willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and with malicious intent of impeaching 
the honesty, integrity and reputation&#8221; and &#8220;with malicious intent of injuring ant exposing said 
offended party to public hatred, contempt and ridicule&#8221;, wrote and published a column in the 
People&#8217;s Journal. The issuance of warrants of arrest against the Tulfo brothers followed the 
normal domestic process concerning libel, whereby as a matter of course, after the filing of a 
criminal complaint, the trial court which has jurisdiction over the offense issues a warrant of 
arrest against the accused and the accused is arrested and taken into custody. Libel is bailable 
under domestic laws. The Government further informed that it does not appear that the Tulfo 
brothers have filed any complaint in relation to the libel case. The Government also provided 
information concerning the rules on libel under domestic law, including the criteria that must 
be present for an act to be considered libel, as well as on the overall legislation concerning 
freedom of opinion and expression. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 7 June 2007

Dodie Nunez</b>, a photojournalist of regional newspaper Katapat, who was reportedly killed on 
21 May, when he returned home in Cavite province, south of Manila. Reportedly, three 
motorcyclists stopped the bus he was on and shot him dead. During the campaign of the 
elections in early May 2007 the newspaper Katapat had accused a candidate &#8211; whose name is 
known by the Special Rapporteur - of corruption. The Rapporteur expressed concern that the 
critical approach and further denouncing of corruption of Katapat in the elections of May 
2007 may be related to the killing of Mr. Dodie Nunez.

Station of General Mariano Alvarez (GMA), Cavite revealed that on 21 May 2007, at about 
10:00 p.m., Mr. Rodolfo Goodies Nunez was on board a passenger jeepney, seated at the rear 
section, travailing from Bi&#241;an, Laguna to GMA, Cavite. While at GMA, Cavite, two 
unidentified male backriders suddenly alighted from a motorcycle and fired at Mr. Nunez 
several times hitting him on different parts of his body. He died on the spot. The suspects 
hurriedly fled towards south direction. Another passenger hit by a stray bullet was 
immediately brought to a nearby hospital for treatment. The body of Mr. Nunez was taken to </p>

shells of caliber .45 pistol, a deformed slug and metal splinters. Continuous investigation is 
being conducted by the GMA Municipal Police Station for possible identification and arrest 
of the suspects as well as to establish the motive behind the killing. No complaint has been 
lodged by the family of Mr. Nunez or on their behalf, as the identities of the suspects have not

Government the situation of Mr <b>Pete Pinlac</b>, Mr <b>Arturo Castillo</b>, Mr <b>John Beato</b>, Mr 
<b>Aurelio Veloso</b>, Ms <b>Virginia Suarez Pinlac</b>, Ms <b>Mitzi Chan</b> and Mr <b>Roy Fernandez</b>. Mr 
Pete Pinlac is the President of Manggagawa sa Komunikasyon ng Pilipinas (MKP &#8211;  The 
Telecommunications Workers&#8217; Union of the Philippines); Mr Arturo Castillo and Mr John 
Beato are First and Second Vice-Presidents of MKP respectively; Aurelio Veloso works with

Ms Virginia Suarez Pinlac is Vice-Chairperson of Pagkakaisa ng Kababaihan (KAISA KA), a

Commission of Kilusan para sa Pambansang Demokrasya (KPD); and Mr Roy Fernandez is 
an MKP Representative.  
 
520. According to information received, on 10 October 2007, Mr Pinlac, Mr Castillo, Mr 
Beato, Mr Veloso, Ms Pinlac, Ms Chan and Mr Fernandez were arrested during their 
participation in a peaceful protest against the labour policies of the Philippine Long Distance 
Telephone Company. The protest, which was held outside the Department of Labour and 
Employment in Manila, was reportedly violently dispersed by members of the Western Police 
District of the Philippine National Police. The individuals arrested have reported having 
suffered severe bruising and Ms Mitzi Chan had her nose broken, allegedly as a result of 
being hit by a member of the police.  
 
521. Mr Pinlac, Mr Castillo, Mr Beato, Mr Veloso, Ms Pinlac, Ms Chan and Mr Fernandez 
were later released on bail. The charges filed against them include having held a rally without 
a permit; obstructing traffic; and disturbing the peace. Concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned arrests of Mr Pete Pinlac, Mr Arturo Castillo, Mr John Beato, Mr Aurelio 
Veloso, Ms Virginia Suarez Pinlac, Ms Mitzi Chan and Mr Roy Fernandez, as well as the 
charges that have been filed against them, may have been directly related to their non-violent

<b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
522. On 22 January 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 4 July 2006. The Government informed that Mr. <b>Crispin Beltran</b> is in the 
custody of the Philippine National Police (PNP) at the Philippine Heart Center while he is 
undergoing trial for the crime of rebellion before Branch 50, Regional Trial Court of Makati 
City. He was arrested by the police without a warrant following Section 5, rule 113 of the 
Rules of Criminal Procedure.

523. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), on 24 February 2006 a political rally 
was held by several non-govemmental organizations at the People Power Monument in 
Quezon City to commemorate the 20th anniversary of People Power I. Members of the PNP 
Crowd Disturbance Unit were deployed in the area to protect the crowd and prevent violence 
from erupting. During the political rally, Mr. Beltran made the following utterances: &#8220;Down 
with the Arroyo governmentl&#8221;, &#8220;Oust Glorial&#8221;, &#8220;Evict the pretender from Malaca&#241;ang&#8221;; 
&#8220;Replace the Arroyo administration with the government of the working class!&#8221;. The police 
officers were not able to effect the immediate arrest of Mr. Beltran due to the commotion that 
followed. Nevertheless, they conducted pursuit operations to track him down. On 26 February 
2006, the police arrested Rep. Beletran while he was en route to Marilao, Bulacan. He was 
taken to Camp Crame where he was detained. In the domestic criminal justice system, 
warrantless arrests of persons caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> or &#8220;caught in the act&#8221; are 
constitutionally allowed. Moreover, rebellion is considered in domestic jurisprudence as a 
&#8220;continuing crime&#8221; that is, one who is involved in rebellion is deemed to be always actually 
committing rebellion, hence may be arrested at any time without a warrant.   
 
524. Following his arrest and the conduct of inquest proceedings, the DOJ filed an 
information for rebellion against Mr. Beltran and a certain 1st Lieutenant Lawrence San Juan 
before the trial court. It bears mentioning that when an arrest is made without a warrant, the 
DOJ immediately conducts inquest proceedings on the case to determine the existence of 
&#8220;probable cause&#8221;, i.e. whether the evidence presented by the police is sufficient to engender a 
well-founded belief that the offense was committed and that the person arrested is probably 
guilty thereof. The criminal case against Mr. Beltran was docketed as Criminal Case No. 06-
452 and raffled to the sala of Judge Jenny Lind B. Aldecoa-Delorino of Regional Trial Court 
Branch 137, Makati City. On 4 April 2006, Mr. Beltran moved that the court make a 
determination on the existence of probable cause, i.e. whether there exists sufficient evidence 
to hold him for trial. Mr. Baltran also requested the court to allow his transfer to a hospital 
with adequate facilities to monitor his health condition. Judge Aldecoa-Delorino granted the 
request for transfer. 
 
525. On 21 April 2006, the DOJ sought to amend the criminal information filed against Mr. 
Beltran by including in the case several other individuals. After the accused in a criminal case 
has entered his plea, an amendment of the information against him can only be made with 
leave of court. In the instant case, the DOJ sought the permission of Judge Delorino to amend 
the information, which request was denied. After the denial of its plea to have the information 
amended, the DOJ filed a motion for the inhibition of Judge Delorino. Judge Delorino 
voluntarily inhibited herself from hearing the case. Hence, the case was re-raffled to another 
court where it is being heard until now. 
 
526. Concerning the charges against Mr. <b>Ocampo</b>, Mr. <b>Casi&#241;o</b>, Mr. <b>Virador</b>, Mr. <b>Mariano 
</b>and Ms. <b>Maza</b>, the Government provided the following information. On 12 May 2006, on the 
basis of the complaint and evidence submitted by the Philippine National Police-Directorate 
for investigation and Detective Management, an infommation for rebellion was filed by the 
DOJ against Jose Maria Sison, Satumino Ocampo, Rafael Mariano, Teodoro Casino, Liza 
Maza, Joel Virador and several others before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati. 
The case for rebellion, docketed as Criminal Case No. 06-944, was raffled to RTC Branch 57, 
Makati City. The case was consolidated with the case for rebellion filed against Mr. Beltran. 
After the filing of the case, Messrs. Ocampo, Mariano, Casino, Virador and Ms. Maza went to 
the Supreme Court questioning the filing of the case against them. The Supreme Court issued </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 143 
 
a status quo order pending the hearing of the petition filed before it. On 21 June 2006, Messrs. 
Ocampo, Casinos Mariano, Virador, and Ms. Maza ffbd a manifestation that the proceedings 
in the trial court be suspended in view of the Status Quo Order issued by the Supreme Court.  
527. Concerning the restrictions on the freedom to travel of Mr. Ocampo, the Government 
informed that the Supreme Court once held that a person who had a pending case and had 
been admitted to bail might be prevented from leaving the country considering the risk of 
flight.  Since there is a pending case for rebellion against Mr. Ocampo, the DOJ may validly 
object to the travel. However, the Government notes that Mr. Ocampo has been able to leave 
the country more than once for Geneva, Switzerland.

<p><b> 
</b>529. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of the <b>Information Center GenderDoc-M</b>, a non-governmental 
organisation that defends the rights of sexual minorities in Moldova. The organisation was the 
subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special Representative to the Secretary-General for 
Human Rights Defenders on 23 May 2006.  
 
530. According to the information received, on 11 April 2007, Chisinau City Council banned 
the Moldovan Pride parade, organised by Information Center GenderDoc-M, on the grounds 
that it could pose a public disorder threat, that it would promote sexual propaganda and that it 
would undermine Moldovan Christian values. The event was due to take place in Chisinau 
city between 27 and 29 April 2007 and was planned as part of the Council of Europe&#8217;s &#8220;All 
Different, All Equal&#8221; campaign. In February 2007, the Supreme Court held that the City 
Council had acted illegally in banning the event in 2006. According to reports, the Parade was 
prohibited on two previous occasions. On 28 April 2006, the office of the General Mayor in 
Chisinau, Moldova rejected an application by the Information Center GenderDoc-M to hold a 
peaceful demonstration in Chisinau on 5 May 2006. The purpose of this demonstration was to 
support the adoption of legislation barring discrimination based on sexual orientation. The 
reported reasons for the rejection of the application were based on &#8220;the statements of religious 
organisations that they will organise protest actions if the demonstration organised by 
GenderDoc-M is allowed, and also based on letters of complaint from individuals living in 
Chisinau.&#8221;  
 
531. Furthermore, on 16 May 2005 the office of the General Mayor in Chisinau, Moldova 
reportedly rejected an application to hold a peaceful demonstration in Chisinau to support the 
adoption of legislation based on sexual orientation. It was also reported that in June 2005 this 
decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal in Moldova.

is reported that the attack followed investigative articles about Serbia's security forces and

Anastasijevic had also made comments about Scorpion members on B92 Radio program 
Kaziprst. Mr. Anastasijevic was a correspondent from the war zone in the former Yugoslavia 
in the 1990s, testified in The Hague at Slobodan Milosevic&#8217;s trial, and in recent years he

<b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 February 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights defenders 
</b> 
535. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the case concerning the Federal Supreme Court of Moscow&#8217;s decision to uphold 
a ruling to close the <b>Russian Chechen Friendship Society </b>(RCFS), a registered, independent 
non-governmental organization based in Nizhny Novgorod which monitors human rights 
violations in Chechnya and other parts of the North Caucasus. Mr <b>Stanislav Dmitrievsky</b>, 
Director, and Ms. Oksana Chlysheva, Deputy Director of RCFS were previously the subjects 
of several communications sent by these mandate-holders; an allegation letter on 9 June 2005, 
of an urgent appeal on 15 November 2005, of a joint allegation letter on 21 November 2005 
and of a joint urgent appeal on 20 October 2006.  
 
536. According to information received, on 23 January 2007, the Federal Supreme Court of 
Moscow upheld a decision of the Regional Court of Nizhny Novgorod to close the Russian 
Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS). The original order was issued on 13 October 2006, on 
the grounds that the organization had violated laws relating to public association, NGO 
reporting procedures and had been involved in alleged extremist activities. The decision taken 
by the Regional Court of Nizhny Novgorod&#8217;s to close RCFS was based on recently adopted 
legislation enshrined within the Federal Law on NGOs. According to the Court&#8217;s decision, 
Article 19 required that Mr Dmitrievsky step down as Director of RCFS for his alleged 
involvement in extremist activities. In addition, according to the Regional Courts decision, 
Article 15 of the Law on the Fight against Extremist Activities, required RCFS to publicly </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 145 
 
condemn Mr Dmitrievsky&#8217;s alleged extremist activities within five days of the court hearing if 
its reputation was to remain intact.  
 
537. On 2 September 2005, Mr Dmitrievsky, was charged under Article 282 (1) of the 
Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, for inciting hatred.  In February 2006, he was again 
charged with the same alleged offence, on the basis of articles published in the RCFS 
newspaper calling for peace in Chechnya. According to reports, legal actions had been 
pursued by the Russian Government on two previous occasions in an attempt to close the 
RCFS. The first was initiated by the Federal Registration Service, which claimed that the 
organization was unable to produce original copies of financial records. It later transpired that 
the documents were with another government agency and RCFS was unable to comply with 
both requests simultaneously.  
 
538. In 2005, legal action was taken against the organization by the tax authorities and the 
registration department of the Ministry of Justice. Serious concerns were expressed that the 
decision to close the Russian Chechen Friendship Society formed part of an ongoing 
campaign against human rights defenders in the Russian Federation and may have been the 
latest attempt to silence organizations because of their legitimate activities in monitoring the 
human rights situation in Russia.  
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 May 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers 
</b> 
539. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government to 
the situation of Mr. <b>Dias Rafikov</b>, a Russian national born in 1986, who was in pre-trial 
detention in Kazan city, Tatarstan at the time the communication was sent. According to the 
information received, Mr. Rafikov, a practicing Muslim, was arrested by police officials on 
the early morning of 7 December 2006, and accused under articles 205, part 1, 272, and 282-
1, parts 1 and 2, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, for involvement in terrorist 
activities, establishment of an extremist organization, participation in an extremist 
organization and preparation of a change of the constitutional order by violence. 
 
540. Upon his arrest, the police conducted a search and seized several copies of Islamic 
literature, films, and other documents. Mr. Rafikov was accused of having acted on behalf of 
Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami, a party whose activities were banned in the Russian Federation by a 
decision of the Supreme Court in 2003. However, Mr. Rafikov had no links with this 
organization or with Islamic extremism. The police seized only Islamic literature, whereas in 
his home there were also Christian and Hindu materials. Mr. Rafikov was interested in 
religion in general and is a first-year student in psychology. Many of the witnesses during the 
seizure did not pay attention to the police acts and it is not certain that all the materials 
recorded as seized had actually been present in his house prior to the seizure.  
 
541. Mr. Rafikov suffered from several diseases. His father requested a copy of his medical 
record from the district medical unit to show it to the pre-trial detention centre authorities in 
order for his son to receive the necessary medical treatment. The medical personnel refused to 
issue a copy of the medical record, claiming that Mr. Rafikov was an extremist. This refusal 
was reportedly due to acts of intimidation against the medical personnel carried out by 
members of the Security Services, who had visited the medical unit earlier than Mr. Rafikov&#8217;s </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 146 
 
father. Mr. Rafikov&#8217;s arrest and detention were ordered by a court and his pre-trial detention 
was extended by courts on two occasions.  
 
542. Concern is expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Rafikov is solely connected to 
his peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to freedom of 
religion or belief. Further concern is expressed as regards Mr. Rafikov&#8217;s state of health and 
the fact that the proceedings against him may have been instigated in order to enhance 
statistics relating to activities in the fight against terrorism. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 30 July 2007 
 
</b>543. The Government informed that regarding the circumstances surrounding the arrest of 
<b>Dias Albertovich Rafikov</b>, it has been ascertained that, following investigations by the 
authorities of the Russian Federal Security Service, the above-mentioned citizen of the 
Russian Federation was charged under the following articles of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation: 205.1 (Abetting terrorism); 282.1 (Setting up an extremist organization); 
282.2 (Organizing the activities of an extremist organization); and 279 (Armed insurrection), 
also taking into consideration article 30 (Preparing to commit an offence and attempted 
commission of an offence). On 5 December 2006, criminal proceedings No. 606008 were 
instituted against Mr. Rafikov by the investigations branch of the Republic of Tatarstan office 
of the Federal Security Service. In accordance with the rules of the Russian Federation Code 
of Criminal Procedure, as a measure of restraint imposed on the defendant, the court of the 
Republic of Tatarstan ordered remand in custody, and this custody has since been extended by 
the court to 5 August 2007. 
 
544. During detective operations, it was established that, when Mr. Rafikov learned of the 14 
February 2003 decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation declaring the so 
called &#8220;Islamic Freedom Party&#8221; (&#8220;Hezb&#8217;-ut-Tahrir al-Islami&#8221;) a terrorist organization and 
banning it from the territory of the Russian Federation, he had systematically organized and 
conducted extremist activities in the interests of the said banned organization in the Republic 
of Tatarstan, laying the groundwork for the perpetration of acts designed to bring about 
violent change of the constitutional order of the Russian Federation. These activities led to his 
being charged with the commission of the offence covered by article 278 (Preparations for the 
forcible seizure of power or forcible retention of power) of the Criminal Code of the Russian 
Federation. 
 
545. Mr. Rafikov&#8217;s involvement in the perpetration of offences with which he is charged is 
corroborated by the evidence gathered on his case. Pursuant to a judicial order of 7 December 
2006, Mr. Rafikov&#8217;s home was searched and extremist materials seized. During the search, 
books, leaflets, pamphlets and other publications on the activities of the Islamic Freedom 
Party were found. The search was conducted in compliance with the requirements of criminal 
procedure law. Other searches carried out in the homes of 13 active members of the &#8220;Islamic 
Freedom Party&#8221; revealed material containing information on the activities of the said 
organization. In addition, plans and 1 kilogram of aluminium powder, which serves for the 
manufacture of home-made explosive devices, were found. 
 
546. The searches of the homes of the accused, including Mr. Rafikov, were carried out by a 
detective from the investigations branch of the Republic of Tatarstan office of the Russian 
Federal Security Service. During these searches, no comments or statements by the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 147 
 
investigative officers were recorded in the search report. Mr. Rafikov was transferred to pre-
trial detention centre No. 1 of the State headquarters of the Russian Federal Corrections 
Service for the Republic of Tatarstan and, upon admission to this facility, underwent a 
medical check-up and examination. He did not report any health complaints. 
 
547. On 21 March 2007 and 11 April 2007, Mr. Rafikov sought medical attention from the 
medical service of the pre-trial detention centre, in response to which he was given medical 
examinations and prescribed the appropriate treatment for his conditions. He was placed 
under medical observation by specialists at the medical service of pre-trial detention centre 
No. 1 for the illnesses from which he was suffering. Currently, Mr. Rafikov is in satisfactory 
health and shows no sign of aggravation of these chronic illnesses. The allegations that 
obstacles have been placed in the way of Mr. Rafikov receiving medical assistance are 
unfounded. No requests for medical checks have been submitted to the authorities at the pre-
trial detention centre or to the investigative authorities either by the accused or by his 
relatives.  
 
548. The claims that staff at the district medical unit refused to issue medical records to Mr. 
Rafikov&#8217;s relatives have been investigated and found to be baseless. Upon his request, Mr. 
Rafikov&#8217;s father was given a transcript from his son&#8217;s outpatient card on 14 December 2006. 
A second request based on Mr. Rafikov&#8217;s alleged poor health and need of extensive treatment 
was refused in early February 2007, on the grounds that there were no records of Mr. 
Rafikov&#8217;s state of health. The claims that medical personnel at the clinic had been intimidated 
by officials from the Tatarstan headquarters of the Federal Security Service were checked and 
also proved to be unfounded. 
 
549. It was also established that Mr. Rafikov was admitted to Kazan pre-trial detention 
centre No. 1 on 14 December 2006 and detained in cells which are furnished in accordance 
with the requirements of Federal Act 103 of 15 July 1995, the Criminal Suspects and 
Defendants (Remand in Custody) Act. Every cell is fitted with a sufficient number of sleeping 
places for the detainees confined within it, the essential sanitary facilities, a television, a 
cabinet for storing food, proper ventilation and adequate lighting. The check brought to light 
no evidence of failure by the staff of the criminal corrections system to protect Mr. Rafikov&#8217;s 
right to personal safety<b>.</b> 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 May 2007 
</b> 
550. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Pavel Sedakov</b>, 
correspondent for the independent business daily &#8220;Kommersant&#8221;, <b>Ms. Kseniya Rusyayeva</b>, 
correspondent for Ren-TV and <b>Mr. Maksim Vnukov</b>, a Ren-TV camera operator. According 
to the information received, on 10 May 2007, Mr. Pavel Sedakov, Ms. Kseniya Rusyayeva 
and Mr. Maksim Vnukov were arrested by police officers from the Samara Main Internal 
Affairs Directorate (GUVD) and the Directorate for Combating Organized Crime, while they 
were interviewing a local leader of the opposition coalition 'Other Russia' in the southern 
Russian city of Samara. Reportedly, police officers interrogated Mr. Sedakov, Ms. Rusyayeva 
and Mr. Vnukov for more than two hours, asking questions about 'Other Russia' and its 
planned &quot;March of the Dissenters&quot; on 18 May 2007 in Samara. The journalists were then 
reportedly released. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 148 
 
551. It is also reported that on 11 May 2007, several police officers seized the computers of 
the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, accusing the employees of &quot;using counterfeit 
software&quot; and confiscating all of the office&#8217;s financial records. On the same day, the police 
reportedly also raided the local offfices of the independent news agency Regnum. 
 
552. The Rapporteur expressed concern that Mr. Sedakov, Ms. Rusyayeva and Mr. Vnukov's 
arrest and the raid of independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta and news agency Regnum, may 
be related to their coverage of the opposition coalition &#8220;Other Russia&#8221;. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 30 July 2007 
</b> 
553. <b>T</b>he Government indicated that according to information from the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, at around 9.45 p.m. on 10 May 2007, a report was received by the duty desk of the 
Law and Order Office of the State Central Internal Affairs Office for Samara province that 
certain unidentified persons were filming and taking photographs in the courtyard of a 
building at No. 100, Tashkent St., in Samara. Officers from the Law and Order Office 
reported to the building in question, together with staff from the Criminal Enforcement 
Inspectorate for Samara province, who were monitoring the activities of a convicted criminal 
whose name was provided to the Special Rapporteur. 
 
554. On arrival at the site, the staff of the said units found <b>K.M. Rusyaeva</b>, <b>M.M. Vnukov</b> 
and <b>P.V. Sedakov</b>, who had just concluded an interview with the convicted criminal 
mentioned above, and invited them to come to the Public Law and Order Office for the 
purpose of filing a written report confirming that the said convicted criminal had breached the 
restrictions placed upon him by the court. The above-named persons agreed to come in their 
own car to the Public Law and Order Office. On arrival, Rusyaeva refused to speak to the 
staff of the office, citing her rights under article 51 of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, while Vnukov and Sedakov explained that Rusyaeva had asked them to come 
along to film and photograph &#8220;certain people&#8221;, a request to which they had acceded. 
 
555. Following the legally prescribed procedure, the convicted criminal was warned by 
officers from the Criminal Enforcement Inspectorate that he had been in breach of the 
restrictions placed upon him by the court. Sedakov, Rusyaeva and Vnukov were not arrested, 
detained or questioned by staff of the Public Law and Order Office. When questioned by staff 
of the procurator&#8217;s office, the journalists confirmed that they had not been subjected to any 
pressure by members of the police force and that they had no complaints against them. 
 
556. Pursuant to orders No. 30 and No. 31 of 10 May 2007, passed by Chief Superintendent 
V.A. Kuzmin, first deputy chief of the State Central Internal Affairs Office for Samara 
province, on 11 May 2007 staff of the Office&#8217;s Special Operations Unit carried out a check of 
the financial and business activities of the limited liability company Novaya Gazeta (S) and of 
the news agency Volga-Inform, which represents the news agency Regnum in the city of 
Samara. During this check, three personal computers were removed from the premises of the 
Novaya Gazeta offices, at No. 106, Novo-Sadovaya St., in Samara. Pirated software had been 
installed and was running on the computers. Two personal computers were also removed from 
the offices of Volga-Inform, situated at the same address. Pirated software had also been 
installed and was running on these computers. Following checks of the managing directors of 
the companies Novaya Gazeta and Volga Inform carried out by the Samara city procurator&#8217;s 
office, on 14 May 2007 criminal proceedings were instituted on the basis of evidence of an </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 149 
 
offence covered by article 146, paragraph 2, of the Russian Criminal Code (Violation of 
copyright and related rights). The case is currently at the preliminary investigation stage. 
</p><p> 
557. Thus no evidence came to light during all these investigations of breaches of the law by 
the police in the performance of their duties. The checks of the journalists&#8217; documents and the 
removal of computers from the offices of the said media organizations had nothing to do with 
any attempts to prevent media coverage of the activities of any voluntary or political 
organization. 
 
558. Pursuant to article 17, paragraph 1, of the Constitution human rights and freedoms are 
recognized and guaranteed in line with universally recognized principles and standards of 
international law, and it is the duty of the State to ensure that human rights and freedoms are 
recognized, upheld and protected (article 2 of the Constitution). Human rights and freedoms 
are directly invocable, and they determine the meaning, content and application of laws, the 
activities of the legislative and executive branches of government and of local authorities and 
their exercise is guaranteed by the system of justice (article 18 of the Constitution). Under 
article 29 of the Constitution, freedom of thought and expression is guaranteed to all.  
 
559. Article 45, paragraph 1, and article 46, paragraph 1, of the Constitution provide State 
(including judicial) guarantees of protection of human rights and freedoms. In addition, 
pursuant to article 46, paragraph 3, of the Constitution, every citizen has the right, in 
accordance with the international treaties to which the Russian Federation is party, to apply to 
international bodies for the protection of human rights and freedoms, if all available domestic 
legal remedies have been exhausted.  
 
560. Issues relating to the freedom to express opinions in the mass media are governed by 
Russian Federal Act No. 2124-1 of 27 December 1991, the Mass Media Act. Article 1 of the 
act states that no restrictions may be placed on the right to seek, receive, publish or 
disseminate mass information, or to establish mass media outlets, or to own, use and manage 
such outlets, or to manufacture, acquire, store and operate devices and equipment and raw 
materials and other inputs intended for the manufacture and dissemination of media materials, 
except such restrictions as are provided for under the Russian law on the media. Pursuant to 
article 3 of the act, no censorship is permitted of mass information. At the same time, article 4 
of the act sets out a number of rules designed to prevent the abuse of freedom of information. 
In particular, the mass media may not be used for the perpetration of criminal acts, for the 
unauthorized disclosure of information constituting State secrets or other confidential material 
specially protected by law, for the dissemination of materials containing public incitements to 
the perpetration of terrorist acts or publicly justifying terrorism, or for the dissemination of 
materials propagating pornography, the cult of violence or cruelty. Under the provisions of 
article 16 of the act, the operation of mass media outlets may only be halted or suspended by a 
decision of their proprietor, or by a court through a civil lawsuit brought by the registration 
authorities. In such a case, a court may halt the operation of a media outlet on the grounds of 
repeated violations by its editors or management, over a period of 12 months, of article 4 of 
the act, in response to which the registration authority has issued written warnings to the 
proprietor or the management (editor in chief) or both, and also in the event of failure by a 
mass media outlet to comply with a court order to suspend operation. The operation of mass 
media outlets may also be halted in the manner and on the grounds set out in Federal Act No. 
114 of 25 July 2002, as amended on 10 May 2007, the Extremist Activities (Efforts to 
Counter) Act. </p>

561. Encroachments on the freedom of information - in other words, any attempts by 
members of the public or by the officials of State agencies and organizations or of voluntary 
associations to impede the lawful activity of the proprietors, editors, publishers and 
distributors of mass media materials, and also of journalists, shall incur criminal, 
administrative, disciplinary or other forms of liability in accordance with the law of the 
Russian Federation (article 58 of the act). The discovery that any agencies, organizations, 
institutions or offices include among their tasks or functions the censoring of mass 
information shall result in the immediate halting of their funding and their dissolution in 
accordance with the procedure prescribed by Russian law. Article 114 of the Criminal Code 
of the Russian Federation establishes liability for efforts to impede the lawful professional 
activity of journalists, which shall incur penalties up to and including the deprivation of 
liberty for periods of up to two years, with or without suspension of the right to occupy 
certain official positions or to engage in certain activities for periods of up to three years. 
In addition to those described above, similar provisions on the freedom of expression may be 
found in Federal Act No. 149 of 27 July 2006, the Information, Information Technology and 
Information Protection Act (art. 3, para. 1; art. 5, para. 1; and art. 8, para. 1). 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 21 June 2007 
</b> 
562. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of <b>Mr. 
Andrei Kalitin</b>, an investigative reporter, who was reportedly shot in the shoulder as he was 
leaving his home on 13 June. Reportedly, Mr. Kalitin, who works in Spetsrassledovaniye 
(Special Investigation), a program on Russia's national television Channel One, has been 
working for the past months on a book alleging mafia involvement and criminal dealings in 
Russia&#8217;s aluminum business. Mr. Kalitin is a former reporter for Sovershenno Sekretno (Top 
Secret), an independent anti-corruption television program and has investigated topics such as 
the dealings of the alleged Russian mafia in the United States, the conflict in Chechnya and 
the North Caucasus, and the July 2004 slaying of Forbes-Russia Editor Paul Klebnikov. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 22 August 2007 
 
</b>563. The Government indicated that that the Ministry of Internal Affairs has established that 
on 13 June 2007, at 9 p.m., Mr. <b>Kalitin </b>was returning home from work. According to the 
victim, in the courtyard of the building where he is currently residing, he was fired on by an 
unknown man from an unidentified weapon. When he was treated at State hospital No. 1 in 
Moscow, Mr. Kalitin was found to have been wounded in the lower third of the left shoulder, 
as a result of which a haematoma developed. There was no serious damage to his health and, 
according to the findings of the forensic medical examination, this injury cannot be 
categorized under the criminal legislation currently in force. 
 
564. On 14 June 2007, the internal affairs office for the Nagatino-Sadovniki district of 
Moscow opened criminal case No. 218378 on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to 
article 213, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. A crime response unit was set up to investigate 
the offence, and a plan of additional investigative measures was developed and is being 
implemented. Several lines of inquiry are being pursued, including the possibility that the 
offence was linked to the victim&#8217;s professional activities. The law enforcement agencies are 
taking all necessary measures to identify the persons who took part in the commission of this 
offence. The leadership of the City Internal Affairs Authority for Moscow and the Office of </p>

the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation are monitoring the progress made in 
carrying out these measures. 
<b> 
Letter of allegations sent on 14 August 2007 
</b> 
565. On 14 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government, 
in relation to <b>Mikhail Afanasyev</b>, editor-in-chief of the Internet magazine &#8220;Novy Focus&#8221;, 
who was reportedly attacked by a man who identified himself as a police officer on 17 June. 
A complaint was reportedly filed by Mr. Afanasyev with the Abakan City Court, but the 
results of the investigation were not made public within the 10-day limit established by law. 
Reportedly, the prosecutor&#8217;s office forwarded the case materials to the police. According to 
the information received, in cases that a police officer is involved, the prosecutor&#8217;s office is 
required to conduct an independent investigation. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 18 October 2007  
 
</b>566. The Government informed that that on 22 June 2007, the Internal Affairs Authority for 
Abakan received from the City Procurator&#8217;s Office a statement by the Editor-in-Chief of the 
Internet publication &#8220;Novy Fokus&#8221;, <b>Mikhail Afanasev</b>, claiming that, on the night of 15-16 
June 2007, he and A.V. Lepeshkin had been attacked while they were in a motor vehicle. An 
unknown individual had inflicted bodily harm on Mr. Afanasev, stolen two cellphones, a 
leather jacket and a bag containing documents and attempted to hijack the car. Earlier, on 18 
June 2007, Mr. Afanasev had made a similar statement to the Abakan Procurator&#8217;s Office. 
The statement indicated that, in addition to the property listed above, a bag containing 
documents and keys had been stolen from him. 
 
567. On 29 June 2007, the Investigation Department of the Internal Affairs Authority for 
Abakan opened criminal case No. 303652 under article 161, part 2, paragraph (d) (Robbery), 
of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation against the unidentified individual who had 
perpetrated the attack. Mr. Afanasev was informed of the decision in writing. On 24 July 
2007, Mr. Afanasev lodged a complaint with the Abakan City Court in which he claimed that 
he had not been notified of the receipt of his statement. The court proceedings concerning his 
complaint were discontinued on 5 September 2007 as a result of Mr. Afanasev&#8217;s withdrawing 
the complaint. Claims that militia officers might have taken part in the attack on Mr. Afanasev 
appeared in the Internet publication &#8220;Otkrytoe informatsionnoe agentstvo&#8221; on 23 and 26 July 
2007 and on the website of the &#8220;Khakassia Internet&#8221; news agency on 24 July 2007. The 
claims concerning the participation in the offence of officers of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs for the Republic of Khakassia were not substantiated during the investigation of the 
case. Mr. Afanasev, when questioned as a victim, explained that the attack had been 
committed by persons unknown to him, not by militia officers. 
 
568. According to the information available, Mr. Afanasev has a reputation as a journalist 
who publishes articles the content of which cannot be objectively confirmed later. For 
example, in 2006, he was prosecuted three times by the Abakan City Court for offences under 
article 129, part 3 (Libel), of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. On 20 June 2007, 
he was convicted of repeat offences under article 319 (Insulting a representative of a public 
authority) and article 129, part 2 (Libel), of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.  The 
investigation identified a person, who had attempted to sell property stolen from the victim, </p>

and who is being sought by the police. The progress of the pretrial investigation is being 
monitored by the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation. 
<b> 
Letter of allegations sent on 19 September 2007 jointly with the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders 
</b> 
569. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of the non-governmental organization <b>Tolerance Support 
Foundation</b> and Mr. <b>Stanislav Dmitrievsky</b>, one of the Foundation&#8217;s collaborators, editor-
in-chief of the newspaper Pravozaschita and Executive-Director of the Russian-Chechen 
Friendship Society. Mr. Dmitrievsky was previously the subject of several communications 
sent by mandate-holders; the subject of an allegation letter sent on 9 June 2005, of an urgent 
appeal on 15 November 2005, of a joint allegation letter sent on 21 November 2005, of a joint 
urgent appeal on 20 October 2006 and of a joint allegation letter sent on 8 February 2007.  
 
570. According to the information received, on 30 August 2007, three officers from the 
department of computer crimes in the internal affairs directorate presented a search warrant to 
the Nizhni Novgorod&#8217;s office of the Tolerance Support Foundation. They conducted a 
complete inspection of the foundation&#8217;s financial and administrative operations as well as 
other activities, which were allegedly not covered by the warrant. All four computers in the 
organization were confiscated on the basis of lack of a software licence. The Foundation&#8217;s 
director and administrator were ordered to appear for questioning at the Nizhni Novgorod 
police.  
 
571. According to reports, the inspection in the Tolerance Support Foundation may have 
been related to the activities of Stanislav Dmitrievsky, who received a two-year suspended 
sentence in February 2006 on the charge of inciting racial hatred after publishing critical 
articles in the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society&#8217;s newspapers. In April 2007, Mr. 
Dmitrievsky organized a demonstration called the &#8220;March of Dissenters&#8221;, which was not 
authorized by the authorities. Subsequently, he received a written statement from the Federal 
Service to Executive Punishment warning him that his conditional sentence might be 
commuted to imprisonment. Allegedly, the authorities refused to hand him a copy of the 
warning. This prevented him from filing an appeal.  
 
572. On 5 and 6 June 2007, the Peace Court 1 of the Nizhegorodskiy district also issued two 
rulings ordering that administrative proceedings be undertaken against Mr. Dmitrievskiy. 
According to information, the terms of Mr. Dmitrievskiy's suspended sentence had also 
become more severe and he may now be imprisoned if he commits administrative violations. 
Concern was expressed that the inspection of the Tolerance Support Foundation&#8217;s activities 
and the confiscation of its computers as well as the written warning and administrative 
proceedings against Mr. Dmitrievsky may have been related to their legitimate exercise of 
their right to freedom of expression and to their peaceful actions in the defence of human 
rights. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 23 November 2007 
</b> 
573. The Government stated that the internal affairs agencies of the Russian Federation are 
taking measures to prevent violations of copyright and related rights by carrying out regular 
checks of enterprises and organizations to determine whether they are using unlicensed </p>

computer software. Over nine months in 2007, the Department for the Prevention of 
Computer Crime of the Central Internal Affairs Department for Nizhny Novgorod province 
checked 47 organizations for compliance with legislation on intellectual property.  
 
574. On 29 August 2007, the Central Internal Affairs Department for Nizhny Novgorod 
province, in accordance with article 11, paragraph 1, subparagraphs 16 and 25, of the Militia 
Act, decided to inspect the financial, economic, entrepreneurial and commercial activities of 
the Tolerance Support Foundation, situated at 26 Korolenko St., room 5, in Nizhny Novgorod. 
On the same day, members of the Department for the Prevention of Computer Crime of the 
Central Internal Affairs Department, in the presence of witnesses and representatives of the 
Tolerance Support Foundation, Ms. O.A. Chelysheva and Mr. S.M. Dmitrievsky, in 
accordance with articles 11 and 23 of the Militia Act, inspected the premises of the 
Foundation with a view to discovering violations of Russian legislation on the protection of 
copyright and related rights. 
 
575. During the inspection, it was found that four base units in the office of the Tolerance 
Support Foundation were using pirated software. The inspection and confiscation of the 
articles were reported in accordance with legislation currently in force. When the Expert-
Criminalistic Centre of the Central Internal Affairs Department for Novgorod province 
examined the aforementioned base units, it found that the software installed was not licensed.  
 
576. According to the representative of the company for Privolzhsky federal district, Mr. 
V.G. Bunatyan, the damages caused by the Tolerance Support Fund to the Microsoft 
Corporation amounts to 75,870 roubles and 51 kopecks. On 1 October 2007, the investigative 
department for Nizhny Novgorod district of the investigative committee attached to the office 
of the procurator of the Russian Federation for Nizhny Novgorod province instituted criminal 
proceedings (case No. 35410) on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 146, 
paragraph 2 (Unlawful use of objects of copyright), of the Criminal Code of the Russian 
Federation. Proceedings in connection with the pretrial investigation of the criminal case were 
under way. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 29 November 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture 
</b> 
577. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Oleg Orlov</b>, head of the human rights organization Memorial, and three 
journalists from the Russian TV station REN TV, Mr <b>Artem Vysotskii, </b>Mr<b> Karen Sakhinov 
</b>and Mr<b> Stanislav Goriachikh</b>. According to the information received, during the night of 23 
to 24 November 2007, armed masked men in camouflage woke up Oleg Orlov, Artem 
Vysotskii, Karen Sakhinov and Stanislav Goriachikh at the &#8220;Assa&#8221; hotel in Nazran in 
Ingushetia. They took all their possessions from the hotel, including computers, money, 
notebooks, their clothes and mobile phones, and put plastic bags over their heads threatening 
to shoot them. The four men were then taken to an unknown place, where they were beaten 
and abandoned after two hours. As they had not been given time to dress or take their shoes 
before they left the hotel, they had to walk barefoot to the nearest police station in the village 
of Nesterovskoye, where they sought assistance. From there they were taken to the 
Sunzhenkoye police station where they reported formally on what had happened. On the 
morning of 24 November, the four men also told the police of Nazran about their abduction </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 154 
 
and ill-treatment. At the police station they were examined by a medical doctor who 
recommended that Artem Vysotskii should be urgently hospitalized. However, the police did 
not allow him and the other two journalists to leave until 1 p.m. Oleg Orlov was allowed to 
leave the police station at around 11.30 a.m.  
 
578. It was feared that this attack was an attempt to prevent the media and the human rights 
defender from monitoring and reporting about a demonstration, which was scheduled to take 
place in Nazran on that day, in which about 70 or 80 persons took part, vastly outnumbered 
by the police. During the demonstration, several of the persons, who protested against 
repressive actions by law enforcement officials including enforced disappearances, unlawful 
killings, torture and ill-treatment, were reportedly ill-treated. According to participants in the 
demonstration, Special Forces (OMON) fired in the air and beat several demonstrators with 
batons. The police detained several young men and took them to a police station. 
<b> 
Replies to communications sent previously</b> 
 
579. On 20 February 2007, the Government replied to a communication sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 8 September 2006 concerning the situation of the independent newspaper 
Permsky Obozrevatel and Mr. <b>Vladimir Korolyov </b>and Ms. <b>Evgeniya Silivanova</b>, journalists 
at said newspaper. According to the Government&#8217;s reply, the Perm Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is 
conducting a criminal investigation launched on 23 June 2006 into allegations that 
confidential information about the private and family life of Mr. Kotov was collected without 
his consent. Allegations of similar crimes against 14 other individuals were investigated, and 
the criminal charge of disclosing State secrets was brought against Mr. V.A. Korolyov. The 
evidence collected confirms that the website server on which information about citizens&#8217; 
private lives was collected belongs to a limited liability company, the Permsky Obozrevatel 
Media Group. Documents and electronic media were removed from the offices occupied by 
this company. The search of Mr. Korolev&#8217;s apartment on 22 August 2006 was conducted in 
accordance with the law governing criminal procedure on the basis of an order by the 
Sverdlovsky District Court in the city of Perm.  
 
580. Investigation into the case continues and the findings are under review. The 
Motovilikhinsky District Procurator&#8217;s Office in the city of Perm examined Ms. E.V. 
Silivanova&#8217;s complaint that Mr. A.R. Aramyan, an investigator from the Office, had behaved 
improperly and breached the Code of Criminal Procedure when summoning her to testify as a 
witness in the above-mentioned criminal case. It was established that the investigator acted in 
conformity with article 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 2 August 2006, in the 
course of a criminal investigation opened on 12 July 2006 by the Perm branch of the Federal 
Security Service (FSB), the offices of the Alfa group of security companies were investigated 
on charges of disclosing State secrets. The Alfa group is located in the same building as the 
Permsky Obozrevatel newspaper and was founded by the same person. The heads of both the 
Alfa Group and the newspaper were informed in advance. No search in the premises 
occupided by the newspaper was conducted.  
 
581. With regard to the edition of the Permsky Obozrevatel newspaper containing 
deliberate libels of a candidate for the Perm municipal administration, on 17 March 2006 the 
investigations department of the Perm internal affairs authority instituted criminal 
proceedings on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 129, paragraph 2, of the 
Criminal Code (defamation). On the investigator&#8217;s instructions, 24,519 copies of the </p>

newspaper were seized. The confiscated newspapers were examined and added to the file as 
material evidence in the case. The preliminary inquiry continues.

<b>Response from the Government sent on 25 June 2007 
</b> 
584. The Government transmitted the Police report regarding the incident and information 
concerning the follow up action that has been undertaken. In the night of 9 February 2007 at 
Medi Motel in Kimironko sector, Gasabo district in Kigali city, Mr.<b>Gasasira J. Bosco</b>, a 
journalist and director of the UMUVUGIZI publication was attacked by three people as he 
left the motel for his car. He was assaulted and sustained serious injuries. Eyewitnesses close 
to the scene of the incident confirmed hearing alarm raised by Mr.Gasasira and rushed for his 
rescue. They reported seeing three attackers fleeing from the scene of the incident. Two 
suspects reportedly fled on a motorcycle that had concealed number plates, while the third one 
who was armed with an iron bar, fled to the nearby bush where he was apprehended and later 
identified, his name being known to the Special Rapporteur. Another eyewitness who was on 
the second floor of the Medi Motel confirmed that she saw the three suspects mentioned 
above as they assaulted Mr. Gasasira. Immediately after the apprehension of the third suspect, 
the Police arrived and took him for questioning, while Mr.Gasasira was rushed to King Faisal 
hospital. 
 
585. Despite overwhelming evidence against him, the third suspect denies assaulting Mr. 
Gasasira. He argues that he heard the victim's alarm and intervened, disarming the attackers 
the iron bar they were using against the victim. Because of available evidence, the Police 
believe his arguments have no basis. The two other suspects are still at large and their identity 
is not yet known. The case file of the third suspect was handed to the prosecution on 12 
February 2007(case file n. RPGR 01100415/51/07/KGL/BG/MVK). The suspect appeared </p>

before the judge in the district court of Kacyiru on 16 February 2007. The judge ruled that he 
be detained provisionally (Court ruling DO 27/2007) at Kigali Central Prison pending further 
court hearings. The file is now in the Prosecutor General's office.

591. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement sur la situation de <b>M. 
Moussa Gu&#232;ye</b>, directeur de publication du quotidien priv&#233; &#171; L&#8217;Exclusif &#187; et <b>M. Justin 
Ndoye</b>, journaliste au m&#234;me quotidien. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, dans la soir&#233;e du 8 
octobre 2007, M. Gu&#232;ye aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; par cinq agents de la Division des investigations 
criminelles (DIC) sur la route en direction de Rufisque. Selon les sources, les agents auraient 
affirm&#233; &#234;tre &#224; la recherche du journaliste Justin Ndoye, dont un article &#233;voquant des &#171; sorties 
nocturnes &#187; du Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique aurait &#233;t&#233; publi&#233; au journal. Il semblerait que M. 
Ndoye, recherch&#233; par la police, &#233;tait en fuite au moment de l&#8217;envoi de la communication. 
Depuis le 8 octobre, le journal &#171; L&#8217;Exclusif &#187; aurait &#233;t&#233; ferm&#233; par les autorit&#233;s. Apr&#232;s son 
arrestation, M. Gu&#232;ye aurait refus&#233; de fournir des informations sur ses collaborateurs. Les 
agents auraient donc d&#233;cid&#233; de se rendre &#224; la r&#233;daction du journal o&#249; ils auraient emport&#233; les 
ordinateurs du quotidien. M. Gu&#232;ye aurait &#233;t&#233; frapp&#233; et amen&#233; &#224; la prison centrale de Dakar. Il

<b>Letter of allegations sent on 18 January 2007 
</b> 
594. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of 
<b>Radio Warsan</b>, a radio station based in the city of Baidoa. It is reported that on 7 January 
2007, the Transitional Federal Government decided the immediate closure of &#8220;Radio 
Warsan&#8221;. It seems that the reason for its closing is its independent editorial line, and that this 
was the fifth time it had been forced to close in recent times. Reports also indicate that on 24 
December 2006, the Transitional Federal Government inaugurated in Baidoa &#8220;Radio Bay&#8221;, 
also called the Voice of the Somali Republic, a radio station under its direct control, which 
was, at the time the communication was sent, the only radio broadcasting from the city seat of 
the Government. 
 
595. In the same communication, the Rapporteur referred to the case of journalist <b>Hassan 
Mohammed Abikar</b> from radio station &#8220;Voice of the Holy Quran&#8221;, based in Baidoa, who 
was allegedly held by governmental forces in an undisclosed location, with no charges 
brought against him, since 1 January 2007. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 2 May 2007 
</b> 
596. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of <b>Mr. 
Yahya Ali Farah</b>, a reporter with &#8220;Radio HornAfrik&#8221;, and <b>Mr. Abdi Dhaqane</b>, working for 
the same radio station and for the Nairobi Bureau of the international news agency Reuters, 
who were reportedly injured on 21 April when several artillery shells were fired at the studios 
of &#8220;Radio HornAfrik&#8221; in Mogadishu. Mr. Yahya Ali Farah suffered minor injuries, and Mr. 
Abdi Dhaqane was seriously injured. Reportedly, as a result of this attack the radio station 
was forced to temporarily shut down its operations. The Rapporteur expressed concern that 
this attack may represent an attempt to prevent both journalists from reporting on the human 
rights situation in Somalia. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 July 2007 
</b> 
597. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of  
<b>Radio Shabelle</b>, a major independent station in Mogadishu, which was reportedly raided four 
times by Somali Government troops on 7 and 8 July. It seems that these raids were a 
retaliation of the contents of a programme broadcasted by Radio Shabelle on a large-scale 
security operation by Government security forces in the Bakara market the preceding week, in 
reaction to a wave of lethal assaults in the area, during which some members of the military 
forces involved abused market merchants and local residents. It is reported that during the raid </p>

against the radio station, staff was threatened of death, equipment destroyed and live 
broadcasting disrupted. Newscaster <b>Abdinur Mohammed Kadie</b> and sports producer <b>Abdi 
Rashid Abdi Ahmad</b> were among the staff threatened. 
 
598. In the same communication, the Rapporteur reported that on 6 June 2007, Information 
Minister Madobe Nounow Mohamuda allegedly ordered three radio stations &#8211; <b>HornAfrik</b>, 
<b>Radio Shabelle</b> and <b>Quran Kariim</b> (Holy Koran) &#8211; to stop broadcasting, accusing them of 
supporting Islamists groups, violating press freedom and spreading chaos amongst the 
population. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 17 August 2007 
</b> 
599. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the deaths of 
<b>Mahad Ahmed Elmi</b>, Director of &#8220;Radio Capital Voice&#8221;, <b>Ali Iman Sharmarke</b>, Director of 
&#8220;Horn Afrik&#8221;, as well as the attack against <b>Abdihakin Omar Jimale</b>, journalist at &#8220;Radio 
Mogadishu&#8221;. According to the information received, Mr. Elmi was shot in the head by an 
unknown gunman in the village of Gubta, close to Mogadishu, dying later in hospital. Mr. 
Sharmarke was killed by a remotely-detonated bomb that exploded as his car passed when he 
was returning from Mr. Elmi&#8217;s funeral. Reportedly, another journalist in the car was injured 
and a third one was in a state of shock. Another journalist, Mr. Jimale, was allegedly wounded 
after he was shot in the shoulder by gunmen in the Yaqshid neighbourhood north of 
Mogadishu. He was reportedly hospitalized. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 5 September 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders 
</b> 
600. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr <b>Ali Moallim Isak</b>, Organising Secretary of the National 
Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ). Mr Ali Moallim Isak had been engaged in training and 
protection activities of Somali journalists and was involved in negotiations to release some of 
them. According to the information received, on 3 September 2007, Mr Ali Moallim Isak 
received death threats over the phone from an unidentified person who warned him to stop his 
human rights activities if he did not want to be killed. The caller reportedly stated that he 
knew where Mr Ali Moallim Isak lived and worked. Later that day, two armed men entered 
the premises of NUSOJ and asked for Mr Ali Moallim Isak, who, however, was not present at 
that time. Serious concern was expressed that the death threats against Mr Ali Moallim Isak 
may have been solely related to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression of journalists in Somalia. Further 
concern was expressed regarding recent reports of mounting violence against journalists in 
Somalia, a theme that was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of opinion and expression on 17 August 2007, subsequent to the murders of 
journalists Mahad Ahmed Elmi and Ali Iman Sharmarke. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 17 October 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</b> 
601. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of <b>Abdullah Ali Farah</b>, manager of Mogadishu Radio Simba, and <b>Mohamed </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 160 
 
<b>Farah</b>, a journalist at Radio Simba. According to the information received, on 11 October 
2007, Radio Simba broadcast an interview with Sheikh Robow, the military chief of the 
Islamic Courts. In the interview, Sheikh Robow claimed responsibility for a suicide car-bomb 
attack on an Ethiopian army checkpoint in the western city of Baidoa. After the broadcast, 
members of the Somali security services arrived at Radio Simba and arrested Abduallahi Ali 
Farah and Mohamed Farah, taking them to an undisclosed location. The radio station was 
closed by the authorities after their arrest.  In view of their alleged incommunicado detention 
at an undisclosed or unconfirmed location concern was expressed for the physical and mental 
integrity of Mr. Abduallahi Ali Farah and Mr. Mohamed Farah.

</b> 
603. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
the situation concerning a <b>demonstration of shack dwellers</b> in the eThekwini Municipality. 
According to the information received, on 28 September 2007, a group of civil society 
organizations representing shack dwellers in the eThekwini Municipality organized a march 
to deliver a memorandum to the Mayor presenting their views on housing and land issues that 
currently affect the city. According to reports, although it was legal and peaceful, the march 
was stopped by the police, which used water cannons, rubber bullets and stun grenades to 
disperse the protesters. Two participants were severely injured, one of which was allegedly 
struck by a rubber bullet at close range. Fourteen participants of the march were arrested 
during the manifestation and released after paying bail. They were due to be tried on 13 
November 2007 by the Durban Magistrate&#8217;s Court.

605. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation<b> </b>of<b> </b>Mr.<b> 
Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi</b>, former Projects Minister, who was reportedly arrested on 17 
March under the Misappropriation of Public Property Act, on the charge of misusing a 
government vehicle. On 27 March, a Magistrate Court refused his request to be released on 
bail. It is reported that Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi, together with National Heritage Minister 
<b>Anura Bandaranaike</b> and Ports Minister <b>Mangala Samaraweera</b> were stripped of their </p>

ministerial portfolios on 9 February 2007, allegedly in connection with their position with 
regard to the Government&#8217;s contacts with the LTTE and with regard to some cases of 
corruption. It seems that former Ports Minister Mangala Samaraweera left the country in 
March 2007 fearing that he could also be arrested. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation sent on 24 April 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to education  
 
</b>606. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government the situation<b> </b>of 
several students of the University of Jaffna, who have reportedly been the target of 
abductions, illegal detentions and killings. According to information received, on 3 January 
2007, <b>Mr. Arunakirinathan Niruparajh</b> student of the Faculty of Sciences was abducted by 
Army Officers. It is reported that at the time, Mr. Niruparajh&#8217;s family was moving residence. 
At about 11 a.m., Army officers carried out a cordon-and-search operation at the family&#8217;s new 
residence. Mr. Niruparajh went to the former residence, at around 2:30 p.m., but he did not 
return home.  Subsequently, University students organized a non-violent protest claiming the 
release of Mr. Arunakirinathan Niruparajh. He was subsequently released, reportedly with 
signs of torture. It is reported that the family has lodged a complaint before the Human Rights 
Commission. 
 
607. On 19 August 2006, <b>Mr. Sivarajah Paheerathan</b>, President of the Student Union of 
the University of Jaffna and student of the Faculty of Arts, was reportedly arrested by the 
Army. He was at the University students&#8217; common room when the Army came to conduct a 
search operation, and arrested him without any legal basis.  
 
608. On 18 November 2006, <b>Mr. Markandu Sasikumar</b>, student of the Faculty of Arts, 
was abducted. Mr. Sasikumar had gone to Pungudutheivu Navy camp in order to obtain 
military clearance to go out of Jaffna. He had left the camp and was waiting for a bus nearby 
when unidentified men in a pick up truck abducted him. The whereabouts of Mr. Sasikumar 
remained unknown. It is reported that his family lodged a complaint before the Human Rights 
Commission. 
 
609. On 18 February 2007, <b>Mr. Krishnan Kamalathas</b> tutor and student of the Faculty of 
Arts was killed. Mr. Kamalathas was on his way to give a private class at Varany, when he 
was reportedly stopped by Army officers near the Varany Army camp. The officers asked him 
to return home and he did so. While he was returning home, unknown men dressed in t-shirts 
and trousers opened fire at him. 
 
610. On 15 August 2006, <b>Mr. Sinnaiah Sivashankar</b>, a student at the Faculty of Sciences 
was murdered. He left the University hostel with a friend at around 12:20 p.m. to buy a soft 
drink in a shop nearby when unidentified men opened fire at them. Mr. Sivashankar family 
has reportedly lodged a complaint before the Human Rights Commission on 10 October 2006. 
To date, none had been arrested in connection with his killing.  
 
611. According to the information received, since August 2006 attacks against students from 
the Jaffna University belonging to the Tamil community have increased. They have had a 
negative impact on students&#8217; curricula which failed to start on two occasions, (i.e. on 19 
January and on 18 February 2007) as authorized by the University Council. In particular, it is 
feard that the abduction of Arunakirinathan Niruparajh and the killing of Krishnan </p>

Kamalathas have prevented the continuation of normal academic activities. Students also fear 
to be the target of another attack in the current pervasive climate of impunity.

2007. Mr Nilakshan was reportedly shot dead by two gunmen who entered his home during 
the early morning before the end of a night time curfew. It is reported that &#8220;Chaa&#8217;laram&#8221; is a 
publication linked to the Federation of Jaffna District students which is known for supporting 
Tamil nationalism. It was also reported that death threats were made in May 2007 against

625. According to relevant authorities, no murder of a person by the name <b>Thanikasalam 
Sarirooban</b> has been reported on or about 2 August 2007 in Jaffna District. The news editor 
of Daily Mirror confirmed that there was no journalist or media work by that name. 
 
626. On 1 August 2007, one Rajaratnam Sabadevan had complained at Jaffna Police station 
that his son <b>Sahathevan Nilakshan</b> who was an undergraduate at the Jaffna University was 
shot dead by an unknown gunman at about 5.30 a.m. On receipt of this complaint, officers of 
Jaffna Police visited the scene and conducted investigations, questioning the people in the 
vicinity, but could not trace any person who had witnessed this murder. All required norms of 
investigations have been followed by the officers of the Jaffna Police. There was no report of 
death threats received by the deceased as mentioned in the communication. Facts of this case 
have been reported in the Magistrate Court of Jaffna under case no.B 272/07 and inquiries are 
being continued to trace the suspects responsible  
 
627. On 21 August 2006, one Periyathambi Naguleshwari complained at Tellippalai Police 
Station that her brother <b>Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah</b> had fallen in his locked room and he is </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

motionless. On receipt of this complaint officers of Tellippalsi broke open the front and the 
bedroom doors of the residence and found Mr.Sunnathamby Sivamaharajah dead with injuries 
similar to gun shots. Officers of Tellippalai Police conducted investigations under the 
directions of the Magistrate of Jaffna and Senior Superintendent of Jaffna Division. The post 
mortem examination was held by the Jurisdiction Medical Officer of Jaffna and the cause of 
death was given as due to two shot injuries. Mr.<b> </b>Sivamaharajah was a former member of 
Parliament for Jaffna District from &#8220;Tamil Arasakattu&#8221; political party and was the former 
President of the Tellippalai Cooperative Society and the &#8220;Eelanadu&#8221; newspaper. On a 
directive of Inspector General of Police, the Criminal Investigation Department took over the 
investigations from Tellippalai; Police and preliminary investigations have revealed that on 20 
August 2006 at about 19.30hrs a lone gunman had shot at Mr. Sivamaharajah through a partly 
opened window of his room. Witnesses could not identify the suspect due to darkness in the 
area. The Police personnel manning the police post closest to the residence of the deceased 
stated that on this particular day around 19.30hrs they heard two sounds similar to gun shots 
and alerted their senior officers anticipating an attack from the LTTE.  
 
628. On 27 July 2007 one Mariyanayagarn Robinson complained at Atchchuveli Police that 
he and Mr. <b>Mariadas Manojanraj</b> were riding two motorcycles delivering newspaper and 
close to Rasa Veediya at around 03.40hrs, Mr. Mariadas, who was in front, got caught to a 
mine and died. On receipt of this complaint officers of Atchchuveli Police visited the scene 
and conducted investigations under the directions of Senior Superintendent of Police Jaffna 
Division. Police recovered six ball bearings from the scene of the crime. In conformity with 
forensic examinations the mine has been filled with C4 explosives and ball bearings have 
been added to cause maximum possible damage. In the recent past LTTE have used identical 
mines to kill Security Forces end Police personnel in Jaffna Division. It could be rationally 
inferred that the mine has been placed to target a Service or Police vehicle by the LTTE and it 
may have gone off accidentally. It is also pertinent to mention that since Security Forces and 
Police personnel are confined to their barracks in the night, LTTE cadres from demilitarized 
areas in Atchcuveli infiltrate the Government Control areas and place mines to target the 
security forces and the police. The mine has been positively identified as a mine used by the 
LTTE. 
 
629. On 2 July 2007 on receipt of information officers of Dehiwala Police recovered a body 
with gun shot injuries. Subsequent inquires led to the identification of the dead body as that of 
free lance journalist Mr. Sampath Lakmal De Silva. Officers of Dehiwala Police recovered the 
following items from the scene of the crime: (a) four empty casings of 9mm munitions; (b) 17 
mobile telephone cards; and (c) an identity card issued to journalists. 
 
630. On 2 May 2006 at about 19.45 hrs an unidentified armed gang entered the premises of 
&#8220;Uthayan&#8221; newspaper and opened fire, killing two persons and seriously injuring two others. 
The gang also caused extensive damage to the property and got away on three motorcycles. 
The two dead persons have been identified as Mr. <b>W.J. Sagaudas</b> a.k.a <b>Suresh Kumar</b> and 
Mr. <b>R Ranjith</b>, a. k.a.<b>Ranjith Kumar</b>. A.R.Udayakumar and N.Dayakaran sustained serious 
injuries. On the directive of Inspector General of Police the CID took over the investigations 
from Jaffna Police. The CID questioned eye witnesses, Uthayan employees and the military 
personnel. Inquiries revealed that at least seven men have been in the gang which entered the 
premises from the side entrance. Two were armed with T-56 rifles with folded butts, and 
armed with a pistol and another with a SMG. Witnesses have heard some of them speaking to 
each other in fluent Tamil in typical Jaffna Tamil accent and they have also spoken in broken </p>

Sinhala on their eve of departure.The assailants had opened fire at the military personnel 
manning the check point near Sivam Kovil on old KKS road when challenged to stop. The 
army retuned fire but the assailants escaped, leaving behind a T-56 rifle which had fallen 
down when they turned the bikes to escape. The weapon was taken into custody by the Army 
and later handed over to Police. This goes to confirm that the assailants had used military type 
weapons in this operation and have it planned well to avoid any counter attack by the security 
forces and also to implicate the Army, with a view to bring GOSL into disrepute in the eyes 
of the world community.  
 
On 24 January 2006 at around 06.45hrs, Mr.<b>Subramaniam Sugirdarajan</b> was shot dead by a

the scene and immediately conducted investigations under the supervision of Senior 
Superintendent of Police. Mrs. Suhair Rajan Maheswari, the wife of the deceased, stated that 
her husband was a tele clerk attached to the Trincomalee Port Authonty. Although several 
persons have been questioned in connection to this case, nobody was able to identify the 
assailant. The facts of this case have been reported to the Magistrate Court of Trincomalee 
under case 62/2006. Further inquiries are being continued by Trincomalee Police.

632. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of eight persons who took part in protests against the construction of the Kijbar dam. 
These eight persons are: Mr <b>Saad Mohamed Ahmed</b>, journalist with Ilaf weekly newspaper 
and activist on dam issue; two lawyers, namely Mr<b>. Imad Al Deen Murgani</b> and Mr. <b>Alam 
Al Deen Abdulghani</b>; Mr. <b>Abdulaziz Mohamed Ali Khairi</b>, engineer and head of foreign 
relations committee of the Kajbar Dam Popular Committee (a committee formed by the 
affected community which has not so far been recognized by the authorities); Mr. <b>Raafat 
Hassan Abbas</b>, information officer in the Khartoum support committee of the Kajbar Dam 
Popular Committee, Dr. <b>Mohamed Jalal Ahmed Hashim</b>, a leader of the Mahas community; 
Mr. <b>Abdallah Abdelgayoum</b>, a member of the Mahas community and former National 
Security officer; and Mr. <b>Osman Osman</b>, driver.  
 
633. According to the information received, on 13 June 2007 four persons were reportedly 
killed and nine other civilians were injured when police used violence to disperse a protest by 
members of the Nubian population opposed to the building of the Kijbar Dam. Five of the 
aforementioned were arrested on the same day in Dongola on their way to investigate and 
report on the demonstrations and the violence. After being questioned about the purpose of 
their trip, the five men were arrested and were being detained in the National Security Section </p>

in Kober prison. Mr. Raafat Hassan Abbas was arrested by National Security officers at a 
private house in El-Dim, southern Khartoum, at 2 a.m. on 15 June 2007. He was believed to 
be in the custody of Khartoum State Security in Riyad, but a member of his family had been 
denied permission to visit him. Dr. Mohamed Jalal Ahmed Hashim was arrested at his home 
in Riyad after participation in a press conference organized by the SPLM on 16 June 2007. 
His whereabouts were unknown.  
 
634. On 20 June, Mr. Saad Mohamed Ahmed was arrested at his office in Khartoum and was 
being detained in the National Security Section in Kober prison. None of the detainees had 
been allowed to contact their families or a lawyer. Concern was expressed that the arrest and 
detention of the aforementioned persons may be related to their peaceful activities in defence 
of the human rights of the people protesting against the construction of the Kijbar dam. In 
view of the incommunicado detention of the aforementioned the mandate-holders were further 
seriously concerned that they might be at imminent risk of torture or other treatment likely to 
cause grave damage to their physical and mental health. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 17 September 2007 
</b> 
635. The Government stated that the detainees had been arrested for incitement of mobs by 
security authorities under preventative measures under the provisions of the National Security 
Act in order to stop the escalation of violence surrounding the dam project. The letter further 
stated that all the detainees had been treated humanely and according to the law while in 
detention and that all had been released on 19 August 2007, except Dr Mohamed Jalal 
Hashim, who was released on 24 August 2007.

human rights defenders 
 
</b>636. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr. <b>Osman Ibrahim</b>, spokesperson for an organisation called &#8220;Committee 
against the Kajbar Dam&#8221;. According to the information received, Mr. Osman Ibrahim was 
arrested in the early morning of 20 July 2007 by police officers at his home in Farraig village, 
Halfa municipality, Northern Sudan. No arrest warrant was produced and no reasons were 
given for Mr. Ibrahim&#8217;s removal to an unknown location. His arrest followed incidents on 13 
June 2007, when Sudanese security forces allegedly killed and injured civilians in the Farraig 
village by shooting at them during a non-violent demonstration against the construction of the 
Kajbar Dam in the area. On that occasion, several individuals were arrested and detained in 
Dongola, the capital of the northern State, and in Khartoum. Concern was expressed that the 
arrest and detention of Mr. Osman Ibrahim may have been in reprisal for his activities in 
defense of the human rights of communities at risk of being affected by the Kajbar Dam. In 
view of Mr. Ibrahim&#8217;s incommunicado detention at an undisclosed place further concern was 
expressed regarding his physical and mental integrity.

<b>Response from the Government sent on 29 August 2007 
</b> 
637. The Government stated that Mr <b>Osman Ibrahim </b>had been released along with the 
other men detained in relation to the Kajbar Dam protests. As outlined in the response to the 
communication of 22 June 2007, Dr Mohamed Jalal Hashim was the last detainee to be 
released on 29 August. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 September jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</b>  
638. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government the <b>killings of 
protestors by the security forces</b> in connection with the construction of a hydropower dam 
in the Kajbar area, northern State. According to information received, on 13 June 2007, 
Sudanese security forces shot dead four civilians and injured eleven close to the Kajbar Dam 
site in the Nubia area of northern Sudan. It was reported that five hundred protestors set out 
on a protest march from the hamlet of Jeddi heading heading for authorities based in Sabu, to 
hand over a memorandum apparently in light of the fact that they been neither consulted nor 
informed about the commencement of the dam construction. Those shot dead were named as 
<b>Abdelmuezz Mohamed Abdelrahim, Mohamed Faqir Mohamed Sid Ahmed, Al Sadeg 
Salim, and Sheikh Eddin Haj Ahmed</b>.  It was reported that three of the four who died were 
shot in the head, the remaining person in the chest. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 29 November jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders 
</b> 
639. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Mr. <b>Faisal al Bagir</b>, a human rights activist with the Sudan 
Organization Against Torture (SOAT), Ms. <b>Lemia al Jaili</b> <b>Abubakr</b>, a journalist from 
Khartoum Centre for Human Rights, and Ms. <b>Sabah Mohamed Adam</b>, a journalist working 
for Al-Ayyam who were reportedly summoned and questioned by members of the National 
Intelligence and Security Services (NISS). Information was also received by the mandate-
holders concerning Mr. <b>Amir Mohamed Suleiman</b>, chairperson of the Khartoum Center for 
Human Rights and Mr. <b>Mashair Abdullah Omer</b>, financial officer of the Center, Ms. 
<b>Madiha Abdullah</b>, journalist with the daily newspaper al-Ayyam and collaborator of the al-
Laq Press Centre, a NGO that provides training for journalists, and Dr. <b>Nagib Nagmeldin</b>, 
former coordinator of the Sudan Organization Against Torture.  
 
640. According to the information received, on 4 November, Mr. al Bagir, Ms. Abubakr and 
Ms. Adam were summoned to appear in the office of the political department of the NISS in 
the Bahri district of Khartoum the following morning. Upon their arrival, they were taken to a 
room where they were kept waiting, in the presence of a security official, for six hours. A 
general subsequently informed them that their questioning would be postponed for the 
following morning. On 6 November, they were reportedly questioned about different human 
rights and journalist groups in whose activities they participate, or whose activities they know 
about, among them SOAT, the Khartoum Centre for Human Rights, and a group of journalists 
working on freedom of the press. They were reportedly asked about the organizations' 
structures, their sources of funding and the activities they conduct. They were released 
without charge at noon.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

641. On 21 November, Messrs Suleiman and Omer were ordered by two NISS officials to 
follow them to NISS offices in North Khartoum, where they were detained for eight hours and 
questioned about personal matters as well as regarding the finance and administrative 
structure of the Karthoum Center for Human Rights. On the same day, Ms Madiha Abdullah 
and Dr Nagib Nagmeldin were also summoned to the NISS offices, where they faced similar 
questioning. Concern was expressed that the summoning and interrogation of the 
aforementioned persons may be directly linked to their peaceful activities in defence of 
human rights. 
 
<b>Letter of allegation sent on 5 December 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to freedom of religion and belief   
 
</b>642. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government the situation of 
<b>Gillian Gibbons</b>, a 54 years old English teacher from Liverpool, living in Sudan. According 
to information received, on 25 November 2007, Ms. Gibbons was arrested at her home in 
Khartoum, where she teaches at a British International School. A court in Khartoum on 29 
November 2007 found her guilty of &#8220;insulting the faith of Muslims&#8221; and sentenced her to 15 
days in prison followed by deportation. Prosecutors had called for her conviction on charges 
of inciting religious hatred, which carries a punishment of up to 40 lashes, six months in 
prison and a fine. Allegedly, in September, Ms. Gibbons had asked her pupils to vote a name 
for a teddy bear as part of the class&#8217;s study of animals and they named it &#8220;Muhammad&#8221;. 
Subsequently an office assistant complained to the Ministry of Education and Ms. Gibbons 
was accused of blasphemy for allowing her pupils to name a teddy bear with the Prophet&#8217;s 
name. On 30 November 2007, thousands of protesters demonstrated in Khartoum, claiming 
the 15-day prison sentence was too lenient. Since protesters have reportedly called for the 
execution of Ms. Gibbons, serious concern was expressed at her safety. Further reports 
indicate that Ms. Gibbons was given a presidential pardon on 3 December 2007. 
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>643. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s responses to his

645. The cases of Mr &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali and of Mr Husam &#8216;Ali Mulhim were already the subject 
matter of an urgent appeal by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary 
detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 21 February 2006. While appreciating the 
response of the Government of 30 August 2006 in these cases, the independent experts 
requested further clarification in view of new information received. In the Government&#8217;s reply 
it is explained that both persons took part in activities hostile to the State and incited public 
unrest using the Internet, which are acts penalized by article 307 of the Syrian Criminal Code 
as &#8220;any act, writing or correspondence aimed at, or resulting in, the creation of confessional or 
racial strife or encouragement of conflict between the confessional groups and different ethnic 
communities of the nation.&#8221; According to the Government, these two persons have further 
established a cell of an organization that advocates acts of terrorism against society and the 
State and solicits support from abroad, which is punishable under articles 306 and 364 of the 
Syrian Criminal Code. They have accordingly been arraigned before the Higher State Security 
Court on 4 April 2006. In addition to our request for additional information on the case of Mr 
&#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali and Mr Husam &#8216;Ali Mulhim we would also like to draw Your Government&#8217;s 
attention to information we have received on the other persons concerned.  
 
646. According to new allegations received, the above mentioned individuals were arrested 
between 26 January and 18 March 2006 and were detained incommunicado since, three 
months of which in solitary confinement. While in detention they were ill-treated during 
interrogation at the Air Force Intelligence Branch in the town of Harast near Damascus. The 
trial of the eight persons commenced on 26 November 2006 before the Higher State Security 
Court in Damascus. Each defendant denied the charges brought against him in court, since 
their confessions had been obtained by resorting to ill-treatment. The eight individuals named 
above had been denied access to counsel until the hearing in court, where they were able to 
meet briefly with their lawyers, in the presence of guards. At least one of the persons was 
allowed to meet with his parents inside the courtroom for three minutes with a guard present. 
The families of the defendants were not permitted to provide them with warm clothing on the 
occasion of the court hearing in order to protect them from the chilly conditions in prison. The 
trial was adjourned until 14 January 2007. 
 
647. According to the Government&#8217;s reply Mr &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali and Mr Husam &#8216;Ali Mulhim 
were charged under articles 306, 307 and 364 of the Syrian Criminal Code. Reportedly 
however, all except Mr &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali were charged under article 278 of the Syrian Criminal 
Code, which makes it a criminal offence to take action or make a written statement or speech 
which could endanger the State or harm its relationship with a foreign country, or expose it to 
the risk of hostile action by that country. Furthermore, all eight were reportedly charged under 
article 287 of the Syrian Criminal Code, which penalizes the &#8220;broadcasting of false news 
considered to be harmful to the State&#8221;. During the hearing the judge accused the defendants of 
having established links with an opposition party based outside Syria.  
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 27 April 2007 
</b> 
648. In its reply, the government indicated that: 
 
</p>
<p>(a) Mr. Ali Nizar Ali was released pursuant to a presidential amnesty issued on the 
occasion of Id al-Adha. He had been convicted under article 287 of the Syrian </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 170 
 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code for broadcasting false information regarded as damaging to the 
State. 
</p>
<p>(b) As for the remaining persons mentioned above, they were referred to the competent 
court after a public prosecution case was brought against them, under article 287 of 
the Syrian Criminal Code, for committing criminal offences involving acts that are 
prohibited by the Government, since such acts could expose the Syrian Arab 
Republic to the threat of hostilities and damage its relations with foreign States. 
These individuals are currently on trial.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 16 May jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers 
</b> 
649. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Anwar al-Bunni</b>, a lawyer and human rights activist, currently held at Adra 
prison near Damascus. He was the subject of previous communications sent out 19 May, 2 
June and 25 October 2006, to which no answers from the Government had so far been 
received.  
 
650. According to new information received, on 24 April 2007, Mr Anwar al-Bunni was 
sentenced to 5 years in prison by the First Damascus Criminal Court for &#8220;spreading false or 
exaggerated information that weaken the spirit of the nation,&#8221; and ordered to pay a fine of 
US$2,000 to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour for his membership in an unlicensed 
human rights centre. Earlier, Mr al-Bunni had been charged with &#8220;spreading false news&#8221; for a 
statement he had made about the inhumane conditions that led to the death of a man in a 
Syrian prison. Furthermore, on 25 January 2007, prison guards made Mr al-Bunni crawl on 
the ground and forcibly shaved his head as punishment during a crackdown on a ward where 
criminal detainees had mounted a protest after being excluded from a recent amnesty. Also, 
on 31 December 2006, Mr al-Bunni was pushed down some stairs and then beaten up by 
another detainee in the presence of prison guards who failed to intervene. Concern was 
expressed that the arrest and conviction of Mr al-Bunni may have been in reprisal for his 
legitimate and peaceful work as a lawyer and human rights activist. Concern was also 
expressed about the repeated ill-treatment of Mr. al-Bunni in detention. 
<b> 
Letter of allegations sent on 25 May jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders</b> 
 
651. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government the 
situation of Mr <b>Michel Kilo</b>, journalist and president of the Organisation for the Defence of 
Freedom of Speech and Press, Mr <b>Mahmoud Issa</b>, an opposition member, Mr <b>Hasan al-
Shummar</b>, a leading member of the Democratic National Community, Mr <b>Khaleel Hussein</b>, 
president of the Public Relations Office at the Kurd Future Trend, and Mr <b>Kamal Labwani</b>, 
head of the Liberal Democratic Party and member of the Administration Board of the 
Committees for the Defense of Human Rights. Mr Kilo was the subject of several urgent 
appeals sent on 17 May 2006, on 2 June 2006 and on 25 October 2006. Mr Mahmoud Issa 
was the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by several mandate-holders on 19 May 2005 and 
another joint urgent appeal sent by mandate-holders on 2 June 2006. Mr Hussein&#8217;s case was 
included in the communications sent by mandate-holders on 17 May 2006 and on 2 June 
2006. Mr Kamal Labwani was the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent on 11 November 2005.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 171 
 
 
652. According to the information received, on 13 May 2007, Mr Michel Kilo and Mr 
Mahmoud Issa were sentenced to three years in prison for &quot;weakening the national ethic&quot;. 
Both men were reportedly arrested in May 2006, after signing the Damascus-Beirut 
Declaration, a petition signed by more than 300 intellectuals and human rights defenders from 
Syria and Lebanon, calling for the improvement of the relationships between both countries. 
On the same day Mr Hasan al-Shummar, and Mr Khaleel Hussein were also sentenced to ten 
years in prison for &quot;conspiring with a foreign country&quot;. They were reportedly sentenced 
without trial. On 10 May 2007, Mr Kamal Lubwani was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment 
on charges of &quot;contact with a foreign entity&quot; and &quot;encouraging attacks against Syria&quot;. He had 
been arrested on 8 November 2005 at Damascus Airport. Concern was expressed that the 
detention and sentences against Mr Michel Kilo, Mr Mahmoud Issa, Mr Hasan al-Shummar, 
Mr Khaleel Hussein and Mr Kamal Labwani may represent an attempt to prevent them from 
carrying out their peaceful human rights activities, in particular their work advocating the 
right to freedom of expression. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 14 August 2007</b> 
 
653. The Government stated that Mr. Kamal Al-Labwani had set up an illegal political 
organization without permission from the relevant authorities, and that this was punishable 
under Syrian law in accordance with article 288 of the Criminal Code. The letter further stated 
that he had established personal links with official agencies abroad and secretly received 
material assistance from foreign organizations hostile to Syria, and that this was also 
punishable under Syrian law in accordance with article 264 of the Criminal Code.  
 
654. The government response asserted that Mr. Al-Labwani had published spurious 
information on a website of a kind likely to damage the reputation of the State locally and 
internationally, and that this was punishable under Syrian law in accordance with articles 286 
and 287 of the Criminal Code. The Office of the Public Prosecutor in Damascus initiated 
criminal proceedings against Mr. Kamal Al-Labwani for the crimes of damaging the 
reputation of the State and weakening national morale and unity. Mr. Al-Labwani was 
interrogated on 12 November 2005 with his legal representatives in attendance. A decision 
was taken to issue a detention order and to remand him in Damascus Central Prison for the 
crimes with which he was charged.  
 
655. The Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic thanked the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders for 
the concern that they had expressed regarding this matter but wished to confirm that the 
reasons for Mr. Al-Labwani&#8217;s detention were not related to his peaceful calls for democratic 
reform in Syria. The letter stated that he was a Syrian citizen and was protected by Syrian law 
from torture or any ill-treatment and allowed regular visits from his lawyers and members of 
his family. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 15 August 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture 
</b> 
656. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government the situation of 
<b>Saif Al-Khayat</b>, an Iraqi journalist working for the Japanese news agency &#8220;Jihi Press&#8221; bureau </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 172 
 
in Damascus. According to the information received, Saif Al-Khayat travelled to Syria to 
work as a member of the local Jihi Press team. Before receiving permission to work in the 
country, Mr. Al-Khayat was reportedly questioned more than once by Syria&#8217;s Political 
Security concerning the nature of his journalism, his political positions and previous work in 
Iraq. On 19 June 2007, after he wrote two news reports about the presidential referendum in 
Syria, a number of Syrian Political Security personnel allegedly raided his apartment and 
arrested him. According to reports received, he was taken to Branch 701 of the Political 
Security&#8217;s headquarters, where he was allegedly told that the two reports were not satisfactory 
to Syrian authorities. He reportedly suffered physical assault and was forced to sign a 
document testifying that he would leave the country within three days. 
<b> 
Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
657. In a letter dated 13 February 2007, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
responded to an urgent appeal dated 23 August 2006, sent by Special Representative, together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
concerning Mr. <b>Ali Shahabi</b>. The letter stated that Mr. Ali Shahabi had been arrested on 10 
August 2006 and brought before the courts pursuant to article 278 of the Criminal Code for 
establishing a secret association, for infringing the laws and regulations, and for engaging in 
this association&#8217;s activities without an official permit from the competent institutions. This 
charge was the core component of an offence under article 288 of the General Criminal Code. 
Mr. Al-Shahabi was, in the view of the government, engaged in clandestine activities, 
distributing unlicensed publications of a kind likely to make Syria vulnerable to attack, to 
sour its relations with foreign States and to leave Syrians or their activities open to revenge 
attacks.  
 
658. The government added that many Syrians living in Lebanon had been physically 
attacked and some had died at the hands of Lebanese nationals, and further stated that Syrian 
courts would have the final say as to whether Mr Shahabi would be convicted or acquitted in 
accordance with the laws and regulations in force in Syria. 
 
659. On 15 March 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 4 October 2006 concerning Mr. <b>Habib Saleh</b>, writer and journalist for the 
Lebanese daily An-Nahar who wasa sentenced to 16 years&#8217; imprisonment by a military court 
in Hamas. In its reply, Mr. Habib Saleh was arrested on 26 May 2006 for publishing false 
information about the country. He was brought before a regular court and convicted after a 
trial in which all the procedures laid down in the laws in force in Syria on the conduct of 
criminal proceedings were respected and Mr. Saleh was attended by his defence counsel. The 
court sentenced him to five years&#8217; imprisonment with hard labour and stripped him of his civil 
rights. Mr. Saleh is currently serving his sentence in prison, benefits from full legal 
guarantees, is being treated well and receives free health care, just like any other prisoner. 
 
<b>Observations

communications of 23 August 2006, 4 October 2006, 8 January 2007 and 25 May 2007. He 
regrets that he has not received a response to his other communications sent in 2007.

661. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government the situation of Ms <b>Angkhana Neelaphaijit</b>, wife of human rights lawyer Mr 
Somchai Neelaphaijit. Ms Neelaphaijit was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression

complaint with the Central Administrative Court regarding the failure by the police to 
investigate her husband&#8217;s disappearance three years ago. He was allegedly abducted by 
members of the police and his case remains unresolved. The complaint was lodged against 
Pol.Gen.Seripisuth Themiyavet in his capacity as National Chief of Police. Later that day, 
Pol. Gen. Seripisuth Themiyavet was quoted in the online newspaper Manager, as saying that 
Ms Neelaphaijit should be prevented from enquiring further into her husband&#8217;s case, and that 
she should not &#8220;trust other people too much&#8221;. He also warned that she would make an enemy 
of him. Ms Neelaphaijit had stated in an article published that morning in the Bangkok Post 
that those responsible for the abduction of her husband were still on duty and that they 
continued to use their positions of power to thwart justice.  
 
663. In February 2007, after Pol. Gen. Seripisuth Themiyavet was promoted, he appointed 
Pol. Gen. Sombat Amornivat as one of his Deputy Officers. Pol. Gen. Sombat Amornivat was 
the former Director of Special Investigations, who allegedly obstructed an investigation into 
the case of Mr Somchi Neelaphaijit, and who was later dismissed and transferred to the 
Ministry of Justice. Concern was expressed that the comments allegedly made by the acting 
Chief of Police form part of an ongoing pattern to discredit human rights defenders in 
Thailand. Further concern was expressed for the safety of Ms Neelaphaijit following the 
alleged remarks made by the acting Chief of Police.

a non-governmental organisation advocating the promotion of democracy through peaceful 
means. 
 
665. According to information received, on 22 July 2007, the UDD organised a peaceful 
protest in which 30,000 protesters participated. The aim of the protest was to march to the 
residence of the Privy Council President General Prem Tinsulanonda and call for his 
resignation, due to his alleged involvement in the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 19 September 2006. The 
protesters set off from Sanam Luang at 2.00pm and were prevented from continuing on two 
occasions. They negotiated with the police present at the scene and were permitted to proceed, 
arriving at the residence of General Prem Tinsulanonda&#8217;s residence at approximately 5.00pm. 
The protesters then set up the stage from which speakers were to address the crowd. At 
approximately 9.00pm, several hundred policemen allegedly arrived; armed with anti-riot 
gear, including shields, batons, pepper spray and tear gas, which they were reported to have 
used in order to disperse the crowd.  
 
666. It was also alleged that military personnel were among the riot police and that there 
were military troops on standby. According to reports, forty-two people were injured in the 
struggle that ensued. The UDD then decided to retreat to Sanam Luang. Nonetheless, the 
following UDD&#8217;s nine leaders were arrested: Mr Jaran Ditapichai, Mr Chatuporn Promphan, 
Mr Jakrapob Penkair, and Mr Nattawut Saiku, Mr Viphuthalaeng Pattanaphunthar, Dr.Weng 
Tojirakar, Mr Manit Jitjanklab, Mr Apinant Vinyachai, and Mr Jaran Ditapichai. They were 
all later released on bail, but had to report to the police on a regular basis. Concern was 
expressed that the arrest and detention of the nine aforementioned UDD leaders may have 
been related to their peaceful activities in defense of human rights. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 29 November 2007 
</b> 
667. The Government stated that exercising the rights to assemble had to be in conformity 
with the law and not adversely affect public safety, public order, or the rights and freedom of 
others. The protesters caused damage to public and private property, injuring more than 250 
people, over 200 of whom were police officers. Only after three failed attempts to persuade 
the protesters to end their rally, and with the rally continuing for over seven hours, did the 
police use tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowd at 23.00. They carried only riot 
shields and batons that they had been strictly instructed to use only in self-defense. The rally 
came to an end without the police using force against the people.  
 
668. The Government further stated that requests for arrest warrants had been made to the 
court for key leaders of the protest for inflicting bodily harm against police officers carrying 
out their duty and that due process would be followed to ensure justice for both officers and 
protestors.

Rapporteur on 11 September 2006 concerning Mr. Asda Jayanama, former Ambassador of 
Thailand to the United Nations, who was sued for defamation by the Deputy Prime Minister. 
In its response, the Government transmitted the information that the allegation submitted by 
the Special Rapporteur was accurate, but that Dr. Surakiart Sathirathai is no longer the Deputy 
Prime Minister of Thailand and no longer holds any political office. Mr. Asda has not lodged </p>

expression, but that its exercise is subject to certain restrictions as stipulated by the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. By virtue of Section 327 of Thailand&#8217;s 
Penal Code, defamation is punishable, with certain exceptions. The Government further 
emphasized that the right to freedom of opinion and expression is well protected under Thai 
laws and that the defamation suit is by no means a violation of human rights as alleged. It is 
up to the court of justice to decide whether this defamation lawsuit will succeeed.<b> Follow-up

Letter of allegations sent on 27 April 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to freedom of religion and belief</b>  
 
677. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they 
had received regarding <b>three Christian employees of the Zirve publishing house</b> who 
distributed bibles in Malatya, a city in eastern Anatolia, and who on 18 April 2007 were found 
dead with their throats slit and their hands and legs bound. Allegedly, one man was still alive 
when found, was taken to the hospital but died later. Reportedly, one of the victims was the 
director of the publishing house. According to the information received, the Zirve publishing 
house prints bibles and Christian literature. Its employees had reportedly been the target of 
threats and a demonstration by nationalists accusing them of proselytism. Concern is 
expressed that these killings may be in connection with their freedom of expression and 
freedom of religion or belief. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 25 June 2007 
 
</b>678. The Government indicated that the incident involving the <b>three Christian employees 
of the Zirve publishing house</b> has prompted a great reaction in all segments of the society in 
Turkey. The perpetrators of this crime were captured and brought to justice soon after the 
incident. Freedom of religious belief and conscience is firmly safeguarded by the Turkish 
Constitution and the relevant legislation. Equality before the law and the prohibition of all 
forms of discrimination are enshrined as fundamental principles of the Republic in the 
Turkish Constitution. The religious rights of non Muslim citizens are further protected in 
accordance with the Lausanne Peace Treaty. There are more than 300 places of worship 
belonging to non- Muslim communities, including 53 churches run by foreigners residing in 
Turkey. As of December 2006, 122 foreign clergymen have been registered with working 
permit to serve in places of worship. 
 
679. The Government informed that the dissemination of religious beliefs is not prohibited 
under Turkish Law, contrary to the suggestions made in connection with the last incident. 
Indeed, preventing a person from disseminating or expressing their religious beliefs through 
use of force or threat constitutes an offence according to the Turkish Penal Code. The 
Government also sent an information note on the case. According to this note, it is reported 
that on 18 April 2007 the Directorate for Security of Malatya received a phone call from a 
person who reported that he was concerned about his friends working at the Zirve Publishing 
House and that he could not enter its premises as the door was not answered for a long time 
despite the fact that he heard noises coming from inside. The law enforcement officials 
immediately responded to the call and arrived at the premises of the Zirve Publishing House. 
While the officials were trying to break the lock of the door, a man was seen jumping from the 
balcony. The law enforcement officials, who later entered the flat, discovered three men lying 
on the floor with their hands and legs bound and seriously injured. A medical team was </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 178 
 
immediately dispatched to the crime scene. Despite the necessary medical intervention, the 
German citizen Mr. Tilman Ekkehart Geske and Mr. Necati Aydin, lost their lives at the scene 
due to the serious injuries they had sustained as result of the attacks. The third victim of the 
assault, Mr. Ugur Y&#252;ksel, who was found alive, was transferred to the nearest hospital but 
could not be saved since he was heavily injured. 
 
680. The five suspects, who were trying to escape, were apprehended by the law 
enforcement authorities at the crime scene together with the weapons used in the crimes. An 
investigation was immediately launched in connection with the murder. A total of 13 persons, 
8 of whom had direct links with those apprehended at the crime scene, were detained for their 
suspected involvement in the incident. The four suspects were arrested on the charges of 
murder, accomplicing to murder, depriving a person of liberty as well as terrorist charges 
under the Anti-terror law No. 3713. They are currently in Malatya E- Type Prison. The fifth 
suspect, who jumped from the balcony, was arrested on 19 May 2007 and sent to the same 
prison after he received medical treatment in the hospital. Further eight persons were later 
released, facing trial for their suspected involvement in the incident. The investigation is still 
under way. 
 
681. During the investigation, the families of the deceased reported to the authorities that 
they did not receive any threats prior to their relatives&#8217; murder and there was nothing to 
suggest that their lives were in danger. Close friends and business partners of the deceased, 
also confirmed in their statements to the authorities that to their knowledge the deceased did 
not face an apparent threat, otherwise they would have taken precaution both in their private 
and business lives and would have reported any threats to the relevant authorities, which was 
apparently not the case. 
 
682. Upon the request for protection by the wife of Mr. Geske, the family has been offered 
protection by the law enforcement officials, who accompany their children to school. The 
house of the other deceased, Mr. Aydin, has also been provided with protection. The Zirve 
Publishing House is under 24-hour protection by the security forces. After this incident, the 
law enforcement agencies conducted an inquiry in Malatya in order to identify as to whether 
the non-Muslim community is facing any similar threat due to their religion or sect. As a 
result, neither a threat nor an application for protection was reported to the authorities, except 
for a priest, who was rendered a protection order upon his application solely based on the last 
incident.<b> 
</b> 
683. Regarding compensation for the victims or their families to redress the damages or 
losses that they sustain as a result of serious crimes, the Government informs that no such 
compensation scheme exists. However, individuals are entitled to claim compensation before 
the courts for any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages as a result of any crime as well as 
other injurious acts. Judicial assistance is provided for those who are in need. The 
administrative authorities are also liable for any negligence which may be attributed in such 
instances and can be sued for compensation.<b> 
</b> 
<b>Letter of allegation sent on 9 November 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights defenders 
</b> 
684. The Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative brought to the attention of the 
Government information they had received regarding Mr <b>Ethem Acikalin</b>, President of the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 179 
 
Human Rights Association (Insan Haklari Dernegi - IHD), Mr <b>Mustafa Bagcicek</b>, Secretary 
General, and Mr <b>H&#252;seyin Beyaz</b>, Financial Secretary. According to the information received, 
on 7 June 2007, Mr Ethem Acikalin, Mr Mustafa Bagcicek, and Mr H&#252;seyin Beyaz were 
sentenced by the Adana Criminal Court n&#176;1 to two years and eight months&#8217; imprisonment for 
&#8220;inciting hatred and hostility&#8221; and &#8220;praising crime and criminals&#8221; (Article 215 of the Criminal 
Code).  
 
685. Mr Ethem Acikalin, Mr Mustafa Bagcicek, and Mr H&#252;seyin Beyaz organized a 
demonstration in 2005 criticizing the &#8220;Return to Life&#8221; military operations of December 2000 
and calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the alleged violations connected to the 
operations. They also issued a press release on the occasion of the demonstration, criticizing 
the conditions of detention of Kurdish leader Abdullah &#214;calan, who was reportedly being 
kept in solitary confinement. On the same day, the three men appealed their sentence before 
the Appeal Court in Ankara (Yargitay). They were reportedly due to remain free until the 
decision of the court, expected to be taken during the first semester of 2008. Concern was 
expressed that the sentencing of Mr Ethem Acikalin, Mr Mustafa Bagcicek, and Mr H&#252;seyin 
Beyaz may be linked to their peaceful activities in defence of human rights. 
 
<b>Responses from the Government sent on 8 January 2008  
</b> 
686. The Government stated that the subjects of the communication had been convicted of 
offenses against article 215 (praising a crime or criminal) and 216/1 (incitement to hatred and 
enmity) of the Turkish Penal Code. The government letter stated that a declaration distributed 
at the gathering on 18 December 2005 praised the ringleader of the terrorist organization 
PKK/KONGRA-GEL, Abdullah &#214;calan, incited citizens of Kurdish origin to breed enmity 
against others and called on the to resort to violence in the context of the &#8216;Return to Life&#8217; 
operation. Following their conviction on these charges, the aforementioned lodged an appeal 
with the Court of Cassation against the verdict of the First Court of Adana, and the appeal 
case was underway at time of writing. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 21 November 2007 
</b> 
687. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of Mr. 
<b>Faruk Cakir</b>, editor-in-chief of the &#8220;Yeni Asya&#8221; newspaper, who was reportedly indicted on 
25 July 2005 after his newspaper published articles claiming possible links between the 
attacks on the 2nd Chamber of the Council of State in Ankara in May 2006 and the discovery 
of a weapons arsenal in a house in Istambul. In his indictment, Mr. Cakir, as editor-in-chief, 
was deemed responsible for the content of the articles, which were published as unsigned 
pieces. He was accused of violating Article 285 of the Penal Code, on violation of secrecy, 
and Article 11 of the Press Law, which defines criminal responsibility in press institutions. He 
allegedly faced up to 4.5 years in prison. 
<b> 
Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>688. In a letter dated 25 May 2007, the Government of Turkey responded to an urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers on 5 April 2006, concerning remarks made by Ms. <b>Eren Keskin</b>, a member of 
the Human Rights Association (Insan Haklari Dernegi, IHD), alleging incidents of sexual </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 180 
 
violence against women perpetrated by members of the Turkish Armed Forces. The letter 
stated that the Court considered if Me Keskin&#8217;s comments fell within the limits of criticism as 
safeguarded in article 301(4) of the Turkish Penal Code. However, Ms Keskin&#8217;s comments 
were found to be motivated by a desire to publicly denigrate the institution of the armed 
forces, her allegations were found to be baseless and she was accordingly fined 6000 Turkish 
Lira 
 
689. On 4 April 2007, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 16 June 2006 concerning the case of Ms. Perihan Ma&#287;den, novelist and 
columnist. In its reply, the Government transmitted the information that on 27 July 2006 the 
2nd Penal Court of First Instance of Istanbul decided on the acquittal of Ms. Ma&#287;den on the 
charge of turning people against military service.

</b> 
696. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government the situation of<b> Mr. 
Artem Skoropadskiy</b>, a journalist of Russian citizenship working with the &#8220;Commercant&#8221; 
newspaper. According to the information received, on 13 August 2007, Mr. Skoropadskiy 
wrote a story harshly criticizing the mayor of Kiev. The newspaper&#8217;s editorial office 
subsequently received a phone call from the City Hall, which complained about an alleged 
distortion of the mayor&#8217;s statement. In the evening on the same day, Mr. Skoropadskiy was 
attacked at the porch of his home by two unknown persons. Reportedly, the assailants did not 
say anything nor extorted money from the victim. A complaint of the assault was reportedly 
filled by Mr. Skoropadskiy with the police. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 8 November 2007 
</b> 
697. The Government informed that the Office of the Procurator-General of Ukraine has 
established that, on 14 August 2007, <b>Artem Kirillovich Skoropadsky</b> lodged a complaint 
with the Obolon district office of the Central Administration of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs in Kiev to the effect that, on 13 August 2007, at the entrance to the apartment building 
in which he lives, an unidentified man struck him twice in the face with his hand. As a result 
of an investigation by the Obolon district militia office, on 20 September 2007 the institution 
of criminal proceedings was refused on the grounds of lack of evidence that a crime had been 
committed. 
 
698. It was not possible to establish the existence or degree of severity of Mr. Skoropadsky&#8217;s 
bodily injuries because the victim refused to undergo a forensic medical examination. There is 
no evidence that suggests that the beating of Mr. Skoropadsky had anything to do with his 
professional activities. Mr. Skoropadsky did not appeal to the law enforcement authorities to 
ensure his physical safety. </p>

699. Since the investigation that was conducted was not sufficient to clarify the matters 
referred to in Mr. Skoropadsky&#8217;s complaint, the Office of the Prosecutor-General of Ukraine 
overturned the decision not to institute criminal proceedings. The case file has been sent to the 
procurator in Kiev for a further investigation. 
 
700. In connection with the complaint that Russian citizen Artem Kirillovich Skoropadsky 
lodged with the Central Administration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine on 14 
August 2007, the Ministry of Internal Affairs wishes to state the following. According to Mr. 
Skoropadsky&#8217;s statement, it was established that, on 13 August 2007, after his midday meal 
he went out until evening and consumed a large quantity of alcoholic beverages. At 
approximately 8 p.m., having taken the metro, he arrived at Obolon metro station and headed 
home. On the way, he bought beer from a stall, entered the building and began to walk 
upstairs to the fifth floor. Between the third and fourth floors he felt a blow to his face and 
saw an unidentified young man. Mr. Skoropadsky, in turn, kicked him, after which they began 
to fight. A moment later, the unidentified man ran downstairs and disappeared, and the 
complainant went to his apartment. According to the results of the investigation of Mr. 
Skoropadsky&#8217;s complaint, and on the basis of the evidence that has been collected, the Obolon 
district office of the Central Administration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Kiev issued 
Decision No. 8171 in which it refused to institute criminal proceedings on the basis of article 
6, paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine. The complainant was informed 
of the decision, and the negative decision was sent to the Obolon district procurator&#8217;s office in 
Kiev for verification of its legality. On 30 August 2007, the district procurator&#8217;s office 
overturned the decision not to institute criminal proceedings and issued instructions that a 
further investigation should be conducted until 25 September 2007. 
 
701. On 30 August 2007, Mr. Skoropadsky was summoned to the Central Administration of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Kiev where he was given an explanation of the procedure 
for considering his complaint and the reasons for taking such a decision, and he was also 
informed of the procedure for lodging an appeal. Mr. Skoropadsky confirmed in writing that 
he had no grievances against the militia officers. From his words it became clear that, on 15 
August 2007, he resigned from the editorial office of the newspaper Kommersant, and that he 
does not associate the incident with the publication of his article about the mayor of Kiev, Mr. 
L. Chernovetsky. He will return to Moscow in the near future. An internal investigation did 
not find that the officials of the district office of the Central Administration of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs had responded to Mr. Skoropadsky&#8217;s complaint in an appropriate manner.

his arrest. Mr. Al Alili had been in detention between 8 August 2005 and 25 October 2005. 
No arrest warrant had been issued, he was held in secret detention and was never brought 
before a court. During that time he was interrogated about his political opinions and his 
criticism related to the state of democracy in the country.  He was allegedly repeatedly beaten 
by the State Security Forces.  In view of his incommunicado detention, concern was 
expressed for his physical and mental integrity.

regarding a raid that was reportedly carried out on 19 February 2007 by US military units in 
the <b>Baghdad offices of the Iraq Syndicate of Journalists</b>.  According to information 
received, US soldiers broke into the offices of the Iraq Syndicate of Journalists, destroying 
furniture, ransacking offices and arresting a number of security guards. The soldiers allegedly 
confiscated computers and other small electric equipment. It is reported that the syndicate, 
which recently received formal recognition from the Iraqi Government, has been very active 
in supporting the families of media professionals killed since the beginning of the conflict, 
and drawing attention to the increasing climate of impunity.

706. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding <b>Samil Al-Haj</b>, a Sudanese cameraman who worked for Al-Jazeera and 
who has been detained in Guantanamo since June 2002. According to the information 
received, Samil Al-Haj was arrested by Pakistani security forces at the Afghan border in 
December 2001 and transferred to US military custody in the Guantanamo Bay military base 
in June 2002, where he has remained in detention ever since. Reportedly, Mr. Al-Haj began a 
hunger strike in December 2006 to protest against his detention. According to his lawyer, he 
has already lost 18 kilograms and is suffering from intestinal problems. It is alleged that Mr. 
Al-Haj&#8217;s hunger strike has been followed by reprisals from medical and military personnel, 
including punishment by placing him in more painful chains. It is also reported that he was 
force-fed. Allegedly, medical personnel have inflicted injuries on Mr. Al-Haj and other 
detainees on hunger strike by using large-diameter tubes or by inserting them into the lungs 
rather than the stomach. Four prisoners have allegedly died since June 2006 as a result of 
hunger-strikes and force-feeding. According to reports, the mental condition of Mr Samil Al-</p>

</p>
<p> 
708. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding Ms <b>Umida Niyazova</b>, a member of Veritas, an unregistered non-
governmental organization which works for the protection of human rights in Uzbekistan. Ms 
Niyazova also works as a journalist for the Central Asia website Oasis, a project of the 
Moscow-based media watchdog Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations and as a 
translator for Human Rights Watch in Tashkent. Ms Niyazova was included in a 
communication sent by the Special Representative on 25 January and 1 February 2007.  
 
709. According to new information received, on 22 January 2007, Ms Niyazova was arrested 
in Uzbekistan whilst crossing the Uzbek-Kyrgyz border. She was reportedly detained in 
Andijan, before being transported to Tashkent four days later.  Ms Niyazova was denied 
access to her lawyer during this period. According to reports, Ms Niyazova remained in 
detention at Tashkent prison where she was awaiting trial on charges of &#8216;illegal border 
crossing&#8217; and &#8216;smuggling subversive literature&#8217;. If charged, Ms Niyazova could face up to ten 
years in prison. On Friday 13 April 2007, prosecutors issued a further charge for alleged 
&#8216;distribution of materials and threatening national security by using foreign financial aid&#8217;. 
This latest charge carried up to15 years in prison along with the confiscation of property.  
 
710. Ms Niyazova had reportedly being subjected to daily interrogations of up to 15 hours 
whilst in detention and slept three to four hours a night. Family who had visited Ms Niyazova 
claimed that she had lost considerable weight and that loud music was constantly played 
while she was in her cell. Concern was expressed that the arrest and continued detention of 
Ms Umida Niyazova formed part of an ongoing campaign against human rights defenders in 
Uzbekistan and that the aforementioned events may be an attempt to prevent her from 
carrying out her legitimate work in defense of human rights. Concern was also expressed at 
reports that she was being detained in poor conditions and that her health was deteriorating as 
a result. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 4 May 2007</b> 
 
711. The Government transmitted a press release concerning the case of Ms Niyazova. The 
press release stated that, on 1 May 2007, Ms Niyazova had been convicted on three charges of 
smuggling, illegal border crossing and production and dissemination of materials containing 
threat to public security and public order. The release further stated that the court hearings had </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 185 
 
been open and attended by members of Human Rights Watch and other non-governmental 
organizations. Ms Niyazova was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.  
 
712. The statement added that in the course of the investigation of the case, it had emerged 
that Ms Niyazova had been engaged in financing various unregistered non-governmental 
organizations operating in Uzbekistan and that she had received this funding from various 
foreign diplomatic missions accredited in the country. The press release stated that this 
constituted financing of illegal organizations and that according to international law, this 
should be considered as an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. This 
issue was further addressed by the Uzbek government in a letter dated 28 June 2007. This 
letter detailed the amounts and origin of funding given to non-governmental organizations, 
which in the view of the government was intended to finance and unite the various &#8216;so-called 
human rights&#8217; organizations and associations illegally operating in Uzbekistan. 
 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 9 May 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers</b> 
 
713. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding Ms <b>Gulbahor Turayeva</b>, human rights defender and pathologist from 
Andijan. According to information received, on 25 April 2007, Ms Turayeva was sentenced to 
six years in prison by the Andijan Regional Court on charges of alleged slander and the 
production and distribution of literature deemed threatening to public order. Ms Turayeva was 
denied access to a defense lawyer of her choice throughout her detention and trial.  
 
714. According to reports, Ms Turayeva was arrested on 14 January 2007 by Uzbek customs 
officers, whilst crossing the Uzbek-Kyrgyz border at the Dustlik post in Andijan, for carrying 
press material published by the opposition Erk party in her bag. Ms Turayeva was 
subsequently detained at Andijan Region customs department before being transferred to the 
local office of the National Security Service detention centre on 16 January 2007. Ms 
Turayeva was currently being detained at the National Security Service Centre in Andijan. 
Concern was expressed that the afore-mentioned events are related to Ms Turayeva&#8217;s work in 
defence of human rights and that her arrest and detention may form part of a pattern of 
harassment of human rights defenders in Uzbekistan.<b> 
</b> 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 3 July 2007 
</b> 
715. The Government informed that Ms. Turayeva had been found guilty of committing the 
following offences: In April 2005, Ms. Turayeva established and headed the unofficial 
organization Animakor under the pretext of providing legal assistance to doctors and patients. 
Through this organization, she engaged in the dissemination, in the mass media, of slanderous 
information that had a negative impact on social stability. In such information, Ms. Turayeva 
exaggerated a number of shortcomings in the work of health-care institutions. In addition, she 
disseminated, on Internet pages, unfounded information about terrorist acts committed in 
Andijan on 13 May 2005, thereby spreading panic among the population. In January 2007, 
Ms. Turayeva, for a large sum of money, travelled to Osh in Kyrgyzstan in order to obtain 
literature containing an open call for the overthrow of the existing constitutional order of 
Uzbekistan and for the violation of the Republic&#8217;s territorial integrity. This literature was to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 186 
 
be disseminated in Uzbekistan. On her return to Uzbekistan, she was arrested at the Dustlik 
customs checkpoint. 
 
716. In the view of the government, Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s guilt had been proven by her 
confessions and repentance for her acts at her trial, by the testimony of the witnesses G. 
Saypirov, Y. Isakov, A. Oripov, M. Tukhtasinov, I. Yuldashev and S. Saydakhmetov, by the 
findings of a comprehensive forensic psychological, philosophical, philological and religious 
examination and by other evidence. The pretrial investigation and trial were conducted in 
accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure of Uzbekistan. The accusations were 
discussed and the evidence was correctly assessed. The letter further stated that there was no 
indication in the case file that law enforcement agencies exerted any physical or psychological 
pressure on Ms. Turayeva during the investigation. The materials of the criminal case showed 
that, from the moment that Ms. Turayeva was arrested as a suspect on 14 January 2007, all 
investigative measures with her participation were conducted in the presence of the lawyer O. 
Matyakubova.  
 
717. On 17 January 2007, Ms. Turayeva requested that Ms. Matyakubova be replaced by the 
lawyer D. Botiraliev; on 22 January 2007, she requested that Mr. Botiraliev be replaced by the 
lawyer A. Usmanov. All of her requests were met and all investigative measures were 
conducted in the presence of the lawyers D. Botiraliev and A. Usmanov. The preliminary 
investigation of Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s case was conducted with the participation of a lawyer, in 
whose presence the prisoner stated that she had testified of her own free will and that she had 
not been subjected to any pressure. During the trial, Ms. Turayeva also confirmed that no 
prohibited methods had been used against her during the pretrial investigation. Since the 
testimony given by Ms. Turayeva during the pretrial investigation coincided with the evidence 
assembled, the court found her testimony plausible.  
 
718. In accordance with article 57 of the Criminal Code (Mitigation of sentence), the court 
sentenced Ms. Turayeva to a fine in the amount of 648,000 sum. In accordance with article 59 
(Sentences in the case of the commission of multiple crimes and multiple convictions) and 61 
(Rules for calculating sentences in the case of multiple convictions), and bearing in mind the 
conviction of 24 April 2007, the court, on the basis of all the offences committed by Ms. 
Turayeva, on 7 May 2007 handed down the combined sentence of six years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty and a fine in the amount of 648,000 sum.On 8 May 2007, Ms. Turayeva filed appeals 
against both court decisions.The appeals were considered by the appellate division of the 
Andijan provincial criminal court. On 12 June 2007, the appellate court amended the court 
sentences of 24 April and 7 May 2007, applying article 72 (Suspended sentence) of the 
Criminal Code. Ms. Turayeva&#8217;s sentence was changed to six years&#8217; deprivation of liberty, 
suspended, with three years&#8217; probation, and a fine of 648,000 sum. Ms. Turayeva was released 
from custody in the courtroom. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 15 August 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention</b> 
 
719. On 15 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent jointly with the Working Group on 
arbitraty detention an urgent appeal to the Government concerning <b>Mr Jamshid Karimov</b>, a 
freelance journalist who previously worked for the Institute of War and Peace Reporting, and 
nephew to President Islam Karimov. According to the information received Mr Jamshid 
Karimov has been held against his will in a psychiatric hospital in Samarkand since </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 187 
 
September 2006. It is reported that two weeks after his compulsory admittance upon a court 
order in Jizzak, it became apparent that he had been forcibly admitted there.  His coerced stay 
has been extended by a further six months subject to a panel decision in March 2007. The 
Governor of Jizzak, Mr Ubaydulla Yamankulov, and officials from the National Security 
Bureau advised Mr Jamshid Karimov in August 2005 to leave the region and not return until 
after the celebration of the Uzbek independence day, because his presence was considered as 
interfering with the festivities. Prior to his detention, Mr Jamshid Karimov, who is allegedly 
an outspoken critic of the Government, had been publishing articles on a website reporting 
about allegations of local government corruption and the plight of peasants in the Jizzak 
region. Mr Karimov&#8217;s health is reportedly deteriorating because of the psychotropic drugs he 
is being administered and the harassment he is reportedly being subjected to in the psychiatric 
institution: he is suffering from a memory loss and from a partial loss of vision and has 
difficulties to concentrate. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the detention of Mr 
Karimov might solely be connected to his reportedly legitimate exercise of his right to 
freedom of opinion and expression.  Further concerns are expressed as regards his physical 
and mental integrity.<b> 
 
Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>720. On 26 January 2007, the Government replied to the communication of 18 January 2006 
concerning Mr. Saidjahon Zaynabitdinov, member of the Human Rights Group in Andijan, 
arrested on 21 May 2005 and held incommunicado. The government transmitted the 
following information. Mr. Zaynabitdinov&#8217;s reports were intended to create panic among the 
population and foster a negative attitude towards the authorities and constitutional system of 
Uzbekistan. Mr. Zaynabitdinov&#8217;s aims were confirmed by tape recordings and also by 
forensic, psychological, philosophical and religious and philological expert examinations. On 
21 May 2005, during a customs inspection at the Dustlik crossing point on Uzbekistan&#8217;s 
border with Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Zaynabitdinov was found to be in possession of materials the 
printing and dissemination of which are prohibited and which pose a threat to the public order 
and the country&#8217;s security.  By the verdict of the Tashkent city court of 5 January 2005 [sic], 
Mr. Zaynabitdinov was sentenced to seven years&#8217; deprivation of liberty under article 139, 
paragraph (a) and (d) (Defamation with aggravating circumstances), article 159, paragraph 3 
(b) and (c) (Attacks against the constitutional order of the Republic of Uzbekistan committed 
by an organized group or in its interests), article 244-1, paragraph 3 (a) and (c) (Preparation or 
dissemination of materials constituting a threat to public safety and public order, committed 
by prior conspiracy or by a group of persons, with the use of financial or other material 
assistance received from religious organizations as well as from foreign States and nationals) 
and article 244-2 (Establishing, leading or participating in religious extremist, separatist, 
fundamentalist or other prohibited organizations), paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. The pre-
trial investigation and judicial proceedings were conducted in accordance with national 
legislation and international norms.<b>

<b>Carta de alegaciones enviada el 30 de mayo de 2007 
</b> 
726. El Relator Especial transmiti&#243; a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en 
relaci&#243;n con el anunci&#243; por el Gobierno venezolano de la decisi&#243;n de no renovar la concesi&#243;n 
de la cadena televisiva Radio Caracas Televisi&#243;n (RCTV), que vence el 28 de mayo de 2007. 
Seg&#250;n parece, RCTV, fundada en 1953, es conocida por sus editoriales de oposici&#243;n y cr&#237;tica 
al gobierno. Parece ser que la decisi&#243;n del gobierno estar&#237;a basada en cargos pol&#237;ticos graves 
en contra de RCTV. Se teme que la medida de no renovaci&#243;n de la licencia afecte 
directamente al pluralismo de medios de comunicaci&#243;n en Venezuela, menoscabando 
particularmente los derechos de libertad de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n.<b> 
 
Llamamiento urgente enviado el 20 de noviembre de 2007 con el Relator Especial sobre 
la independencia de magistrados y abogados y la Representante Especial del Secretario-
General para los defensores de los derechos humanos 
 
</b>727.  Los titulares de mandato de procedimientos especiales enviaron un llamamiento 
urgente en relaci&#243;n con la reforma de la <b>Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica Bolivariana de 
Venezuela</b>, aprobada el 3 de noviembre de 2007 por la Asamblea Nacional de la Rep&#250;blica 
Bolivariana de Venezuela, y que ser&#237;a sometida a refer&#233;ndum a principio de diciembre del 
2007. Por un lado, quer&#237;an destacar que, dentro de la reforma propuesta, hay importantes 
avances para los derechos humanos como, por ejemplo, la extensi&#243;n de la prohibici&#243;n, 
contenida en el art&#237;culo 21 de la Constituci&#243;n a la discriminaci&#243;n por razones de salud y de 
orientaci&#243;n sexual, as&#237; como el reconocimiento al valor de la diversidad de culturas, contenido 
en el art&#237;culo 100 de la Constituci&#243;n. Por otro lado, se hab&#237;a recibido informaci&#243;n sobre los 
cambios sugeridos y aprobados por la Asamblea Nacional en los art&#237;culos 337, 338 y 339 
referidos al estado de excepci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la reforma aprobada por 
la Asamblea Nacional eliminar&#237;a la obligaci&#243;n de presentar el decreto que declare el estado de 
excepci&#243;n ante la Sala Constitucional del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia para que se pronuncie 
sobre su constitucionalidad.  
 
728. Se habr&#237;an suprimido los l&#237;mites temporales que la Constituci&#243;n vigente establece para 
los estados de excepci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s, la reforma eliminar&#237;a la exigencia expresa de que el 
decreto que declare el estado de excepci&#243;n cumpla con las garant&#237;as establecidas en el Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos y en la Convenci&#243;n Americana sobre Derechos 
Humanos. Asimismo, durante un estado de excepci&#243;n, podr&#237;an suspenderse algunas garant&#237;as 
consagradas en la Constituci&#243;n vigente, en particular el acceso a la informaci&#243;n. Si bien el 
nuevo texto incluye, en el listado de derechos humanos intangibles, al derecho a la defensa, a 
la integridad personal, a ser juzgado o juzgada por sus jueces naturales y a no ser condenado o 
condenada a penas que excedan los treinta a&#241;os, as&#237; como la prohibici&#243;n a la desaparici&#243;n 
forzosa; no menciona en forma expresa, como as&#237; lo hace el texto vigente, el derecho a un 
debido proceso.  
 
729. Asimismo, dicha propuesta de reforma cambiar&#237;a las disposiciones vigentes sobre la 
remoci&#243;n de los magistrados del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (Art&#237;culo 265). Mientras la 
Constituci&#243;n en vigor prev&#233; que dichos magistrados pueden ser removidos por la Asamblea 
Nacional mediante una mayor&#237;a calificada de las dos terceras partes de sus integrantes, la 
reforma prev&#233; que su remoci&#243;n puede ser votada por solo la mayor&#237;a de los integrantes de la 
Asamblea Nacional. Esta disposici&#243;n fragiliza la posici&#243;n de los magistrado y vulnera su </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 190 
 
independencia respeto al poder legislativo. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, dicha 
propuesta de reforma cambiar&#237;a las disposiciones vigentes sobre libertad de asociaci&#243;n, 
prohibiendo a las &#8220;asociaciones con fines pol&#237;ticos y que participen en el proceso electoral&#8221; 
recibir fondos provenientes de fuentes internacionales, tanto p&#250;blicas como privadas. La 
definici&#243;n de &#8220;asociaciones con fines pol&#237;ticos&#8221; podr&#237;a dar lugar a incertidumbres legales que 
afectar&#237;an directamente a las asociaciones de defensa de los derechos humanos y otras 
organizaciones no-gubernamentales. De esta manera, se les impedir&#237;a recibir fondos 
internacionales de los que, en muchos casos, dependen.  
 
730. Los titulares de mandato expresaron su preocupaci&#243;n por la seguridad de los periodistas 
y los participantes en las manifestaciones que se suceden entre partidarios y opositores a la 
mencionada reforma constitucional. En este sentido, quer&#237;an se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n de su 
Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido sobre varios incidentes que han tenido lugar 
recientemente. As&#237;, el 25 de octubre de 2007, Paulina Moreno, de la cadena p&#250;blica &#193;vila 
televisi&#243;n, habr&#237;a resultado herida por un explosivo cuando cubr&#237;a un foro en el Instituto 
Pedag&#243;gico de Caracas, y un camar&#243;grafo del mismo medio habr&#237;a sido agredido por 
opositores a la reforma. El 7 de noviembre de 2007, varios estudiantes habr&#237;an resultado 
heridos de bala por varios desconocidos armados en el campus de la Universidad Central de 
Venezuela, en Caracas, durante una manifestaci&#243;n de oposici&#243;n a la reforma.<b> 
 
Respuesta del Gobierno enviada el 30 de noviembre de 2007 
 
</b>731. El gobierno venezolano respondi&#243; a la comunicaci&#243;n arriba. El gobierno lament&#243; que, a 
su juicio, los titulares de mandato no respetaron las pautas de conducto al no darle al Estado 
venezolanolo la oportunidad de formular sus observaciones sobre las evaluaciones hechas.

Seguimiento de comunicaciones transmitidas previamente 
</b> 
732. Por carta con fecha 30 de abril de 2007, el Gobierno transmiti&#243; la siguiente informaci&#243;n 
en respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n del 8 de septiembre de 2004 en relaci&#243;n con el homicidio del 
Sr. Mauro del Valle Marcano Ramos. Las Fiscal&#237;as S&#233;ptima y Quincuag&#233;sima del Ministerio

El 7 de julio de 2005, se solicit&#243; orden de aprehensi&#243;n en contra de 5 individuos cuyos 
nombres son conocidos por el Relator Especial. Se solicit&#243; orden de aprehensi&#243;n en contra de 
un sexto individuo el 26 de julio de 2005, en conformidad con el art&#237;culo 25 del C&#243;digo 
Org&#225;nico Procesal Penal. El 24 de julio de 2005, se llev&#243; a cabo en la sede del Juzgado

Monagas, la Audiencia de Presentaci&#243;n de uno de los imputados, a quien el tribunal le decret&#243; 
Medida de Privaci&#243;n Judicial Preventiva de Libertad. Por considerar que el individuo hab&#237;a

de 2005 fueran decretadas Medidas Cautelares Sustitutivas de Libertad, de acuerdo a lo 
pautado en el art&#237;culo 256. El 30 de agosto de 2006, el Ministerio P&#250;blico tuvo conocimiento 
que uno de los ciudadanos se encontraba detenido en Trinidad y Tobago. Se iniciaron las 
gestiones legales necesarias p ara hacer efectiva la deportaci&#243;n de lo mismo. En reuniones con 
autoridades de Trinidad y Tobago, se explic&#243; la situaci&#243;n procesal pendiente de dicho

<b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 February 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporeur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
freedom of religion or belief  
</b> 
734. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding <b>Father Nguyen Van Ly</b>, a Catholic priest and one of the editors of the 
underground magazine &#8220;Tu do Ng&#244;n luan&#8221; (Free Speech), who was reportedly arrested on the 
evening of 19 February 2007 in the central city of Hue, during an administrative check at the 
archdiocesan building where he lives. Around 60 police officers, reportedly led by a colonel 
who specialises in religious matters, cut phone lines and searched the entire building, breaking 
open a cupboard which Ly refused to unlock. They took away six computers and mobile 
phones and many documents. 
 
735. It was reported that Father Nguyen Van Ly is a member of the pro-democracy 
movement called Bloc 8406. He spent several years in prison in 1977 and 1978 and from 
1983 to 1992 as a result of his activities in support of freedoms of opinion, expression and 
religion. He was sentenced again in October 2001 to 15 years in prison for activities linked to 
the defence of free speech. The sentence was commuted several times and he finally left 
prison in February 2004. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief has already 
sent two communications to the Government of Viet Nam regarding Father Nguyen Van Ly 
(see E/CN.4/1993/62, para. 68 and A/56/253, para. 77). 
 
736. Two others editors of &#8220;Tu do Ng&#244;n luan&#8221;, <b>Father Chan Tin</b> and <b>Father Phan Van 
Loi</b>, were also put under house arrest. No information was provided about the reasons for 
their detention. 
 
<b>Replies from the Government sent on 18 May 2007 
</b> 
737. The Government emphasized that the State of Vietnam always respects the rights to 
freedom and democracy and that no one is detained on the ground of political views or 
religions. Only those who violate laws are handled with, conforming to Vietnamese and 
international laws. 
 
738. Concerning the case of Nguyen Van Ly, the Government indicated that he in 1977 was 
dismissed as General Bishop&#8217;s Secretary by the Archbishop. In 1981, late Archbishop Nguyen 
Kim Dien issued a decision to deprive Nguyen Van Ly of his right to do missionary work 
because of his self-indulgent lifestyle, violating the Christian rules and damaging the 
credibility of the Church. In 1983, Nguyen Van Ly was convicted by the provincial People&#8217;s 
Court of the Binh Tri Thien Province to 10 years of imprisonment for his acts of undermining 
the national unity bloc and provoking serious public disorder. On 17 May 2001, Nguyen Van </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 192 
 
Ly was arrested for repeating acts in violation of the law. He was publicly tried on 19 October 
2001 by the People&#8217;s court of the Thua Thien-Thue Province and sentenced to 15 years of 
imprisonment and another 5 years of administrative probation following the completion of his 
jail term. The arrest and trial were conducted in full accordance with the law.  
 
739. On 16 July 2003, the People&#8217;s Court of the Ha-Nam Province, in view of Nguyen Van 
Ly&#8217;s repentance and redemption, reduced Ly&#8217;s sentence from 15 to 10 years of imprisonment. 
In a letter to the US Congress dated 27 June 2003, Nguyen Van Ly had admitted that the 
Vietnamese Government never suppressed religion and that he was rightly imprisoned 
because he had committed crimes against the law which could result in creating conditions 
unfavourable for the common cause of building national unity. Nguyen Van Ly was released 
in January 2005 under the special amnesty order by the State President of Vietnam, but he 
still had to serve his administrative probation for another 5 years. 
 
740. On 19 February 2007, Nguyen Van Ly was arrested again for violation of the probation 
sentence and other Vietnamese laws, such as inciting complaints, causing social and security 
disorders and establishing illegal organizations. On 30 March 2007, he was publicly tried by 
the People&#8217;s Court of the Thua Thien Hue Province in full and strict observance of legal 
proceedings stipulated in the Criminal Procedures Code. The State of Vietnam allowed him to 
have his defence counsel but he refused to do so. He showed aggressive behaviour, defied the 
law, not fully respected the Court (e.g. demolishing the bar with his foot) and libelled the 
Court. Not any international or national legal standard could allow such deeds. Therefore, the 
authorities had to apply the necessary measures to restore the order of the Court. Nguyen Van 
Ly was sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment and 5 years of administrative probation in 
accordance with Article 88 of the Penal Code. 
 
741. Regarding Mr. Chan Tin, born 15 November 1920, a priest of the Messiah, Ho Chi 
Minh City and Mr. Phan Van Loi, born 9 March 1951, living in Hue city, the Government 
stated that these are Vietnamese citizens, who fully enjoy all rights of freedom like other 
Vietnamese citizens. The information that they &#8220;were put under house arrest&#8221; is completely 
ungrounded.

Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and laywers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture  
 
</b>743. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding<b> Mr &#8216;Abbas al-&#8216;Assal</b>, aged 42, and <b>Mr Nasser al-&#8216;Awlaqi</b>, aged about 
40.  According to the allegations received, Mr &#8216;Abbas al-&#8216;Assal and Mr Nasser al-&#8216;Awlaqi 
were arrested on 2 August 2007 by security forces together with other retired soldiers, 
including Brigadier Nasser al-Nouba and Mr Shallal Ali Shaya, who were released on 7 
August.  The arrests were carried out following a protest in form of a &#8220;sit-in&#8221; at Liberty 
Square in central Aden.  The protesters intended to voice their concern that their pension </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

payments had either not been made or been significantly delayed.  Security forces dispersed 
the protesters using tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition.  Several persons were 
injured and it is feared that one protester was killed. 
 
744. Mr &#8216;Abbas al-&#8216;Assal and Mr Nasser al-&#8216;Awlaqi continued to be held in 
incommunicado detention at Sheikh Osman police station in Aden without access to family 
members or lawyers at the time the communication was sent.  The reason for their arrests and 
continued detention and whether they have been charged with any offence is still unknown. In 
view of the incommunicado detention of Mr &#8216;Abbas al-&#8216;Assal and Mr Nasser al-&#8216;Awlaqi, 
concern is expressed that they might be at risk of ill-treatment.  Further concern is expressed 
that their arrests and continued detention might solely be connected to their exercise of their 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of assembly. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 4 September 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture 
</b> 
745. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding Mr. <b>Abdel Karim al-Khaiwani</b>, former editor of the online newspaper 
Al-Shoura. Mr. al-Khaiwani is a harsh critic of the government&#8217;s policies, particularly in the 
fight against rebels in Saada. He also wrote recently an article published in Al-Needa'a which 
highlighted human rights violations in Yemeni prisons. According to the information received 
on 27 August 2007, Mr. al-Khaiwani was abducted by six gunmen wearing civilian clothes 
outside the offices of the weekly newspaper Al-Nedaa in central Sana&#8217;a. It appeared that at 
least one of his abductors was a Yemeni security service officer. Mr. al-Khaiwani was then 
blindfolded and forced into a vehicle. On the way to a remote area in the outskirts of Sanaa he 
was interrogated, kicked and beaten in his face, which caused an injury to his eye. The 
gunmen also put the fingers of Mr. al-Khaiwani&#8217;s writing hand into a metal finger cutter. 
Upon arrival he was allegedly beaten again on the face and chest.  
 
746. The gunmen threatened to kill Mr. al-Khaiwani and his family if he continued to write 
&#8220;words harmful to government officials or to national unity&#8221;. They also confiscated his 
passport, identification card and cell phone before abandoning him, still blindfolded. Mr. al-
Khaiwani&#8217;s home had been raided in June 2007, when he was last detained by the security 
services. According to reports, since 2005 six other journalists have been the target of assaults 
that were believed to be politically motivated. Serious concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned events may have been directly related to Mr al-Khaiwani's peaceful activities 
in defence of human rights in Yemen. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 1 November 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture  
 
</b>747. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding <b>Mr. Muhammad Ahmed &#8216;Abdullah al-Sha'wi</b>. According to the 
information received, on 12 October 2007, Mr. Muhammad Ahmed &#8216;Abdullah al-Sha'wi was 
arrested at the airport in Sana&#8217;a by officers from the National Security forces. Mr. &#8216;Abdullah 
al-Sha'wi had just returned from receiving medical treatment in Egypt, and still needed 
regular medical checkups. Since his arrest he was held in incommunicado detention and his </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

whereabouts were unknown at the time the communication was sent. The arrest of Mr. 
Abdullah al-Sha'wi may be directly connected with the articles he has written for the weekly 
newspaper Attariq, based in the city of Aden, in which he has criticized the authorities in 
Yemen. With a view to the fact that Mr. Muhammad Ahmed &#8216;Abdullah al-Sha'wi was being 
held incommunicado at an unknown place, concern was expressed that he might be at risk of 
torture or ill-treatment. Further concern was expressed that his arrests and continued detention 
might solely be connected to his exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
 
<b>Observations

749. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding<b> Nyamutata Margaret</b>, 52 years, associated with the Movement for 
Democratic Change. According to the information received, on 12 December 2006, as she 
was reading flyers at C junction, the ZANU PF youth arrested her and took her to Makoni 
Police Station, where she was severely beaten by several officers. On the next day at around 6 
pm she was taken to Harare Central Police Station. She was released on 14 December 2006 at

legs, feet, back, stomach and impaired concentration and sleep disturbances. She has bruises 
on her back, arms, face, thighs and buttocks. 
 
750. In the same communication, the Rapporteurs bring to the attention of the Government 
the case of <b>Nzimba Kevek</b>, 32 years, farmer, resident in Mt Darwin, activist with the 
Movement for Democratic Change, who was reportedly assaulted on 7 December 2006 by 
members of the ZANU PF youth police, whose names are known to the Rapporteurs, with 
bricks and stones. The assault resulted in severe pain in his head shoulders, legs, feet, chest 
and back. Since the incident Mr Nzimba also suffers from sleep disturbances.<b>

</b> 
751. The Government informed that Ms. <b>Margaret Nyunutata</b> was arrested on 12 
December 2006 for &#8220;Behaving in a threatening, abusive and insulting manner intending to 
provoke the breach of peace&#8221;. The circumnstances are that on 12 December 2006 at about 
20.00 hours, the Ms. Nyamutata was arrested at the intersection of Unit C and Unit K roads, 
in Chitungwiza, for using abusive and insulting language while distributing some fliers titled 
&#8220;Lets All Stay Away&#8221;. The accused was in the company of some Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC) supporters who ran away on sight of the Police. The message on the fliers 
was meant to discourage people from going to work. Ms. Nyamutata paid an admission of 
guilt fine of $250 at Harare Central Police Station. The Government stated that the accused 
person was arrested by the police and not by Zanu PF youths as alleged. She was never 
assaulted as claimed. She paid the admission of guilt without any undue influence.

752. Mr. <b>Nzimba Kelvin</b> of Madzivanzira Village, Chief Dotito, Mount Danvin made a 
report of assault at Karanda Police Base on 8 Decanber 2006. He alleged that two pwesons 
whose names are known to the Special Rapporteur had assaulted him. This followed a dispute 
in which Mr. Kelvin&#8217;s cattle had strayed into the two accused persons&#8217; maize field and 
destroyed crops. After a report had been made at the police base, investigations were 
instituted leading to the arrest of the two accused. They were charged of &#8220;Commiting criminal 
nuisance&#8221;. Each paid $250 admission of guilt fines at Dotito Police Station. The two accused 
persons do not belong to what was termed Zanu PF youth police and such a Police unit does 
not exist. The assault arose as a result of a pure misunderstanding and is in no way politically 
motivated. The complainant did not sustain severe injuries as alleged. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 7 February 2007 jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers 
</b> 
753. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding<b> </b>Mr <b>Arnold Tsunga</b>, a prominent lawyer, Director of the Zimbabwe 
Lawyers for Human Rights organisation, acting Secretary of the Law Society of Zimbabwe, 
Chairperson of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association, and the trustee of the radio station 
Voice of People (VOP). Mr Tsunga is also the laureate of the 2006 international Martin 
Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders which is granted annually to someone who has 
demonstrated an exceptional record of combating human rights violations by courageous and 
innovative means. Mr Tsunga, together with five other activists, was the subject of an urgent 
appeal by the Special Representative on 31 January 2006, to which a response from the 
government was received on 4 May 2006.  
 
754. According to new information received, on 25 January 2007, Mr Tsunga was 
reportedly detained for a brief period at the Harare International Airport when returning from 
the World Social Forum in Kenya. He was stopped in the arrivals terminal by four men in 
civilian clothing who asked to see his passport. When Mr Tsunga enquired about their 
identification, they physically dragged him into an office where they demanded to see his 
baggage. Mr Tsunga was reportedly released without charge. Concern was expressed that the 
most recent detention of Mr Tsunga may be related to his legitimate and peaceful activities as 
a lawyer acting in defence of human rights, in particular his participation in the World Social 
Forum in Kenya, and may form part of a campaign of intimidation and harassment against 
human rights defenders in Zimbabwe. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 20 March 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture  
</b> 
755. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding the arrest of around <b>50 opposition activists</b> on 11 March 2007 in 
connection with a &#8220;prayer meeting&#8221; organized by the &quot;Save Zimbabwe Campaign&quot; in the 
nation's capital of Harare, which was declared illegal. According to information received, 
police had imposed a temporary ban on rallies and demonstrations on the basis of section 24 
of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). Reportedly, as citizens approached the sports 
field where the meeting was to be held on 11 March 2007, riot police forcefully blocked the 
entrance to the grounds and fired tear gas on the crowds. During these events, <b>Mr. Gift </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1

<b>Tandare</b>, the Youth Chairperson of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) was shot 
dead. It is also alleged that on 13 March 2007, police prevented and forcefully dispersed 
another crowd that had gathered to attend the funeral of Mr Tandare in Glen View, which also 
resulted in several injuries including the shooting of two MDC activists at point blank in the 
early hours of the morning. The two, <b>Mr. Nickson Magondo </b>and<b> Mr. Naison 
Mashambanhaka</b> were among a group of about 500 mourners observing a vigil, consoling 
the Tandare family. The two are said to be recuperating in hospital.  
 
756. On 11 March 2007, various leaders and members of the Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC) and 50 more activists were reportedly arrested and detained in different police 
stations in connection with the said meeting. The detainees included: <b>Mr. Morgan 
Tsvangirai </b>the President of MDC, <b>Mr. Arthur Mutambara</b>, senior official of MDC and <b>Ms 
Grace Kwinjeh</b>, MDC&#8217;s Deputy Secretary for International Relations, who were allegedly 
beaten and seriously injured while in police custody. <b>Mr. Chamisa</b>, current spokesperson of 
MDC; <b>Mr. Tendai Biti</b>, the Secretary General of the Tsvangirai-led MDC and member of 
Parliament for Harare East constituency, <b>Mrs Sekai Holland</b>, <b>Mr Elton Mangoma</b> of MDC, 
and <b>Mr. Lovemore Madhuku</b>, a known civil society activist, chairperson of the NCA, were 
also allegedly detained. According to the information received, the latter two were severely 
beaten while in police custody. None of them received medical attention while in detention. 
<b>Mr. Harrison Nkomo</b>, the legal representative for the arrested parties, was allegedly not only 
denied access to his clients, but was himself assaulted for seeking to protect their rights. 
Reportedly all the above detainees were released following the order of the High Court on 12 
March, to allow the arrested opposition leaders to be seen by medical doctors and their 
lawyers, to be brought to court by 13 March.   
 
757. Several participants of the meeting were said to have sustained injuries following 
excessive use of force by riot police, in their attempt to disperse the demonstrators. Moreover, 
arrests have been reported in Masvingo and in Mutare, where 125 activists of the opposition 
have been picked up. In addition, student leaders at the University of Zimbabwe, <b>Mr. 
Zwelithini Viki</b> and <b>Mr. Kudakwashe Mapundu</b>, who were allegedly arrested for 
distributing fliers calling for the meeting, were allegedly still detained at Harare Central 
Police Station at the time the communication was sent.  
 
758. On 13 March 2007, the vice-president of Zimbawe National Students Union was 
arrested in Masvingo (ZINASU), <b>Lynnette Mudehwe</b>, Information and Publicity secretary of 
ZINASU, and a youth activist, <b>Sydney Chisi</b> were being held at Southerton Police Station 
together with others 6 activists at the time the communication was sent.<b> 
</b> 
759. Finally, it is reported that on 17 March 2007, <b>Arthur Mutambara</b>, <b>Sekai Holland</b> 
and <b>Grace Kwinje</b> were re-arrested, the latter two being under armed guard in their hospital 
beds. On 18 March 2007, Mr. Chamisa was allegedly severely beaten by unknown men at 
Harare airport when he was on his way to attend an Africa Caribbean Pacific-EU meeting in 
Belgium.<b> 
 
Letter of allegations sent on 2 May 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions  
 
</b>760. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
regarding the following cases. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
 Page 197 
 
 
761. On 29 March 2007, <b>Mr. Edward Chikomba</b>, a cameraman for the state broadcaster 
Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), who was reportedly abducted by armed men 
from his home in a township outside the capital Harare.  His body was found a few days later, 
in bushes 50 miles west of Harare. Mr. Chikombo was a sympathizer of the opposition 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and his murder could be linked to the 
dissemination, out of Zimbabwe, of television images of the opposition leader Morgan 
Tsvangirai after he was beaten up by police on 11 March. 
 
762. On 1 April 2007, police reportedly arrested <b>Mr. Gift Phiri</b>, a reporter of the exiled 
weekly &#8220;The Zimbabwean&#8221; and beat him severely while in detention. On 5 April, he was 
released on bail, and immediately hospitalized for treatment. He has been charged with 
&#8220;practicing as a journalist without accreditation and publishing false news&#8221;. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 4 September 2007 
</b> 
763. In its response, the Government transmitted a memorandum that informed that the 
Zimbabwe Republic Police is not aware of any beatings on Mr. <b>Gift Phiri</b> while he was in 
police custody or the motive for the alleged kidnapping and subsequent death of <b>Edward 
Chikomba</b>.  
 
764. The facts pertaining to Mr. Gift Phiri&#8217;s case are that he is a stringer for a weekly 
newspaper &#8220;The Zimbabwean&#8221; and he wrote an article that appeared in that paper on 16-22 
November 2006. The article contained false information. Part of the article had the following 
sentence, &#8220;Go now &#8211; Generals tell Mugabe as ZANU PF loses support&#8221;. This was false as 
there was no time or occasion when the Generals ever said this to the State President. 
 
765. Following the publication of the article, it was noted that Gift Phiri was practicing 
journalism without having been accredited by the Media and Information Commission, which 
is a statutory requirement under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act for 
all practicing journalists. 
 
766. On 1 April 2007, Gift Phin was arrested and detained by the Police. At no time was he 
assaulted while in police custody. On 5 April 2007 he was taken to court where he was 
remanded out of custody to 4 June 2007. While in court, Gift Phiri never wised any 
allegations of assault by the Police while in custody. It is custom in Zimbabwe that all 
suspects brought to court are asked by the presiding magistrate if they have any complaints 
against the Police fpr their treatment while in custody. If such complaints had been raised at 
this stage, the magistrate would have, as is the norm, ordered an investigation into the 
allegations before the case the suspect is facing goes for trial. The charges that were preferred 
against Mr. Phiri are &#8220;Practicing journalism without accreditation by the Media and 
Information Commision&#8221; and &#8220;Abuse of journalistic priviledges&#8221;, in respect to the false 
accusation concerning the Generals. The case was remanded to 9 July 2007 for trial. 
 
767. Concerning Mr. <b>Edward Chikomba</b>, at the time of his alleged kidnapping and 
subsequent death he was not a cameraman for the state Broadcaster (Zimbabwe Broadcasting 
Corporation) as alleged in the communication. Rather, he was retrenched together with others 
during the retrenchment exercise carried out by the ZBC in 2001. The Police are not aware of 
Mr. Chikomba&#8217;s political affiliation or his alleged dissemination out of Zimbabwe of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 198 
 
television images of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. However, what is clear is that 
there was no secret about the injuries suffered by Tsvangirai and therefore any alleged 
smuggling of television images would only have been an act in futility as the pictures were in 
the public domain. Any photographer or cameraperson could take the pictures.  
 
768. The circumstances of his disappearance are that on 29 March 2007 at around 18.00 hrs 
it is alleged that Mr. Chikomba was bundled into an Isuzu twin cab as he was about to get to 
his house in Glenview, Harare. Four men are said to have been involved in the abduction. The 
truck is said to have driven at a high speed towards the city center of Harare. On the same 
day, Mr. Chikomba&#8217;s relatives who indicated that they had heard hmi shouting for help as he 
was taken away made a report at Glenview Police station, which opened a kidnapping docket. 
On 1 April 2007, the deceased&#8217;s body was found at Old Lands farm, Darwendale. The 
Criminal Investigations department is carrying out an investigation of murder in connection 
with the case. So far no one has been arrested in connection with this case.  
 
<b>Urgent appeal sent on 12 June 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
</b> 
769. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding the situation of members of the <b>Women and Men of Zimbabwe 
Association (WOZA-MOZA)</b>. Members of WOZA-MOZA have already been the subject of 
previous communications snet by mandate-holders, the most recent dated 7 December 2006, 
to which a reply was received on 14 December 2006.  According to the new information 
received, on 6 June 2007, around 200 members of the Women and Men of Zimbabwe 
Association (WOZA-MOZA) undertook a silent and peaceful march through the city of 
Bulawayo to launch a document entitled &quot;Ten steps to a new Zimbabwe&#8221;. The Association 
was also expressing its concern that Zimbabwean civil society was excluded from the ongoing 
dialogue initiated by the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and mediated by South 
African President Thabo Mbeki, creating the danger that pertinent issues on civil, political, 
economic and social rights and democracy would be given not enough attention. After having 
walked one block, one group of participants was reportedly violently dispersed by the riot 
police. Five WOZA members, namely Ms. <b>Rosemary Sibiza</b>, Ms. <b>Angeline Karuru</b>, Ms. 
<b>Martha Ncube</b>, Ms. <b>Sangeliso Dhlamini</b> and Ms. Pretty Moyo, were badly beaten with 
baton sticks, arrested and detained at Bulawayo Central Police Station.  
 
770. Upon hearing that five of their colleagues had been beaten, another group of women 
went to the police station. The police officers then assaulted the women, before arresting Ms. 
<b>Jennifer Williams</b>, WOZA National Co-ordinator and Ms. <b>Magodonga Mahlangu</b>, another 
WOZA leader. Following the arrest of the WOZA women, attorney Kossam Ncube went to 
the police station to represent them. At the police station, Superintendent Nsingo reportedly 
accused him of being &#8220;unethical&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and stated that lawyers had no business 
at the police station as he sought to speak to his clients. He also ordered Mr. Ncube to leave 
and pushed him out of the station. On 7 June 2007, Mr. Ncube tried again to meet with his 
clients but was denied access by the police.

<b>Response from the Government sent on 19 June 2007 
</b> 
771. The Government informed that this was not the first time that WOZA had violated the 
laws of Zimbabwe with the sole intention of attracting the attention of human rights groups. 
They further stated that all rights had been respected and access had been granted to lawyers. 
The letters informed that the first group of five accused persons had been charged with 
contravening section 46, sub-section 2 of the Criminal Code, &#8220;criminal nuisance&#8221;. They had 
taken to court on 8 June 2007 where they were remanded until 21 June 2007 on $100,000 bail 
each. On 21 June 2007, the police were instructed to proceed by way of summons. Jennifer 
Williams and Magodonga Mhlanga were charged for contravening section 37 (1) (a) (1) of the 
Criminal Code, &#8220;participating in an unlawful demonstration&#8221; and &#8220;criminal nuisance&#8221;. They 
were also released on $100,000 bail. They appeared in court on 22 June 2007. During the 
court proceedings their lawyer raised the question of constitutionality in respect of the charges 
against them. The case had since been referred to the Supreme Court for a determination on 
the issues raised by the defence lawyer. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 28 August 2007 
</b> 
772. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information 
received concerning the <b>Interception of Communications Act</b>, a surveillance law that will 
allegedly allow authorities to intercept all phone, Internet and mail communications, which 
was reportedly signed into law by the President on 8 August 2007. The Act will also 
reportedly establish a state monitoring center and require telecommunications providers to 
install systems supporting interception of communications. Allegedly, the law was described 
by the Minister of Information as intending to &#8220;protect the president, a minister, or any citizen 
from harm&#8221; and to target &#8220;imperialist-sponsored journalists with hidden agendas&#8221;. The law 
allegedly restricts Zimbabwean journalists&#8217; ability to communicate with and send their reports 
to media outlets and online publications based outside the country. 
 
<b>Response from the Government sent on 5 September 2007 
 
</b>773. The Government informed that the Interception of Communications Act was 
promulgated to protect the national security of Zimbabwe. Any transgressors will be brought 
to justice regardless of their profession. As far as the alleged statement by the Minister of 
Information is concerned, the Government is not obliged to respond to wild speculation. 
  
<b>Observations 
 
</b>774. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s replies to the communications 
of 19 January 2007, 2 May 2007, 12 June 2007 and 28 August 2007. He regrets that he has 
not received a response to the other communications sent in 2007.

<p><b>Information transmitted to the Palestinian Authority 
</b> 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 September 2007 
</b> 
775. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations with respect to information regarding 
the dissolution of the Gaza Strip branch of the <b>Union of Palestinian Journalists</b>. According 
to that information, on 3 September 2007, the Hamas government dissolved the Union of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.1 
Page 200 
 
Palestinian Journalists, reportedly following a declaration by the deputy information minister, 
who allegedly stated that the &#8220;government would refuse to talk to the Union as long as the 
journalists are incapable of restoring order in it&#8221;. According to reports, this decision also 
followed a mounting trend of abusive treatment of journalists in the Gaza Strip, especially 
against leaders of the Union of Palestinian Journalists. In particular, on 25 August 15 armed 
members of the Executive Forces allegedly tried to arrest Mr. Sakher Abu el-Oun, the head of 
the Union&#8217;s branch in Gaza. The Rapporteur expressed concern that the dissolution of the 
Gaza Strip branch of the Union of Palestinian Journalists will restrict journalists&#8217; freedom of 
inquiry. 
 
<b>Letter of allegations sent on 30 November 2007 
</b> 
776. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the case of Mr <b>Alaa Al-
Titi</b>, reporter at Al-Aqsa TV and Mr <b>Ossayd Amarneh</b>, cameraman at the same TV station, 
who were reportedly detained by the Palestinian preventive security services in Hebron on 5 
November, after meeting with a Hamas deputy who had been arrested earlier that week by the 
Israeli army. The two media professionals were taken to the al-Khalil detention centre. On 20 
November, they reportedly appeared before a judge in Hebron, but the charges against them 
were not revealed. While in court, they were requested to pay a bail of 12,000 shekels, which 
their families refused. At the time of the sending of the communication, Messrs Al-Titi and 
Amarneh remained in detention.
