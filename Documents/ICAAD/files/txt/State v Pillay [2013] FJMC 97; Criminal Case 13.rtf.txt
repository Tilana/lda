7.      
On a finding a heifer with no brand on it appellant with 12 previous convictions for larceny of cattle knew it did not belong to him and took no reasonable steps to find the owner but sold it for $400.00. from a starting point of 12 months, consider aggravating factors, value of heifer, that heifer was removed from a fenced farm, benefit to appellant, failure to find owner; mitigating factors: early guilty plea, age and remorse, thus 18 months imprisonment within tariff [Brij Basi Singh v Reginam (1971) 17 FLR 65, per Gould, VP, Marsack & Richmond, JJA].

Taking all into my account, in your case I would pick 12 months imprisonment as my starting point. I add 5 month to reflect the above aggravating factors. I deduct further 3 months for your previous good character. I deduct further 3 months to reflect your mitigation. Your final term of sentence is 11 months imprisonment.
