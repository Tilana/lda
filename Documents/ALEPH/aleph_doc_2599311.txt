LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholder
The year in review held few surprises for the resources sector, and commodity prices have continued to drift in line with our expectations.
The much discussed supply gap for copper remains on the horizon and is becoming more evident as each year passes. While we do
not see many indicators of a return to strong growth in economic demand, copper supply depletion continues which lends credibility
to the view of analysts that commodity prices may have bottomed.
The cold hard reality is that the ore bodies of existing mines are being exhausted, copper head grades are declining and the barriers
to entry for new development have become – globally – extremely high. These factors lead us to conclude that, while price
correction may take some time, when it arrives (as it will) it will be volatile around a longer-term trend recovery.
Market volatility remains a concern for the global minerals industry and for Rex Minerals Ltd (Rex or the Company). Timing of the
recovery in commodity prices will be a material factor in the timing and the structure of the ﬁnancing of the Hillside Project.
This uncertainty in the timing of a recovery reinforces our view that completing the work to ensure the Hillside Project is “shovel
ready” is crucial so that we are able to capitalise on the recovery when it comes.
To recap, the Extended Feasibility Study has positioned the Hillside Project in South Australia for a phased development of the
Resource, with a markedly reduced start-up capital requirement.
Combined with a reduced physical and existential community footprint, Hillside is now a more economically viable and attractive
project, with healthier prospects of optimising shareholders’ return on equity.
We are continuing to work with the relevant South Australian Government Department and the Hillside community to demonstrate
that a carefully reﬁned and ﬁt-for-purpose Project is consistent with the existing Mining Lease.
Now, with a smaller development footprint, the Hillside Project should enable the Company to tailor an efﬁcient ﬁnancing package,
one that is to the advantage of Rex and its shareholders, that can draw on a broad range of options.
Put simply, and with the longer term in mind, the greater the share of equity that we retain for shareholders, the greater the value
that will be created and retained for shareholders. Rex remains debt free, has not given up any of its future offtake and does not
have any commercial royalties attached to the Project. All of the Hillside Resource remains with the Company.
The Hillside Project, once developed, will create substantial beneﬁts for shareholders, the local community and the South
Australian economy. To ensure this happens, Rex is committed to maintaining its community engagement program, to working
directly with both the local community on the Yorke Peninsula and with the wider regional and state community to ensure that the
Project strikes the right balance for all stakeholders.
The Rex Board remains focused on delivering on its vision to position the Company for the development of the Hillside Project,
with potential – for many decades of production – in the region.
We continue to progress the development of the State Government required Program for Environment Protection and
Rehabilitation, and we have begun work into investigating further enhancements to the Project. Our small, but highly-experienced
and skilled team, is focused on maximising the value of the Company’s assets.
On behalf of the Board, we would like to thank our employees and contractors for their efforts and achievements during the year,
and the continuing support of shareholders and other stakeholders. We would also like to acknowledge the support of our suppliers.
Rex is proud to be a member of the community on the Yorke Peninsula, and we look forward to increasing our contribution to the
community and many other businesses and services in the region, as the Hillside Project develops.
Yours sincerely
Dr David Carland
Chairman
Mr Richard Laufmann

HILLSIDE PROJECT, YORKE PENINSULA, SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Rex’s ﬂagship Hillside Project is situated 12 kilometres south of the township of Ardrossan on the Yorke Peninsula,
South Australia (Figure 1). Copper-gold mineralisation was ﬁrst discovered at the Hillside Project by Rex in 2008.
Targeting of the Project was based on the presence of a small historical copper mine, a broad magnetic feature and
subtle gravity anomalies in the area. The Project was also the ﬁrst test of a larger theory that iron-oxide-copper-gold
style mineralisation could exist underneath the thin cover rocks on the Yorke Peninsula.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (Continued) for the year ended 30 June 2016

HILLSIDE PROJECT,YORKE PENINSULA, SOUTH AUSTRALIA (CONTINUED)

Following the discovery of the Hillside deposit in 2003, the Company raised the funds required to drill out the Hillside
deposit to a depth of approximately 600 metres, and this drilling and associated technical work is the basis for the current
Mineral Resource and Dre Reserve for the Hillside Project.‘lhe latest Mineral Resource at Hillside was the starting point
for the Hillside Extended Feasibility Study (EFS).The Mineral Resource, Ore Reserve and EFS assumptions announced by
the Company on 25 May 2015 continue to apply and have not materially changed.

The results of the EFS involve a smallerrscaie, but very similar, open pit operational project focusing on copperrgoid

only, with the ability to expand or extend the operation at a later stage, depending on commodity pricing and overall
project economics.

Key aspects of the Hillside Project, based on ﬁndings from the EFS, include:

- A A$4BOM development, including an open pit mine and processing plant,-

- An initial 13+ year mine life, based on the are Reserve (proved and probable) of EZM tonnes;

- An annual processing rate of six million tonnes to produce approximately 35,000 tonnes of copper and
24,000 ounces of gold; and

- A construction workforce of close to 5007550, reverting to approximately 500 when in operation.

Rex’s Hillside Project has a number of key advantages, aside from sovereign risk, compared to other copper development
opportunities around the world.These include:

- infrastructure rThe Hillside Project is connected by a major highway (within a (worhoul' drive) to the city of
Adelaide (population 1.2 million);

- People and equipmentslhe Hillside Project has the potential to draw most of the required skilled labour and
equipment from the surrounding couhtry towns, close to the Project, as well as from Adelaide;

- Power and water Jihe area is connected to South Australia's main power grid and water network;

- Nearby town rThe Hillside Project is located near to the town and port of Ardrossan, which hosts an upenrcut
dolomite mine that ships its product through the port. The Project also has ready access to the Port of Adelaide by
road, a distance of approximately 11:0 kilometres; and

- Freehold land 7 Rex has purchased freehold land, which covers all of the known and potential copper
mineralisation of the Hillside Project.

Rex holds an approved Mining Lease (ML) for the Hillside Project, obtained in late 2014 from the Department of State
Development (DSD). In June 2015, Rex provided the BSD with additional information regarding the revised Hillside
Project to show that the Project is consistent with the ML and lease conditions already granted.while many aspects of
the Hillside Project have not changed compared to the original ML proposal, including the overall method of operation,
some areas have changed. These include:

- A reduced area of direct operations;

- An operation that will now be less than 50% of the original mining rate, with less than half the previous
mill throughput;

- A focus on coppel'rguid extraction only;

- Lower water and power use; and

- No offrsite infrastructure impacts, apart from the approved road diversions, power line and water pipeline.

REX MIN ERALS LTD
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (Continued) for the year ended 30 June 2016
> HILLSIDE PROJECT 7 REGULATORYAPPROVALS AND COMMUNITV
In August 2015, the BSD approved a lzrmonth extension for the submission of the Program for Environment Protection
and Rehabilitation (PEPR) and the Social Management Plan (8MP) for the Hillside Proiect. Rex has utilised this
extension period to engage further with the BSD, in relation to additional information required regarding the revised
Hillside Proiect outlined through the EFS process, as well ongoing engagement with the local and regional community,
and other stakeholders.
In line with its approved Community Engagement Plan (CEP),Lhe Company continued its direct engagement with the
community through oneeoneone and group meetings, with landowners, community groups and local and State Government
members. In September 2015, Rex presented at a public forum on the Vorke Peninsula regarding the revised and smaller
starteup Hillside Project. The Company highlighted the reduced local, physical and existential community footprint of the
revised layout, which sits inside the original design of the larger Prolect, and detailed how this compares and fits within
the original ML and lease conditions.
The CEP is structured to be consistent with guidelines determined by the DSD.The plan incorporates actions and activities
that the Company will engage in with the community through the planning, construction, commissioning, operation and
rehabilitation phases.The plan also sets out the various tools and types ofengagennent with the local community, including
signiﬁcant engagement through the Hillside Mine Community Voice (HMCV).
The H MCV includes representatives from the surrounding landowners, progress associations, businesses, the Yorke
Peninsula Council,the Yorke Peninsula Land Owners Group (VPLOG), Indigenous communities and other local and
regional groups, in addition to Rex representation. The HMCV was established in 2014, in response to the approval of the
Hillside Proiect ML, and it has taken on similar tasks to the previously convened Community Consultative Group, which
was established in 2011 and remained engaged during the exploration process, largerescale feasibility studies, the ML
proposal submission and the granting of the ML. During March this year, a new independent Chair of the HMCV, Mr Phil
Tyler, was selected and engaged by the HMcv. Rex acknowledges and thanks Ms Kate Van Schaik for taking on the role as
Acting Chair from late 2014 and appreciates her dedication and invaluable contribution to the development of the HMCV.
Ms Van Schaik will continue her involvement with the HMCV through participation in working groups.
In June 2015, the Company submitted to the BSD additional detailed information regarding its revised Hillside Prolect in
the form of a full “Description of Operations” document, along with updated independent impact modelling reports and
revised impact assessment documents.This information is used by the BSD to conﬁrm that the revised Prolect is
consistent with the existing ML and lease conditions. After an initial adequacy check, the main documents will be released
publicly, with all documents released after they are assessed by the BSD. Rex always intended that these documents would
be publicly released.
An important message that Rex has been communicating through the HMcv and other meetings is that the ML
conditions, as set down by the South Australian Government in its approval of the ML, still stand, even with the revised
Proiect.These conditions are there to ensure that a future mining operation will have minimal impact on the surrounding
area and will not adversely impact on the health of employees or surrounding community.The ML and lease conditions are
based on the possible larger extent of mining operations, the process and outcome of community consultation, the
potential impacts both beneﬁcial and adverse, and the control/remediation measures governing mining and processing
operations across the life of the mine to each of the speciﬁc phases of construction, operations, rehabilitation and post
mine closure.
Rex has continued to prepare information for the PEPR and the SMP, based around the revised Hillside Project. The PEPR
and SMP must be submitted and approved by the BSD before operations can commence.The Company is engaged with a
number of local community working groups, established within the H Mcv, to obtain feedback and community input into the
PEPR process. Seven working groups are currently active and have been established to inform and provide local input and
expertise into key areas of the PEPR and SMP.These working groups have started involving other community members
outside the H MCV, with the purpose of enabling crussepuil'matiun of ideas. Rex has commenced providing background
information and detail, where required by and within each group, and group leaders report through to the HMcv.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (Continued) for the year ended 30 June 2016
>         HILLSIDE PROJECT – REGULATORY APPROVALS AND COMMUNITY (CONTINUED)
The identiﬁed socio-economic beneﬁts of the Hillside Project will be in the contribution to the region and the state’s
broader economic development, founded in increased direct and indirect employment opportunities, related growth in
physical and social infrastructure, in business enterprises providing goods and services, stimulus for population growth,
and diversiﬁcation of its current agricultural and tourism industries. To date, there have been over 2,000 expressions of
interest (EOI's) for employment at Hillside with over 500 of those EOI’s being locally-based people. There are many
people already living on the Yorke Peninsula who have substantial experience and skills in the resources industry, and
living in the region will be an attraction to future employees.
Rex is committed to working with the local Indigenous community, to mutual beneﬁt, on a platform of respecting
Indigenous culture, heritage, and special connections to lands and waters. Based on heritage surveys undertaken,
evidence of Indigenous cultural heritage is wide-spread throughout the region and within the vicinity of the proposed
Hillside Project area. A Native Title Claim has been lodged covering the entire Yorke Peninsula. However, no Native Title
agreements are required in relation to the ML, Extractive Mineral Lease or Miscellaneous Purpose Licence.
>         HILLSIDE PROJECT – ENVIRONMENT AND REHABILITATION
The Company completed a substantial drilling program during 2011 and 2012 over its freehold land, and full
rehabilitation of this impacted area was completed in 2013. Rex now has two years of compiled broad-acre cropping data
from its lease farmer, which demonstrate the successful rehabilitation of the land, and Rex will be making details of this
data available to the DSD and the local community in the near term.

Company. The Directors and Ofﬁcers Liability Insurance provides cover against all costs and expenses that may be
incurred in defending civil or criminal proceedings that fall within the scope of the indemnity and that may be brought
against the Ofﬁcers in their capacity as Ofﬁcers. Disclosure of the nature of the liability cover and the amount of the
premium is subject to a conﬁdentiality clause under the insurance policy.
The Company has entered into an agreement with Directors and Executive Ofﬁcers to indemnify these individuals against
any claims and related expenses, which arise as a result of their work in their respective capacities.
The Company has not provided any insurance or indemnity for the auditor of the Company.
NON-AU DIT SERVIC ES
During the year, KPMG Australia (KPMG), the Group’s auditor, has performed certain other services in addition to the
audit and review of the ﬁnancial statements.
The Board has considered the nonraudl’t services provided during the year by the auditor and is satisﬁed that the provision
of those noneaudl’t services is compatible with and did not compromise, the auditor independence requirements of the
Corporations Act 2001. The nonraudl’t services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor
independence as set out in ‘A PES 110 Code Of Ethics for Professional Accountants’, as they did not involve reviewing or
auditing the auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decisionrmaking capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate
for the Group or jointly sharing risks and rewards.
Details of amounts paid to the auditor of the Group, KPMG and its related practices for audit and nuneaudit services
during the year, are set out below.

REMUNERATION REPORT—AUDITED
The Directors present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2015, outlining key aspects of the
remuneration policy and framework and the remuneration awarded during the year.
The Board considers that cash preservation is crucial in small exploration and development companies, and also
recognises the importance of retaining Rex’s small but high‘yaexperl’enced and skilled team. In current market conditions,
ﬁnding the right balance is difﬁcult. To ﬁnd this balance, a review of all positions was undertaken with base salaries
reduced by restructuring employees and contractors to parHime. NonaExecutive Directors' also agreed to a reduction in
the cash component of their fees. In recognition of this reduction, Directors, employees and contractors were issued with
options under the Option Incentive Plan approved at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.

REX MIN ERALS LTD
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued) for the year ended 30 June 2016
REMUNERATION REPORT rAUDITED (CONTINUED)
Principles of compensation
Remuneration is referred to as compensation throughout this report.
Key Management Personnel (KMP) comprise the Directors of the Company and Senior Executives ior the Group. KMP
have authority and responsibility lor planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company and the Group.
Compensation packages may include a mix of ﬁxed and variable compensation, and shortrterm and longrterrn
performancerbased incentives.
Fixed compensation
Fixed compensation consists ol base compensation (which is calculated on a total cost basis and includes any fringe
beneﬁts tax charges related to employee beneﬁts including motor vehicles), as well as leave entitlements and employer
contributions to superannuation lunds.
Compensation levels are reviewed annually through a process that considers individual, segment and overall perlormance
of the Group. ll/larxet research provides analysis and guidance for compensation.
Performance linked compensation
Performance linxed compensation may include both shortrterrn and longrterm incentives, and is designed to reward senior
executives for meeting or exceeding their ﬁnancial and personal objectives.The shortrterm incentive is an ‘at risk’bonus
provided in the iorm ol cash, while the longrterrn incentive is provided as options over ordinary shares of the Company
pursuant to the terms and conditions ol the options.
Short»term incentive
The shortrterm incentive (STI) is a discretionary bonus provided in the form of cash. At the end of the ﬁnancial year, the
Board assesses the performance of the Group and individuals.
The Board determines and approves the cash incentive to be paid to the individuals. During the year, no STl cash bonuses
were paid or payable.
Long-term incentive
The Iongrterm incentive (LTI) is provided as options over ordinary shares of the Group.The Board believes the LTI is an
important component ol a comprehensive remuneration strategy. It aligns participants’ interests with those of
shareholders by linking their overall total rewards to the longrterm success ol the Company and helps retain cash funds
within the Company.
The Board was granted shareholder approval for an Option Incentive Plan at the Annual General Meeting on
30 November 2015.The plan is administered by the Board which has the discretion to determine eligibility to
participate in the plan.
Consequences of performance on shareholder wealth
The variable components of the Group’s Executives’ remuneration (the STI and LTI) seek to encourage alignment of
management periormance and shareholders’ interests by linking remuneration to the perlormance oi the Group. Whilst the
Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the indices detailed below, the Board acknowledges that as an
exploration and development company, the use oi such indices does not lully reﬂect the Group’s periormance.

REX MINERALS LTD
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (Continued) for the year ended 30 June 2016
REMUNERATION REPORT – AUDITED (CONTINUED)
Service agreements
In line with Group policy, the Group has entered into contracts with each of its Executive Ofﬁcers, and they are capable of
termination on up to three months’ notice. The Group retains the right to terminate a contract immediately by making
payment in lieu of notice. Executive Ofﬁcers are also entitled to receive (on termination of employment) their statutory
entitlements of accrued annual and long service leave, together with any superannuation beneﬁts. The employment
contract provides for no additional entitlement on termination in the event of removal for misconduct or gross negligence.
The employment contract outlines the components of compensation paid to the Executive Ofﬁcers, but does not prescribe
how compensation levels are modiﬁed year to year. Compensation levels are reviewed each year to meet the principles of
the compensation policy. There is currently no STI plan offered to Executive Ofﬁcers. The Company has established an
Option Incentive Plan, and the Board may invite Executive Ofﬁcers to participate under the terms and conditions of the
plan as an LTI.
Non-Executive Directors
Total compensation for all Non-Executive Directors, last voted upon by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General
Meeting, is not to exceed $500,000 per annum and is set based on advice from external advisors with reference to fees
paid to other Non-Executive Directors of comparable companies.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not receive performance related remuneration. Directors’ fees cover all
main Board activities and membership of Board committees.
During the year, the Board agreed to a reduction in the cash component of their annual Non-Executive Director fees from
$80,000 to $60,000 and in the case of the Chairman from $120,000 to $100,000. In consideration for this reduction of
the cash component, shareholders approved the issue of one million options to each Non-Executive Director at the 2015
Annual General Meeting. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the options are valued at 2.51 cents per option on
grant date and are subject to vesting over three years.

REX MINERALS LTD
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.        REPORTING ENTITY
Rex Minerals Ltd (the Company) is a Company domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company’s registered
ofﬁce is Level 19, 11 Waymouth Street, Adelaide, South Australia 5000. The Group ﬁnancial statements as at and
for the year ended 30 June 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group
and individually as Group entities). The Group is a for proﬁt entity primarily involved in minerals exploration and
evaluation in Australia.
2.        BASIS OF PREPARATION
(a)       Statement of compliance
           The ﬁnancial report is a general purpose ﬁnancial report which has been prepared in accordance with Australian
Accounting Standards (AASBs) (including Australian Interpretations) adopted by the Australian Accounting
Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001. The ﬁnancial report of the Group complies with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB).
The ﬁnancial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 9 September 2016.
(b)       Basis of measurement
           The Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
(c)       Functional and presentation currency
           These Group ﬁnancial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional currency of all
entities in the Group.
The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument
2016/191and in accordance with that Rounding Instrument, all ﬁnancial information is presented in Australian
dollars and has been rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise stated.
(d)       Use of estimates and judgements
           The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying
accounting policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amount recognised in the ﬁnancial statements are
described in the following notes and their related accounting policies:

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group
ﬁnancial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities. The Group has adopted all of the new
and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board that are relevant
to the Group and effective for the current annual reporting period.
The adoption of these new and revised Australian Accounting Standards has had no signiﬁcant impact on the
Group’s accounting policies.
(a)
Basis of consolidation
(i)      Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable
are taken into account. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Group ﬁnancial
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Basis of consolidation (Continued)
(ii)    Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are
eliminated in preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements.
(b)       Financial instruments
(i)
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables,
cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair
value through proﬁt or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments are measured as described below.
A ﬁnancial instrument is recognised if the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised if the Group’s contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the
ﬁnancial assets expire or if the Group transfers the ﬁnancial asset to another party without retaining control
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Sales of ﬁnancial assets are accounted for at trade date,
ie. the date that the Group commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised
if the Group’s obligations speciﬁed in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
(A) Receivables – other debtors
Other debtors are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment
losses. Other debtors are reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indicators of impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised for debts which are known to be uncollectable. An impairment
allowance is raised for any doubtful accounts.
(B) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of
three months or less.
(C) Term deposits
Term deposits comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of more than
three months.
(D) Trade and other payables
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services provided to the
Group prior to the end of the reporting period and are stated at amortised cost. The amounts are
unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
Other non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less any impairment losses.
(ii) Share capital
Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary
shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

Property, plant and equipment
(i)      Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
(ii)    Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of PP&E is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is
probable that the future economic beneﬁts embodied within the part will ﬂow to the Group and its cost can
be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day
servicing of PP&E are recognised in proﬁt or loss as incurred.
(iii)   Depreciation
Depreciation is recognised in the proﬁt or loss for items of PP&E on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of each part of an item of PP&E.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
Plant and equipment
3 – 10 years
Buildings
10 – 20 years
Land is not depreciated.
Water infrastructure will be depreciated over the life of the Hillside Project, upon commencement
of production.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted if appropriate.
(d)
Exploration and evaluation
Exploration and evaluation expenditure, excluding the costs of acquisition, are expensed within the proﬁt and loss
as incurred.
Costs incurred in acquiring rights, the entry premiums paid to gain access to areas of interest and amounts payable
to third parties to acquire interests in existing projects are capitalised as incurred and assessed for impairment
triggers annually.
(e)
Impairment
(i)      Financial assets
A ﬁnancial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that
it is impaired. A ﬁnancial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more
events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ﬂows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a ﬁnancial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference
between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the
original effective interest rate.
Individually signiﬁcant ﬁnancial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining
ﬁnancial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment loss was recognised. For ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised
in proﬁt or loss.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Impairment (Continued)
(ii)    Non-ﬁnancial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-ﬁnancial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable
amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair
value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together
into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inﬂows from continuing use that are largely independent
of the cash inﬂows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in
a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units that are
expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect
of cash-generating units are allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units
and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses
recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates
used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(f)
Employee beneﬁts
(i)      Wages, salaries and annual leave
Liabilities for employee beneﬁts for wages, salaries and annual leave that are expected to be settled within
12 months of the reporting date represent obligations resulting from employee services provided to reporting
date, and are calculated at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration, wage and salary rates that the
Company expects to pay as at reporting date including related on-costs such as workers compensation
insurance and payroll tax.
(ii)    Long-term beneﬁts
The Group’s obligation in respect of long service leave is measured as the present value of the future beneﬁt
expected to be paid to employees that has been earned in return for their service in the current and prior
periods. Consideration is given to the expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures
and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using Australian corporate bond rates.
(iii)   Share based payments
Equity-based compensation is recognised as an expense in respect of the services received.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the participants
become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value at grant date is independently determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that
takes into account the exercise price, the term of the options, the vesting and performance criteria, the impact
of dilution, the non-tradeable nature of the option, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility
of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option.
(g)
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised in the statement of proﬁt or loss when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have
been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are signiﬁcant uncertainties regarding recovery of
the consideration due.
Revenues are recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of goods and services tax
(GST). Exchanges of goods or services of the same nature and value without any cash consideration are not
recognised as revenue.

Tax
(i)      Income taxes
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in proﬁt or loss
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor
taxable proﬁt, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are
expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by
the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities, will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available
against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.
Research and development beneﬁts are recognised in the year the beneﬁt is received.
(ii)    Tax consolidation
The Company and its wholly-owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax consolidated group. As a
consequence, all members of the tax consolidated group are taxed as a single entity. The head entity within
the tax consolidated group is Rex Minerals Ltd. The tax consolidated group has entered into tax funding and
tax sharing agreements.
(iii)   Goods and services tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST
incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as
part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable
from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation Ofﬁce (ATO) is included as a current asset or liability in the
balance sheet.
Cash ﬂows are included in the statement of cash ﬂows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash ﬂows
arising from investing and ﬁnancing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are
classiﬁed as operating cash ﬂows.
(i)
(j)
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in proﬁt
or loss, using the effective interest method.
Earnings/loss per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is
calculated by dividing the proﬁt or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined by
adjusting the proﬁt or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary
shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Segment reporting
(k)
           The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the
CEO, who is the consolidated entity’s chief operating decision-maker.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in exploration activities which incurs expenses.
An operating segment’s expenditures are reviewed regularly by the CEO to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Segment expenditure that is reported to the CEO includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those
that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire PP&E.
(l)        Restoration and rehabilitation provision
          Obligations to restore and rehabilitate certain areas of property may arise from time to time as a result of the
Group’s activities. A provision for rehabilitation and restoration is recognised in respect of the estimated cost of
rehabilitation, decommissioning and restoration of areas of disturbance existing at reporting date, but not yet
rehabilitated. Rehabilitation activities include dismantling infrastructure, removal and treatment of waste
material, and land rehabilitation, including recontouring, top-soiling and revegetation of the disturbed area.
Provisions for the cost of the rehabilitation program are recognised at the time that environmental disturbance
occurs (or is acquired).
A corresponding asset is recognised in PP&E or exploration and evaluation assets only to the extent that it is
probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the rehabilitation, will ﬂow to the entity. Determining the
cost of rehabilitation and restoration of the area of disturbance requires the use of signiﬁcant estimates and
assumptions, including: the timing of the cash ﬂows and expected life of the relevant area of interest, the
application of relevant environmental legislation, and the future expected costs of rehabilitation, decommissioning
and restoration. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used to determine the cost of rehabilitation,
decommissioning and restoration could have a material impact on the carrying value of the site restoration
provision and related asset. The provision is updated based on the facts and circumstances at the reporting date.
(m)      New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
           A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods
beginning after 1 July 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial statements:
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
AASB 9 Financial Instruments will be effective for the Group’s 2019 ﬁnancial statements. The new
standard addresses the classiﬁcation, measurement and derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial
liabilities and sets out new rules for hedge accounting. It is likely to affect the Group's accounting for its
ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. The Group has not yet decided when to adopt AASB 9 and has not
yet determined the potential effect of the standard.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which will be effective for the Group’s 2019 ﬁnancial
statements. The new standard is not expected to have signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnancial statements.
Amendments to AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets detail
acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation. These amendments will be effective for the Group’s
2017 ﬁnancial statements. The new standard is not expected to have signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnancial
statements.
AASB 16 Leases removes the classiﬁcation of leases as either operating or ﬁnances leases for the lessee,
effectively treating all leases on balance sheet. Short-term leases and leases of low value assets are exempt
from the lease accounting requirements. These amendments will be effective for the Group’s 2020 ﬁnancial
statements with early adoption permitted. The Group has not yet decided when to adopt AASB 16 and has
not yet determined the potential effect of the standard.

4.        DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair values for ﬁnancial
assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the
following methods. Where applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values
is disclosed in the notes speciﬁc to that asset or liability.
(a)
Trade and other receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash ﬂows,
discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
(b) Non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future
principal and interest cash ﬂows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
(c)
Share based payments
The fair value of options granted to participants as compensation is independently measured using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model. Measurement inputs include the exercise price of the options, the term of the
options, the vesting and performance criteria, the non-tradeable nature of the option, the share price at grant
date and expected price volatility of the underlying share (based on an evaluation of the Company’s
historical volatility), expected term of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option
holder behaviour), the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds)
for the term of the option.
5.        FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
(a)
Capital Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern, so as to maintain an adequate capital base sufﬁcient to maintain future exploration and progress
of its projects. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to
shareholders or issue new shares. The Group’s focus has been to raise sufﬁcient funds through equity to fund
exploration and evaluation activities, and currently has no external borrowings.
The Group encourages employees and contractors to be shareholders through the Option Incentive Plan.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Risk management
policies and procedures are established with regular monitoring and reporting.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
(b)
(c)
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party to a ﬁnancial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables
and cash balances.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufﬁcient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. To this end, actual cash ﬂows and forecast
future cash ﬂows are reported to and monitored by the Board on a periodic basis.
(d) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices (such as foreign exchange rates), interest rates and
equity prices that will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of ﬁnancial instruments. The
objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return.

(a) Credit risk
Management monitors the exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis through monitoring the Group’s
counterparties. The Group does not require collateral in respect of ﬁnancial assets.
At reporting date, cash is held with a number of reputable ﬁnancial institutions. The maximum exposure to
credit risk is represented by the carrying amount ot each ﬁnancial asset in the balance sheet.
(b) Fair value
The ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities included in assets and liabilities approximate their net fair values.
(0) Liquidity risk
The following are the contractual maturities of ﬁnancial liabilities.
Carrying Contractual 1 year 1-2

(d) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s shortrterm deposits.
At balance date, the Group had the following ﬁnancial assets exposed to interest rate risk:
2016 2015
$000 $000
Cash and cash equivalents 3,205 7,930
Term deposits 3,000 3,000
Total cash and term deposits 6,205 10,930
At balance date, the Group has no ﬁnancial liabilities exposed to Variable interest rate risks.
The tollowing sensitivity analysis is based on the interest rate risk exposure in existence at the balance sheet
date. At 30 June 2016, if interest rates had moved, as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables
constant, proﬁt and or loss and equity would have been affected as tollows:
Profit nr lnss Equity
higher/(Inwar) higher/(lower)
2016 2015 2016 2015
$000 $000 $000 $000
Grnup
+1% (100 basis points) 87 291 r r
71% (100 basis points) (87) (291) r r
The movements in proﬁt or loss are due to higher/lower interest earnings on cash balances and term
depositsThe movements in equity are directly linked to movements in the Consolidated statement of proﬁt
or loss and other comprehensive income.
(e) Impairment losses
None of the Group’s receivables are past due (2015: rlil).

capable of reliable measurement.

over the Group’s performance of rehabilitation obligations on certain tenements. Under the agreement, the Group
has indemniﬁed the bank in relation to these guarantees. The guarantees are backed by deposits amounting to
$20,000 as at 30 June 2016 (2015: $20,000).
The Group's bankers have provided a guarantee amounting to $199,000 to the landlord regarding the ofﬁce at
Level 19, 11 Waymouth Street, Adelaide, South Australia as security over the Group's obligations regarding the
lease held. Under the agreement, the Group has indemniﬁed the bank in relation to this guarantee. The guarantee

INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORTTO THE MEMBERS OF REX MINERALS LTD
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Rex Minerals Limited
Report on the ﬁnancial report
We have audited the accompanying ﬁnancial report of Rex Minerals Limited (the Company). Which
comprises the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position as at 30 June 2016, and consolidated statement
ofproﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement ofchanges in equity and
consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the year ended on that date, notes 1 to 24 comprising a summary
of signiﬁcant accounting policies and other explanatory information and the directors' declaration ofthe
Group comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year‘s end or from time to time during
the ﬁnancial year.
Directors 're.vporzsibi1itv/or theﬂrtartciul report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial report that gives a true and
fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the ﬁnancial report that
is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or en‘or. In note 2, the directors also state, in
accordance with Australian Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the
ﬁnancial statements of the Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor It responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the ﬁnancial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. These Auditing Standards require that we comply
with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the ﬁnancial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the ﬁnancial report
that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity‘s internal control. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial report.
We performed the procedures to assess whether in all material respects the ﬁnancial report presents fairly,
in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards, a true and fair view
which is consistent with our understanding ofthe Group's ﬁnancial position and oftheir performance.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
