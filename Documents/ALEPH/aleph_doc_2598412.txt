Principal activities and significant changes in nature of activities
The principal activity of the Group during the financial year was the operation of the 100% owned Kwale Mineral Sands 
Operation (“Kwale Operation”) in Kenya.
There were no significant changes in the nature of the Group’s principal activities during the reporting period.
Operating results
The Group recorded a loss after tax of $20,918,682 for the reporting period (2015: $16,038,746).
Dividends paid or recommended
There were no dividends paid or declared for payment during the reporting period.
Review of operations
Base Resources operates the 100% owned Kwale Operation in Kenya, which commenced production in late 2013.  The 
Kwale  Operation  is  located  10  kilometres  inland  from  the  Kenyan  coast  and  50  kilometres  south  of  Mombasa,  the 
principal port facility for East Africa.
During  the  reporting  period,  mining  activity  continued  in  the  high  grade  regions  of  the  Central  Dune,  close  to  the 
processing plant, except for three months mining lower grade perimeter blocks.   The average ore grade mined was 
8.3% heavy mineral (“HM”) for the year.  Mining activities will remain focussed on the Central Dune deposit for the next 
four years of the operation, before transitioning to the South Dune for the remainder of the mine life.
The coming year will see the introduction of a second mining unit, a 400tph hydraulic mining unit (“HMU”).  Operating 
dual mining units will enable concurrent mining of high grade ore with the existing dozer-trap mining unit (“DMU”) and 
allow access to lower grade perimeter blocks more cost effectively utilising the HMU.  This is expected to produce a 
blended average ore grade lower than achieved this year and result in a higher mining volume to maintain heavy mineral 
concentrate (“HMC”) production.
The Kwale Operation is designed to process ore to recover three separate products – rutile, ilmenite and zircon.  Ore is 
received at the wet concentrator plant (“WCP”) from the mining units via a slurry pipeline. The WCP removes slimes at 
a particle size less than 45μm, concentrates the valuable heavy minerals (rutile, ilmenite and zircon) and rejects most
4
DIRECTORS REPORT
of the non-valuable, lighter gangue minerals. The WCP incorporates a number of gravity separation steps using spiral 
concentrators.  The HMC, containing 90% heavy minerals, is then processed in the mineral separation plant (“MSP”). 
The MSP cleans and separates the rutile, ilmenite and zircon minerals and removes any remaining gangue.

With the consistent achievement of design availabilities and throughputs in the WCP, and the high average grade of ore 
mined,  HMC  production  of  734,431  tonnes  was  achieved  in  the  reporting  period.  HMC  production  exceeded  MSP 
consumption, allowing the continued building of a HMC stockpile to mitigate risk and optimise future production.  At 
year end, the HMC stockpile was 139,364 tonnes.
During  the  reporting  period,  709,443  tonnes  of  HMC  was  fed  into  the  MSP  to  produce  455,870  tonnes  of  ilmenite, 
85,654 tonnes of rutile and 31,389 tonnes of zircon.  The successful completion of a number of MSP upgrade projects, 
together with ongoing process optimisation, has yielded benefits in both throughput and downstream recoveries of 
rutile and zircon during the  reporting period.   Having achieved design  recovery levels for all products, ongoing MSP 
optimisation is expected to yield sustained increases in feed rates above 90tph in the 2017 financial year.
Ilmenite production continued at above design capacity due to the combination of increased MSP feed rates and high 
recoveries.  Following the installation of an additional MSP magnet stage in November 2015, ilmenite recovery reduced 
from a pre-upgrade average of 110% to an average of 102% for the remainder of the year, still exceeding design.  The 
additional magnet stage had the effect of removing rutile from ilmenite product and creating a high chrome stream, 
which is now rejected to enhance product quality.  Ilmenite production continues to benefit from the proportionally 
higher ilmenite content (but lower rutile content) of the high grade ore in the Central Dune, a feature of the Kwale 
deposit.
Rutile production exceeded the 80,000 tonnes per annum design target for the first time in the reporting period, thanks 
to the higher MSP feed rates and ongoing optimisation of recoveries, aided by the  MSP upgrade projects.   Average 
rutile recovery for the reporting period was 99%, surpassing design expectations.
With some altered ilmenite species, that are not defined as either ilmenite or rutile in the resource, being recovered in 
the production of both, calculated recoveries (or yields) of over 100% are achievable for both ilmenite and rutile.
Zircon production continued its steady improvement throughout the reporting period, in line with the planned ramp-
up schedule, and ultimately exceeded the 30,000 tonne design target, driven by the combination of achieving design 
recovery (77.8%) and the increased MSP feed rate.  Zircon recoveries averaged 78% in the last quarter and reached as 
high as 80% in June.

DIRECTORS REPORT
Marketing & sales
Base Resources has a number of off-take agreements across each of its three product streams spanning between one 
and six years of production of the Kwale Operation.  The agreements are with some of the world’s largest consumers of 
titanium dioxide minerals and zircon products, including a cornerstone agreement with Chemours (formerly DuPont 
Titanium Technologies).
The agreements provide off-take security for the Kwale Operation, and contain firm minimum annual offtake volumes 
subject  to  annual  Base  Resources’  production  forecasts.    Pricing  is  derived  from  prevailing  market  prices,  based  on 
agreed price indices or periodic price negotiations, with some agreements offering downside protection in the form of 
floor prices.
In  the  reporting  period,  Base  Resources  sold  almost  600,000  tonnes  of  product  from  the  Kwale  Operation,  with 
shipments being made to a combination of customers with existing offtake agreements, regular customers buying on a 
spot basis and some new spot customers buying Base Resources’ products for the first time.
The appointment of a Chinese distributor for ilmenite in early 2015 has assisted Base Resources in continuing to build 
its  market  presence  in  China  –  the  world’s  largest  ilmenite  market  –  through  the  2016  financial  year.    During  the 
reporting period, Base Resources became the largest importer of ilmenite into China, having sold almost 450,000 tonnes 
in the 2016 financial year.  Solid relationships have been established with major Chinese ilmenite consumers who now 
comprise a  mix of shorter term contracts (one to three-year duration) and regular  spot customers.  Base  Resources 
maintains a strong focus on servicing the Chinese market and continues to expand its customer base with further trial 
lots of ilmenite being evaluated by new customers.
Despite challenging market conditions for much of the reporting period, sales volumes increased significantly over the 
comparable period to match production growth.  A solid improvement in the global titanium dioxide pigment market 
through the first half of the 2016 calendar year led to a high level of demand for Base Resources ilmenite and rutile in 
the June 2016 quarter.  This has kept stocks at minimal levels and provided a solid base for price improvement during 
the 2017 financial year.
During the March quarter of 2016, Base Resources received a force majeure notice from an ilmenite customer and a 
volume reduction notice from a rutile customer.  In both cases the impact was to defer or cancel a significant portion of 
previously agreed sales volumes for the remainder of calendar 2016.  Alternative sales have been secured to fully cover 
the shortfall arising from these notices, aided by the strengthening demand for titanium dioxide feedstocks experienced 
towards the end of the reporting period.
Unlike the titanium dioxide feedstock markets, conditions for zircon remained subdued through the reporting period.  
Despite the ongoing over-supplied market, Base Resources has had sustained solid demand for zircon from its small, 
but loyal, customer base.
Market Outlook
Ilmenite  and  rutile  are  primarily  used  as  feed  stock  for  the  production  of  titanium  dioxide  pigment,  with  a  small 
percentage also used in the production of titanium metal and fluxes for welding rods and wire.  Pigment makes up over 
90% of titanium minerals demand and is the main driver of pricing.  Titanium dioxide is the most widely used white 
pigment because of its non-toxicity, brightness and very high refractive index. It is an essential component of consumer 
products such as paint, plastics and paper.
Global consumption of pigment has maintained a long term average growth rate closely correlated to global GDP, or 
approximately  3%  per  annum.    However,  volatility  in  the  global  economy  in  recent  years  has  created  significant 
fluctuations in this growth rate, manifesting in big swings in inventory levels throughout the entire pigment supply chain.  
A  growing  supply  deficit,  compared  with  demand,  over  the  past  year  appears  to  have  resulted  in  global  pigment 
inventories falling below normal levels for the first time in several years.   Growth in pigment consumption, together 
with re-stocking activity, has resulted in pigment demand surging by more than 7% year-on-year, and substantial price 
improvements being reported in the first half of calendar year 2016.  This has percolated through the supply chain and
6
DIRECTORS REPORT
translated into strengthening feedstock demand by the end of the reporting period.  As a consequence, feedstock levels 
have been drawn down at a more rapid pace than expected and tightness has emerged in feedstock markets for the 
first time since the Kwale Operation commenced production.
The ilmenite feedstock market has become particularly constrained owing to the further constrictions in supply and 
growth in ilmenite-intensive Chinese sulphate pigment production that has occurred over the  reporting period.  As a 
result,  ilmenite  prices  are  responding  positively,  allowing  Base  Resources  to  lock  in  substantial  price  increases  for 
shipments in the September 2016 quarter.
Conditions for rutile also tightened by year end, although current supply and stocks appear adequate to meet demand 
in the immediate future.
Current analysis suggests that excess global inventories of titanium dioxide feedstocks, which have weighed heavily on 
prices over the past couple of years, should return to normal levels by the end of calendar year 2016.  In the absence of 
substantial new feedstock supply coming online, the titanium dioxide feedstock market is expected to begin a period of 
structural supply deficit, providing an opportunity for price growth in both ilmenite and rutile over the next few years.
Zircon has a range of end-uses, the largest of which is ceramic tiles, which accounts for more than 50% of global zircon 
consumption. Milled zircon enables ceramic tile manufacturers to achieve brilliant opacity, whiteness and brightness in 
their products. Zircon’s unique properties include heat and wear resistance, stability, opacity, hardness and strength. 
These  properties  mean  it  is  also  sought  after  for  other  applications  such  as  refractories,  foundries  and  specialty 
chemicals.
Demand growth for zircon is closely linked to growth in global construction and increasing urbanisation in the developing 
world. After a sharp downturn in 2012, major zircon suppliers have attempted to match their supply to demand since 
2013, keeping prices relatively stable until early 2016.  However, with demand remaining sluggish and supply growing 
from new sources, one major zircon supplier reduced prices by approximately US$100 per tonne in March 2016, forcing 
others  to  follow.    Despite  attempts  to  subsequently  increase  pricing,  subdued  demand  and  excess  inventories  are 
expected to keep prices flat at current levels throughout the 2017 financial year.
Any potential uplift in zircon prices remains dependent on firmer than expected economic growth in the major markets 
of China, USA and Europe, and on a more controlled response from major zircon producers in managing their production 
and stocks.

(i) Base Resources’ financial results are reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These Financial Statements include certain 
non-IFRS measures including EBITDA, EBIT and NPAT. These measures are presented to enable understanding of the underlying performance of the 
Group and have not been audited.
Base Resources recorded a loss after tax of $20.9 million for the year ended 30 June 2016, compared with $16.0 million 
in 2015.  Sales revenue was $169.0 million for 2016 (2015: $145.5 million), achieving an average price of product sold 
(rutile, ilmenite and zircon) of $282 per tonne or US$205 per tonne (2015: $309 per tonne or US$256 per tonne).  Total 
cost of goods sold was $86.6 million for 2016 (2015: $73.3 million), at an average cost of $144 per tonne (US$105 per 
tonne) of product sold (2015: $155 per tonne or US$130 per tonne).  Operating costs per tonne produced for 2016 was 
$121 per tonne or US$88 per tonne (2015: $124 per tonne or US$103 per tonne).
With an achieved revenue to cost of sales ratio of 2:1, the Kwale Operation is well positioned in the upper quarter of 
mineral  sands  producers.  Having  reached  design  recoveries  for  rutile  and  zircon  in  2016,  it  is  expected  that,  when 
combined with higher MSP throughput  rates, production of these high  value  products  will increase in 2017, further 
improving the revenue to cost ratio.
Despite lower commodity prices, increased production and sales volumes and a sharp focus on cost management has 
delivered a Kwale Operation EBITDA of $68.0 million (2015: $62.4 million) and a Group EBITDA of $60.6 million for 2016 
(2015: $55.0 million).
8
DIRECTORS REPORT
A net loss after tax of $6.4 million (2015: $6.0 million) was recorded by the Kwale Operation and $20.9 million (2015: 
$16.0 million) for the Group.  Loss per share for the Group was 3.41 cents (2015: 2.85 cents).
Cash flow from operations was $78.6 million for 2016 (2015: $38.2 million), higher than Group EBITDA predominately 
driven by a decrease in receivables of $10.9 million during the reporting period, associated with $10.3 million of Kenyan 
operational VAT refunds and timing of sales receipts.
In December 2015, the Kwale Project Debt Facility (“Debt Facility”) was rescheduled in order to establish a repayment 
profile  more  appropriate  to  the  commodity  price  environment. 
  Under  the  terms  of  the  reschedule,  
US$14  million of the Debt  Facility was paid down on execution, with a  further US$9.5 million  scheduled repayment 
made in June 2016, reducing the outstanding debt to US$180.5 million. Total debt outstanding, inclusive of the Taurus 
Debt Facility, at 30 June 2016 was $270.3 million (US$201 million) compared with $292.6 million (US$224 million) at 30 
June 2015.
Significant changes in state of affairs
The significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the year and to the date of this report were:
a.  Reschedule of the Debt Facility in December 2015; and
b.  Completion of a pro rata renounceable entitlement offer to existing shareholders in March 2016, raising gross 
proceeds of $10 million.  The proceeds will be used to provide continuity and certainty of corporate funding, 
and allow progression of Base Resources’ strategic plan and capitalise on achievements to date.
There were no other significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial period.
After balance date events
Subsequent to year end, in July 2016, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Facility, US$10.8 million of surplus 
cash  was  ‘swept’  from  the  Kwale  Operation.    Half  of  the  cash  sweep  (US$5.4  million)  went  towards  mandatory 
repayment  of  the  Debt  Facility,  with  the  other  half  distributed  up  to  the  Australian  parent  entity,  Base  Resources 
Limited.  From the cash sweep portion received by Base Resources Limited, a mandatory fifty percent (US$2.7 million) 
was  applied  to  repayment  of  the  Taurus  Debt  Facility,  as  required  under  the  facility  agreement,  with  the  balance 
available for general corporate funding.
There have been no other significant after balance date events at the date of this report.
Future developments, prospects and business strategies
Base  Resources  strategy  is  to  continue  to  optimise  the  Kwale  Operation  whilst  pursuing  growth  from  internal  and 
external opportunities.

also granted indemnities under the terms of deeds of indemnity with current and former Directors and current 
officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Each deed provides that the relevant Director or officer is to the

REMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED
Role of the Remuneration & Nominations Committee
The Remuneration & Nominations Committee is responsible for oversight of the remuneration system and policies. It is 
also responsible for evaluating the performance of the Executive Directors and monitoring performance of the executive 
management team. The Board, upon recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, determines the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and approves the remuneration of the executive management team.
The objective of the Remuneration & Nominations Committee is to ensure that remuneration system and policies attract 
and retain executives and directors who will create value for shareholders.
Services from remuneration consultants
The  Remuneration  Committee  engaged  Godfrey  Remuneration  Group  (“Godfrey”)  to  review  the  market 
competitiveness of the Group’s remuneration practices for the Senior Executives in 2016.
The Committee is satisfied the advice received from Godfrey is free from undue influence from the Senior Executives to 
whom the remuneration recommendations apply.
The  Godfrey  remuneration  review  was  provided  to  the  Committee  as  an  input  into  decision  making  only.  The 
Remuneration Committee considered the review, along with other factors, in making its remuneration decisions.
In addition to the Senior Executive remuneration review, Godfrey provided advice on the remuneration of the Group’s 
non-executive directors, and various other advisory services.  Total fees paid to Godfrey for these services were $30,200.
Remuneration policy
Base Resources is committed to the close alignment  of remuneration to shareholder return, particularly that of the 
Senior Executives. To this end, the Group’s remuneration system is designed to attract, motivate and retain people by 
identifying and rewarding high performers and recognising their contribution to the continued growth and success of 
the Group.
Key objectives of the Group’s remuneration policy are to ensure that remuneration practices:
  Facilitate the achievement of the Group’s objectives; 
  Provide strong linkage between executive incentive rewards and creation of value for shareholders;  
  Are simple to understand and implement, openly communicated and are equitable across the Group; 
  Attract, retain and motivate employees of the required capabilities; and 
  Comply with applicable legal requirements and appropriate standards of governance.
17
REMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED
Key principles of Senior Executive remuneration
Remuneration  comprises  fixed  remuneration,  and  variable  (or  “at-risk”)  remuneration,  which  is  determined  by 
individual and Group performance. The Group targets total fixed remuneration (“TFR”) at the 50th market percentile 
and total remuneration package (“TRP”), including at-target variable remuneration, at the 75th market percentile, for 
Senior Executives. As a consequence, the Group’s Senior Executives have a higher proportion of remuneration at-risk 
than industry averages.
Questions and answers about Senior Executive remuneration:
Remuneration mix
What is the balance 
between fixed and at-
risk remuneration?
The mix of fixed and at-risk remuneration varies depending on the organisational level of 
executives, and also depends on the performance of the Group and individual executives. 
More senior positions have a greater proportion of their remuneration at-risk.
If  overall  Group  performance  fails  to  meet  a  minimum  standard,  no  executives  will  be 
entitled to receive any at-risk remuneration. For all executives, it is therefore possible that 
no at-risk remuneration will be earned and that fixed remuneration will represent 100 per 
cent of total remuneration.
If target at-risk remuneration is earned, the proportion of total remuneration represented 
by fixed and at-risk remuneration would be:

Executive Directors (includes Managing Director): 36% fixed and 64% at-risk.
  Other Senior Executives: 53% fixed and 47% at-risk.
Fixed remuneration
What is included in 
fixed remuneration?
When and how is fixed 
remuneration 
reviewed?
TFR  includes  a  base  salary  plus  superannuation.  Allowances  and  other  benefits  may  be 
provided  and  are  as  agreed, 
leased  motor  vehicles  and  additional 
superannuation, provided that no extra cost is incurred by the Group.
including
In order to attract and retain people of the requisite capability to key roles located in Kenya, 
an additional market allowance may be paid. The market allowance, while fixed in nature, 
does  not  form  part  of  TFR  for  the  purposes  of  calculating  at-risk  remuneration 
entitlements.
TFR is reviewed annually. Any adjustments to the TFR for the Executive Directors must be 
approved  by  the  Board  after  recommendation  by  the  Remuneration  Committee.  The 
Executive  Directors  determine  the  TFR  of  other  Senior  Executives  within  specified 
guidelines approved by the Board. The Group seeks to position the fixed remuneration at 
the 50th market percentile of salaries for comparable companies within the mining industry, 
utilising datasets and specific advice provided by independent remuneration consultants.
Short Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”)
What is the STIP?
The STIP  is the cash component  of the at-risk  remuneration, payable based on a  mix of 
Group and individual annual performance standards.
Why does the Board 
consider the STIP is 
appropriate?
At-risk remuneration strengthens the link between pay and performance.  The purpose of 
these programs is to reward executives for annual performance relative to expectations of 
their role accountabilities, required behaviours and KPI’s as well as the delivery of annual 
business plans. A reward structure that provides at-risk remuneration is also necessary as a 
competitive remuneration package in the Australian and global marketplace for executives.
18
REMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED
STIP (continued)
Does the STIP take into 
account different levels 
of performance 
compared to 
objectives?



The size of any payment is linked to the extent of achievement. Levels of performance 
required for target levels of STIP are set such that they are challenging but achievable.
Required performance levels for each performance criteria are set at three levels being:
Threshold - A performance level that is below optimal but nevertheless acceptable. It is 
the minimum for which a small STIP award would be payable.  The STIP is designed such 
that  there  is  an  80%  probability  the  executive  will  achieve  or  exceed  this  level  of 
achievement.
Target  -  A  performance  level  that  represents  a  challenging  but  achievable  level  of 
performance.    The  STIP  is  designed  such  that  there  is  a  50%  to  60%  probability  the 
executive will achieve or exceed this level of achievement.
Stretch - A performance level that is clearly at the upper limit of what may be achievable.  
The STIP is designed such that there is a 10% to 20% probability the executive will achieve 
or exceed this level of achievement.
The  probabilities  of  achievement  are  set  at  these  levels  such  that,  over  time,  awards 
approximately equal to the target level would become payable, assuming performance to 
role.  The  achievement  of  this  target  level  of  award  would  support  the  75th  market 
percentile total remuneration package policy objective for executives.
What are the 
performance criteria?
Performance  criteria  are  assigned  for  both 
Performance criteria may change from year to year.
individual  and  Group  performance.
For Senior Executives, 50% of the STIP is attached to individual performance criteria and 
50% to corporate performance criteria.
Reflecting  the  importance  attached  to  role  clarity  within  Base  Resources,  individual 
performance criteria are drawn directly from the role accountabilities in the participant’s 
role  description.    Each  performance  criteria  is  allocated  a  weighting  that  reflects  the 
relative importance of that performance criteria for the year.
Corporate performance criteria are set at the commencement of each financial year and 
are derived from the annual operating plan and may vary from time to time to include 
other  aspects  of  performance  for  which  there  is  shared  accountability  and  which  the 
Group wishes to emphasise.
The target corporate performance (50% STIP component) criteria for Senior Executives for 
the 2016 financial year comprised:

5% above budgeted group EBITDA, assuming fixed AUD:USD exchange rate and 
variances in actual sales prices against budgeted prices limited to +/- 25%.
Is there an overriding 
financial performance 
or other conditions?
For  each  year,  a  gate  or  gates  may  be  determined  by  the  Board.    The  gate  may  be  a 
minimum level of earnings for the Group or a safety performance threshold that must be 
achieved for any awards to become payable under the STIP.
Irrespective  of  whether  a  gate  is  achieved,  the  Board  retains  discretion  to  increase  or 
decrease  awards  in  its  absolute  discretion.    It  is  intended  that  the  exercise  of  this 
discretion is used sparingly to take account of significant events and/or factors that were 
not anticipated when the year commenced and the performance criteria were set.
The following gates were in place for the 2016 financial year:
  No workplace fatalities.
  No major reputational or environmental events.
19
REMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED
STIP (continued)
What is the value of the 
STIP award 
opportunity?
Executive  Directors  have  a  target  STIP  opportunity  of  60%  of  TFR,  with  a  minimum 
opportunity  (if  only  threshold  level  is  met)  of  20%  and  a  maximum  opportunity  (if  the 
stretch targets are achieved) of 100% of TFR.
How is STIP assessed?
Other Senior Executives have a target STIP opportunity of 30% of TFR, with a minimum 
opportunity  (if  only  threshold  level  is  met)  of  15%  and  a  maximum  opportunity  (if  the 
stretch targets are achieved) of 60% of TFR.
These percentages are set based on external advice to achieve the remuneration policy 
intent of 75th market percentile total remuneration package market positioning.
Individual performance criteria - are assessed using a performance rating scale. In making 
the assessment in respect of a particular area of accountability, consideration is given to 
the  extent  to  which  the  behaviours  and  performance  indicators  identified  in  the  role 
description  have  been  modelled  and  observed.  This  assessment  is  undertaken  by  the 
participant’s manager and then signed-off by the manager-once-removed.  In the case of 
the Executive Directors, the assessment is undertaken by the Remuneration Committee 
and approved by the Board.
Corporate  performance  criteria  –  the  Board  determines  the  extent  to  which  each 
corporate performance criteria has been achieved.
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
What is the LTIP?
The LTIP is the equity component of at-risk remuneration and is linked to the Group’s Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance over a 3 year period.
The LTIP aims to reward participants for Base Resources TSR performance, both relative 
to its peer group and in absolute terms.
How often are LTIP 
awards made?
The LTIP operates on the basis of a series of cycles.  Each cycle commences on 1 October 
and is followed by a 3 year performance period, with a test date on the 3rd anniversary of 
the commencement of the cycle. The first cycle of the LTIP began on 1 October 2011.
Why does the Board 
consider an LTIP is 
appropriate?
The Group believes that a well designed LTIP can:
  Attract executives with the required capability;
  Retain key talent;
  Maintain a stable leadership team; and
 Explicitly  align  and  link  the  interests  of  Base  Resources  leadership  team  and
shareholders.
What types of equity 
may be granted under 
the LTIP?
Performance rights are granted under the Base Resources LTIP. Performance rights are a 
right  granted  to  acquire  one  share  in  Base  Resources,  subject  to  satisfying  the 
performance criteria outlined below.
A participant is not entitled to participate in or receive any dividends or other shareholder 
benefits  until  the  performance  right  has  vested  and  a  share  has  been  allocated  and 
transferred to the participant.
Was a grant made in 
2016?
Performance  Rights  were  granted  to  eligible  participants  in  the  LTIP  for  the  cycle 
commencing  1  October  2015.  The  number  of  performance  rights  granted  for  each 
executive  was  calculated  by  reference  to  the  volume  weighted  average  share  price 
(“VWAP”) on the twenty trading days up to the start of the cycle, being $0.0575 per share.
20
REMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED
LTIP (continued)
What are the LTIP 
performance 
conditions?
The Group uses two LTIP performance criteria to determine the proportion of performance 
rights which vest, as follows:
  Half  of  the  performance  rights  are  subject  to  a  relative  TSR  criteria  (the  relative  TSR
performance rights); and
  Half  of  the  performance  rights  are  subject  to  an  absolute  TSR  criteria  (the  absolute  TSR
performance rights).
The Board considers that TSR is an appropriate performance hurdle because it ensures that 
a proportion of each participant’s remuneration is explicitly linked to shareholder value and 
ensures that participants only receive a benefit where there is a corresponding direct benefit 
to shareholders.
Relative TSR performance rights
The proportion of relative TSR performance rights which vest will be determined on the basis 
of Base Resources’ TSR relative to the TSR of the comparator group over the performance 
period, as set out below:
Base Resources relative TSR 
performance
Less than 50th percentile
50th percentile
Percentage of relative TSR 
performance rights that vest
Nil
50%
Between 50th and 75th percentile
Pro rata between 50% and 100%
75th percentile and above
100%
Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  Board  has  the  absolute  discretion  to  determine  that  no 
relative TSR performance rights vest if Base Resources TSR is negative (despite its relative 
placing within the TSR comparator group).
Absolute TSR performance rights
The proportion of absolute TSR performance rights which vest will be determined on the 
basis of Base Resources’ TSR on the following scale:
Base Resources 3-year TSR
Percentage of absolute TSR 
performance rights that vest
Less than 40.5%
40.5%
Nil
25%
Between 40.5% and 60%
Pro rata between 25% and 50%
Between 60% and 100%
Pro rata between 50% and 100%
100% or greater
100%
The number of performance rights granted for the cycle commencing 1 October 2015 is by 
reference to the 20 day VWAP of $0.0575 per share, subject to a small scaleback to ensure 
compliance with applicable ASIC relief ($0.2905 for cycle commencing 1 October 2014 and 
$0.3697 for cycle commencing 1 October 2013). In order to achieve 100% vesting a share 
price of $0.1150 or greater would be required ($0.5810 for cycle commencing 1 October 
2014 and $0.7394 for cycle commencing 1 October 2013) at the conclusion of the 3 year 
performance period.

REMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED
LTIP (continued)
What happens to 
performance rights 
granted under the LTIP 
when a participant 
ceases employment?
Where a participant ceases to be employed by a Group member (and is not immediately 
employed  by  another  Group  member)  for  any  reason  other  than  a  qualifying  reason,  all 
unvested performance rights of that participant are automatically forfeited.
Where  a  participant  ceases  to  be  employed  by  a  Group  member  because  of  a  qualifying 
reason, then the Board must determine, in its absolute discretion, the number of unvested 
performance rights of a participant (if any) that will remain on foot and become capable of 
vesting in accordance with LTIP rules.
The Board will generally exercise its discretion in the following manner:

Performance rights granted in the cycle beginning on the 1 October immediately prior 
to  the  participant  ceasing  to  be  employed  by  a  Group  member  are  automatically 
forfeited; and
  All  other  performance  rights  that  are  not  forfeited  on  the  participant  ceasing  to  be 
employed by a Group member will continue to be held by the participant and will be 
tested for vesting on the test date for the relevant performance right.
Qualifying reasons include but are not limited to death, total and permanent disablement, 
retirement or redundancy.
What happens in the 
event of a change of 
control?
Subject to the Board determining otherwise, if a change of control event occurs then a test 
date arises on the date that the change of control event occurs with the Board to test the 
extent to which the performance criteria have been satisfied:
Do shares granted 
upon vesting of 
performance rights 
granted under the LTIP 
dilute existing 
shareholders’ equity?
Does the Group have a 
policy in relation to 
hedging at-risk 
remuneration?
Did any performance 
rights vest in 2016?
  On the basis of the offer price of the relevant transaction; and 

In  the  case  of  absolute  TSR  performance  rights,  reducing  the  percentage  TSR 
performance hurdle pro rata to the unexpired portion of the performance period as at 
the date the change in control event occurs.
Shares allocated to the participants in the LTIP upon vesting of performance rights may be 
satisfied by the Group issuing shares to the plan trustee or purchases by the plan trustee on 
market.  In the event the Group issues shares to the plan trustee to satisfy the vesting of 
performance rights then shareholders’ pre-existing equity will be diluted.
A participant in the LTIP must not enter into an arrangement if the arrangement would have 
the effect of limiting the exposure of the participant to risk relating to performance rights 
that have not vested.
The  4,870,331  performance  rights  granted  under  the  LTIP  for  the  cycle  commencing  
1 October 2012, completed the three year performance period on 30 September 2015 and 
vested as follows:
  Relative TSR performance rights
Base Resources TSR over the performance period placed it in  38th position relative to 
the  TSR  of  the  50  comparator  group  companies,  a  TSR  performance  in  the  26th 
percentile, resulting in none of the 2,435,166 relative performance rights vesting.
  Absolute TSR performance rights
Base Resources TSR over the performance period, by reference to a final VWAP of $0.06, 
equated to a TSR of -75%, resulting in none of the 2,435,165 absolute performance rights 
vesting.
No shares were issued to the participants in the LTIP.

Group performance and its link to shareholder return
The following graph compares the yearly change in the cumulative  TSR of Base Resources Limited shares during the 
period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2016, against the cumulative total return of the ASX 200 Resources Index over the same 
period.  The graph illustrates the cumulative return from Base Resources over the past five years, assuming $100 was 
invested.  No dividends have been declared during this period.

Executive remuneration outcomes for 2016
Short Term Incentives
At the end of the 2016 financial year, a review of the performance of each Senior Executive was undertaken against 
each  of  their  2016  individual  performance  measures  as  explained  above.    The  2016  financial  year  corporate 
performance achieved was between target and stretch performance levels, and incentives are payable in relation to 
this component commensurate with the performance level achieved. STIP entitlements earned for 2016 performance 
are paid in the 2017 financial year.
The following table outlines the STI that was earned in comparison with the target STI for the 2016 financial year:

LTIP Performance Rights
The LTIP, introduced in 2012, operates on the basis of a series of 3 year performance cycles commencing on 1 October 
each  year.  Accordingly,  LTIP  performance  rights  issued  in  the  year  ending  30  June  2016  are  subject  to  a  3  year 
performance period ending on 30 September 2018. Performance rights issued under the plan in the 2013 financial year, 
totalling 4,870,331, completed their 3 year  performance period on 30 September 2015, with no performance rights 
vesting.

Take home pay for 2016
The remuneration detailed in this table represents the Senior Executives’ “take home pay” and is aligned to the current 
reporting period, and therefore is particularly useful in understanding actual remuneration received during the year. 
The table excludes adjustments made for accounting purposes, and included in Statutory Remuneration (refer page 27), 
specifically the probability and value of an employee obtaining long service leave and the fair value of performance 
rights under three outstanding LTIP cycles expensed during the 2016 financial year. The remuneration packages for all 
Senior Executives are shown in the following table in their employment currency and  remain unchanged from 2015, 
excluding changes in STIP bonus and vested performance rights.

REMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED
Statutory remuneration disclosures for the year ended 30 June 2016
The  statutory  remuneration  disclosures  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  are  detailed  below  and  are  prepared  in 
accordance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  differ  from  the  take  home  pay  summary  on  page  26.  These 
differences  arise  due  to  the  accounting  treatment  of  share-based  payments  (such  as  the  STIP  and  LTIP).  The 
remuneration packages for all Senior Executive’s remain unchanged from 2015, in their base currency.  Any changes in 
remuneration  in  the  following  table,  excluding  STIP  bonus,  are  the  result  of  foreign  exchange  movements  only,  as 
detailed below.  The remuneration for each Senior Executive of the Group for the years ending 30 June 2016 and 2015

(i)  Current year STI bonuses are accrued in the financial year to which the performance relates.  
(ii)  Long service leave entitlement represents the movement in the provision. Due to a change in calculation methodology a reduction in the provision
occurred during the year, impacting some employees.
(iii)  The fair value of performance rights is calculated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo Simulation model and recognised over the period in 
which the minimum service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The value disclosed is the portion of the fair value of the performance 
rights recognised  in the  reporting  period. The  amount  included as  remuneration  is not  necessarily  the  benefit  (if  any)  that  individual  Senior 
Executive may ultimately receive.

Shareholders approve the maximum aggregate remuneration for non-executive directors. Fees paid to non-executive 
directors  are  recommended  by  the  Remuneration  Committee  and  the  Board  is  responsible  for  ratifying  any 
recommendations, if appropriate. As approved at the Annual General Meeting on 28 November 2011, the aggregate 
limit of fees payable per annum is $750,000 in total.  Non-executive director remuneration has remained unchanged 
since 2011.
The Group’s policy is that non-executive director’s remuneration is structured to exclude equity-based remuneration 
and  reviewed  annually.  However,  historically  the  Group  was  small  and  the  full  Board,  including  the  non-executive 
directors, were included in the operations of the Group more closely than may be the case with larger companies and 
the non-executive directors were entitled to participate in equity based remuneration schemes.
All directors have their indemnity insurance paid by the Group.
Non-executive  directors  receive  a  fixed  fee  remuneration  consisting  of  a  cash  fee  and  statutory  superannuation 
contributions made by the Group and additional fees for committee roles as set out below:

which is due at 31 December 2016, totalling $27.0 million (US$20 million), reduced to $22.7 million (US$17.3 million) 
subsequent  year  end,  refer  to  note  13.    The  positive  working  capital  position  at  the  subsidiary  level  is  not  freely 
transferable to the parent entity due to restrictions under the Kwale Project Debt Facility and as a result, the Group will 
require additional funding by 31 December 2016.
The Directors consider the going concern basis of preparation to be appropriate based on forecast  cash flows.  The 
achievement of the cash flow forecast is dependent upon mineral sands prices, meeting production output and cost 
forecasts, the receipt of VAT refunds as expected and the successful refinancing or replacement of the Taurus Debt 
Facility at the parent entity level.
The Group is currently assessing its options to address the outstanding balance of the Taurus Facility at maturity, which 
include seeking an extension of the facility maturity date, refinancing the facility with another party, raising equity or a 
combination of these options.  However, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that a suitable funding solution 
can be secured in the required timeframe in light of current market conditions for mineral sands, current operating 
performance of the project and the past capacity of the Group to obtain funding as required.
Should the Group not secure a suitable funding solution for the Taurus Debt Facility in the required timeframe, there is 
material uncertainty as to whether the Group will be able to continue as a  going concern and realise its assets and 
extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business at  the amounts stated in the financial report. The financial 
report does not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts nor to 
the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the  Group's functional currency 
and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000s) unless otherwise stated.  The functional currency for 
the subsidiaries is United States dollars.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The directors make estimates and judgements in the preparation of the financial report that affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses based on historical knowledge 
and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on 
current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying values of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have been impaired. This requires an estimation of the fair value of the cash-
generating unit to which the assets are allocated. Estimating the fair value amount requires management to make an 
estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit over the forecast period and also to determine 
a  suitable  discount  rate  in  order  to  calculate  the  present  value  of  those  cash  flows.  Key  estimates  supporting  the 
expected future cash flows include mineral sands prices, production output and cost forecasts.
Mine closure and rehabilitation obligations
Provision  is  made  for  the  anticipated  costs  of  future  closure  and  rehabilitation  of  mining  areas.  These  future  cost 
estimates are discounted to their present value. The calculation of these provision estimates requires assumptions such 
as application of environmental legislation, plant closure dates, available technologies, engineering cost estimates and 
discount  rates. A change in any of the assumptions used may have a  material impact on the carrying value of mine 
closure and rehabilitation obligations.
Ore reserves and resources estimates
The  estimated  quantities  of  economically  recoverable  reserves  and  resources  are  based  upon  interpretations  of 
geological and geophysical models and require assumptions to be made regarding factors such as estimates of  short 
and long-term exchange rates, estimates of short and long-term commodity prices, future capital requirements and 
future operating performance. Changes in reported reserves and resources estimates can impact the carrying value of 
property,  plant  and  equipment,  intangible  assets,  provisions  for  mine  closure  and  rehabilitation  obligations,  the 
recognition of deferred tax assets, as well as the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the Statement of 
Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
Share based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by a recognised valuation model, using 
the assumptions detailed in note 20.
Taxation
Balances related to taxation disclosed in the financial statements and the notes thereto are based on the best estimates 
of directors. These estimates take into account both the financial performance and position of the Group as they pertain 
to  current  income  taxation  legislation,  and  the  directors  understanding  thereof.  No  adjustment  has  been  made  for 
pending or future taxation legislation.  The current income tax position represents the directors’ best estimate, pending 
an assessment by the tax authorities in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations. In accordance with
40
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
the Group’s accounting policies for deferred taxes (refer note 1c), a  deferred tax asset  is recognised  for unused tax 
losses only if it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise those losses. Determination of future 
taxable  profits  requires  estimates  and  assumptions  as  to  future  events  and  circumstances,  in  particular,  whether 
successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest will be 
achieved. This includes estimates and judgements about commodity prices, exchange rates, future capital requirements, 
future operational performance and the timing of estimated cash flows. Changes in these estimates and assumptions 
could impact on the amount and probability of estimated taxable profits and accordingly the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are set out in note 6.
Construction period VAT receivable
Refer to note 22 for discussion on judgements surrounding recovery of construction period VAT receivable.
Significant accounting policies
(a)  Principles of consolidation
The  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  assets,  liabilities  and  results  of  entities  controlled  by  Base 
Resources Limited at the end of the reporting period.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the 
date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Where controlled entities have entered or left the Group during the year, the financial performance of those entities 
are included only for the period of the year that they were controlled. A list of controlled entities is contained in note  
19 to the financial statements.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all inter-group balances and transactions between entities in the 
consolidated  Group  have  been  eliminated  on  consolidation.    Accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  have  been  changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with those adopted by the parent entity.
(b)  Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting 
date are re-translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.  Non-monetary items in a foreign 
currency that  are measured  at historical cost  are translated using the  exchange rate at  the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency differences arising on re-translation are recognised in Profit or Loss.
Foreign operations
The  assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  to  the  functional  currency  at  exchange  rates  at  the 
reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, are translated to Australian dollars at exchange rates 
at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Foreign  currency  differences  are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and 
presented in the foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) in equity. When the settlement of a monetary 
item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign 
exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign 
operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income, and are presented in the translation reserve in equity.
(c)
Income tax
The income tax expense / benefit for the year comprise current income tax expense / benefit and deferred tax expense 
/ benefit.
41
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Current  income  tax  expense  charged  to  the  Statement  of  Profit  or  Loss  and  Other  Comprehensive  Income  is  the 
expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income or loss calculated using applicable income tax rates enacted, 
or substantially enacted, as at reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  Current 
tax liabilities / assets are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to / recovered from the relevant 
taxation authority.
Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the 
year as well as unused tax losses.
Current and deferred income tax expense / benefit is charged or credited directly to equity instead of the Statement of 
Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to 
equity.
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  ascertained  based  on  temporary  differences  arising  between  the  tax  bases  of 
assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  Deferred  tax  assets  also  result  where 
amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available.  No deferred income tax will be recognised 
from  the  initial  recognition  of  an  asset  or  liability,  excluding  a  business  combination,  where  there  is  no  effect  on 
accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset 
is  realised  or  the  liability  is  settled,  based  on  tax  rates  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  reporting  date.    Their 
measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the 
related asset or liability.
Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net 
settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur.  Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities 
where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability 
will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered 
or settled.
(d)  Property, plant and equipment
Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less, where applicable, any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
Plant and equipment is measured on the historical cost basis.  Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to 
the acquisition of the asset.  Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
Group  and  the  cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured  reliably.  All  other  repairs  and  maintenance  are  recognised  in  the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income during the financial period in which they are incurred.  The gain or loss on disposal 
of an item of plant and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of 
the property, plant and equipment, and is recognised net within other income / other expenses in  the Statement of 
Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
Mine property and development assets include costs transferred from exploration and evaluation assets once technical 
feasibility  and  commercial  viability  of  an  area  of  interest  are  demonstrable,  and  also  includes  subsequent  costs  to 
develop the mine to the production phase. Any ongoing costs associated with mining which are considered to benefit 
mining operations in future periods are capitalised.
42
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Depreciation
The depreciable amount of all buildings, plant and equipment, but excluding freehold land, is depreciated on a straight 
line  basis  over  the  asset’s  useful  life  to  the  Group  commencing  from  the  time  the  asset  is  held  ready  for  use.    The 
depreciation methods used for each class of depreciable assets are:
Class of plant and equipment
Depreciation method
Buildings
Straight line at 5% per annum
Plant and equipment
Straight line at 10% to 30% per annum
Mine property and development
Straight line over remaining mine life
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if appropriate, at each reporting 
date.  An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount 
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
(e)  Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources is the search for mineral resources after the entity has obtained 
legal rights to explore in a specific area, as well as the determination of the technical feasibility and commercial viability 
of  extracting  the  mineral  resource.    Accordingly,  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  are  those  expenditures 
incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical 
feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable.
Accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed separately for each 'area  of interest'. An 'area  of 
interest' is an individual geological area which is considered to constitute a favourable environment for the presence of 
a mineral deposit or has been proved to contain such a deposit.
For each area of interest, the expenditure is recognised as an exploration and evaluation asset when the rights of tenure 
to that area of interest are current and the expenditure is expected to be recouped through successful development 
and exploitation of an area of interest, or alternatively by its sale, and where activities in the area have not yet reached 
a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves.
General and administrative costs are allocated to, and included in, the cost of exploration and evaluation assets only to 
the extent that those costs can be related directly to operational activities in the area of interest to which the exploration 
and evaluation assets relate.  In all other instances, these costs are expensed as incurred.
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other 
Comprehensive Income in the year in which the decision to abandon the area is made.
Impairment testing of exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility 
and commercial viability or facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
(f)  Mine development assets
Mine development expenditure relates to costs incurred to access a mineral resource.  It represents those costs incurred 
after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the mineral resource has been demonstrated and 
an identified mineral reserve is being prepared for production (but is not yet in production). Exploration and evaluation 
assets are assessed for impairment prior to their transfer to mine development assets.
43
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Significant  factors considered in determining the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project  are the 
completion of a feasibility study, the existence of sufficient proven and probable reserves to proceed with development 
and approval by the board of directors to proceed with development of the project.
Mine development expenditure includes:
  Reclassified exploration and evaluation assets; 
  Direct costs of construction; and 
  An appropriate allocation of overhead and borrowing costs incurred in the construction phase.
Capitalisation of mine development expenditure ceases once the mining property is capable of commercial production, 
at which point it is transferred to property, plant and equipment, and depreciated (refer note 1(d)).
Any  mine  development  expenditure incurred once a mine property is in production is immediately expensed to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income except where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity, 
in which case it is capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
(g)
Inventories
Inventories of heavy mineral concentrate and finished product are physically measured or estimated and valued at the 
lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value.  Cost  represents  weighted  average  cost  and  includes  direct  costs  and  an 
appropriate portion of fixed and variable overhead expenditure, including depreciation and amortisation.
Inventories  of  consumable  supplies  and  spare  parts  to  be  used  in  production  are  valued  at  weighted  average  cost. 
Obsolete or damaged inventories are  valued at net  realisable value. A regular  and ongoing review is undertaken to 
establish the extent of surplus items, and a provision is made for any potential loss on their disposal.
Net realisable value is the net selling price less all costs still to be incurred in converting the relevant inventory to saleable 
product.
(h)  Mine closure and rehabilitation obligations
Provisions are made for the estimated cost of  mine closure and rehabilitation relating to areas disturbed during the 
mine’s operations up to the reporting date but not yet rehabilitated. Provision has been made in full for all the disturbed 
areas at the reporting date based on current estimates of costs to rehabilitate such areas, discounted to their present 
value based on expected future cash flows. The estimated costs include the current cost of rehabilitation necessary to 
meet legislative requirements. Changes in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis as they arise.
Uncertainty exists as to the amount of rehabilitation obligations which will be incurred due to the impact of changes in 
environmental  legislation,  and  many  other  factors,  including  future  developments,  changes  in  technology,  price 
increases  and  changes  in  interest  rates.  The  amount  of  the  provision  relating  to  mine  closure  and  rehabilitation 
obligations is recognised at the commencement of the mining project and/or construction of the assets where a legal 
or constructive obligation exists at that time.
The provision is recognised as a liability, separated into current (estimated costs arising within twelve months) and non-
current  components  based  on  the  expected  timing  of  these  cash  flows.  A  corresponding  asset  is  included  in  mine 
property and mine development assets, only to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the restoration expenditure will flow to the entity. The capitalised cost of this asset is recognised in property, plant 
and equipment and is amortised over the life of the mine.
At each reporting date the rehabilitation liability is re-measured in line with changes in discount rates, and timing or 
amounts of the costs to be incurred. Mine closure and rehabilitation provisions are adjusted for changes in estimates. 
Adjustments  to  the  estimated  amount  and  timing  of  future  closure  and  rehabilitation  cash  flows  are  a  normal 
occurrence in light of the significant judgements and estimates involved. Changes in the liability relating to mine closure 
and  rehabilitation  obligations  are  added  to  or  deducted  from  the  related  asset  (where  it  is  probable  that  future
44
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
economic benefits will flow to the entity), other than the unwinding of the discount which is recognised as financing 
expenses in the  Statement  of Comprehensive Income. Changes to capitalised cost  result  in an adjustment  to future 
amortisation charges.
The provisions referred to above do not include any amounts related to remediation costs associated with unforeseen 
circumstances.
(i)
Finance income and expenses
Financing income includes:

Interest income on cash and cash equivalents.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest rate method.
Financing expenses include:

Interest on short-term and long-term borrowings;
  Amortisation of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings; 

Finance lease charges; and 
The impact of the unwinding of discount on provisions for mine closure and rehabilitation.

Financing  expenses  are  calculated  using  the  effective  interest  rate  method.  Finance  expenses  incurred  for  the 
construction of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare 
the asset for its intended use or sale. Other financing expenses are expensed as incurred.
(j)
Leases
Operating Leases
Lease payments for operating leases, where substantially all the risks and benefits remain with the lessor, are charged 
as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
Leased assets
Assets held by the Group under leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
are classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of 
its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that 
asset.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction 
of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. This will be 
the case if the following two criteria are met:
 the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets; and 
 the arrangement contains a right to use the assets.
At  inception  or  upon  reassessment  of  the  arrangement,  the  Group  separates  payments  and  other  consideration 
required by such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair 
values. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an 
asset and a liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset. Subsequently, the liability
45
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
is  reduced  as  payments  are  made  and  an  imputed  finance  cost  on  the  liability  is  recognised  using  the  Group’s 
incremental borrowing rate.
(k)
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying values of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to the asset’s carrying 
value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is expensed to Profit or Loss.
(l)  Revenue
The  Group  sells  mineral  sands  under  a  range  of  International  Commercial  Terms  (Incoterms).  Product  sales  are 
recognised as revenue when the Group has transferred both the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control 
of the products sold and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. The passing of risk to the customer is usually 
realised at the point that the physical control is transferred and is no longer under the physical control of the Group. 
The  Incoterms  set  out  the  point  at  which  the  transfer  of  risk  to  the  customer  takes  place  and  are  the  ultimate 
determinant.
Contract terms for some of the Group’s sales allow for a price adjustment based on average market prices in the quarter 
that  the  product  is  shipped.  Sales  revenue  for  these  products  is  recognised  at  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  total 
consideration received or receivable, which takes into account the latest available market data at the balance date and 
excludes taxes or duty.
(m)  Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can be reliably measured (refer to note 1h 
for provision for rehabilitation).
(n)  Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial assets
The Group initially recognises loans, receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial 
assets are  recognised initially on the date at which  the Group becomes a  party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
The  Group  derecognises  a  financial  asset  when  the  contractual  rights  to  the  cash  flows  from  the  asset  expire,  or  it 
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that 
is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and 
only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  
Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.  Subsequent to initial 
recognition  loans  and  receivables  are  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method,  less  any 
impairment losses.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits held at call with banks.
46
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Non derivative financial liabilities
The Group initially recognises financial liabilities on the date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.  Such liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction 
costs.  Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.
Other financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables.
(o)  Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share 
options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
(p)  Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share for its ordinary shares.  Basic earnings per share is calculated 
by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the earnings attributable to ordinary 
shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares which comprise of vested and exercisable share options.
(q)  Employee benefits
Short-term benefits payable
Short-term  employee  benefit  obligations  are  measured  on  an  undiscounted  basis  and  are  expensed  as  the  related 
service is provided.  A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under the short-term incentive plan if 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past services by the employee, 
and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Defined contribution plans
Contributions are made by the Group to individual defined contribution superannuation plans for Australian directors 
and employees and are charged as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.
Equity-settled Compensation
The Group operates equity-settled, share-based payment, employee share schemes.  The fair  value of the equity to 
which employees become entitled is measured at grant date and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, with 
a corresponding increase to an equity account.  The fair value of performance rights is ascertained using a recognised 
pricing model which incorporates all market vesting conditions.
(r)  Goods and services tax (GST), Value added tax (VAT) and other indirect taxes
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of indirect taxes, except where the amount of indirect 
tax incurred is not recoverable from the tax authorities in the relevant jurisdiction. In these circumstances the indirect 
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and 
payables in the Statement of Financial Position are shown inclusive of indirect taxes.
Cash flows are presented in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis.
(s)  Segment reporting
Determination and presentation of operating segments
Operating  segments  are  components  of  the  Group  about  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  that  is 
evaluated regularly by the Group’s senior executives in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
47
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Segment information that is evaluated by the Group’s senior executives is prepared in conformity with the accounting 
policies adopted for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Segment results that are reported to the Group’s senior executives include items directly attributable to a segment as 
well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The division of the Groups results into segments has been ascertained by reference to direct identification of revenue / 
cost centres and where interrelated segment costs exist, an allocation has been calculated on a pro rata basis of the 
identifiable costs.
(t)  New accounting standards adopted in the current period
A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2016, 
however,  the  Group  has  not  applied  the  new  or  amended  standards  in  preparing  these  consolidated  financial 
statements.  Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below.  The Group does not plan to adopt these 
standards early.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a  comprehensive framework for determining whether, 
how  much,  and  when  revenue  is  recognised.  It  replaces  existing  revenue  recognition  guidance,  including  IAS  18 
Revenue, IAS 11 Construction contracts, and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. AASB 15 is effective for annual 
reporting  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2018,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  The  Group  is  assessing  the 
potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of AASB 15.
AASB 16 Leases removes the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases – for the lessee – effectively 
treating all leases as finance leases.  Short term leases (less than 12 months) and leases of low value assets are exempt 
from the lease accounting requirements.  Furthermore, there are changes in accounting over the life of the lease as a 
front-loaded pattern of expense will be recognised for most leases, even when a constant annual rental is paid.  Lessor 
accounting remains similar to current practice.   Base Resources has not yet determined the extent of the impact of this 
standard.
AASB 9 Financial Instruments, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement. AASB 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial 
instruments, a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge 
accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments 
from IAS 39. AASB 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption 
permitted.    The  Group  is  assessing  the  potential  impact  on  its  consolidated  financial  statements  resulting  from  the 
application of AASB 9.

Potential  deferred  tax  assets  attributable  to  tax  losses  and  exploration  expenditure  carried  forward  have  not  been 
brought to account at 30 June 2016 and 2015 because the directors do not believe it is appropriate to regard realisation 
of the deferred tax assets as probable at this point in time. These benefits will only be obtained if:
The Group derives future assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from 
the deductions for the loss and exploration expenditure to be realised; 
The Group continues to comply with conditions for deductibility imposed by law; and 
No changes in tax legislation adversely affect the Group in realising the benefit from the deductions for the loss 
and exploration expenditure.

In November 2011, the Group entered into  Kwale Operation Debt Facility (“Debt Facility”) for the development and 
construction  of  the  Kwale  Operation.  In  December  2015,  the  Debt  Facility  was  rescheduled  in  order  to  establish  a 
repayment profile more appropriate to the commodity price environment.  Under the terms of the reschedule, US$14 
million of the Debt Facility was paid down on execution, with a further US$9.5 million paid down in June 2016, reducing 
the outstanding debt to US$180.5 million. All tranches of the Debt Facility carry interest rates of LIBOR plus 630 basis 
points, inclusive of political risk insurance.
Security for the Debt Facility is a fixed and floating charge over all the assets of Base Titanium Limited (“BTL”) and the 
shares in BTL held by Base Titanium (Mauritius) Limited (“BTML”) and Base Resources Limited (“BRL”) and the shares 
held in BTML by BRL.  In addition, BRL provides a parent guarantee which will remain in place until June 2017, subject 
to finalising a long term operating licence for the Group’s port operations. An additional margin of 25 basis points was 
applicable until the completion of documentation to perfect the lender security package, which was finalised in  June 
2016.   The remaining tenor of all loan tranches is 4 years.
The weighted average effective interest rate on the facilities at 30 June 2016 is 6.78% (30 June 2015: 6.65%).
All transaction costs directly attributable to securing the project debt facility funding are capitalised and offset against 
drawn loan amounts.  Capitalised borrowing costs are amortised over the life of the loan using the effective interest 
rate method.
Subsequent to year end, in July 2016, in accordance with the terms of the Debt Facility, US$10.8 million of surplus cash 
was ‘swept’ from BTL.  Half of the cash sweep (US$5.4 million) went towards mandatory repayment of the Debt Facility, 
with the other half distributed up to the Australian parent entity, BRL.  The outstanding debt after this repayment was 
US$175.1 million.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
b. Taurus Debt Facility
In December 2014, the Company executed a US$20 million unsecured debt facility with one of its major shareholders, 
Taurus Funds Management (“Taurus Facility”), to provide the funds to satisfy additional liquidity requirements from the 
Kwale Project Debt Facility reschedule in 2014, and US$5 million in corporate funding.  The Taurus Facility has been 
reclassified  from  non-current  to  current  borrowings  due  to  the  final  repayment  date  of  31  December  2016.    All 
transaction  costs  directly  attributable  to  securing  the  project  debt  facility  funding  are  capitalised  and  offset  against 
drawn loan amounts.  Capitalised borrowing costs are amortised over the life of the loan using the effective interest 
rate method.
Subsequent to year end, in July 2016, US$2.7 million of the Taurus Facility was repaid from permitted distributions from 
the Kwale Project, reducing the outstanding debt to US$17.3 million.

The mine closure and rehabilitation obligations have been recorded initially as a liability at fair value, assuming a risk-
free discount rate equivalent to the average of 10 year US Government bonds of 2.59% as at 30 June 2016 (2015: 2.81%) 
and an inflation factor of 2.13% (2015: 2.35%).  Although the ultimate amount to be incurred is uncertain, management 
has, at 30 June 2016, estimated the asset retirement cost of work completed to date using an expected remaining mine life 
of 9 years and a total undiscounted estimated cash flow of US$22,168,415 (2015: US$21,389,489). Management’s estimate 
of  the  underlying  asset  retirement  costs  are  independently  reviewed  by  an  external  consultant  on  a  regular  basis  for 
completeness.

In December 2014, the Group executed the Taurus Debt Facility, which entitled Taurus to 61,425,061 unlisted share 
options over unissued fully paid shares, for nil consideration and exercisable at $0.40, with half being issued at execution 
and half pro-rata on facility drawdown above US$5 million, which occurred in June 2015.
The fair value of the 61,425,061 options granted during the 2015 financial year  were estimated at the date of grant 
using a Black & Scholes model using the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 3%; no dividend yield; volatility 
factor  of  the  expected  market  price  of  the  Company’s  shares  of  67%  and  91%  for  each  issue  respectively;  and  a 
contractual life of 4 years.
In July 2015, 1,000,000 options, granted to RFC Corporate Limited, with an exercise price of $0.25 lapsed unexercised 
following their expiry. In January 2016, 8,500,000 options with an exercise price of $0.25 and 7,100,000 options with an 
exercise price of $0.09, granted to Key Management Personnel, lapsed unexercised following their expiry.

Terms of granted performance rights
Performance rights were granted to Senior Executives and other eligible employees under the terms of the LTIP. The 
LTIP operates on the basis of a series of cycles.  Each cycle commences on 1 October and will be followed by a 3 year 
performance  period,  with  a  test  date  on  the  3rd  anniversary  of  the  commencement  of  the  Cycle.  The  LTIP  contains 
performance criteria related to total shareholder return (TSR) to determine the proportion of performance rights which 
vest, as follows:
  Half of the performance rights are subject to a relative TSR criteria (relative TSR performance rights); and
  Half of the performance rights are subject to an absolute TSR criteria (absolute TSR performance rights).
For any relative TSR performance rights to vest, Base Resources TSR over the three year performance period must rank 
above the 50th percentile of the TSR achieved by a defined comparator group of companies. If Base Resources TSR ranks 
at the 50th percentile of the comparator group, 50% of the relative TSR performance rights vest. If Base Resources TSR 
is above the 75th percentile of the comparator group, 100% of the relative TSR performance rights vest. For achievement 
between the 50th and 75th percentile, vesting is prorated between 50% and 100%.
For any absolute TSR performance rights to vest, the absolute TSR of Base Resources over the three year performance 
period  must  be  greater  than  or  equal  to  40.5%.  If  the  TSR  reaches  40.5%,  25%  of  the  performance  rights  vest.  TSR 
performance between 40.5% and 60% will result in pro rata vesting between 25% and 50%. If the TSR performance is 
100% or more over the period, 100% of the absolute TSR performance rights vest. For TSR performance between 60% 
and 100%, vesting is prorated between 50% and 100%.
All performance rights are granted for nil consideration.
59
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The fair value of the performance rights granted during the 2016 financial year has been estimated at the date of grant 
using a Monte Carlo Simulation model using the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.15%; no dividend 
yield; volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company’s shares of 70%; and a remaining life of performance 
rights of 2.88 years. The fair value of the performance rights is recognised over the service period, which commenced 
on the date of grant of 1 October 2015.

The  overall  risk  management  strategy  seeks  to  assist  the  Group  in  meeting  its  financial  targets,  whilst  minimising 
potential  adverse  effects  on  financial  performance.  The  senior  executives  of  the  Group  meet  on  a  regular  basis  to 
analyse treasury risks and evaluate treasury management strategies in the context of the prevailing economic conditions 
and forecasts. Risk management policies are approved and reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. Financial assets 
and liabilities of the Group are carried at amortised cost, which approximates fair value.
Commodity price risk
The  Group  is  exposed  to  commodity  price  volatility  on  rutile  sales  made  under  contract  terms  which  allow  for  a 
retrospective price adjustment based on average market prices in the quarter the product is sold. Average market prices 
are derived from an independently published quarterly dataset of all rutile trades, available 4 to 5 months after the end 
of each quarter. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, sales made under these terms that have not yet been 
subject  to a  final price adjustment  are recognised at the  estimated fair  value of the total consideration received or 
receivable, which takes into account the latest available market data at the balance date.
Rutile sales revenue of $39.3 million is still subject to final market pricing at 30 June 2016 (2015: $35.4 million).  An 
interim adjustment to sales revenue has been recorded at the reporting date to align the estimated fair value of these 
sales with the latest available market data, in accordance with the accounting policy.  If commodity prices increased / 
decreased by 10%, with all other variables held constant, the Group’s after tax loss would have decreased / increased 
by $3.6 million (2015: $3.3 million).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to 
the Group.  Credit risk arises from cash and deposits with financial institutions as well as credit exposures to outstanding 
receivables.
The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through sales of mineral sands products under normal terms of trade. 
Total sales revenue for the year ended 30 June 2016 was $169.0 million (2015: $145.5 million). Major customers who 
individually accounted for more than 10% of sales revenue contributed approximately 37% (2015: 51%) of sales revenue. 
These customers represent 0% (2015: 48%) of the trade receivables balance at 30 June 2016.
Credit risk arising from sales to customers is managed by the Group’s policy to only trade with reputable companies, 
with whom a long term offtake agreement is held, or where such an agreement is not in place, sales are backed by 
Letters of Credit held with internationally recognised banks.
The Group is owed $25.2 million in VAT receivable by the Government of Kenya (Note 9). $23.0 million relates to the 
period of construction of the Kwale Mineral Sands Project by the Government of Kenya and is overdue but not impaired. 
An estimation has been made as to the timing of the receipt of this amount and forms the basis for its classification as 
a current asset.
At  the  reporting  date  the  carrying  amounts  of  financial  assets  are  adjusted  for  any  impairment  and  represent  the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security, which was as follows:

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Base Resources Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Base Resources Limited (the company), which comprises the 
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, and consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the 
year ended on that date, notes 1 to 24 comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information and the directors’ declaration of the Group comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the 
year’s end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view 
in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the 
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that is free from material 
misstatement whether due to fraud or error. In note 1, the directors also state, in accordance with Australian 
Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements of the Group 
comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. These Auditing Standards require that we comply with relevant ethical 
requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether 
the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in 
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the financial report.
We performed the procedures to assess whether in all material respects the financial report presents fairly, in 
accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards, a true and fair view which is 
consistent with our understanding of the Group’s financial position and of its performance.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.
68
Auditor’s opinion
In our opinion:
(a) the financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:
(i)
(ii)
giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of its performance 
for the year ended on that date; and
complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations  
2001.
(b) the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as disclosed in note 1.
Material uncertainty regarding continuation as a going concern
Without modification to our opinion expressed above, we draw attention to the following matter. As a result of the 
matters set out in the Financial Position note in Note 1, there is a material uncertainty which may cast significant 
doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, the company may be unable to 
realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial 
report.
Report on the remuneration report
We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the directors’ report for the year ended 30 June 2016. The 
directors of the company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the remuneration report in 
accordance with Section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
remuneration report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards.
Auditor’s opinion
In our opinion, the remuneration report of Base Resources Limited for the year ended 30 June 2016, complies with 
Section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.
