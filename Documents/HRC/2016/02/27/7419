</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of the Gambia started by stating that the country had made great 
</p>
<p>efforts to strengthen human rights in several areas, from education and health, to the rights 
</p>
<p>of women, children, persons with disabilities and fundamental freedoms, while maintaining 
</p>
<p>a balance with security to ensure a stable environment for socio-economic development.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation reiterated the particular circumstances of the Gambia that must be 
</p>
<p>borne in mind when considering human rights, notably its size, at barely 11,500 square 
</p>
<p>kilometres, with a population of less than 1.8 million people. It added that the Gambia was 
</p>
<p>a secular State with different religions living together side by side in peace and harmony, as 
</p>
<p>did the several ethnic tribes throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>7. Regarding access to the justice, the delegation noted that the Government 
</p>
<p>recognized that it was a fundamental right that was necessary for the maintenance of a 
</p>
<p>stable environment for socio-economic development. To that end, several mechanisms have 
</p>
<p>been introduced to improve access to justice, such as the National Agency for Legal Aid 
</p>
<p>(NALA) and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Secretariat (ADRS). The delegation added 
</p>
<p>that the judiciary had continued its decentralization programme with the establishment of 
</p>
<p>Magistrates&#8217; Courts in all regions, and that it was in the process of establishing Cadi Courts 
</p>
<p>and Children&#8217;s Courts all over the country as well as more High Courts in addition to the 
</p>
<p>ones in Banjul, Basse and Brikama.  </p>


<p>8. On the right to education, the delegation stated that the Gambia was one of the 
</p>
<p>leading African countries that had met the Millennium Development Goals with respect to 
</p>
<p>primary school enrolment free of charge as well as gender parity. The Government plans to 
</p>
<p>expand free education to secondary schools by 2015 for both boys and girls. The delegation 
</p>
<p>added that more schools with a proximity range of three kilometres had been built to 
</p>
<p>provide access to education for every Gambian child. Moreover, according to the 
</p>
<p>delegation, the University of The Gambia continues to register annual increases in the 
</p>
<p>number of students and has launched a new undergraduate degree programme in 
</p>
<p>journalism.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to the right to health, the delegation noted that the Gambia offered 
</p>
<p>health services to the public at a very affordable flat fee for consultation and prescription 
</p>
<p>medicine. There are several health centres with qualified nurses in every region, and 
</p>
<p>referral hospitals manned by qualified doctors. The delegation added that maternal and 
</p>
<p>antenatal health care was offered free of charge in all public health facilities. The delegation 
</p>
<p>stated that, with the advent of the Ebola virus epidemic, the Gambia had taken strong 
</p>
<p>preventative steps, including sensitization of the public, increased surveillance at border 
</p>
<p>points and the provision of protective clothing to all personnel concerned, as well as Ebola 
</p>
<p>test kits.  
</p>
<p>10. In the domain of the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities, the 
</p>
<p>delegation noted that the Gambia had taken great strides to reinforce their rights. In order to 
</p>
<p>combat gender-based violence, two pieces of legislation were enacted in December 2013. 
</p>
<p>The Domestic Violence Act addresses domestic violence and provides protection for the 
</p>
<p>victims of domestic violence, particularly women and children, and the Sexual Offences 
</p>
<p>Act criminalizes every form of sexual assault, exploitation and harassment.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation mentioned that the Gambia had ratified the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child and the provisions of this Convention had been domesticated in the Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Act 2005. It also noted that law enforcement officers had been trained on children-related 
</p>
<p>laws, that police stations countrywide had Child Welfare Units manned by officers trained 
</p>
<p>on issues relating to children and that shelters for children had been established.  
</p>
<p>12. The delegation also noted that campaigns to create awareness of the danger of child 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse and exploitation had been launched and sensitization of stakeholders had been 
</p>
<p>undertaken in the tourism industry to ensure greater protection of children from sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation.  
</p>
<p>13. In terms of juvenile justice, the delegation said that two additional children&#8217;s courts 
</p>
<p>had been established; child offenders were provided with free legal representation; and 
</p>
<p>children were always separated from adults, from the pretrial to trial stage.  
</p>
<p>14. On the rights of persons with disabilities, the delegation mentioned that the Gambia 
</p>
<p>had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) as well as its 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol (OP-CRPD) and that a draft Disability Bill was under consultation.  
</p>
<p>15. Regarding the fight against trafficking in persons, the delegation mentioned the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons, which had started its 
</p>
<p>operations in December 2011, and had engaged in a countrywide sensitization programme 
</p>
<p>to enlighten the public on the dangers and legal consequences of human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>16. With regard to asylum, the delegation recalled that in 2013, the Government had 
</p>
<p>signed and ratified the Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Reduction of Statelessness. Moreover, the Gambia Commission for Refugees, which is 
</p>
<p>responsible for the security and protection of refugees, issues visitor passes to refugees, 
</p>
<p>which enable them to travel freely within the member States of the Economic Community 
</p>
<p>of West African States (ECOWAS).  </p>


<p>17. Concerning the judiciary, the delegation stated that the Judges (Remuneration 
</p>
<p>Allowances and Other Benefits) Bill, which was currently under consultation, would 
</p>
<p>enhance the security of tenure of judicial officers in the long run and contribute to justice 
</p>
<p>delivery services. It added that a second commercial court and a pretrial court had been 
</p>
<p>established.  
</p>
<p>18. On fundamental freedoms, the delegation stated that the Constitution, the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure Code and the Police Act, among others, provided safeguards for persons under 
</p>
<p>investigation and in detention. It also noted that persons suspected of having committed 
</p>
<p>offences may be detained for up to 72 hours and thereafter must be brought before a court. 
</p>
<p>According to the delegation, the Government has taken many measures to decongest the 
</p>
<p>prisons and to improve prison conditions as well as the social welfare of prisoners. It added 
</p>
<p>that, in 2013, special hearing dates had been organized for Mile 2 Prison remand wing 
</p>
<p>inmates; trials had been conducted expeditiously; and persons for whom no sufficient 
</p>
<p>evidence supported their charges had been acquitted and discharged.  
</p>
<p>19. Regarding the conditions of detention, the delegation mentioned that the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Interior, in collaboration with the Prison Services Department, had made efforts to renovate 
</p>
<p>the security wing and increase the size of cells and cells allocation. Practical steps to 
</p>
<p>promote rehabilitation of prisoners through education and vocational training have also 
</p>
<p>been taken. Furthermore, according to the delegation, a doctor visits the prisons on a daily 
</p>
<p>basis to provide medical services to sick inmates, and trained nurses are also present to 
</p>
<p>attend to inmates.  
</p>
<p>20. On freedom of speech, expression and assembly, the delegation stated that the 
</p>
<p>Gambia was committed to creating a conducive environment for the media to operate freely 
</p>
<p>and to ensure a free flow of information, as provided for in the Constitution. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>the Information and Communications Act 2009 was passed into law to provide for the 
</p>
<p>restructuring, development and regulation of the information and communications sectors. 
</p>
<p>Underlining that the right to freedom of expression was not absolute, the delegation 
</p>
<p>mentioned that the Criminal Code provided for the offences of criminal libel and sedition. It 
</p>
<p>added that, since 1994, there has been a steady increase in the number of radio stations and 
</p>
<p>newspapers. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to the issue of the female genital mutilation (FGM), the delegation 
</p>
<p>explained that a National Plan of Action to Accelerate the Abandonment of FGM had been 
</p>
<p>formulated. Acknowledging that FGM was still being practiced in the country, the 
</p>
<p>delegation stated that this harmful practice was being addressed by the Government and 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations through community empowerment programmes.  
</p>
<p>22. On the establishment of a national human rights institution, the delegation said that 
</p>
<p>the draft National Human Rights Commission Bill was currently being revised to ensure 
</p>
<p>compliance with international standards before being presented to the legislature for 
</p>
<p>consideration. It added that, while the Commission was in the process of being established, 
</p>
<p>the Office of the Ombudsman had a wide mandate, such as investigating allegations of 
</p>
<p>maladministration, mismanagement or discrimination in any government department, 
</p>
<p>authority, or other public body.  
</p>
<p>23. Regarding the death penalty, the delegation recalled that it had been abolished in 
</p>
<p>1993 but reinstated in 1995 by a Decree which had been accepted as the law when the 
</p>
<p>Constitution was adopted by referendum in 1997. The delegation stated that the application 
</p>
<p>of the death penalty was limited to murder and treasonable offences, meaning only to &#8220;most 
</p>
<p>serious crimes&#8221;. Furthermore, Gambian law prescribes that the procedural guarantees, 
</p>
<p>including the right to a fair hearing by an independent tribunal, presumption of innocence, 
</p>
<p>minimum guarantees for the defence, and the right to review by a higher tribunal prescribed </p>


<p>must be observed before the death penalty could be applied. Those rights are applicable in 
</p>
<p>addition to the particular right to seek pardon. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation stated that the issue of elections had caused some controversial 
</p>
<p>decisions to be made by international organizations, usually on the basis of boycotts by 
</p>
<p>political parties. It noted, however, that all Gambians eligible to vote had access to 
</p>
<p>registration centres, and that campaign periods regulated by the Independent Electoral 
</p>
<p>Commission gave each party equal airtime on national television. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding the reduction of poverty, the delegation noted that the Government had 
</p>
<p>formulated a number of policies and strategies, such as Vision 2020, the development 
</p>
<p>strategy and investment programme for 2012&#8211;2015, called the Programme for Accelerated 
</p>
<p>Growth and Employment (PAGE), which is the successor to the Poverty Reduction 
</p>
<p>Strategy Programme II (PSRP II). A recent programme for food self-sufficiency, called 
</p>
<p>Vision 2016 has been launched; it seeks to encourage farmers to move from small- to 
</p>
<p>larger-scale farming and to produce the necessary volume for consumption by the 
</p>
<p>population. The delegation explained that the main objective of PAGE was to accelerate 
</p>
<p>growth and employment, and thereby reduce poverty and improve the well-being of the 
</p>
<p>population. In terms of food security and agriculture, the delegation noted that the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s priority was to transform the country into a major supplier of agricultural 
</p>
<p>products to the local and international markets. 
</p>
<p>26. On treaty obligations, the delegation stated that the Gambia had made strides in 
</p>
<p>fulfilling its treaty reporting obligations since the last reporting period. In 2012, the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme (UNDP) had organized a workshop to train government 
</p>
<p>officials on treaty reporting to the United Nations and, in 2013, a National Treaty Reporting 
</p>
<p>Task Force was established. The delegation added that the Gambia had submitted a number 
</p>
<p>of reports, including the initial report under the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights in 2011. 
</p>
<p>27. The delegation mentioned that in a bid to implement the recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>first cycle of the UPR, the Gambia had constituted a multisectorial National Task Force 
</p>
<p>composed of various government ministries and agencies as well as members of civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations in order to formulate a National Action Plan for the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. On United Nations special procedures, the delegation noted that the Gambia had no 
</p>
<p>objection to any visits by Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council. It added that, 
</p>
<p>in fact, some Special Rapporteurs were preparing to visit the country during the first week 
</p>
<p>of November 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>

</p>
<p>establish a national human rights institution based on the Paris Principles. </p>

</p>

</p>

<p>the enactment of the Gender Violence Act and encouraged further legal reforms aimed at 
</p>
<p>eliminating all forms of discrimination against women, girls and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>Equality of opportunity in the social and economic spheres should be guaranteed for all, 
</p>
<p>regardless of gender or disabilities.  
</p>
<p>38. Mali welcomed the creation of the National Agency against Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p>the adoption of the National Action Plan against Gender-Based Violence, free maternal and

</p>
<p>Employment.

<p>moratorium on the death penalty had been breached in recent years. 
</p>
<p>41. Montenegro enquired about the main obstacles impeding the submission of overdue 
</p>
<p>periodic reports and encouraged the Gambia to improve its cooperation with OHCHR and

</p>
<p>their work be guaranteed. It was concerned that amended section 144a of the Criminal Code

<p>intersex (LGBTI) persons. 
</p>
<p>44. Nicaragua commended the action taken to provide the education system with the 
</p>

<p>the adoption of the Domestic Violence Act and the Sexual Offences Act.

<p>to implement anti-trafficking programmes. With a view to eradicating poverty, it

</p>
<p>FGM, and combat sexual and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>49. Senegal encouraged the Gambia to pursue its efforts to reform the justice system and 
</p>
<p>enhance its independence. Greater attention should be paid to the right to life and security 
</p>
<p>of persons. Persons in conflict with the law, especially those sentenced to death, should 
</p>
<p>have access to all avenues of appeal.  
</p>
<p>50. Sierra Leone commended the Gambia for progress made in the social and economic

</p>
<p>National Plan of Action against the Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children. It urged the 
</p>
<p>Gambia to intensify its efforts to establish a national human rights institution and a 
</p>
<p>protective mechanism for refugees, and to promote freedom of expression, association and 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>51. Singapore took positive note of efforts to improve access to education and the 
</p>
<p>achievement of the Millennium Development Goals on gender parity in primary and lower 
</p>
<p>secondary schools, with upper secondary school figures on track. It noted efforts by the

<p>National AIDS Council and Secretariat to combat HIV/AIDS and the relatively low

<p>prevalence among adults. 
</p>
<p>52. Slovakia noted that the conditions in prisons remained unsatisfactory and requested

</p>
<p>freedom of expression and on human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>53. Slovenia commended the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child  on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</p>
<p>(OP-CRC-SC). It requested information about the measures taken to prohibit violence </p>


<p>against children in all settings, and the steps taken to implement legislative and other 
</p>
<p>measures to combat violence against women. It expressed concern about reported violations 
</p>
<p>of the freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>54. South Africa commended the Gambia for the marked improvements registered in all 
</p>
<p>spheres of national development, particularly in the achievement of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals on universal primary education and gender parity. It welcomed the 
</p>
<p>declaration regarding free education at upper basic school level and for leading the way on 
</p>
