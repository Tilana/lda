Forward-looking statements
This announcement includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement,
including, without limitation, those regarding Rio Tinto’s financial position, business strategy, plans and
objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Rio
Tinto’s products, production forecasts and reserve and resource positions), are forward-looking statements.
These statements may generally, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as “anticipates”,
“should”, “expects”, “estimates”, “believes”, “intends”, “aims”, “projects”, “will”, “targets”, “set to”, “may”, “plans” or
similar expressions. In particular, among other statements, certain statements under the caption “Dividends” and
elsewhere in this report with regard to expected levels of growth, profitability, capital expenditure, returns to
shareholders (capital or otherwise) and dividends are all forward-looking in nature.
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may
cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Rio Tinto, or industry results, to be materially different
from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Rio Tinto’s present
and future business strategies and the environment in which Rio Tinto will operate in the future. Among the
important factors that could cause Rio Tinto’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements are levels of actual production during any period, levels of demand
and market prices, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the impact of foreign currency
exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, operational problems, political uncertainty and economic
conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such
as changes in taxation or regulation and such other risk factors identified in Rio Tinto’s most recent Annual
Report and Accounts in Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or Form 6-Ks furnished to, or filed with,
the SEC. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue
reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of
the date of this announcement. Rio Tinto expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required
by applicable law, the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct
Authority and the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange) to release publicly any updates or
revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Rio Tinto’s expectations
with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.
Nothing in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Rio Tinto plc or
Rio Tinto Limited will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.

•
1 EBITDA margin is defined as Group underlying EBITDA divided by Product Group total revenues as per the Financial Information by
Business Unit on page 11 where it is reconciled to profit on ordinary activities before finance items and taxation. This financial metric
is used by management internally to assess performance, and therefore is considered relevant to users of the accounts.
2  Operating cash cost improvements represent the difference between the current and prior year full cash cost of
sales per unit based on the prior year volume sold.
3  Free cash flow is defined as Net cash generated from operating activities less Cash used in investing
activities, excluding proceeds from divestments.
4 This production target was disclosed in a release to the market on 6 May 2016. All material assumptions underpinning that target
continue to apply and have not materially changed.
5 This production target was disclosed in a release to the market on 27 November 2015. All material assumptions underpinning that
target continue to apply and have not materially changed.

Economy and commodities
Global economy
Page 4
In the first half of 2016, the global economy was more resilient than markets had anticipated. The broadly
negative sentiment about China, which caused financial markets to move into lower risk sectors at the start of the
year, turned quickly back to a higher tolerance for risk after Chinese New Year. It became increasingly apparent
that less restrictive macro-economic policies introduced by the Chinese government in the second half of 2015,
and a strong credit boost at the start of 2016, had been successful in reviving a moribund property sector. This
enabled China’s economic slowdown to stabilise, with GDP growth remaining above six and a half per cent.
The pick-up in China’s construction activity benefited commodity demand and pulled commodity prices up from
multi-year cyclical lows, but the recovery has not been broad-based. The property market revival has itself been
unbalanced, with sales rising most strongly in the large tier 1 and 2 cities while inventories in lower tier 3 and 4
cities remain at elevated levels. Growth in the industrial and manufacturing sectors continued to face some
headwinds, resulting in a further slowdown in corporate investment. The performance in these sectors was
hindered by weak exports, which were constrained by slow global trade growth. This reflects a global macro-
economic environment that is still fragile.
Global growth forecasts for 2016 have been downgraded to around three per cent, matching the pace of the past
few years. The US carried some weak momentum into the start of the year with the manufacturing sector under
pressure from a stronger dollar. Despite improvements in investment and the labour market, the Federal Reserve
delayed a rise in its policy rates, which had been widely expected by financial markets. Europe continued to
build on its solid performance in 2015, but the UK’s Brexit vote in June risks further undermining confidence
across the Eurozone, with the resilience of some European banks once again being questioned.
Commodities
With the China upturn affecting construction materials disproportionally, iron ore led the commodity price
rebound in the first half of 2016. Having dipped below $40 per dry metric tonne (CFR) throughout January, the
iron ore price briefly reached above $60 in early April and averaged close to $50 over the first six months of the
year. Over that period China imported close to 520 million tonnes of iron ore, an increase of about nine per cent
compared with the first half of 2015, with Chinese crude steel production reaching annualised run-rates above
850 million tonnes during the second quarter of 2016. These high production rates were partly accommodated by
continued strong Chinese steel exports. Despite the more favourable demand context and delays to some project
ramp-up schedules, more new tonnes are expected to come onto the market over the near to medium-term.
Metallurgical coal prices benefited from the same steel dynamics as iron ore, with prices recovering from lows of
near $70 per tonne in February to again touch $100 per tonne during the second quarter of 2016. The rebound in
base metals prices has been more muted. Inventories and excess capacity kept pressure on aluminium, with
LME prices trading within a narrow band between $1,500 per tonne and $1,650 per tonne. Copper prices held
above $2 per pound throughout the first half and, unlike most other commodities, have remained well above the
third quartile of the industry cost curve.
The bauxite, thermal coal and titanium dioxide markets were more strongly influenced by supply-side
developments. The temporary bauxite export ban in Malaysia was extended twice and is currently due to run
until late into the third quarter of 2016. Stronger supplies of Guinean and Australian bauxites into China closed
the supply gap. Thermal coal prices were mostly stable, at just over $50 per tonne during most of the first half of
2016 but a combination of supply disruptions and Chinese production cutbacks started to push prices back
above $55 per tonne by the end of June. Titanium dioxide feedstock prices have stabilised over the past six
months, while pigment prices have started to rise again. There are increasing signs indicating that excess
feedstocks inventories are falling across the value chain.
As with commodities, currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars started the year under significant
downward pressure. However, the rebound in commodity prices, combined with shifting expectations over the
US Federal Reserve policy rate rises led to renewed appreciation of these currencies. The Australian dollar
recovered from a low of 68 US cents in January 2016 to 75 cents.
Conclusions
Page 5
The credit-fuelled bounce in Chinese construction activity has had a positive impact on commodity markets in the
first half of 2016, but its impact has been uneven, benefiting most steel raw materials. This has pulled prices up
from the multi-year lows seen at the start of the year, as markets continue to rebalance. Growth in China has
stabilised, but it is on a long transition path of slower and less commodity-intensive growth. Meanwhile the global
economy seems stuck in a subdued low-productivity growth pattern which would indicate that continued caution
is required for the second half of 2016.

2016 first half
Prices
1,563
1,713
The effect of price movements on all major commodities in 2016 first half was to decrease underlying earnings by
$1,899 million compared with 2015 first half.
The Platts price for 62 per cent iron Pilbara fines was 14 per cent lower on average compared with 2015 first half
while hard coking coal benchmark prices were 26 per cent lower and thermal coal spot prices averaged 19 per
cent lower. Average copper and LME aluminium prices were down 21 and 13 per cent respectively, while gold
prices averaged one per cent higher.
Exchange rates
Compared with 2015 first half, the US dollar, on average, strengthened by seven per cent against the Canadian
dollar, by six per cent against the Australian dollar and by 29 per cent against the South African rand. The effect
of all currency movements was to increase underlying earnings relative to 2015 first half by $241 million.
Volumes
Movements in sales volumes lowered earnings by $24 million compared with 2015 first half. Volumes were
higher in iron ore, following the increase in capacity at the Pilbara ports and mines, and in bauxite, from
increased production at all four mines. These gains were outweighed by volume declines in refined copper at
Kennecott, as a result of the drawdown in inventory in 2015 first half, and lower gold production at both
Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi.
Energy
Lower input energy prices during the period improved underlying earnings by $61 million compared with 2015
first half mainly related to oil, where the price fell approximately 31 per cent half-on-half to average $40 per barrel
during 2016 first half.
Page 7
Cash costs, exploration and evaluation
Rio Tinto made further progress on its cost reduction programme and has now achieved $6.8 billion pre-tax ($4.7
billion post-tax) in total operating cash cost improvements and reductions in exploration and evaluation
expenditure compared with the 2012 base.
In 2016 first half, the Group realised $0.6 billion pre-tax ($0.4 billion post tax) in operating cash cost savings and
reductions in exploration and evaluation expenditure. This was in addition to the $6.2 billion pre-tax ($4.3 billion
post-tax) achieved in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
The Group continued to refine its exploration and evaluation expenditure, building on the savings achieved in
prior years whilst progressing the highest priority projects. In 2016 first half, approximately 38 per cent of this
expenditure was incurred on Energy & Minerals, 28 per cent by central exploration, 25 per cent by Copper &
Diamonds and the balance on Aluminium and Iron Ore.
Tax / non-cash / interest / other
The 2016 first half effective corporate income tax rate on underlying earnings, excluding equity accounted units,
was 25 per cent compared with 28 per cent in 2015 first half. The Group expects an underlying effective tax rate
of approximately 27 to 30 per cent in 2016.
The Group interest charge (net of tax) of $328 million increased by $182 million compared with 2015 first half,
following completion of some major capital projects in 2015 first half and early redemption costs from a bond buy-
back in 2016 first half. Interest is capitalised during the construction period. In 2016 first half, $22 million of
interest was capitalised, compared with $122 million in 2015 first half. The Group successfully completed two
bond buy-back programmes in 2016 first half, reducing gross debt by $4.5 billion (nominal value). The early
redemption costs are reflected in the interest charge and decreased first half earnings by $125 million.
Items excluded from underlying earnings
Non-cash exchange and derivative gains in 2016 first half of $558 million (post-tax) arose primarily on US dollar
debt in non-US dollar functional currency Group companies, intragroup balances, and on the revaluation of
certain derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting. These exchange gains in 2016 first half were in
contrast to net exchange losses in 2015 first half of $1,306 million, giving rise to a positive period-on-period
movement of $1,864 million. The exchange gains are largely offset by currency translation losses recognised in
equity and the quantum of US dollar debt, which will be repaid from US dollar sales receipts and US dollar
divestment proceeds, is therefore largely unaffected.
A review of the infrastructure capacity requirements in Queensland, Australia, has confirmed that it is no longer
likely that Rio Tinto will utilise the Abbot Point Coal Terminal and associated rail capacity contracted under take-
or-pay arrangements. Accordingly, an onerous contract provision has been recognised based on the net present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at a post-tax real rate of two per cent, resulting in a post-tax
onerous contract charge of $496 million.
In 2016 first half, the Group incurred $88 million (post-tax) of restructuring costs associated with its costs
reduction programme.
In 2015 first half, the Group recognised impairment charges of $421 million, primarily relating to the write-down of
its shareholding in Energy Resources of Australia (ERA). This followed Rio Tinto’s announcement that it
supported ERA’s decision not to progress any further study or development of Ranger 3 Deeps, due to the
project’s economic challenges.
In 2015 first half, the Group recorded a post-tax charge of $242 million for the remediation of legacy properties,
including the Holden mine in Washington State, and incurred $135 million (post-tax) of restructuring costs
associated with its costs reduction programme.
Cash flow
Net cash generated from operating activities of $3.2 billion was 27 per cent lower than 2015 first half, mainly
reflecting the impact of lower prices, partially offset by cash cost improvements, stable current working capital
and lower tax payments in line with lower underlying profits.
Page 8
The Group continued to focus its efforts on working capital in 2016 first half to reduce inventories and
receivables, which were partly offset by a reduction in payables, mostly from actions taken to reduce capital and
operating expenditures during the year.
Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets declined by $1.2 billion or 47 per cent to $1.3
billion in 2016 first half, following the completion of some major capital projects in 2015 first half, including the
expansion of the Pilbara iron ore infrastructure and the expansion of the Kitimat aluminium smelter. Major capital
projects in 2016 first half included the commencement of earth moving works at the Amrun bauxite project in
Queensland and the power systems upgrade in the Pilbara.
Dividends paid in 2016 first half of $1.9 billion reflected the final 2015 dividend paid in April 2016.
In 2016 first half, net proceeds from the disposal of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of $0.6 billion
related primarily to amounts received following the disposal of the Group’s 40 per cent interest in the Bengalla
coal Joint Venture which completed on 1 March 2016.
Balance sheet
Net debt (see page F-12) decreased from $13.8 billion at 31 December 2015 to $12.9 billion at 30 June 2016.
Net debt to total capital (gearing ratio) was 23 per cent at 30 June 2016 (31 December 2015: 24 per cent) and
interest cover was five times, down from seven times coverage in full year 2015.
Adjusted total borrowings at 30 June 2016 were $21.2 billion (refer to page F-12). At 30 June 2016,
approximately two thirds of Rio Tinto’s total borrowings were at floating interest rates, the weighted average cost
of total borrowings was approximately 4.1 per cent and the weighted average maturity was around ten years. The
maximum amount, within non-current borrowings, maturing in any one calendar year was $2.6 billion, which
matures in 2022.
In 2016 first half, the Group repaid $6.3 billion of borrowings and drew down $4.4 billion of funds, mainly from the
Oyu Tolgoi project financing. Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2016 were $8.3 billion (31 December 2015:
$9.4 billion).
Profit for the period
Net earnings and underlying earnings, which are the focus of the commentary in this report, refer to amounts
attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. The net profit attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto in 2016 first half
totalled $1,713 million (2015 first half: $806 million). The Group recorded a profit in 2016 first half of $1,741
million (2015 first half: $799 million) of which a profit of $28 million (2015 first half: loss of $7 million) was
attributable to non-controlling interests.
Dividends
Page 9
In February 2016, the board announced a new dividend policy. At the end of each financial period, the board will
determine an appropriate total level of ordinary dividend per share, taking into account the results for the financial
year, the outlook for our major commodities, the board’s view of the long-term growth prospects of the business
and the Company’s objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet. The board expects total cash returns to
shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40 to 60 per cent of underlying earnings in aggregate
through the cycle.
The board is committed to maintaining an appropriate balance between cash returns to shareholders and
investment in the business, with the intention of maximising shareholder value.
Acknowledging the cyclical nature of the industry, in periods of strong earnings and cash generation, it is the
board’s intention to supplement the ordinary dividends with additional returns to shareholders.
Dividends are determined in US dollars. Rio Tinto plc dividends are declared and paid in pounds sterling and
Rio Tinto Limited dividends are declared and paid in Australian dollars, converted at exchange rates applicable
on 2 August 2016 (the latest practicable date prior to the declaration of the dividend).

Notes to financial information by business unit
Business units are classified according to the Group’s management structure. The financial information by
business unit has been recast in accordance with the organisational restructure announced on 21 June 2016.
The main impacts are as follows: Iron Ore Company of Canada has moved from the Iron Ore Product Group to
the Energy & Minerals Product Group; Coal businesses have moved from the previous Copper & Coal Product
Group to the Energy & Minerals Product Group; and, Diamonds businesses have moved from the previous
Diamonds & Minerals Product Group to the Copper & Diamonds Product Group.
(a) Gross sales revenue includes the sales revenue of equity accounted units on a proportionately consolidated
basis (after adjusting for sales by EAUs to subsidiaries) in addition to consolidated sales. Consolidated
sales revenue includes subsidiary sales to equity accounted units which are not included in gross sales
revenue.
(b) EBITDA of subsidiaries and the Group’s share of EBITDA relating to equity accounted units represents profit
before: tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation charged to the income statement in the period.
Underlying EBITDA excludes the same items that are excluded from underlying earnings.
(c) Represents profit after tax for the period attributable to the owners of the Rio Tinto Group. Business unit
earnings are stated before finance items but after the amortisation of discount related to provisions. Earnings
attributed to business units do not include amounts that are excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.
(d) Pilbara represents the Group’s 100 per cent holding in Hamersley and 65 per cent holding of Robe River
Iron Associates. 30 per cent of Robe River Iron Associates is held through a 60 per cent owned subsidiary
and 35 per cent is held through a 100 per cent subsidiary. Therefore the Group’s net beneficial interest is 53
per cent.
(e) Presented on an integrated operations basis splitting activities between Bauxite & Alumina, Primary Metal,
Pacific Aluminium and Other integrated operations (which in total reflect the results of the integrated
production of aluminium) and Other product group items, which relate to other commercial activities.
(f) Under the terms of a contractual agreement, Rio Tinto is entitled to 40 per cent of material mined as a
consequence of expansions and developments of the Grasberg facilities since 1998.
(g) Rio Tinto’s interest in Oyu Tolgoi is held indirectly through its 50.8 per cent investment in Turquoise Hill
Resources Ltd (TRQ) which in turn owns 66 per cent of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owns the Oyu Tolgoi copper-
gold mine. The principal asset of TRQ, as at 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2015, was its interest in Oyu
Tolgoi LLC.
(h)
Includes Rio Tinto’s interests in Argyle (100 per cent) and Diavik (60 per cent). Murowa (77.8 per cent) was
included until its disposal to RZ Murowa Holdings Limited on 17 June 2015.
(i) As at 30 June 2016, includes Rio Tinto’s 100 per cent shareholding in Coal & Allied Industries Limited and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries and in Hunter Valley Resources Pty Ltd. Rio Tinto, as a 100 per cent owner of
Coal & Allied, holds 67.6 per cent, 80 per cent and 55.6 per cent respectively, with management rights, in
Hunter Valley Operations, Mount Thorley and Warkworth; and holds a 100 per cent interest in the Mount
Pleasant project.
As at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2015, this represented Rio Tinto’s 80 per cent interest in Coal & Allied,
through which Rio Tinto held its beneficial interests in Bengalla, Mount Thorley and Warkworth of 32 per cent, 64
per cent and 44.5 per cent respectively.
Mitsubishi has moved from holding a 20 per cent stake in Coal & Allied (as at 30 June 2015 and 31 December
2015) to holding a direct 32.4 per cent stake in the Hunter Valley Operations mine.
(j)
(k)
Includes Rio Tinto’s interests in Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (100 per cent), QIT Madagascar Minerals (80 per
cent) and Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest of 74 per cent).
Includes Rio Tinto’s interests in Energy Resources of Australia (68.4 per cent) and Rössing Uranium Limited
(68.6 per cent).
(l) Simfer Jersey Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey in which the Group has a 53 per cent interest, has
an 87.88 per cent interest in Simfer S.A. the company that operates the Simandou mining project in Guinea.
The Group therefore has a 46.58 per cent indirect interest in Simfer S.A. These entities are consolidated as
subsidiaries and together referred to as the Simandou iron ore project.
(m) Other Operations include Rio Tinto’s 100 per cent interest in the Gove alumina refinery and Rio Tinto
Marine.
Page 13
Notes to financial information by business unit (continued)
(n) Capital expenditure comprises the net cash outflow on purchases less disposals of property, plant and
equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less disposals of other intangible assets. The details
provided include 100 per cent of subsidiaries’ capital expenditure and Rio Tinto’s share of the capital
expenditure of joint operations and equity accounted units.
(o) Operating assets of subsidiaries comprise net assets excluding post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of
tax, and are before deducting net debt. Operating assets are stated after deduction of non-controlling
interests, which are calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies (i.e. inclusive of such
companies’ debt and amounts due to or from Rio Tinto Group companies).
(p) Assets and liabilities held for sale at 30 June 2016 comprise Rio Tinto’s interests in the Blair Athol coal
project, Mount Pleasant, and certain separate assets at Rio Tinto Kennecott. Carbone Savoie and Bengalla
were disposed of during the period.
Assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2015 comprised Rio Tinto’s interests in the Blair Athol coal
project, Carbone Savoie, Bengalla and Molybdenum Autoclave Process assets.

Iron Ore Company of Canada and Simandou are reported within Energy & Minerals, reflecting management
responsibility.
Performance
The Iron Ore group’s underlying earnings of $1,743 million in 2016 first half were 17 per cent or $357 million
lower than 2015 first half. This was primarily attributable to lower prices, reflected in the 14 per cent fall, on
average, in the Platts 62 per cent index, which reduced earnings by $744 million. The price impact was partly
offset by higher sales volumes, a weaker Australian dollar, lower energy costs and the realisation of further cost
savings.
Pre-tax cash cost improvements in the Iron Ore group were $138 million in 2016 first half and have now delivered
$1,191 million of cumulative savings compared with the 2012 base. This is reflected in a reduction in Pilbara unit
cash costs to $14.30 per tonne in 2016 first half (2015 first half: $16.20 per tonne), attributable to exchange rate
movements, increased volumes, reduced fuel prices, lower selling costs and increased labour productivity.
Pilbara operations delivered a free on board (FOB) EBITDA margin of 58 per cent in 2016 first half, compared
with 61 per cent in 2015 first half.
Gross sales revenues for Pilbara operations in 2016 first half of $6,303 million included freight revenue of $344
million (2015 first half: $372 million).
Net cash generated from operating activities of $1,690 million benefited from strong shipments from the Pilbara,
combined with lower operating costs through realised cost savings initiatives and improved productivity.
Free cash flow of $1,332 million was $163 million higher than 2015 first half, mainly attributable to the 57 per
cent decline in capital expenditure, reflecting the completion of the Pilbara infrastructure expansion in 2015 first
half.
Markets
First half sales of 158.9 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 129.8 million tonnes) were eight per cent higher than the
same period of 2015 with a strong rail performance and no major weather events in contrast to last year. Bulk
inventories built up at the mines during the infrastructure expansion phase were largely exhausted by the end of
2015.
Approximately 21 per cent of sales in 2016 first half were priced with reference to the prior quarter’s average
index lagged by one month. (The second quarter reference price for these sales was December 2015 to
February 2016 at $39.40 per dry metric tonne FOB). The remainder was sold either on current quarter average,
current month average or on the spot market. Approximately 61 per cent of 2016 first half sales were made on a
cost and freight (CFR) basis, with the remainder sold FOB.
Achieved average pricing in 2016 first half was $44.50 per wet metric tonne on an FOB basis (2015 first half:
$54.40 per wet metric tonne). This equates to $48.40 per dry metric tonne (2015 first half: $59.10 per dry metric
tonne), which compares with the average FOB Platts price of $48.10 per dry metric tonne for 62 per cent iron
Pilbara fines during the half (2015 first half: $55.30 per dry metric tonne).
Operations
Page 15
Pilbara operations produced 160.8 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 131.3 million tonnes) in 2016 first half, ten per
cent higher than the same period of 2015. This performance reflects minimal weather impacts as well as the
successful implementation of operational improvements and the ramp-up of expanded and new mines across the
Pilbara.
New projects and growth options
On 2 August 2016, the Group approved $338 million to complete the development of Silvergrass, to maintain the
Pilbara blend and reduce unit costs. The initial phase of the Nammuldi Incremental Tonnes project, NIT1, (with a
five million tonne per annum capacity) commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the second
phase, NIT2, (which will take annual mine capacity from five to ten million tonnes) is expected to come into
production in the fourth quarter of 2016. With this $338 million approval, the road haulage used in the NIT
projects will be replaced by a conveyor, which is expected to take annual mine capacity from 10 to 20 million
tonnes1 from the fourth quarter of 2017, with full production in 2018.
1 This production target was disclosed in a presentation dated 10 May 2016, released to the market. All material assumptions
underpinning that target continue to apply and have not materially changed.

The Gove alumina refinery is curtailed and reported separately from Aluminium within Other Operations.
Performance
The Aluminium group had a strong first half operationally, with higher production in all three products compared
with 2015 first half. Several sites achieved production records, including Yarwun for alumina, Gove and CBG for
bauxite and Kitimat for aluminium.
The group’s underlying earnings of $377 million decreased 52 per cent compared with 2015 first half, due to a
decline in prices, which lowered earnings by $656 million, and an increase in depreciation expense following the
commissioning of the modernised Kitimat smelter. Despite the weaker pricing environment, the Aluminium group
increased its free cash flow generation to $660 million (first half 2015: $646 million), through a combination of
strong volumes, cash cost and working capital improvements and reduced capital expenditure, following the
completion of the Kitimat smelter expansion. The product group’s relentless focus on cost reduction efforts and
productivity improvement initiatives and a strong operational performance, partly mitigated this price impact and
generated an EBITDA margin from integrated operations of 25 per cent (2015 first half: 35 per cent).
Pre-tax cash cost improvements in the Aluminium group were $223 million in 2016 first half and the group has
now delivered $1,355 million of cumulative savings compared with the 2012 base.
Markets
The 2016 first half cash LME aluminium price averaged $1,544 per tonne, a decrease of 13 per cent on 2015 first
half. Market premia in all regions fell from their record highs in early 2015. In the US, the Mid-West market
premium averaged $181 per tonne in 2016 first half, compared with an average $395 per tonne in 2015 first half,
a 54 per cent decrease.
Overall, the group achieved an average realised aluminium price of $1,805 per tonne in 2016 first half (2015 first
half: $2,292 per tonne). This includes premia for value-added products (VAP), which represented 53 per cent of
primary metal produced in 2016 first half and generated attractive product premia averaging $226 per tonne of
VAP sold (2015 first half: $259 per tonne) on top of the physical market premia.
Rio Tinto’s share of third party bauxite sales in 2016 first half increased by five per cent to 13.9 million tonnes
(2015 first half: 13.2 million tonnes). Bauxite prices decreased during this period due to increased bauxite supply
and lower freight rates.
Operations
Bauxite delivered strong production in 2016 first half, up nine per cent compared with 2015 first half, with Weipa,
Gove and CBG all reaching new production records for the half. The higher volumes, combined with cash cost
reductions, absorbed 67 per cent of the bauxite price decline and led to the bauxite business recording a 48 per
cent FOB EBITDA margin in 2016 first half. Bauxite underlying earnings declined 11 per cent to $243 million in
2016 first half.
Gross sales revenues for bauxite in 2016 first half decreased five per cent to $962 million and included freight
revenues of $93 million (2015 first half: $93 million).
Page 17
Alumina production increased by six per cent compared with 2015 first half. Yarwun achieved record production
as process improvement initiatives were completed. The transformation of the Alumina business gathered pace
during 2016 first half, and resulted in the Alumina business significantly reducing its cash costs. Alumina
managed to offset 53 per cent of the price decrease it incurred during 2016 first half through enhanced volumes
and reduced cash costs. Overall, the Alumina business recorded a loss of $83 million, compared with a loss of
$52 million in 2015 first half.
First half aluminium production of 1.8 million tonnes was ten per cent higher than 2015 first half, with the
modernised and expanded Kitimat smelter delivering its first full quarter at nameplate capacity. The Primary
Metal business managed to offset 28 per cent of the price decrease it incurred during 2016 first half through
enhanced volumes and reduced cash costs. Primary Metal earnings (Canada, Europe, Middle East) declined by
65 per cent to $107 million, while earnings from Pacific Aluminium (Australia, New Zealand) decreased by 81
per cent to $29 million.
New projects and growth options
The expanded Kitimat smelter commenced production in June 2015, reached nameplate capacity of 420
thousand tonnes per annum in March 2016 and is driving its production costs down into the first decile of the
industry cost curve.
On 27 November 2015, the Group approved the $1.9 billion Amrun (South of Embley) bauxite mine and
associated processing and port facilities on the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. The planned initial
annual output of 22.8 million tonnes a year1 is expected to replace production from the depleting East Weipa
mine and increase annual bauxite exports from Cape York by around 10 million tonnes. Production and shipping
are expected to commence in the first half of 2019.

1 Net cash generated from operating activities excludes the operating cash flows from equity accounted units (mainly Escondida) but
includes dividends from equity accounted units.
Performance
Despite the challenging market environment, the Copper & Diamonds group was free cash flow neutral during
the half, and recorded an underlying loss of $67 million.
The decline in earnings, compared with $393 million in 2015 first half, was principally driven by the $236 million
impact of lower prices and $114 million of non-cash asset write-downs, following the conclusion of the review of
the asset portfolio at Rio Tinto Kennecott. Operationally, lower sales volumes for copper, gold and molybdenum
were partly offset by further cost savings at Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi and an improved operational performance
in Diamonds.
During the period, an agreement was reached for the sale of undeveloped land in the community of Daybreak,
located five miles to the west of the Kennecott mine. The sale transaction was completed on 16 July 2016 and
the net proceeds have been subsequently received. As at 30 June 2016, the land was classified an asset held
for sale and revalued to fair value.
Over $140 million of pre-tax cash cost improvements were achieved by Rio Tinto managed operations during the
first half. This was fully offset by the lower volumes at Escondida in conjunction with the operation’s programme
to release working capital with the processing of lower grade stockpiles. Despite this programme creating value,
it resulted in higher unit cash costs which are reflected in the results. Hence the net pre-tax cash cost
improvements for the group were minimal in 2016 first half. Pre-tax cash cost savings delivered across the
Copper & Diamonds group since 2012 totalled $999 million.
The free cash flow during the half is net of investments in development capital and exploration and evaluation
spend of $370 million across the business.
Markets
Average copper prices declined 21 per cent to 213 cents per pound and gold increased one per cent to $1,221
per ounce.
Page 19
In 2016 first half, the US consumer market was steady, however demand from India and China continued to be
slower due to local market factors. Industry rough diamond prices varied across product segments.
The total impact of price changes on the Copper & Diamonds group, including the effects of provisional pricing
movements, resulted in a decrease in underlying earnings of $236 million compared with 2015 first half.
At 30 June 2016, the Group had an estimated 189 million pounds of copper sales that were provisionally priced
at US 214 cents per pound. The final price of these sales will be determined during the second half of 2016. This
compared with 252 million pounds of open shipments at 31 December 2015, provisionally priced at US 217
cents per pound.
Operations - Copper
Mined copper production was one per cent higher than 2015 first half, as a result of increased output at
Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi, and a contribution from Grasberg, largely offset by a decrease in production at
Escondida. Lower mined gold production was driven by lower grades at Oyu Tolgoi and reduced mine
throughput at Kennecott, partly offset by a contribution from Grasberg. Refined copper and gold production at
Kennecott was lower than 2015 first half, when volumes were boosted by a drawdown in inventory.
Mined copper production at Kennecott for the first half was significantly higher than the same period of 2015 as
mining progresses through areas of higher copper grades. The focus continued on the de-weighting and de-
watering of the east wall of Bingham Canyon and the development of the south wall pushback. Refined copper
and gold production at Kennecott were 36 per cent and 43 per cent lower, respectively, compared with 2015 first
half, when a drawdown in inventory occurred.
Kennecott continues to toll third party concentrate to optimise smelter utilisation, with 199 thousand tonnes
received for processing in the first half of 2016. Tolled copper concentrate, which is smelted and returned to
customers, is excluded from reported production figures.
Mined copper production at Escondida in the first half was 23 per cent lower than the same period of 2015,
primarily due to lower copper grades, partly offset by higher throughput from the new concentrator.
At Oyu Tolgoi, mined copper production was 23 per cent higher than 2015 first half, attributable to higher grades
and throughput, along with productivity improvements.
On 19 July 2016, Rio Tinto reported its share of Grasberg’s production for the half of 17.1 thousand tonnes of
mined copper and 29.4 thousand ounces of mined gold, in line with Freeport’s publicly stated guidance at the
time.
On 30 June 2016, Rio Tinto announced that it had transferred its 53.8 per cent shareholding in Bougainville
Copper Limited to an independent trustee, to be distributed between the Autonomous Bougainville Government
for the benefit of all the Panguna landowners and the people of Bougainville, and the Independent State of
Papua New Guinea.
Operations – Diamonds
Diamonds production was two per cent higher than 2015 first half, with higher volumes at Argyle from the
continued ramp-up of production from the underground mine offsetting lower carats recovered at Diavik,
reflecting lower grades.
New projects and growth options
On 6 May 2016, Rio Tinto, the Government of Mongolia and Turquoise Hill Resources announced the approval
of the $5.3 billion development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine. Project activities have started, with the
engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) agreement awarded and mobilisation in
progress. Following approval of the project, over $4 billion of project financing has been drawn down, and
represents one of the largest project financing facilities in the industry.
At Escondida, the new concentrator (OGP1, a 152 thousand tonne per day concentrator) has been
commissioned and continues to ramp up to nameplate capacity. On 30 June 2016, the Escondida Owners
Council approved the Los Colorados Extension project for $180 million (100 per cent basis). First production is
expected in the first half of 2017, adding incremental annual capacity of approximately 200 thousand tonnes of
copper in the near term.

Iron Ore Company of Canada and Simandou are reported within Energy & Minerals, reflecting management
responsibility.
Performance
The Energy & Minerals group’s underlying earnings of $82 million, which were 11 per cent higher than 2015 first
half, benefited from further cash cost improvements and weaker exchange rates, partly offset by lower prices,
while sales volumes were generally flat. Excluding the impact of the Simandou costs associated with completing
the bankable feasibility study, Energy & Minerals earnings were 35 per cent higher at $124 million.
Pre-tax cash cost improvements in the Energy & Minerals group were $152 million in 2016 first half and the
group has now delivered $1,215 million of cumulative savings compared with the 2012 base.
Net cash generated from operating activities of $469 million was 31 per cent lower than 2015 first half due to
lower prices, higher tax payments and the expensing of all Simandou study costs, partly mitigated by cost
improvements and further reductions in working capital.
Free cash flow during the half was $332 million, $77 million lower than 2015 first half, reflecting lower operating
cash flow partly offset by reduced capital expenditure, which declined by $129 million, or 49 per cent, to $134
million with continued capital discipline across the product group. From the start of 2016, all Simandou study
costs are being expensed.
Markets
Thermal and hard coking coal prices declined in 2016 first half, averaging $51 and $84 per tonne, respectively.
Thermal coal revenues of $611 million in 2016 first half (2015 first half: $769 million) represented 3.8 per cent of
the Rio Tinto Group total (2015 first half: 4.3 per cent).
Titanium dioxide feedstock demand remained subdued throughout 2016 first half as the industry continued to
absorb excess inventories, although there is positive demand growth for specific grades. The market for zircon
has recently stabilised following an initial period of weak demand in China.
Demand for borates has remained stable globally, with robust demand in the Americas and India partly offset by
weaker growth in China and weather-related demand constraints in south-east Asia.
The uranium market continues to suffer from high inventory levels throughout the supply chain, with soft prices
declining during 2016 first half and remaining under pressure.
Operations - Energy
Page 21
Hard coking coal production for 2016 first half was eight per cent lower than 2015 first half primarily due to the
timing of the longwall changeover at Kestrel.
Semi-soft coking coal production reflects the Coal & Allied restructure in early 2016 and mine production
sequencing at Hunter Valley Operations and Mount Thorley Warkworth, resulting in eight per cent higher
production for the first half of 2016 than the first half of 2015.
Thermal coal production for the first half was broadly in line with the same period last year.
Despite lower prices, all coal operations were free cash flow positive in 2016 first half.
Uranium production was 41 per cent higher than 2015 first half, with higher mill throughput and mill recoveries at
Energy Resources of Australia and a stronger half at Rössing following a fire in the final product recovery plant in
2015 first half.
On 30 September 2015, Rio Tinto reached a binding agreement for the sale of its interest in the Bengalla Joint
Venture to New Hope Corporation Limited. The sale completed on 1 March 2016 for $617 million.
On 27 January 2016, Rio Tinto announced that it had reached a binding agreement for the sale of its Mount
Pleasant thermal coal assets to MACH Energy Australia Pty Ltd for $224 million plus royalties. The conditions
precedent of the sale have been met and the sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016.
Operations – Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC)
IOC achieved first half of production of 8.5 million tonnes of concentrate and pellets (Rio Tinto share 5.0 million
tonnes), a six per cent increase over the first half of 2015. This improvement was driven by increased asset
reliability and performance. The improvement in production boosted first half sales by 17 per cent over last year’s
levels, to 8.6 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 5.0 million tonnes).
Operations - Minerals
Titanium dioxide slag production in the half was 23 per cent lower than in the first half of 2015. Rio Tinto Iron &
Titanium continues to optimise production in line with demand, with two of nine furnaces at Rio Tinto Fer et
Titane and one of four furnaces at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) currently idled.
Borates and salt production were broadly in line with 2015 first half.
New projects and growth options
Work continues on the feasibility study for the Zulti South development at RBM, which is one of the best
undeveloped assets in the mineral sands industry.
The Jadar project in Serbia is a potentially world-class lithium-borate deposit discovered by Rio Tinto in 2004.
Findings so far are encouraging and pre-feasibility assessments are ongoing to confirm the economic business
case.
Simfer (owned 42.7 per cent by Rio Tinto) completed the integrated Bankable Feasibility Study for the mine, rail
and port and infrastructure elements of the Simandou iron ore project in May 2016 on time and as required by the
Investment Framework. Extensive engagement with potential infrastructure investors has taken place, but
deteriorating market conditions have had a negative impact on investors’ appetite for the project and have
prevented Simfer from assembling a funding consortium. The group is working with its partners to restructure the
project so as to facilitate access to infrastructure funding from China.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
for the half year ended 30 June 2016
Review of operations and important events
A detailed review of the Group’s operations, the results of those operations during the half year ended 30 June
2016 and likely future developments are given on pages 1 to 23. Important events that have occurred during the
period and up until the date of this report are set out below.
On 27 January 2016, Rio Tinto announced that it had reached a binding agreement for the sale of its Mount
Pleasant thermal coal assets to MACH Energy Australia Pty Ltd for US$224 million plus royalties.
On 1 March 2016, the Group announced that it had completed the sale of its 40 per cent interest in the Bengalla
coal Joint Venture in Australia to New Hope Corporation Limited for US$616.7 million.
On 17 March 2016, the Group announced that Rio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh would retire from the
business on 1 July 2016 and would be succeeded by Copper & Coal chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques.
Jean-Sébastien joined the board and became deputy chief executive with effect from the same date.
On 15 April 2016, the Group announced that Rio Tinto and Sinosteel Corporation had extended their historic
Channar Mining Joint Venture in Australia’s Pilbara region. The Channar joint venture extension, together with a
separate agreement for Rio Tinto to supply iron ore from the Pilbara, will enable sales of up to 70 million tonnes
of iron ore to Sinosteel Corporation over the next five years. This extension will see 30 million tonnes of iron ore
supplied into the joint venture, with Sinosteel making a one-off payment of US$45 million to Rio Tinto and
providing additional production royalties linked to the iron ore price. In a separate agreement, Rio Tinto will sell
up to 40 million tonnes of iron ore to Sinosteel between 2016 and 2021.
On 21 April 2016, the Group announced a proposed transaction, using its strong liquidity position, to reduce
gross debt through the early repayment of some near term maturing debt, by commencing cash tender offers to
purchase $1.5 billion of its 2017 and 2018 notes.
On 27 April 2016, the Group announced that it had progressed plans to reduce gross debt through the early
repayment of some near term maturing debt, pricing its Any and All Offer. The total consideration payable in
connection with the Any and All Offer by Rio Tinto pursuant to the Offer to Purchase dated 21 April 2016 was set
at $1,006.91 for the 2.000 per cent Notes due 2017 and at $1,005.85 for the 1.625 per cent Notes due 2017, in
each case per $1,000 principal amount of notes.
On 28 April 2016, the Group announced that under its plan to reduce gross debt through the early repayment of
some near term maturing debt, it had accepted for purchase a total of $1.359 billion in debt pursuant to its Any
and All Offer, which commenced on 21 April 2016 and expired on 27 April 2016. $339 million in aggregate
principal amount of its 2.000 per cent Notes due 2017 would be purchased at a price of $1,006.91 per $1,000
principal amount of notes. $1.020 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 1.625 per cent Notes due 2017
would be purchased at a price of $1,005.85 per $1,000 principal amount of notes.
On 5 May 2016, the Group announced that under its plan to reduce gross debt through the early repayment of
some near term maturing debt, it had accepted for purchase a total of $141 million of debt under its Dutch Auction
Offer.
On 6 May 2016, the Group announced that Rio Tinto and its partners, the Government of Mongolia and
Turquoise Hill Resources, had approved the next stage in the development of the world-class Oyu Tolgoi copper
and gold mine in Mongolia. The development of the underground mine will start in mid-2016 following the
approval of a $5.3 billion investment by the partners and the recent granting of all necessary permits. First
production from the underground, which has an average copper grade of 1.66 per cent, more than three times
higher than the open pit, is expected in 2020. When the underground is fully ramped up in 2027, Oyu Tolgoi is
expected to produce more than 500,000 tonnes of copper a year, compared with current annual production of
175,000-200,000 tonnes. The mine also benefits from significant gold by-products, with an average gold grade of
0.35 grams per tonne.
On 24 May 2016, the Group announced that it had appointed Stephen McIntosh as the acting Group executive,
Technology & Innovation to succeed Greg Lilleyman, who left the company after 25 years of service. Stephen
has been with Rio Tinto for almost 30 years working on projects in more than 45
Page 24
countries spanning the A-Z of minerals and metals. Most recently, he was head of Exploration, leading a 450-
strong global team of employees operating in 20 countries.
On 7 June 2016, the Group announced a proposed transaction, continuing to use its strong liquidity position, to
reduce gross debt, by commencing cash tender offers to purchase up to $3 billion of its 2018, 2020, 2021 and
2022 US dollar-denominated notes.
On 13 June 2016, the Group announced that it had progressed plans to reduce gross debt as part of its ongoing
capital management, by pricing its Any and All Offer announced on 7 June 2016. The total consideration payable
in connection with the Any and All Offer pursuant to the Offer to Purchase dated 7 June 2016 was set at
$1,108.33 for the 6.500 per cent Notes due 2018 and at $1,024.36 for the 2.250 per cent Notes due 2018, in each
case per $1,000 principal amount of notes.
On 14 June 2016, the Group announced that under its plan to reduce gross debt as part of its ongoing capital
management, it had accepted for purchase a total of $1.747 billion in debt pursuant to the Any and All Offer,
which commenced on 7 June 2016 and expired on 13 June 2016. $943 million in aggregate principal amount of
6.500 per cent Notes due 2018 would be purchased at a price of $1,108.33 per $1,000 principal amount of notes.
$804 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.250 per cent Notes due 2018 would be purchased at a price of
$1,024.36 per $1,000 principal amount of notes.
On 21 June 2016, the Group announced that under its plan to reduce gross debt as part of its ongoing capital
management, it had accepted for purchase a total of $1.252 billion of debt under its Maximum Tender Offer and
$1.748 billion under its Any and All Offer. Both offers commenced on 7 June 2016 and are part of Rio Tinto’s
ongoing capital management. The final aggregate principal amount of Securities purchased under the Any and
All Offer that expired on 13 June 2016 was $1.748 billion, including the notes purchased under the guaranteed
delivery procedures described in the Offer to Purchase.
On 21 June 2016, the Group announced that it had priced the Maximum Tender Offer under its plan to reduce
gross debt by $3 billion. The Maximum Tender Total Consideration payable in connection with the Maximum
Tender Offer was set at $1,069.72 for its 3.500 per cent Notes due 2020, $1,094.06 for its 4.125 per cent Notes
due 2021 and $1,078.46 for its 3.750 per cent Notes due 2021. The Maximum Tender Offer Total Consideration
payable was set at $1,046.94 for its 3.500 per cent Notes due 2022 and $1,016.14 for its 2.875 per cent Notes
due 2022, in each case per $1,000 principal amount of notes.
On 21 June 2016, the Group announced that it would strengthen its organisational structure to continue to drive
performance under its new chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques. From 2 July 2016, Rio Tinto’s product
group structure was adjusted to better align the Group’s assets with the business strategy to help drive further
efficiencies and optimise performance. The Group’s world-class assets have been placed firmly at the centre of
the business, supported by efficient and agile global functions.
Under the new arrangements, Rio Tinto’s organisational structure includes four product groups –
Aluminium, Copper & Diamonds, Energy & Minerals and Iron Ore. These groups are complemented by a newly
shaped Growth & Innovation group, which focuses on future assets and technical support.
Under the new structure:
•
•
•
•
•
Aluminium retains its focus on safety, cash and value creation from its high-quality bauxite, alumina and
aluminium businesses. Alfredo Barrios would remain as chief executive, based in Montreal.
Iron Ore is exclusively focused on the Group’s world-class iron ore operations in Western Australia. Chris
Salisbury, previously acting Copper & Coal chief executive, became Iron Ore chief executive based in Perth.
Copper & Diamonds combines our two marketing-led businesses into a single product group, which helps
us maximise our technical underground mining expertise. Arnaud Soirat joined the Executive Committee as
Copper & Diamonds chief executive. Arnaud, previously Aluminium Primary Metal president and chief
executive officer, with more than 24 years of industry experience across three continents, is based in
London.
Energy & Minerals re-shaped Alan Davies’ portfolio, bringing together Rio Tinto’s coal, uranium, salt,
borates and titanium dioxide businesses, as well as the Iron Ore Company of Canada. Alan, previously
Diamonds & Minerals chief executive, remains based in London.
Growth & Innovation provides strategic leadership and technical expertise for the end-to-end delivery and
management of growth from exploration to projects. Stephen McIntosh, previously acting Technology &
Innovation Group executive, takes up the role of Growth & Innovation Group executive, based in Brisbane.
In addition, reflecting the Group’s increased focus on health and safety, accountability for safety as a discrete unit
sits with an Executive Committee member for the first time.
Page 25
Joanne Farrell, previously the global head of Health, Safety, Environment and Communities takes on the role of
Group executive, Health, Safety & Environment based in Perth. Joanne, who has more than 35 years’
experience in the mining sector, also became managing director of Australia.
Andrew Harding, previously Iron Ore chief executive, left the business with effect from 1 July 2016.
On 30 June 2016, the Group announced that it had transferred its 53.8 per cent shareholding in Bougainville
Copper Limited (BCL) to an independent trustee. Equity Trustees Limited would manage the distribution of these
shares between the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) for the benefit of all the Panguna landowners
and the people of Bougainville, and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Under the trust deed,
the ABG would have the opportunity to receive 68 per cent of Rio Tinto’s shareholding (which equates to 36.4
per cent of BCL’s shares) from the independent trustee for no consideration and PNG would be entitled to the
remaining 32 per cent (which equates to 17.4 per cent of BCL’s shares). The ABG and PNG would both hold an
equal share in BCL of 36.4 per cent if the transfers are completed. This ensures both parties are equally involved
in any consideration and decision-making around the future of the Panguna mine.
On 2 August 2016, the Group announced the approval of the development of the Silvergrass iron ore mine to
maintain the Pilbara blend. The Group will invest an additional $338 million to complete the development,
adding ten million tonnes of annual capacity.
Non-GAAP measures
Page 26
The Group presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, including underlying earnings, which are reconciled
to directly comparable IFRS financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures are used internally by
management to assess the performance of the business. They are not a substitute for the IFRS measures and
should be considered alongside those measures.

Underlying earnings is reported by Rio Tinto to provide greater understanding of the underlying business
performance of its operations. The measure of underlying earnings is used by the chief executive of Rio Tinto to
assess the performance of the product groups. Underlying earnings and Net earnings both represent amounts
attributable to owners of Rio Tinto.
The following items are excluded from net earnings in arriving at underlying earnings in each period irrespective
of materiality:
•
•
•
•
Net gains on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses.
Impairment charges and reversals of cash generating units.
Profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations.
Certain exchange and derivative gains and losses (as defined in the table above).
Exclusions from underlying earnings relating to equity accounted units are stated after tax and included in the
column ‘Pre-tax’. Items (a) to (f) below are excluded from net earnings in arriving at underlying earnings.
(a)
Impairment charges during the period to 30 June 2015 included impairment at Energy Resources of
Australia, Carbone Savoie and other businesses in the Aluminium portfolio.
(b) For the period to 30 June 2016, a pre-tax gain of US$410 million (post-tax US$268 million) was recognised
by Rio Tinto on the sale of its 40 per cent interest in the Bengalla Joint Venture on 1 March 2016. This was
partially offset by a loss on disposal of the 100 per cent interest in Carbone Savoie on 31 March 2016.
The 2015 net post-tax gains on disposal of interests in businesses of US$11 million relate mainly to Turquoise
Hill Resources partial disposal of its shareholding in SouthGobi Resources.
Page 28
Reconciliation of net earnings to underlying earnings (continued)
(c) Valuation changes on currency and interest rate derivatives, which are ineligible for hedge accounting, other
than those embedded in commercial contracts, and the currency revaluation of embedded US dollar
derivatives contained in contracts held by entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar.
(d) Valuation changes on commodity derivatives, including those embedded in commercial contracts, that are
ineligible for hedge accounting, but for which there will be an offsetting change in future Group earnings.
(e) A review of the infrastructure capacity requirements in Queensland, Australia, has confirmed that it is no
longer likely that Rio Tinto will utilise the Abbot Point Coal Terminal and associated rail infrastructure
capacity contracted under take or pay arrangements. Accordingly, an onerous contract provision has been
recognised based on the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a post-tax real rate of
two per cent, resulting in a post-tax onerous contract charge of US$496 million.
(f) Other credits and charges that individually or in aggregate, if of a similar type, are of a nature or size to
require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into business performance.

(a) The impairment charge for the period to 30 June 2015 included impairment at Energy Resources of
Australia, Carbone Savoie and other businesses in the Aluminium portfolio.
(b) For the period to 30 June 2016, a pre-tax gain of US$410 million was recognised by Rio Tinto on the sale of
its 40 per cent interest in the Bengalla Joint Venture on 1 March 2016. This was partially offset by a loss on
disposal of the 100 per cent interest in Carbone Savoie on 31 March 2016.
The 2015 gain related mainly to the sale by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ) of 25.7 per cent of its holdings
in SouthGobi Resources (SGR) on 23 April 2015. Rio Tinto also sold its 77.8 per cent interest in Murowa
Diamonds and 50 per cent interest in Sengwa Colliery Ltd to RZ Murowa Holdings Limited on 17 June 2015.

Group income statement (continued)
(c) Finance costs in the income statement include hedging adjustments and are net of amounts capitalised of
US$35 million (30 June 2015: US$171 million).
(d) Rio Tinto completed two bond buyback programmes during April 2016 and June 2016 for US$1.5 billion and
US$3 billion (nominal values) respectively. The early redemption of these bonds accelerated the recognition
of future interest payments associated with them. Included in finance costs is a net charge of US$175 million
attributable to early redemption of bonds.
There was no early redemption of bonds completed for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
(e) For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of Rio Tinto plc and
Rio Tinto Limited shares outstanding during the period was 1,797.1 million (30 June 2015: 1,838.9 million),
being the average number of Rio Tinto plc shares outstanding of 1,373.5 million (30 June 2015: 1,409.3
million), plus the average number of Rio Tinto Limited shares outstanding of 423.6 million (30 June 2015:
429.6 million). The profit figures used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share are the
profits attributable to owners of Rio Tinto.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the effect of dilutive securities is added to the weighted
average number of shares. This effect is calculated under the treasury stock method.

under take or pay arrangements. Accordingly, an onerous contract provision has been recognised based on
the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a post-tax real rate of two per cent,
resulting in a pre-tax onerous contract charge of US$709 million. The increase to the onerous contract
provisions has been taken through net operating costs in the income statement and is excluded from
underlying earnings. Refer to Reconciliation of net earnings to underlying earnings on page 28.
(c) At 30 June 2016, Rio Tinto plc had 1,374.6 million ordinary shares in issue and held by the public, and Rio
Tinto Limited had 424.2 million shares in issue and held by the public. No shares in Rio Tinto Limited were
held by Rio Tinto plc at 30 Jun 2016 (31 December 2015: nil). As required to be disclosed under the ASX
Listing Rules, the net tangible assets per share amounted to US$18.43 (31 December 2015: US$18.42).

1 Basis of preparation
F-10
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this interim report have been prepared in
accordance with International Accounting Standard (‘IAS’) 34 ‘Interim financial reporting’ as adopted by the
European Union (‘EU’), the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (‘DTR’) of the Financial Conduct Authority
(‘FCA’) applicable to interim financial reporting and an Order under section 340 of the Australian Corporations
Act 2001 issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 14 December 2015.
These condensed interim financial statements represent a ‘condensed set of financial statements’ as referred to
in the DTR issued by the FCA. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required for a full annual
financial report and are to be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by the Group during the interim reporting period.
These annual financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards and in
accordance with applicable UK law, applicable Australian law as amended by the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Order dated 14 December 2015 and Article 4 of the European Union IAS regulation
and with:
•
•
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) both as
adopted by the European Union and which were mandatory for EU reporting as at 31 December 2015; and
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB and interpretations issued from time to
time by the IFRS IC which were mandatory as at 31 December 2015.
Accounting policies
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting
policies, methods of computation and presentation consistent with those applied in the financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2015, and in the corresponding interim period, except for the adoption of a number
of amendments issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and endorsed by the EU which
apply for the first time in 2016. This basis of accounting is referred to as ‘IFRS’ in this report. The new
pronouncements do not have a significant impact on the accounting policies, methods of computation or
presentation applied by the Group and therefore the prior period consolidated financial statements have not been
restated. The Group has not early adopted any amendments, standards or interpretations that have been issued
but are not yet effective.
The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty for the half year are the same as
those disclosed in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The financial information by business unit and the geographic analysis of sales by destination provided on
pages 11 to 14 and F-13 of this unaudited condensed interim financial report respectively, satisfy the disclosure
requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ for interim financial statements and also provide additional
voluntary disclosure which the Group considers is useful to the users of the financial statements.

(a) Consolidated net debt is stated net of the impact of certain funding arrangements between equity accounted
units (EAUs) and partially owned subsidiaries (EAU funded balances). This adjustment is required in order
to avoid showing borrowings twice in the net debt disclosure, where funding has been provided to an EAU
by the Group and subsequently on lent by the EAU to a consolidated Group subsidiary.
(b) Total borrowings are combined with other current financial liabilities of US$214 million (31 December 2015:
US$231 million) and non-current financial liabilities of US$309 million (31 December 2015: US$330 million)
in the balance sheet.

The financial information by business unit and the geographic analysis of sales by destination satisfy the
disclosure requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ for interim financial statements and also provide
additional voluntary disclosure which the Group considers is useful to the users of the financial statements.
(a) Consolidated sales revenue by geographical destination is based on the ultimate country of destination of
the product, if known. If the eventual destination of the product sold through traders is not known then
revenue is allocated to the location of the product at the time when the risks and rewards of ownership are
transferred. Rio Tinto is domiciled in both the UK and Australia.
(b) 2015 comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with the 2016 presentation of consolidated sales

revenue.

(a) Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments. This
category includes listed equity shares and other quoted funds.
(b) Valuation is based on inputs that are observable for the financial instruments; these include quoted prices for
similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active, or inputs, either
directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
(c) Valuation is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).
(d) Other investments, including loans, comprise: cash deposits in rehabilitation funds, government bonds and
royalty amounts receivable. The royalty receivables are valued based on an estimate of forward sales
subject to the royalty agreement.
(e) Trade receivables includes provisionally priced receivables relating to sales contracts where selling price is
determined after delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated
in the contract. Revenue is recognised on provisionally priced sales based on the forward selling price for
the period stipulated in the contract.
(f) Level 3 derivatives consist of derivatives embedded in electricity purchase contracts linked to the LME with
terms expiring between 2016 and 2030. The embedded derivatives are measured using discounted cash
flows and option model valuation techniques. Long-term embedded derivatives with a fair value of US$397
million at 30 June 2016 are valued using significant unobservable inputs as the term of the derivative
extends beyond the forward curve for aluminium.
Aluminium prices are flat lined beyond the market forward curve and increased by projected inflation up to the
date of expiry of the contract.
The range of market prices is US$2, 104 per metric tonne in 2026 to US$2, 304 in 2030.
The other contracts with a fair value of US$21 million at 30 June 2016 are categorised as level three as the
market premium assumptions used represent unobservable inputs.
F-16
Fair value disclosure for financial instruments (continued)
(g)
Interest rate and currency interest rate swaps are valued using applicable market quoted swap yield curves
adjusted for relevant basis and credit default spreads. Currency interest rate swap valuations also use
market quoted foreign exchange rates. A discounted cash flow approach is applied to the cash flows derived
from the inputs to determine fair value.
(h) There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 or between Level 2 and Level 3 for the six months to
30 June 2016 or the year to 31 December 2015.
Level 3 Financial instruments
The table below shows the summary of changes in the fair value of the Group’s Level 3 financial assets and
financial liabilities for the six months to 30 June 2016 and the year ended 31 December 2015.

Sensitivity analysis in respect of level 3 derivatives
Forward contracts and options whose carrying value are valued using unobservable inputs are calculated using
appropriate discounted cash flow and option model valuation techniques.
The most significant of these assumptions relate to long term pricing wherein internal pricing assumptions are
used after the 10 year LME curve. A 10 per cent increase in long term metal pricing assumptions would result in
a US$31 million (31 December 2015: US$38 million) decrease in carrying value. A 10 per cent decrease in long
term metal pricing assumptions would result in a US$42 million (31 December 2015: US$39 million) increase in
carrying value.

the output of Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., an aluminium smelter in which the Group is a joint venturer. The
Group immediately sells the purchased products to third parties.
For Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C. the Group, along with the other joint venturers, has made various
commitments to provide shareholder funding as required, subject to approved thresholds.
At 30 June 2015, Minera Escondida Limitada held a shareholder line of credit for US$225 million (Rio Tinto
share) which was undrawn at that date. This line of credit matured during the year ended 31 December 2015.
Contingent liabilities (subsidiaries and joint operations)
Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees were US$292 million at 30 June 2016
(31 December 2015: US$226 million).
Indemnities and other performance guarantees represent the potential outflow of funds from the Group for the
satisfaction of obligations including those under contractual arrangements (for example undertakings related to
supplier agreements) not provided for in the balance sheet, where the likelihood of the guarantees or indemnities
being called is assessed as possible rather than probable or remote. There were no material contingent liabilities
arising in relation to the Group’s joint ventures and associates.
Marketing of iron ore is undertaken in the Singapore Commercial Centre by Rio Tinto Iron Ore Asia Pte Ltd
(RTIOA), which is remunerated on an arm’s length basis by the Group’s iron ore product group. The
arrangements are under review by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Rio Tinto considers the arrangements to be
in accordance with transfer pricing law, and will therefore vigorously defend its position in the event of any ATO
challenge.
The Group is subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations arising out of the
ordinary course of business. Legal proceedings include, but are not limited to, alleged breach of contract and
alleged breach of environmental, competition, securities and health and safety laws. The Group may not be
insured fully, or at all, in respect of such risks. The Group cannot predict the outcome of individual legal actions.
The Group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings prior to a final judgment or determination of liability.
The Group may do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational
consequences of continuing to contest liability, even when it believes it has valid defences to liability. The Group
believes that no material loss to the Group is expected to result from these legal proceedings, claims, complaints
and investigations.

The Group has, from time to time various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers. These include a claim
relating to the Manefay slide at Rio Tinto Kennecott in April 2013. An interim progress payment was received on
this claim in 2013 and a second in 2015. Further receipts are considered possible but the amount cannot
currently be reliably estimated.
