<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report contains a summary of the activities of the Special Rapporteur on the 
adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes 
on the enjoyment of human rights. In view of the review of the special procedure mandates by 
the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur outlines the main conclusions developed 
under the mandate concerning the challenges posed by the illicit movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes to the enjoyment of human rights. 
 The report includes a section highlighting the importance of the right to information and 
participation. The Special Rapporteur notes that the right to information and participation are 
both rights in themselves and essential tools for the exercise of other rights, such as the right to 
life, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to adequate housing and 
others. The section includes a discussion of current legal frameworks on the rights to information 
and participation that exist at the international and regional levels. Reference is also made to the 
different forms of implementation and monitoring mechanisms that can be used at the national 
level. 
</p>
<p> Lastly, the Special Rapporteur provides some conclusions and recommendations targeted 
at developing and developed States to fulfil their obligations in adhering more strictly to 
international normative frameworks with regard to the illicit movement and dumping of toxic 
and dangerous products. The Special Rapporteur also states that the main obligation in dealing 
with toxic wastes and dangerous products lies mainly with States, which should not abuse that 
responsibility by withholding information, given the potential risks and dangers to the health and 
well-being of the population and the potential impact on the environment.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with General Assembly resolution 60/251 
and Human Rights Council resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>2. The Commission on Human Rights adopted its first resolution on the adverse effects of the 
illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of 
human rights in 1995. In its resolution 1995/81, the Commission affirmed that the illicit traffic 
and the dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes constituted a serious threat to the 
rights to life and health, and it established the mandate of the Special Rapporteur to analyse the 
adverse effects on human rights of such phenomena. The Commission adopted yearly resolutions 
on this issue. By its resolution 2004/17, it extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for an 
additional three years. 
</p>
<p>3. In his first report as mandate-holder (E/CN.4/2005/45), the Special Rapporteur, 
Okechukwu Ibeanu, informed the Commission that he intended to adopt a thematic focus in his 
forthcoming reports. He identified criteria such as the extent and gravity of actual or potential 
human rights violations arising from a particular issue, and whether an analysis from the 
perspective of victims of human rights violations could add impetus to international efforts to 
address a particular issue, to be applied when choosing the thematic issues on which to focus his 
reports. 
</p>
<p>4. Previous reports submitted to the Commission pursuant to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mandate have addressed a variety of issues, including the adverse effects on human rights 
resulting from exposure to hazardous chemicals, particularly pesticides. Other reports have 
included information about the elaborate, multilateral legal framework adopted or being 
developed in the sphere of international environmental law with a view to preventing adverse 
effects on humans and the environment from exposure to some of the most dangerous chemicals. 
In his previous report to the Council, the Special Rapporteur chose to focus on the impact of 
armed conflict on exposure to toxic and dangerous products and wastes. Although war has 
always had an adverse effect on the environment, the voluntary or incidental release of toxic and 
dangerous products in contemporary armed conflicts has an important adverse effect on the 
enjoyment of human rights. 
5. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur has chosen to focus on the right to 
information and participation. Access to and communication of information about toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes and their effects on the environment are essential to guarantee 
certain other rights, such as the rights to life, to health and to adequate food. 
</p>
<p>6. The first addendum to the present report contains a summary of communications sent to 
and replies received from Governments and other stakeholders in 2006 and 2007. </p>

</p>
<p><b>II.  UPDATE ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur carried out a country visit to Ukraine from 22 to 30 January 2007 
(A/HRC/7/21/Add.2). During his mission, he visited Kyiv, Lviv and the Zakarpatya regions. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Ukraine for its invitation, which 
showed its commitment to human rights and environmental matters. He would like to thank, in 
particular, the Ministry of Environmental Protection for the openness and transparency 
demonstrated during the visit, which gave him the opportunity to meet all relevant public 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall, as in his previous reports, the importance of 
country visits. He believes that country visits provide an invaluable opportunity to obtain 
information from different interlocutors at the national level and to engage in an in-depth study 
of different phenomena related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes on human rights. Country visits also provide the 
opportunity to share experiences of best practices in combating the illicit movement and 
dumping of toxic wastes and to understand this multidimensional problem from a national, 
regional and international perspective. 
</p>
<p>9. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to call on Governments to respond 
positively to his requests for in situ visits. In 2006 and 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent several 
requests for official invitations mainly to the African and Asian regions, since both regions had 
not yet been visited by the current mandate-holder. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur thanks a number of Governments for responding positively to his 
requests. The Special Rapporteur is looking forward to his visits to the C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and India 
in 2008. He would like to thank the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, where he 
recently concluded a country visit, for their invitation. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur has submitted to the Council a preliminary note on his recent 
mission to the United Republic of Tanzania. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Statements and interventions 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur conveyed a statement to the expert group meeting on indigenous 
peoples and the protection of the environment held from 27 to 29 August 2007 in Khabarovsk, 
Russian Federation. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the government of Khabarovsk, 
the United Permanent Forum of Indigenous Peoples and the Association of Indigenous Peoples 
of the Russian North, Siberia and the Far East for the opportunity to contribute to that initiative. 
In his statement, the Special Rapporteur stressed the importance of receiving information from a 
variety of interlocutors, including indigenous groups and peoples. He noted his concern about 
allegations he had received concerning health problems affecting areas populated by indigenous 
communities caused by the use of pesticides or other toxins. He explained that such incidents 
had resulted in significant adverse effects on the ecosystem, the rural and indigenous 
communities living in the affected areas complaining of deterioration in the health of humans 
and livestock, crop damage and contamination of surface waters. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/21 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>13. He called on the national authorities and the international community to recognize the 
specific challenges and difficulties confronting indigenous people as a result of the illicit 
movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes, and urged action at the 
local, national, regional and international levels to address those problems and to involve 
indigenous peoples and other groups in decision-making processes related to issues such as the 
extraction of natural resources and development generally.  
</p>
<p><b>III. ADVERSE EFFECTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE  
ILLICIT MOVEMENT AND DUMPING OF TOXIC  
AND DANGEROUS PRODUCTS AND WASTES 
</b></p>
<p>14. In order to facilitate the review of the mandate by the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to recall some basic information about the illicit movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes, and highlight their impact on fundamental human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>15. In recent decades, the movement of hazardous wastes and products across the globe, and 
particularly from developed to developing countries, has continued to flourish, often without 
appropriate safeguards, despite international standards and norms which prohibit dumping or 
illicit movements. Disparities in domestic legal standards and the high costs of disposing of toxic 
waste effectively and safely have resulted in the regular movement of wastes across borders and 
frontiers, often illegally. 
</p>
<p>16. In 1980, 80 per cent of the trade in hazardous wastes was between developed countries.<b>1</b> 
In 1988, between 2 and 2.5 million tons of waste were transported among the European members 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In 1987 and 1988, the 
existence of a number of contracts between Western companies and African countries was made 
public. The information on the contracts showed that transnational corporations based in 
developed countries were selling toxic wastes and hazardous products to States in the South, in 
particular in Africa, where small payments could secure ample land on which to dump such 
wastes.<b>2</b> Transfers of waste were justified initially on the grounds that African countries had 
adequate land for safe disposal of such wastes and that the income generated could serve 
development needs. However, the limited technical capacity of such countries to dispose of it 
was ignored, as were the long-term consequences of burying and incinerating waste, which were 
the common disposal methods. Increasing global attention to this type of waste transfers led to

</p>
<p>greater regulation and the emergence of global norms. Unfortunately, regulation then led many 
companies to increasingly resort to illegal or illicit movement and dumping of wastes and 
dangerous products, with far-reaching consequences for human rights. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur notes that, apart from direct transfers of waste and dangerous 
products, there appears to have been an increase in indirect transfers through the relocation of 
polluting industries, industrial activities and/or technologies which generate hazardous wastes 
from OECD to non-OECD countries. High environmental and health standards coupled with 
strong opposition from local authorities or community and labour organizations in OECD 
countries have also fuelled such relocation. 
</p>
<p>18. Although the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that developing countries trade in 
hazardous products and toxic wastes owing to the poverty and the dire developmental situation 
of the countries concerned, the overall risks to life, health and the environment always outweigh 
short-term monetary benefits. The disposal of hazardous products and wastes requires technical 
knowledge for safe handling, technology which is often not available in destination countries. 
Advanced technology is needed for the safe disposal of waste, such as that generated by 
industrial chemicals, pesticides, poison, drugs, &#8220;e-wastes&#8221; (such as computers, refrigerators and 
cell phones) and for ship-breaking. Ironically, developed countries that have such technology are 
increasingly less likely to dispose of such wastes, but instead send them to developing countries 
that lack the necessary know-how. 
</p>
<p>19. Given the current scenario, the human rights of local populations in countries that are net 
receivers of toxic products and wastes are threatened by the dumping of hazardous wastes for 
disposal or storage and by the trade in hazardous waste for recycling or further use. Such risks 
are also involved in the selling of wastes to poor countries under the waste-to-energy plants that 
are often promoted to produce free energy.<b>3</b> Other forms of exposure for the local population are 
generated by lead recycling factories, the export of plastic residues, the export of ships for 
recycling operations, and the export of waste-intensive industries such as asbestos-related 
industries, cyanide heap-leaching and chlorine-related facilities in the chlor-alkali industry and 
tanneries. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur notes that, because of structural conditions in many developing 
countries, women and the young are particularly at risk from transfers of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes. Women, children and the young are often among the poorest and therefore 
likely to work in polluting industries and scavenge dumps of waste for reusable materials. They 
are also most likely to have limited access to information on waste products and to health 
facilities in the event of contamination. The Special Rapporteur calls for greater global attention 
to the gender and age dimensions of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>

<p>A/HRC/7/21

</p>
<p>21. The prevalence of low environmental standards, weak or no regulatory institutions and 
poor monitoring, poverty and development needs in developing countries continue to serve as 
pull factors for the dumping of hazardous products and wastes. The Special Rapporteur would 
also like to highlight that corruption, both in the developing and developed countries, is sadly a 
factor in the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and products. 
</p>
<p>22. In spite of relevant international normative frameworks related to both the environment 
and human rights, the trade in hazardous wastes and products persists and is on the increase. The 
Special Rapporteur notes with disappointment that, where regional mechanisms such as the 
Bamako Convention<b>4</b> exist, the norms and standards they have established are often observed 
only in the event of breach. Consequently, such regional mechanisms have become ineffective in 
curbing the illicit transboundary movement of wastes. 
</p>
<p>23. The impact of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and 
wastes can be particularly severe on the enjoyment of the rights to life, health, food and work. 
The right to a remedy should also be seen as central to the relationship between toxic wastes and 
human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>24. The right to life, which is enshrined in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is seen as a right 
which is &#8220;non-derogable&#8221; and the most important, since without it, all other rights would be 
devoid of meaning.<b>5</b> The Human Rights Committee has said that it is a right that should not be 
interpreted narrowly and that States should take positive measures to guarantee, including 
measures to reduce infant mortality and to increase life expectancy.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The right to life involves, at the very least, a prohibition on the State not to take life 
intentionally or negligently. The right to life is one of the first rights to be affected by the 
production, use, trading and temporary or final disposal, including dumping, of toxic wastes and 
products. In extreme cases, where environmental disasters such as Chernobyl and Bhopal occur, 
this right can be invoked by individuals to obtain compensation from the State insofar as it is 
responsible for the disaster. 
</p>
<p>26. According to information gathered by the mandate over the years, many of the violations 
in various parts of the world involve violations of that right in the form of immediate death,

<p>life-threatening diseases such as cancer, infant mortality, sterility and other major handicaps and 
diseases. One such example of such a violation of this right is the Chernobyl incident, which has 
claimed many victims and displaced populations.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Right to the highest attainable standard of health 
</b></p>
<p>27. Every human being is entitled to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health 
conducive to living in dignity. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted 
that the right to health was closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human 
rights, including the rights to food, housing, work, education, human dignity, life, 
non-discrimination, equality, the prohibition of torture, privacy, access to information and the 
freedoms of association, assembly and movement.<b>7</b> Furthermore, the Committee recognized that 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health was not confined to the right to 
health care, but embraced a wide range of socio-economic factors that promoted conditions in 
which people could lead a healthy life and extended to the underlying determinants of health, 
such as food and nutrition, housing, access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, 
safe and healthy working conditions and a healthy environment.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Right to adequate food 
</b></p>
<p>28. The right to adequate food is part of the broader right to an adequate standard of living, 
which also includes housing and clothing, and the distinct fundamental right to be free from 
hunger, which aims at preventing people from starving and is closely linked to the right to life. 
As is the case for other human rights, this right is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the 
human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other universal guarantees enshrined in 
the International Bill of Human Rights. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
considers that the core content of the right to adequate food implies the availability of food in a 
quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse 
substances, and acceptable within a given culture.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>29. The right to work is enshrined in article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Every 
individual has the right to be able to work, allowing the person to live in dignity. According to 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right to work is a fundamental right

</p>
<p>which is essential for realizing other human rights and forms an inseparable and inherent part of 
human dignity.<b>10</b> The right to work plays an important role in the survival of the individual as 
well as that of his or her family.  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Right to remedy  
</b></p>
<p>30. Where there is a right, there is a remedy.<b> 11</b> This principle is expressed in article 2, 
paragraph 3 (a), of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees 
victims of human rights violations an effective remedy. There are two aspects to the right to a 
remedy: access to justice and substantive redress. They require the existence of independent and 
impartial bodies with the capacity to afford redress after a hearing which respects due process 
guarantees. More and more national administrative and judicial bodies throughout the world are 
giving effect to the right to a remedy in cases of alleged violations of constitutional rights to a 
sound environment, related in some cases to the right to life or to health. While the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has no provision comparable to 
article 2 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it has been argued that 
the rights it recognizes also require that remedies be available for victims of violations. The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted, for example, that any person or 
group victim of a violation of the right to health should have access to effective judicial or other 
appropriate remedies at both the national and international levels and should be entitled to 
adequate reparation.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  RIGHT TO INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION  
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur has decided to focus the present report on the importance of the 
right to information and participation in relation to his mandate. He continues to receive 
information and communications with regard to the violation of the right to information in 
environmental matters. Trends show that States, corporations and other private entities generally 
do not share vital information about the potential effects of pollution and irreversible damage to 
the environment until an incident has occurred. In such cases and when an incident has occurred, 
the relevant authorities and/or actors are often reluctant to disclose information of vital 
importance to the victims and their defence. Such information is either withheld, falsified,

</p>
<p>provided after a delayed amount of time or given piecemeal in order to confuse or be deemed 
unusable. Governmental authorities often justify this behaviour on national security grounds, 
transnational corporations for considerations of trade secrecy.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur considers that the right to information and participation  are both 
rights in themselves and also essential to the exercise of other rights, such as the right to life, the 
right to the highest attainable standard to health and the right to adequate food, among others. 
Lack of information denies people the opportunity to develop their potential to the fullest and 
realize the full range of their human rights.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur considers the right to information and participation highly relevant 
in the context of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products on the environment and on the enjoyment of basic human rights. Public access to 
information when requested and the obligation of public authorities to disclose and inform, 
irrespective of requests, are imperative for the prevention of environmental human rights 
problems and the protection of the environment.   
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes that there are many cases that have been brought to his 
attention of disputes between citizens and Governments in developing countries and between 
developing countries and transnational corporations over the movement of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes. Disputes often arise owing to a lack of information or the failure of the 
State or of corporations to ensure full disclosure of the potential dangers of activities carried out 
by those corporations to individuals, communities and the environment. He notes that, in many 
cases, even Governments claim not to have access to the necessary information on the potential 
dangers to human beings and the environment. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that the responsibility of States is particularly 
important when dealing with the issue of toxic waste, including the disposal of nuclear wastes, 
and the production or use of pesticides, chemical products and toxins because of the dangers to 
the health and well-being of human beings that they pose. 
</p>
<p>36. National security, &#8220;trade secrets&#8221;, the principle of confidentiality of matters <i>sub iudice</i>, or 
other grounds invoked against reasonable requests for information on toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes must be applied with caution. The Special Rapporteur stresses that 
Governments may only invoke such grounds insofar as they are in conformity with the relevant 
derogation or limitation clauses of international human rights instruments. The use of such 
concepts must be regularly reviewed to ensure that the public&#8217;s right to information is not unduly 
restricted.<b>13</b>  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur considers it important that individuals, communities and 
neighbouring countries have information regarding hazardous materials and conditions at 
industrial facilities located in their vicinity in order to undertake disaster risk reduction and 
preparedness wherever there is a danger of large-scale industrial accidents, like those in 
</p>

<p>Chernobyl and Bhopal. Individuals, communities and neighbouring countries must have 
information regarding the full extent of environmental impact of proposed development projects 
in their regions in order to participate meaningfully in decisions that could expose them to 
increased pollution, environmental degradation and other such effects. Individuals, communities 
and neighbouring countries must have information regarding pollutants and wastes associated 
with industrial and agricultural processes. The Special Rapporteur considers it a clear duty of the 
State to disclose such information. 
</p>
<p>38. In developing countries, the Special Rapporteur notes the frequent violation of the right to 
information regarding the transboundary movement of wastes and dangerous products. Among 
other things, the Special Rapporteur notes with great concern that toxic wastes and dangerous 
products are often not labelled in the local language, which further exposes the population to 
severe health and environmental risks. In addition, it must be mentioned that hazardous products 
and wastes in developing nations are frequently dumped in rural and isolated areas, where there 
is a high prevalence of illiteracy and inadequate information. 
</p>
<p>39. Widespread political instability in many developing countries means that vital information 
that is necessary to the health, environment and well-being of the population is often withheld 
from the public, apparently on the grounds that it is necessary to uphold national security, and 
prevent civil unrest. In his previous report to the Council (A/HRC/5/5), the Special Rapporteur 
stated that one of the consequences of armed conflicts was the trafficking of dangerous products 
and wastes and their illicit dumping. Armed conflicts can also have a negative impact on the 
right to information and participation, which in turn increases the likelihood that toxic wastes 
and products will be illicitly moved and dumped. 
</p>
<p>40. Although the media could play an indispensable role in information dissemination in 
communities, countries and regions, as well as both the rural and urban areas about the illegal 
movement of hazardous products and wastes, it is often the case in developing countries that the 
freedom of the press is severely curtailed or simply does not exist.  
</p>
<p>41. The rights to information and participation, and their particular importance for both 
human rights and environment matters, are, however, well reflected in the international legal 
framework, in both human rights law and environmental law. Some basic elements of that legal 
framework and the importance of monitoring mechanisms are described below. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p><b>1. International instruments  
</b></p>
<p>42. The right to information is frequently presented as an individual and group right that 
constitutes an essential feature of democratic processes and of the right to participation in public 
life. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to  </p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression; that right includes freedom to hold opinions without 
interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and 
regardless of frontiers. Article 21 of the Declaration would be rendered meaningless unless  </p>
<p>individuals and groups have access to relevant information on which to base the exercise of the 
vote or otherwise express the will of the people.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/21 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>43. The right as a legally binding treaty obligation is enshrined in article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 19 (2) stipulates that everyone should have the 
right to freedom of expression; that right should include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. Article 19 (3) does allow certain 
restrictions, but they should only be such as are provided by law and are necessary (a) for the 
respect of the rights and reputations of others; (b) for the protection of national security or of 
public order, or of public health and morals. Article 25 of the Covenant in turn prescribes that 
every citizen should have the right and the opportunity to take part in the conduct of public 
affairs.  
</p>
<p>44. While there are no explicit references in the core international human rights treaties to the 
right to information and participation with regard to environmental matters, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to recall that the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development <b>14</b> 
focused on the right to information, participation and remedies with regard to environmental 
conditions. Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration stipulates that participation of all concerned 
citizens should be practised when environmental issues are concerned. At the national level, it 
calls for each individual to have appropriate access to all appropriate information concerning the 
environment held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and 
activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. 
It further calls upon States to facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by 
making information widely available. It further calls upon States to ensure that access to judicial 
and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, is provided. 
</p>
<p>45. Principle 18 of the Declaration calls upon States to immediately notify other States of any 
natural disasters or other emergencies that are likely to produce sudden harmful effects on the 
environment of those States. It reminds States that efforts should be made by the international 
community to help States that are afflicted by such calamities. Principles 20, 21 and 22 call for 
the wide participation of women, youth, indigenous peoples and other communities in protecting 
the environment and fostering development.   
</p>
<p>46. Article 15 (2) of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for 
Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade of 10 September 1998 <b>15</b> 
requires each State party to ensure, to the extent practicable, that the public has appropriate 
access to information on chemical handling and accident management and on alternatives that 
are safer for human health or the environment than the chemicals listed in annex III to the 
Convention.

<p>47. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants of 22 May 2001 aims at 
protecting human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants. 
Article 10 (i) provides that each party should, within its capabilities, promote and facilitate 
provision to the public of all available information on persistent organic pollutants and ensure 
that the public has access to public information and that the information is kept up to date. The 
Convention also calls for education and public awareness programmes to be developed, in 
particular for women, children and the poorly educated (art. 10 (1) (c)). Parties to the Convention 
are also obligated to make accessible to the public, on a timely and regular basis, the results of 
their research, development and monitoring activities pertaining to persistent organic pollutants 
(art. 11 (2) (e)). The Convention stipulates that, although parties that exchange information 
pursuant to the Convention should protect any confidential information, information on health 
and safety of humans and the environment should not be regarded as confidential (art. 9 (5)). 
</p>
<p>48. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes 
and Their Disposal sets out obligations for the exchange of information for both the State 
concerned and interested parties. In article 4 (2) (f), the Convention clearly requires that 
information about a proposed transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes be 
provided to the States concerned and that it clearly state the effects of the proposed movement on 
human health and the environment. In article 4 (2) (h), it encourages cooperation through 
activities with other parties and/or interested organizations for the dissemination of information 
on transboundary movements in order to improve environmentally sound management and to 
work towards the prevention of illegal traffic. Article 13 (1) provides that parties to the 
Convention should ensure that, should an accident occur during the transboundary movement of 
wastes and other wastes or their disposal and that is likely to present risks to human health and 
the environment in other States, those States are immediately informed.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>49. The Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and 
Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, signed in Aarhus, Denmark, on 25 June 1998,<b>17</b> 
takes a very comprehensive approach to the recognition of the importance of the right to 
information and public participation. As at 17 September 2007, there were 41 parties to the 
Convention. Although it was open for signature only to State members of the Economic 
Commission for Europe and those with consultative status with it (art. 17), article 19 of the 
Convention opens the door to accession by other States on the condition that they are members 
of the United Nations and that the accession is approved by the meeting of the parties to the 
Convention. In the preamble, it states that &#8220;every person has the right to live in an environment 
adequate to his or her health and well-being, and the duty, both individually and in association 
with others, to protect and improve the environment for the benefit of present and future 
generations&#8221;. In the following paragraph, it states that, in order to be able to assert that right 
and observe that duty, citizens must have access to information, be entitled to participate in 
decision-making and have access to justice in environmental matters, and, in that regard, citizens 
may need assistance in order to exercise their rights.

</p>
<p>50. Articles 4 and 5 of the Convention obligates States parties to collect and publicly 
disseminate information, and to make such information available to the public in response to 
requests. Each party to the Convention is to publish a national report on the state of the 
environment every three to four years. In addition to the national report, the party is obliged to 
disseminate legislative and policy documents, treaties and other international instruments 
relating to the environment. Each party must ensure that public authorities, upon request, provide 
environmental information to a requesting person without the latter having to state an interest. 
Information should be made public within one month, or, in exceptional cases, in not more than 
two months (art. 4 (2)). In addition to providing information on request, each State party must be 
proactive, ensuring that public authorities collect and update environmental information relevant 
to their functions. This requires States parties to establish mandatory systems to obtain 
information on proposed and existing activities which could significantly affect the environment. 
(art. 5 (1)). The Convention does provide for a number of exceptions in article 4 (4) to the duty 
to inform, in the light of other political, economic and legal considerations, but they are to be 
interpreted in a restrictive way and take into account the public interest served by disclosure.  
</p>
<p>51. Public participation is guaranteed by articles 6 to 8 of the Convention. Public participation 
is required in regard to all decisions on whether to permit or renew permission for industrial, 
agricultural and construction activities listed in annex I to the Convention, as well as other 
activities which may have a significant impact on the environment (art. 6 (1) (a)-(b)). The public 
must be informed in detail about the proposed activity early in the decision-making process and 
be given time to prepare and participate in the decision-making (art. 6 (2)-(3)). In addition to 
providing for public participation in decisions on specific projects, the Convention calls for 
public participation in the preparation of environmental plans, programmes, policies, laws and 
regulations (arts. 7 and 8). <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Regional instruments 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Africa 
</b>52. Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights stipulates that every 
individual has the right to receive information (art. 9 (1)) and to express and disseminate his 
opinions within the law (art. 9 (2)).  
</p>
<p>53. In 2002, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights adopted a declaration of 
principles, in which it stated that &#8220;public bodies hold information not for themselves but as 
custodians of the public good and everyone has a right to access this information&#8221; (principle IV). 
Principle IV (2) guarantees the right to information. Although the declaration is not legally 
binding, the Special Rapporteur notes that it reflects the thoughts of African people and has 
considerable moral force.   
</p>
<p><b>(b) Arab States  
</b>54. The Arab Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development adopted in 1991 the 
Arab Declaration on Environment and Development and Future Perspectives (see A/46/632), in 
which the League of Arab States stressed the right of individuals and organizations to acquire 
information about environmental issues and to participate in the formulation and implementation 
of decisions that could affect their environment. <b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/21 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Asia-Pacific</b> 
55.<b> </b>The<b> </b>Ministerial Declaration on Environmentally Sound and Sustainable Development in 
Asia and the Pacific, of 1990, affirms the right of individuals and non-governmental 
organizations to be informed of environmental problems relevant to them, to have the necessary 
access to information, and to participate in the formulation and implementation of decisions 
likely to affect their environment (A/CONF.151/PC/38, para. 27).  
</p>
<p><b>(d) Latin America and Caribbean States  
</b>56. Article 13 (1) of the American Convention on Human Rights of 1969 states that &#8220;everyone 
has the right to freedom of thought and expression. This right includes freedom to seek, receive, 
and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing, in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other medium of one&#8217;s choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>57. Principle 4 of the Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression, 
approved by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in October 2000, specifically 
recognizes that &#8220;access to information held by the State is a fundamental right of every 
individual. States have the obligation to guarantee the full exercise of this right. This principle 
allows only exceptional limitations that must be previously established by law in case of a real 
and imminent danger that threatens national security in democratic societies&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. On 10 June 2003, the Organization of American States (OAS) General Assembly adopted a 
resolution on access to public information: strengthening democracy. In its resolution, OAS 
considers that access to public information is a requisite for the very functioning of democracy, 
greater transparency, and good governance. It also reaffirms that everyone has the freedom to 
seek, receive, have access to and impart information and that access to public information is a 
requisite for the very exercise of democracy.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Europe 
</b>59. In article 10 (1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms of 1950, the Council of Europe states that everyone has the right to 
freedom of expression, a right that includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart 
information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. 
</p>
<p>60. Article 11 (1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in 2000 by the 
European Union explicitly guarantees the right to receive and impart information and 
ideas without interference by public authorities and regardless of frontiers.  
</p>
<p>61. For the European Union, the principle of openness was introduced by the Treaty of 
Maastricht in 1991; the Council and the Commission then adopted a code of conduct on public 
access to their documents. In 1996, public right of access was enshrined in article 255 of the 
Treaty, establishing the European Community as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam. 
Regulation (EC) No. 1049/2001, which became applicable in December 2001, gave effect to the 
right of European Union citizens to obtain documents of the European Parliament, Council and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/21 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>Commission, thus leading to a significant increase in requests for access. Possible amendments 
to the regulation were under consideration in 2007, also to reflect adoption of a regulation 
applying the Aarhus Convention to the European Union institutions.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Implementation and monitoring mechanisms 
for the realization of the right to information  
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes that, although the list of standards mentioned above is not 
exhaustive, it provides for several examples of legal norms and standards that do exist on the 
right to information both at the international and regional levels. There are several projects that 
monitor access to information held by national authorities and international or supranational 
organizations, such as the Access to Information Monitoring Tool of the Open Society Justice 
Initiative.<b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur would like to appeal to States to implement the right to 
information by establishing specific legislation conforming to international norms and standards. 
Ensuring effective implementation of the right to information requires proper training in their 
responsibilities for persons involved in implementing the law in how to deal with requests for 
information and how to interpret the law.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur also encourages Governments to be proactive in promoting the 
right to information and to educate the public on how to claim it. He would like to remind States 
that right to information laws should not only require public authorities to provide information 
upon request but also impose a duty on public bodies to actively disclose, disseminate and 
publish information. One such example of facilitating proactive disclosure of information would 
include the creation of systems informing the public on right to information laws. The 
implementation of right to information laws would also entail the setting up of systematic 
records management, including managing, recording and archiving.  
</p>
<p>65. States should also set up information commissions as general oversight bodies to regulate 
the implementation and oversight of right to information laws, or ensure that such functions, 
together with the necessary capacity and resources, are entrusted to national human rights 
institutions. The Special Rapporteur notes that, although many models of information 
commissions already exist in different regions, they usually have similar functions, acting as 
external independent authorities with a clear mandate to supervise the implementation of the 
right to information. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that the right to participation in public 
life is linked very closely with the right to information (and to education). The right to 
popular participation in decision-making is enshrined in article 21 of the Universal 
</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p><b>Declaration of Human Rights and several other international instruments. The exercise of 
the right to participation would be meaningless if there was no access to relevant 
information on issues of concern.</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>67<b>. The Special Rapporteur believes that the Human Rights Council may want to 
recognize explicitly the right to information as a precondition for good governance and the 
realization of all other human rights. States should move towards implementing the right 
to information enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Special Rapporteur notes that 
information held by the State should be considered to be held in trust for the public, not as 
belonging to the Government. Although the State can invoke national security or defence 
clauses, it is the view of the Special Rapporteur that this responsibility should not be 
abused by States or used to derogate from their duty to protect and promote the rights of 
their citizens in relation to the adverse effects of toxic and dangerous products and wastes.  
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The Special Rapporteur would like to appeal to both developed and developing States 
to adhere more strictly to international normative frameworks, such as the 
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and 
Their Disposal. The Special Rapporteur notes that there are currently 170 parties to the 
Convention and appeals to those States that have not already done so to consider ratifying 
it. The Special Rapporteur also urges States to take into account, and if possible become 
parties to, other legal instruments such as the Aarhus Convention, which are central to the 
full realization of the right to information with regard to environmental matters, which in 
turn would help combat the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic 
and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights.  
</b>69.<b> While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that developing countries are sometimes 
left with little choice owing to developmental needs and situations of poverty, both 
developing and developed States need to find alternative solutions to the trade of toxic 
wastes and dangerous products. Although the income generated by such trade is very 
attractive, States need to take into account the future costs and long-term consequences of 
environmental degradation, as well as their obligation to save future generations from a 
multitude of health problems. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the 
consequences of these health problems for women and young persons and appeals to States 
to put in place adequate means for their protection.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that developed countries must not 
see developing nations as &#8220;cheap dumping grounds&#8221; to get rid of unwanted and hazardous 
products and wastes. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the high environmental and 
health standards that often prevail  in developed States, at both the national and the 
regional level, it is his hope that developed countries will consider passing on key 
knowledge on the safe handling of toxic and dangerous products, and their experience in 
monitoring safety standards and the effective running of regulatory mechanisms, to 
developing countries.
