PROSPECTUS
Subject To Completion, dated July 31, 2014
17,500,000 Common Units
Representing Limited Liability Company Interests
This is the initial public offering of Transocean Partners LLC. Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, or the selling unitholder, is
offering 17,500,000 common units representing limited liability company interests in this offering. We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of common units by the selling unitholder. We currently estimate that the initial public offering price will be between
$19.00 and $21.00 per common unit. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common units.
We are a Marshall Islands limited liability company formed by an affiliate of Transocean Ltd., or Transocean, a leading international
provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. We will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Our common units have been approved, subject to official notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “RIGP.” We are an “emerging growth company,” and we are eligible for reduced reporting requirements. See “Summary—
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company.”
Investing in our common units involves a high degree of risk. Before buying any common units, you should carefully read
the discussion of material risks of investing in our common units in “Risk Factors” beginning on page 20.
These risks include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and
expenses to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our units.
We must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet, which will
reduce cash available for distribution.
Financing agreements containing operating and financial restrictions and other covenants may restrict our business and
financing activities.
We currently derive all of our revenues from two customers, and the loss of either of these customers or a dispute that leads
to a loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.
Any limitation in the availability or operation of any of our three drilling rigs, or the inability to obtain new and favorable
contracts for the drilling rigs upon any termination or expiration, could have a material adverse effect on us.
We depend on affiliates of Transocean to assist us in operating and expanding our business.
Unitholders have limited voting and other rights.
•
•
•
•
Transocean and its affiliates own a controlling interest in us, have conflicts of interest and may favor their own interests to
the detriment of us and our other common unitholders.
Transocean and its affiliates may compete with us, and we are limited in our ability to compete with Transocean.
You will experience immediate and substantial dilution of $6.33 per common unit.
A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we are resident or in which we
have operations, or a loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our intercompany pricing policies in
certain countries, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of
these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.

SUMMARY
This summary provides a brief overview of information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. It does not contain all of the
information that you should consider before investing in the common units. You should carefully read the entire prospectus, including
“Risk Factors” and the historical and pro forma financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this prospectus,
before investing in our common units. Unless we otherwise specify, all references to information and data in this prospectus about our
business and fleet refer to our business and fleet immediately after the closing of this offering. Unless otherwise indicated, the
information in this prospectus assumes (i) an initial public offering price of $20.00 per unit (the midpoint of the price range set forth on
the cover of this prospectus) and (ii) that the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional common units. Unless
otherwise indicated, all references to “dollars” and “$” in this prospectus are to, and amounts are presented in, U.S. Dollars.
All references in this prospectus to “Transocean Partners,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and “the company” refer to Transocean Partners LLC and
its subsidiaries, including the RigCos, unless the context otherwise indicates. We will own a 51 percent interest and Transocean will
own a 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the entities that own and operate Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader
and Development Driller III. Each of these drilling rigs will be owned by and operated by separate subsidiaries of ours. We refer to the
rig-owning and rig-operating company for each drilling rig together as a “RigCo” and collectively for all of our drilling rigs as the
“RigCos.” References in this prospectus to our fleet, refer to the drilling rigs in which we hold interests indirectly through the RigCos.
Unless otherwise specifically noted, financial results and operating data are shown on a 100 percent basis and are not adjusted to
reflect Transocean’s 49 percent noncontrolling interest in the RigCos.
References in this prospectus to “Transocean” refer, depending on the context, to Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG, SIX: RIGN) and/or to
any one or more of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, other than us. References in this prospectus to “Transocean Member” refer to
the owner of the Transocean Member interest, initially Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, the selling unitholder in this offering
and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. The Transocean Member interest is a non-economic interest in
Transocean Partners that includes the right to appoint three members of our board of directors. References in this prospectus to
“Chevron” and “BP” refer to the subsidiaries of Chevron Corporation and BP plc, respectively, that are our customers. We have
provided definitions for some of the terms we use to describe our business and industry and other terms used in this prospectus in the
“Glossary of Terms” beginning on page B-1 of this prospectus.
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC
We are a growth-oriented limited liability company recently formed by Transocean, one of the world’s largest offshore drilling
contractors, to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. Our initial assets consist of 51
percent interests in the RigCos that own and operate three ultra-deepwater drilling rigs that are currently operating in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico. Transocean owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. We generate revenue through
contract drilling services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and work crews on a dayrate
basis to large international energy companies to drill oil and gas wells.
Our drilling rigs currently operate under long-term contracts with Chevron and BP, two leading international energy companies, with
an average remaining contract term of approximately 4.1 years as of July 7, 2014. We believe that our drilling contracts will generate
stable and reliable cash flows over their term. We intend to use the relationships and expertise of Transocean to re-contract our fleet
when the existing contracts expire and identify opportunities to expand our fleet through acquisitions.

(1) Contract start and completion dates are estimated. Contracts could be longer in duration because of a provision that allows the
customer to finish drilling a well-in-progress and due to other factors not under our control. New contracts do not commence until
the prior contract has been completed.
(2) Represents the maximum contractual operating dayrate (which could change in the future due to cost escalations), but excludes
amortization of drilling contract intangible revenues and certain cash and non-cash pre-operating revenues that terminate at the
end of the rigs’ current contracts. For a description of amortizing revenues included in the dayrates presented in this table,
please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Performance and
Other Key Indicators—Contract Backlog.”
The average dayrate actually earned over the term of the contract will reflect various reduced rates received under the contract
as a result of time billed according to standby rates, waiting-on-weather rates, maintenance rates or any other similar rates,
which are typically less than the contract dayrate. In addition, the amount shown does not reflect incentive programs, which are
typically based on the rig’s operating performance against a performance curve. For the three months ended March 31, 2014,
average daily revenue was $533,200, $579,700 and $467,200 for Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and
Development Driller III, respectively, and the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our initial fleet was 98 percent. For the year ended
December 31, 2013, average daily revenue was $500,700, $450,500 and $416,100 for Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear
Leader and Development Driller III, respectively, and the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our initial fleet was 86 percent. For
additional information about average daily revenue earned and revenue efficiency in historical periods, please read
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Performance and Other Key
Indicators.”
(3) The dayrate for the remainder of the contract is linked to the standard West Texas Intermediate crude oil price with a floor of $40
per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $400,000 and a ceiling of $70 per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $500,000,
before cost escalation adjustments of $50,000 per day and pre-operating revenues of $19,000 per day.
For the three months ended March 31, 2014, we had operating revenues of $148 million, net income of $63 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of $72 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had operating revenues of $526 million, net income of $189
million and Adjusted EBITDA of $221 million. Please read “—Non-GAAP Measures” and “Selected Historical Financial and
Operating Data—Non-GAAP Measures” for the definition of the term Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net
income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.

Our Relationship with Transocean
One of our principal strengths is our relationship with Transocean. Transocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract
drilling services for oil and gas wells. As of July 7, 2014, Transocean owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 77
mobile offshore drilling units, including our initial drilling rigs. As of July 7, 2014, Transocean’s fleet, including the rigs in our fleet,
consisted of 46 high-specification floaters (ultra-deepwater, deepwater and harsh environment semisubmersibles and drillships), 21
midwater floaters and 10 high-specification jackups. At such date, Transocean also had nine ultra-deepwater drillships and five high-
specification jackups under construction or under contract to be constructed.
We believe that our relationship with Transocean will provide us with access to leading international energy companies, as well as
suppliers and other key service providers for our industry. We also believe that Transocean’s operational and managerial expertise
will enable us to compete more effectively for contract opportunities than other contract drilling companies similar in size to us.
Under an omnibus agreement to be entered into on or before the closing of this offering, Transocean will grant us a right of first offer
for its remaining ownership interests in each of the RigCos should Transocean decide to sell such interests. Transocean also will be
required to offer us the opportunity to purchase not less than a 51 percent interest in four of the six drillships listed below within the
five years following the closing of this offering at a purchase price equal to the greater of the fair market value (taking into account the
anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts) or the all-in construction cost, plus transaction costs. Transocean will
select which of these rigs it will offer to us, the timing of the offers and whether it will offer us the opportunity to purchase a greater than
51 percent interest in any offered rig.

(1) Contract start and completion dates are estimated. Contract start dates depend on delivery by shipyards, testing and customer
acceptance. Contracts could be longer in duration because of a provision that allows the customer to finish drilling a well-in-
progress and due to other factors not under our control.
(2) Represents the maximum contractual operating dayrate. The average dayrate actually earned over the term of the contract will
reflect various reduced rates received under the contract as a result of time billed according to standby rates, waiting-on-weather
rates, maintenance rates or any other similar rates, which typically are less than the contract dayrate. In addition, the amount
shown does not reflect incentive programs, which are typically based on the rig’s operating performance against a performance
curve. Each of these drilling rigs is currently under construction and, therefore, has no operating history.
In addition, subject to specified exceptions, Transocean and its controlled affiliates (other than any publicly held affiliates of
Transocean) will be required to offer us the opportunity to purchase any drilling rigs that Transocean acquires or contracts to build
after the closing date of this offering that are subject to a drilling contract with a remaining term of five years or longer, and any existing
drilling rigs in its fleet that were constructed in 2009 or later and are placed under an extension or a new drilling contract with a term of
five years or longer, in each case excluding any unexercised customer option to extend the drilling contract. We refer to such drilling
rigs, together with any related contracts and associated assets, as Five-Year Drilling Rigs. In addition, we generally will agree not to
acquire, own, operate or contract for certain drilling rigs operating under drilling contracts of less than five years.
Table of Contents

Relatively few drilling contracts have a term of five years or greater, particularly in the case of contracts that are not associated with
newbuild units. As a result, we expect that Transocean will effectively have a right of first refusal on most drilling contract
opportunities. Please read “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—
Omnibus Agreement.”
The consummation and timing of any acquisitions from Transocean will depend upon, among other things, our ability to obtain any
necessary consents, the determination that the acquisition is appropriate for our business at that particular time, our ability to agree on
mutually acceptable terms of purchase, including price, and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms.
Following this offering, Transocean will retain a significant interest in us through its ownership of common and subordinated units,
representing an aggregate 74.6 percent limited liability company interest in us, and all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe
that Transocean is motivated to facilitate the growth of our distributions per unit, including through future contribution or sales to us of
additional rigs and its remaining interests in each of the RigCos. In addition to the drillships discussed above, Transocean has a
number of newer rigs that are operating under long-term drilling contracts and rigs under construction. Although Transocean is not
obligated to offer these rigs to us, we believe that these rigs would be particularly suitable for future contribution or sale to us. Any
publicly held affiliates of Transocean would not be subject to the restrictions on competition contained in the omnibus agreement;
however, Transocean does not have any current plan to form such an affiliate that would focus on Five-Year Drilling Rigs.
Business Strategies
Our primary business objectives are to operate and maintain our fleet to generate stable cash flows and increase our quarterly cash
distributions per unit over time. We intend to accomplish these objectives by executing the following business strategies:
Grow through strategic acquisitions. We intend to pursue strategic opportunities to grow our company and fleet through
acquisitions from Transocean or third parties that will enable us to increase our quarterly distributions per unit. Pursuant to
the omnibus agreement, Transocean will be required, under certain circumstances, to offer us the opportunity to purchase
its remaining interests in one or more of the RigCos, as well as certain drilling rigs (including a majority ownership interest
in four of the ultra-deepwater drillships that are currently under construction and are supported by long-term contracts).
Pursue assets with contracts that help maintain stable cash flows. We are focused on generating and maintaining
stable cash flows by pursuing drilling rigs operated under long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties. We believe
that employing our rigs under long-term contracts will improve the stability and predictability of our cash flows and should
also contribute to our growth strategy by facilitating our access to debt and equity financing. We also believe that our
relationship with Transocean will enhance our ability to compete for contract opportunities.
Conduct safe, efficient and reliable operations. We participate in Transocean’s programs designed to maintain and
improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of all our operations, which are vital to our ability to retain and attract our
customers. We believe that our relationship with Transocean and our relatively young and high-specification fleet will
enable us to operate safely, efficiently and cost effectively. We expect that these factors will enhance our ability to secure
additional long-term contracts and extend existing contracts, enabling us to maintain high asset utilization.
Maintain a modern and reliable fleet. We have one of the most capable and technologically advanced fleets in the
industry. We plan to invest both in growing our modern and reliable fleet and in continually maintaining the quality and
operational integrity of our assets. We believe that investing in high-quality assets with proven and reliable drilling rig
technology is an important component in our strategy to provide our customers with safe and reliable operations and
services.

Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths:
•
Relationship with Transocean provides industry expertise and facilitates our growth strategy. Transocean
specializes in operations in technically demanding regions of the global offshore drilling industry with a particular focus on
ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling services. Transocean believes its mobile offshore drilling fleet is one of the
•
•
•
•
most versatile fleets in the world, consisting of drillships, semisubmersibles and high-specification jackups used in support
of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis. We believe that our relationship with
Transocean will facilitate our acquisition and growth strategy, provide access to premier customers and suppliers and allow
us to capitalize on Transocean’s operational expertise. In addition, we believe that our relationship with Transocean will
assist us in securing new contracts for our rigs as we complete our current contracts. We believe Transocean’s history as
an efficient and reliable contractor and its operational and management expertise will enhance our ability to obtain new
long-term contracts.
Long-term contracts with high-quality customers promote stable cash flows. All of our revenues and associated cash
flows are derived from our existing long-term contracts. Our rigs are contracted to high-quality, creditworthy customers for
an average remaining contract term of approximately 4.1 years as of July 7, 2014. Our drilling contracts provide for payment
on a fixed-dayrate basis for the applicable contract term. We believe these agreements will enhance cash flow
dependability and predictability, providing us with the financial stability we need to make cash distributions and obtain
financing for future growth.
High-quality, well-maintained, modern and young fleet provides strong operational results. We believe that we have
one of the most capable, technologically advanced and efficient fleets in the offshore drilling industry and that we can
become a preferred provider of offshore drilling services. Our fleet is comprised of technologically advanced drilling rigs
designed to operate in ultra-deepwater environments, as well as in deepwater and midwater environments. All of our rigs
were placed into service in 2009 or 2010, with an average age of approximately 4.4 years as of July 7, 2014. In general,
customers prefer newer, more technologically advanced rigs. Accordingly, we expect to have relatively low maintenance
and replacement capital expenditures, high utilization rates and efficient and reliable operations.
Financial flexibility to execute growth strategy. Upon the closing of this offering, we expect to have an undrawn
committed $300 million revolving credit facility with an affiliate of Transocean that allows for uncommitted increases in
amounts to be agreed upon by Transocean and us. We expect that our borrowing capacity under this credit facility as well
as access to the capital markets and other financing sources will be conducive to the execution of our acquisition strategy
and enable us to pursue other expansion opportunities.
Experienced leadership team. Our management team has an average of over 20 years of experience in the energy
industry. Our management team has established strong relationships with customers, suppliers and other industry
participants, which we believe will be beneficial to us in pursuing our business strategies.
Operational Update
Discoverer Clear Leader is anticipated to be out of service during the third quarter of 2014 for a period of between 14 to 18 days for
maintenance to its blowout preventer and for an additional 21 days for a scheduled special periodic survey. Transocean has agreed
to indemnify us for any lost revenue arising out of the failure to
Table of Contents
5
receive an operating dayrate from Chevron for Discoverer Clear Leader, up to $100 million, for the period commencing on the closing
date of this offering through the completion of this special periodic survey. As a result of this indemnity, we do not expect that these
out of service periods will reduce the amount of our cash available for distribution.
Risk Factors
An investment in our common units involves risks associated with our business, our limited liability company structure and the tax
characteristics of our common units, including the risks described below. You should carefully consider these risks and the other risks
described in “Risk Factors” beginning on page 20 and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common units.
Risks Inherent in Our Business
•
We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and
•
•
•
•
•
•
expenses to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our common units and subordinated units.
The assumptions underlying our forecast of cash available for distribution are inherently uncertain and subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasted.
We must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet, and we may
be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitiveness and to comply with laws and the
applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations, or to execute our growth plan, each of
which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and reduce cash available for
distribution.
We currently derive all of our revenues from two customers, and the loss of either of these customers or a dispute that leads
to a loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.
Any limitation in the availability or operation of any of our three drilling rigs could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition and could significantly reduce our ability to make distributions to our
unitholders.
Our revenues will initially be derived from assets that are operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, making us vulnerable to risks
associated with operating in that single geographic area.
We may be unable to renew or obtain new and favorable drilling contracts for rigs whose contracts are expiring or are
terminated, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us
Transocean and its affiliates may compete with us, and we are limited in our ability to compete with Transocean. In
addition, we generally will agree not to acquire, own operate or contract for certain drilling rigs operating under drilling
contracts of less than five years. Relatively few drilling contracts have a term of five years or greater, particularly in the case
of contracts that are not associated with newbuild units. As a result, we expect that Transocean will effectively have a right
of first refusal on most drilling contract opportunities.
The Transocean Member and its other affiliates own a controlling interest in us and have conflicts of interest and limited
duties to us and our common unitholders, and the Transocean Member and its other affiliates may favor their own interests
to the detriment of us and our other common unitholders.
•
•
Table of Contents
6
•
Our limited liability company agreement limits the duties that the Transocean Member and our directors and officers may
have to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by the Transocean Member or
our directors and officers.
•
Holders of our common units have limited voting rights.
•
There is no existing market for our common units, and a trading market that will provide you with adequate liquidity may not
develop. The price of our common units may fluctuate significantly, and unitholders could lose all or part of their investment
in us.
Tax Risks
•
•
A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we have operations, are
incorporated or are resident could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could result in a significant
negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.
A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the
taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings,
reducing our cash available for distribution to you.
Formation Transactions
We were formed on February 6, 2014 as a Marshall Islands limited liability company to own and operate a fleet of offshore drilling
rigs.
At or prior to the closing of this offering, the following transactions will occur:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
subsidiaries of Transocean that own Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III will sell
each of these rigs to the Transocean Member in exchange for cash and/or a note;
the Transocean Member will contribute each of Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III
to its wholly owned holding company subsidiaries, which will further contribute each rig to the respective rig-owning
company for that rig, each of which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Transocean Member;
the Transocean Member will contribute or sell to us a 51 percent ownership interest in each of the holding companies that
own the RigCos;
we will issue (a) to the Transocean Member (i) 41,379,310 common units and 27,586,207 subordinated units, representing
a 60 percent and a 40 percent limited liability company interest in us, (ii) the non-economic Transocean Member interest,
and (iii) all of the incentive distribution rights, which entitle the Transocean Member to increasing percentages of the cash
that we distribute in excess of $0.416875 per unit per quarter, and (b) to an affiliate of Transocean a 364-day note payable
of approximately $43 million for cash proceeds of $43 million, all or a portion of which we will pay to the Transocean
Member for our pro rata share of certain working capital balances;
a subsidiary of Transocean will sell to the holding company subsidiaries a 100 percent ownership interest in the respective
rig-operating companies that operate and hold the drilling contracts for Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and
Development Driller III in exchange for cash and/or a note;
the Transocean Member will sell 17,500,000 common units to the public, representing a 25.4 percent limited liability
company interest in us;
the Transocean Member will grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,625,000 common
units on the same terms and conditions as the 17,500,000 common units sold to the public;

we will enter into the omnibus agreement with Transocean and the Transocean Member;
we will enter into master services agreements with Transocean;
we will enter into support and secondment agreements with Transocean; and
we will enter into a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility, or the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, with an affiliate
of Transocean.
Holding Company Structure
We are a holding company, and our subsidiaries will conduct our operations and business, as is common for publicly traded limited
liability companies. Initially, the RigCos will conduct all of our operations. Separate RigCos will own and operate each of the drilling
rigs in our initial fleet. This ownership structure provides us the flexibility to purchase additional interests in individual drilling rigs
rather than interests in our entire fleet, if we believe that is the appropriate way to grow our business.

Our limited liability company agreement provides that our board of directors has authority to oversee and direct our operations,
management and policies on an exclusive basis. Our executive officers will manage our day-to-day activities consistent with the
policies and procedures adopted by our board of directors. We currently do not employ any of our executive officers and rely on
Transocean to provide us with personnel who will perform executive officer services for our benefit pursuant to agreements with
Transocean and who will be responsible for our day-to-day management subject to the direction of our board of directors. All
references in this prospectus to “our officers” include those personnel of Transocean or its affiliates who perform executive officer
functions for our benefit.
We will reimburse Transocean and its affiliates for their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with providing
management, administrative, financial and other support services to us. In addition, we will pay Transocean a services fee for
providing these services to us. We expect that we will pay approximately $39 million in total under the master services agreements
and the support and secondment agreements for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015. There is no cap on the amount of
fees and cost reimbursements that we may be required to pay pursuant to these agreements. For a more detailed description of these
agreements, please read “Management—Directors and Executive Officers” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions.”
Principal Executive Offices and Internet Address
Our registered and principal executive offices are located at Deepwater House, Kingswells Causeway, Prime Four Business Park,
Aberdeen, AB15 8PU, Scotland, United Kingdom, and our phone number is +44 1224 945 100. Following the completion of this
offering, our website will be located at www.transoceanpartners.com. We expect to make our periodic reports and other information
filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, available, free of charge, through our website as
soon as reasonably practicable after those reports and other information are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
Information on our website or any other website is not incorporated by reference into this prospectus and does not constitute a part of
this prospectus.
Summary of Conflicts of Interest and Duties
Our directors have a legal duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us, subject to the limitations described under “Conflicts of
Interest and Duties.” However, several of our directors and all of our officers hold positions with Transocean or its affiliates, resulting
in those persons owing legal duties to those entities. As a result of these relationships, conflicts of interest may arise between us and
our unaffiliated members on the one hand, and Transocean and its affiliates, including the Transocean Member, on the other hand.
The resolution of these conflicts may not be in the best interest of us or our unitholders. In particular:
all of our current executive officers and directors also serve as executive officers or directors of Transocean or its affiliates;
Transocean and its other affiliates may compete with us, subject to the restrictions contained in the omnibus agreement;
we will be restricted in our ability to compete with Transocean, subject to the exceptions contained in the omnibus
agreement; and
we have entered into arrangements, and may enter into additional arrangements, with Transocean and certain of its
subsidiaries, relating to the purchase of interests in drilling rigs, the provision of certain services to us by Transocean and
other matters. In the performance of their obligations under these agreements, Transocean and its subsidiaries are
generally held to the standard of care specified in these agreements.

Table of Contents
For a more detailed description of our management structure, please read “Management—Directors and Executive Officers” and
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”
Although a majority of our directors will be elected by common unitholders, Transocean will likely have substantial influence on
decisions made by our board of directors due to its ability to appoint certain of our directors and its significant ownership of our units.
Our board of directors will have a conflicts committee composed of independent directors. Our board may, but is not obligated to, seek
approval of the conflicts committee for resolutions of conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the relationships between the
Transocean Member and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us and our unaffiliated members, on the other.
For a more detailed description of the conflicts of interest and duties of our directors and officers, please read “Conflicts of Interest and
Duties.” For a description of our other relationships with our affiliates, please read “Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions.”
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
As a company with less than $1 billion in revenues during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as
defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may, for up to five
years, take advantage of specified exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are otherwise applicable
generally to public companies. These exemptions include:
•
•
•
•
the presentation of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the registration statement of an initial public offering of
common equity securities;
exemption from the auditor attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls over financial
reporting;
delayed adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards; and
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which will occur on the earliest of
(1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more
than $1 billion in annual revenues, (3) last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $700 million in market value of our
common units held by non-affiliates as of the end of our fiscal second quarter or (4) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion of
non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
We have elected to take advantage of all of the applicable JOBS Act provisions, including the exemption that allows emerging growth
companies to extend the transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. This election to take
advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable.
Accordingly, the information that we provide you may be different than what you may receive from other public companies in which
you hold equity interests.

Common units offered to the public by the selling unitholder
Units outstanding after this offering
Use of proceeds
Cash distributions
17,500,000 common units.
20,125,000 common units if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional common units in full.
41,379,310 common units and 27,586,207 subordinated units,
representing a 60 percent and 40 percent limited liability
company interest in us, respectively.
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common
units by the selling unitholder in this offering. See “Use of
Proceeds.”
We intend to make minimum quarterly distributions of
$0.3625 per common unit ($1.45 per unit on an annualized
basis) to the extent we have sufficient cash from operations
after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and
expenses, including payments to Transocean. We refer to this
cash as “available cash,” and we define its meaning in our
limited liability company agreement and in the glossary of
terms attached as Appendix B.
Table of Contents
12
We will adjust the minimum quarterly distribution for the period
from the closing of the offering through September 30, 2014
based on the actual length of the period.
In general, we will pay any cash distributions we make each
quarter in the following manner:
•       first, to the holders of common units, pro rata, until each
common unit has received a minimum quarterly distribution of
$0.3625 plus any arrearages from prior quarters;
•       second, to the holders of subordinated units, pro rata, until
each subordinated unit has received a minimum quarterly
distribution of $0.3625; and
•       third, to all unitholders, pro rata, until each unit has
received an aggregate distribution of $0.416875.
Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter (beginning
with the quarter ending September 30, 2014), we will distribute
all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the
applicable record date. Our ability to pay our minimum
quarterly distribution is subject to various restrictions and other
factors described in more detail under the caption “Our Cash
Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions.”
If cash distributions to our unitholders exceed $0.416875 per
unit in a quarter, holders of our incentive distribution rights
(initially, the Transocean Member)
will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the
cash we distribute in excess of that amount; provided that for
any fiscal quarter in which the application of our distribution
formula would result in the holders of the common units
receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the
aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter, then
the distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution rights
will be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the
aggregate distribution to the holders of the common units to
represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available
cash for such quarter. We refer to these distributions as
“incentive distributions.” The amount of available cash may be
greater than or less than the aggregate amount of the minimum
quarterly distribution to be distributed on all units.
We believe, based on the estimates contained in and the
assumptions listed under “Our Cash Distribution Policy and
Restrictions on Distributions—Estimated Cash Available for
Distribution for the Twelve Months Ending September 30,
2015,” that we will have sufficient cash available for
distribution to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly
distribution of $0.3625 on all of our common and subordinated
units for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015.
However, unanticipated events may occur which could
adversely affect the actual results we achieve during the
forecast period. Consequently, our actual results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition during the forecast period
may vary from the forecast, and such variations may be
material.
Transocean will initially own all of our subordinated units. The
principal difference between our common units and
subordinated units is that in any quarter during the
subordination period the subordinated units are entitled to
receive the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit
only after the common units have received the minimum
quarterly distribution and arrearages in the payment of the
minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters.
Subordinated units will not accrue arrearages.
The subordination period generally will end if we have earned
and paid at least $1.45 (the minimum quarterly distribution on
an annualized basis) on each outstanding common and
subordinated unit for any three consecutive, non-overlapping
four-quarter periods ending on or after June 30, 2019, provided
there are no arrearages on our common units at that time.
The subordination period also will end upon the removal of the
Transocean Member other than for cause if no subordinated
units or common units held by the Transocean Member or its
affiliates are voted in favor of that removal.
When the subordination period ends as provided above, all
subordinated units will convert into common units on a one-for-
one basis, and all common units will no longer be entitled to
arrearages.
Please read “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company
Agreement Relating to Cash Distributions—Subordination
Period.”
We can issue an unlimited number of additional units,
including units that are senior to the common units in rights of
distribution, liquidation and voting, on the terms and conditions
determined by our board of directors, without the consent of
our unitholders. Please read “Units Eligible for Future Sale”
and “The Limited Liability Company Agreement—Issuance of
Additional Interests.”
We will hold a meeting of the members every year to elect one
or more members of our board of directors and to vote on any
other matters that are properly brought before the meeting.
Prior to the closing of this offering, the Transocean Member, in

its capacity as the initial holder of the common units, will elect
three of the seven members of our board of directors who will
serve as initial directors, and such elected directors may elect
an additional elected director. Prior to the 2015 annual
meeting, the Transocean Member may also appoint additional
directors to fill the appointed director positions, provided that
the number of elected directors must, immediately after such
appointment, exceed the number of appointed directors. At our
2015 annual meeting, the common unitholders will elect four of
our directors. The four directors elected by our common
unitholders at our 2015 annual meeting initially will serve for
one-year terms. Upon the election by the Transocean Member
to classify our board of directors, the four directors
elected by our common unitholders will be divided into three
classes to be elected by our common unitholders on a
staggered basis to serve for three-year terms. Transocean may
vote any common units held by it in the election of directors;
however, subordinated units will not be voted in the election of
directors. Our governance documents require that, at all times,
at least a majority of the members of our board of directors be
United Kingdom (“U.K.”) tax residents.
Each outstanding common unit is entitled to one vote on
matters subject to a vote of common unitholders.
You will have no right to elect the Transocean Member on an
annual or other continuing basis. The Transocean Member
may not be removed except by a vote of the holders of at least
66 2⁄3 percent of the outstanding units, including any units
owned by the Transocean Member and its affiliates, voting
together as a single class. Upon consummation of this offering,
Transocean will own 23,879,310 of our common units and all
of our subordinated units, representing a 74.6 percent limited
liability company interest in us. If the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional common units is exercised in full,
Transocean will own 21,254,310 of our common units and all
of our subordinated units, representing a 70.8 percent limited
liability company interest in us. As a result, you will initially be
unable to remove the Transocean Member without
Transocean’s consent because Transocean will own sufficient
units upon completion of this offering to be able to prevent the
Transocean Member’s removal. Please read “The Limited
Liability Agreement—Voting Rights.”
If at any time the Transocean Member and its affiliates own
more than 80 percent of the outstanding common units, the
Transocean Member has the right, but not the obligation, to
purchase all, but not less than all, of the remaining common
units at a price equal to the greater of (x) the average of the
daily closing prices of the common units over the 20 trading
days preceding the date three days before the notice of
exercise of the call right is first mailed and (y) the highest price
paid by the Transocean Member or any of its affiliates for
common units during the 90-day period preceding the date
such notice is first mailed. The Transocean Member may
assign this right to its affiliates, including us. The Transocean
Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion, nor will
the unitholders be entitled to dissenter’s rights of appraisal,
regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by
the Transocean Member upon the exercise of this limited call
right.

We are organized as a limited liability company that is treated
as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Consequently, distributions you receive from us will constitute
dividends to the extent of our current-year or accumulated
earnings and profits (as computed for U.S. federal income tax
purposes). The remaining portion of such distributions will be
treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of
your tax basis in your common units and thereafter as capital
gain. We estimate that if you hold the common units that you
purchase in this offering through the period ending December
31, 2016, the distributions you receive, on a cumulative basis,
that will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax
purposes will be less than 20 percent of the total cash
distributions received during that period. Please read “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Holders—
Ratio of Dividend Income to Distributions” for the basis for this
estimate. For a discussion of other material U.S. federal
income tax consequences that may be relevant to prospective
unitholders, please read “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations.”
For a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and U.K. tax
consequences that may be relevant to prospective unitholders,
please read “Non-United States Tax Considerations.”
Our common units have been approved for listing, subject to
official notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol “RIGP.”

SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA
The following table presents, in each case for the periods and as of the dates indicated, summary historical financial and operating
data of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor, which includes the operating results, assets and liabilities of the drilling rigs in our
initial fleet. The summary historical financial data of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012 are derived from the audited combined financial statements of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor,
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. The summary historical financial data of
Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor as of March 31, 2014 and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 are derived
from the unaudited condensed combined financial statements of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor, prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, which are included elsewhere in this prospectus.
The following financial data should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,” the historical combined financial statements of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor and the notes thereto,
our unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet and the notes thereto and our forecasted results of operations for the twelve months
ending September 30, 2015, in each case included elsewhere in this prospectus.
Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could differ from those that would have resulted if we operated
autonomously or as an entity independent of Transocean in the periods for which historical financial data are presented below, and
such data may not be indicative of our future operating results or financial performance.

(1) Represents cash used to fund capital expenditures.
(2) An operating day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period
after commencement of operations.
(3) Average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenues earned per operating day. Our average daily revenue fluctuates
relative to market conditions and our revenue efficiency. Average daily revenues increased in the three months ended March 31,
2014 relative to the three months ended March 31, 2013 due to an increase in revenue efficiency resulting from lower unplanned
downtime and an increase in operating dayrates associated with cost escalation adjustments that reflect increases in our
operating costs. Average daily revenues decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 relative to the year ended
December 31, 2012 due to a decrease in revenue efficiency resulting from unplanned downtime. This decrease was slightly
offset by an increase in operating dayrates associated with cost escalation adjustments that reflect increases in our operating
costs.
(4) Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by the maximum revenue
calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest amount of
contract drilling revenues the drilling unit could earn for the measurement period, excluding amounts related to incentive
provisions. Our revenue efficiency rate varies due to revenues earned under alternative contractual dayrates, such as a waiting-
on-weather rate, repair rate, standby rate, force majeure rate or zero rate, that may apply under certain circumstances. Revenue
efficiency increased in the three months ended March 31, 2014 relative to the three months ended March 31, 2013 resulting from
lower unplanned downtime associated primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea equipment. Revenue
efficiency was lower in the year ended December 31, 2013 relative to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to unplanned
downtime associated primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea equipment.
(5) Rig utilization is defined as the total number of operating days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the
measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Our rig utilization rate declines as a result of idle and stacked rigs and during
shipyard and mobilization periods to the extent these rigs are not earning revenues.
(6) Please read “—Non-GAAP Measures” described below for a description and a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
Non-GAAP Measures
We present our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that certain financial measures which are not in
conformity with U.S. GAAP, or non-GAAP measures, provide users of our financial statements with additional useful information in
evaluating our operating performance. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense net of interest income, taxes,
depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for amortization of prior certification costs and license fees,
non-cash recognition of royalty fees, amortization of the drilling contract intangible and amortization of pre-operating revenues.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as supplemental financial measures by which management and external users of our
financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, can assess:
our performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to
financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;
the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our members;
our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment
opportunities.

We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus provides information useful to investors in
assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA is net income. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating
income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and these measures may vary among
other companies. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented above, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
of other companies.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated.

RISK FACTORS
Common units are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are
subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business. You should carefully consider the
following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this prospectus in evaluating an investment in our common
units.
If any of the following risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
materially adversely affected. In that case, we might not be able to make distributions on our common units, the trading price of our
common units could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in us.
Risks Inherent in Our Business
We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and
expenses to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our common units and subordinated units.
We may not have sufficient cash from operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit, or $1.45 per unit on an
annualized basis, on our common units and subordinated units, which will require us to have available cash of approximately
$25.0 million per quarter, or $100.0 million per year, based on the number of common and subordinated units to be outstanding after
the completion of this offering. We may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly
distribution. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our
operations, which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the risks described in this section, including, among other things:
•
our ability to re-contract our drilling rigs in their current configuration upon expiration or termination of an existing drilling
contract and the dayrates we obtain under such contracts;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the dayrates we obtain under our drilling contracts;
the level of reimbursable revenues and expenses;
the level of our rig operating costs, such as the cost of crews, repairs, maintenance and insurance;
the effect of governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards on the conduct of our business;
rig downtime or less than full utilization, which would result in a reduction of revenues under our drilling contracts;
changes in local income tax rates, tax treaties and tax laws;
the timeliness of payments from customers under drilling contracts;
time spent mobilizing drilling rigs to the customer location;
resolution of tax assessments;
currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; and
prevailing global economic and market conditions.
In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond
our control, including:
•
the level and timing of capital expenditures we make;
20
Table of Contents
the level of our operating, maintenance and rig and shore-based general and administrative expenses, including
reimbursements to the Transocean Member and its affiliates for services provided to us and additional expenses we will
incur as a result of being a public company;
our debt service requirements and other liabilities;
fluctuations in our working capital needs;
the cost of acquisitions, if any;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;
restrictions on distributions contained in our debt agreements; and
the amount of cash reserves, including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working
capital and other matters, established by our board of directors.
For a description of additional restrictions and factors that may affect our ability to make cash distributions, please read “Our Cash
Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions.”
The assumptions underlying our forecast of cash available for distribution are inherently uncertain and are subject to risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasted.
The forecast of cash available for distribution set forth in “Our Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions” includes our
forecast of operating results and cash flows for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015. Our ability to pay the full minimum
quarterly distribution in the forecast period is based on a number of assumptions that may not prove to be correct, which are
discussed in “Our Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions.”
Our financial forecast has been prepared by management, and we have neither received nor requested an opinion or report on it from
our or any other independent auditor. The assumptions underlying the forecast are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant
business, economic, regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
forecasted. If we do not achieve the forecasted results, we may be unable to pay the full minimum quarterly distribution or any amount
on our common units or subordinated units, in which event the market price of our common units may decline materially.
The amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common and subordinated units depends primarily
on our cash flow rather than on our profitability, which may prevent us from making distributions, even during periods in
which we record net income.
The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow rather than on profitability, which will be
affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses for financial
accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting
purposes.
Our ability to grow may be adversely affected by our cash distribution policy.
Our cash distribution policy, which is consistent with our limited liability company agreement, requires us to distribute all of our
available cash each quarter. In determining the amount of available cash each quarter, our board of directors will approve the amount
of cash reserves to set aside, including reserves for anticipated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working capital
and other matters. We will also rely upon external financing sources, including commercial borrowings, to fund our capital
expenditures. To the extent we do not have sufficient cash reserves or are unable to obtain financing, our cash distribution policy may
Table of Contents
21
significantly impair our ability to meet our financial needs or to grow. Accordingly, our growth may not be as fast as businesses that
reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.
We must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet, and we may be
required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitiveness and to comply with laws and the
applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations, or to execute our growth plan, each of
which could negatively affect our financial condition, result of operations and cash flows and reduce cash available for
distribution. In addition, each quarter we are required to deduct estimated maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures from operating surplus, which may result in less cash available to unitholders than if actual maintenance and
replacement capital expenditures were deducted.
We must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain and replace, over the long-term, the operating capacity of
our fleet. We estimate that maintenance and replacement capital expenditures will average approximately $69 million per year,
including amounts for replacing current drilling rigs at the end of their useful lives. Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures
include capital expenditures for maintenance (including special classification surveys) and capital expenditures associated with
modifying an existing drilling rig, including to upgrade its technology, extending the useful life of existing drilling rigs, acquiring a new
drilling rig or otherwise replacing current drilling rigs at the end of their useful lives to the extent these expenditures are incurred to
maintain or replace the operating capacity of our fleet. These expenditures could vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and from
year to year, and could increase as a result of changes in the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the cost of labor and materials;
customer requirements;
fleet size;
the cost of replacement drilling rigs;
the cost of replacement parts for existing drilling rigs;
the geographic location of the drilling rigs;
length of drilling contracts;
governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization and technical standards relating to safety, security or
the environment;
compliance with Transocean’s consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, or Consent Decree, Transocean’s
administrative agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA Agreement, and other governmental
agreements; and
•
industry standards.
Changes in offshore drilling technology, customer requirements for new or upgraded equipment and competition within our industry
may require us to make significant capital expenditures in order to maintain our competitiveness. Our competitors may have greater
financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to make technological improvements to existing equipment or
replace equipment that becomes obsolete. In addition, changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards, as
well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, may require us to make additional unforeseen
capital expenditures. As a result, we may be required to take our rigs out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding
losses of revenues, in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment. In the future, market conditions may not justify these
expenditures or enable us to operate our older rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic lives.
Table of Contents
22
Our limited liability company agreement requires our board of directors to deduct estimated maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures, instead of actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, from operating surplus each quarter in an effort to
reduce fluctuations in operating surplus as a result of variations in actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures each
quarter. The amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to
review and change by our conflicts committee at least once a year. In years when estimated maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures are higher than actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, the amount of available cash will be lower
than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted from operating surplus. If our board of directors
underestimates the appropriate level of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, we may have less available
cash in future periods when actual capital expenditures exceed our previous estimates.
If capital expenditures are financed through cash from operations or by issuing debt or equity securities, our ability to make
cash distributions may be diminished, our financial leverage could increase or our unitholders could be diluted.
In order to maintain our fleet and execute our growth plan, we may require additional capital in the future. If we are unable to fund
capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, we may be required to either incur additional borrowings or raise capital through
the sale of debt or equity securities. Our ability to access the capital markets for future offerings may be limited by our financial
condition at the time, by changes in laws and regulations (or interpretation thereof) and by adverse market conditions resulting from,
among other things, general economic conditions, changes in the offshore drilling industry and contingencies and uncertainties that
are beyond our control. Failure to obtain the funds for future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition and on our ability to make cash distributions. Even if we are successful in
obtaining necessary funds, the terms of any debt financings could limit our ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. In addition,
incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional equity
securities may result in significant unitholder dilution and would increase the aggregate amount of cash required to pay the minimum
quarterly distribution to unitholders, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make cash distributions.
We currently derive all our revenues from two customers, and the loss of either of these customers or a dispute that leads to
a loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We currently derive all of our revenues and cash flow from two customers. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Chevron
accounted for 67 percent and BP accounted for 33 percent of our total revenues, respectively. All of our drilling contracts have fixed
terms, but may be terminated early due to certain events or might nevertheless be lost in the event of unanticipated developments,
such as the deterioration in the general business or financial condition of a customer, resulting in its inability to meet its obligations
under our contracts. Transocean’s relationship with BP, whose affiliate was the operator of the Macondo well, has been and could
continue to be negatively impacted by the Macondo well incident. The loss of any customers, drilling contracts or drilling rigs, or a
decline in payments under any of our drilling contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows and could reduce our cash available for distribution.
In addition, our drilling contracts subject us to counterparty risks. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations
under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general
economic conditions, the condition of the offshore drilling industry, prevailing prices for oil and natural gas, the overall financial
condition of the counterparty, the dayrates received and the level of expenses necessary to maintain drilling activities. In addition, in
depressed market conditions, our customers may no longer need a drilling rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain
a comparable drilling rig at a lower dayrate. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under an
Table of Contents
23
agreement with us, we could sustain losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash available for distribution.
Any limitation in the availability or operation of any of our three drilling rigs could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition and could significantly reduce our ability to make distributions to our
unitholders.
Our fleet currently consists of two drillships and one semi-submersible drilling rig. Our limited number of rigs makes us more
susceptible to incremental loss in the event of any downtime with respect to any rig. If any of our drilling rigs is unable to generate
revenues as a result of sustained periods of downtime or the expiration or termination of its drilling contracts, and we are unable to
recontract such rig, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected and our cash
available for distribution could be reduced.
Our revenues will initially be derived from assets that are operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, making us vulnerable to risks
associated with operating in that single geographic area.
Currently, all of our operations are conducted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This concentration could disproportionately expose us to
operational and regulatory risk or other adverse developments in this area, including, for example, delays or decreases in the
availability of equipment, facilities or services, severe weather, including tropical storms and hurricanes, and changes in the
regulatory environment, including a complete moratorium on drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These factors could have a
significantly greater impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows than if our operations were more
diversified. Because our fleet is mobile, we may have similar concentration risk in other geographic locations in the future.
We may be unable to renew or obtain new and favorable drilling contracts for rigs whose contracts are expiring or are
terminated, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
Our ability to renew expiring drilling contracts or obtain new drilling contracts will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the
time. If we are unable to obtain new drilling contracts, if new drilling contracts are entered into at dayrates substantially below the
existing dayrates or on terms otherwise less favorable compared to existing contract terms or if our customers request modifications of
our drilling rigs in connection with new drilling contracts, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.
The offshore drilling market in which we compete experiences fluctuations in the demand for drilling services, as measured by the
level of exploration and development expenditures. The existing drilling contracts for our drilling rigs are scheduled to expire from
2016 through 2020. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain drilling contracts for our rigs upon the completion or
termination of their current contracts or that there will not be a gap in employment of the rigs between current contracts and
subsequent contracts. In particular, if oil and natural gas prices are low, or it is expected that such prices will decrease in the future, at
a time when we are seeking to arrange drilling contracts for our rigs, we may be unable to obtain drilling contracts at attractive
dayrates or at all. In addition, our customers may require modifications to our drilling rigs in connection with a new drilling contract
and, depending on the market conditions at the time we enter into the contract, we may not be reimbursed for some or all of such
modifications.
If the dayrates which we receive for the reemployment of our current drilling rigs are less favorable, we will recognize less revenue
from their operations. Our ability to meet our cash flow obligations will depend on our ability to consistently secure drilling contracts for
our drilling rigs at sufficiently high dayrates. We cannot predict the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil
and gas industry. If oil and gas companies do not continue to increase exploration, development and production expenditures, we
may have difficulty securing drilling contracts, or we may be forced to enter into contracts at unattractive dayrates, which would
adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.

If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from Transocean or third parties, our future growth
would be limited, and any acquisitions we may make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash flows and ability to make
distributions to unitholders.
Our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders is dependent in part on our ability to make acquisitions that
result in an increase in cash available for distribution per unit. Our growth strategy is based in part on our right of first offer from
Transocean’s obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase four specified drilling rigs or other acquisitions that we expect to make
from Transocean. There can be no assurance that such acquisitions will be available to us on an accretive basis, on acceptable terms
or at all. Other than this obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase these four drilling rigs, Transocean has no obligation to make
any acquisitions available to us. The consummation and timing of any future acquisitions will depend upon, among other things,
whether:
•
•
•
•
we are able to identify attractive acquisition candidates;
we are able to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements;
we are able to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; and
we are outbid by competitors.
We can offer no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate any future acquisitions, whether from Transocean or any
third parties. Any acquisitions that may be available to us may require that we be able to access the debt and equity markets.
However, we may be unable to access such markets on attractive terms or at all. If we are unable to make future acquisitions, our
future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited. Furthermore, even if we do consummate acquisitions that we believe
will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in cash available for distribution per unit as a result of incorrect assumptions in
our evaluation of such acquisitions or unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. Acquisitions involve
numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, inefficiencies and unexpected costs and liabilities.
The continuing effects of the enhanced regulations enacted following the Macondo well incident, the Consent Decree and
the EPA Agreement could materially and adversely affect our operations.
New governmental safety and environmental requirements applicable to both deepwater and shallow water operations have been
adopted for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico following the Macondo well incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010. In order to obtain
drilling permits, operators must submit applications that demonstrate compliance with the enhanced regulations, which require
independent third-party inspections, certification of well design and well control equipment and emergency response plans in the
event of a blowout, among other requirements. Operators have previously had, and may in the future have, difficulties obtaining
drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the oil and gas industry has adopted new equipment and operating standards,
such as the American Petroleum Institute Standard 53 relating to the installation and testing of well control equipment. These new
safety and environmental guidelines and standards and any further new guidelines or standards the U.S. government or industry may
issue or any other steps the U.S. government or industry may take, could disrupt or delay operations, increase the cost of operations,
increase out-of-service time or reduce the area of operations for drilling rigs in U.S. and non-U.S. offshore areas.
Other governments could take similar actions relating to implementing new safety and environmental regulations in the future.
Additionally, some of our customers have elected or may elect to voluntarily comply with some or all of the new inspections,
certification requirements and safety and environmental guidelines on rigs operating outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Additional
governmental regulations and requirements concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications and training requirements or the
voluntary adoption of such requirements or guidelines by our customers could increase the costs of our operations, increase
certification and permitting requirements, increase review periods and impose increased liability on offshore operations.

Because we are an affiliate of Transocean, our operations in the waters of the United States are subject to the safety, environmental,
reporting, operational and other requirements of the Consent Decree and the EPA Agreement. These requirements are in addition to
the regulations applicable to all industry participants and may add additional costs and liabilities and may adversely affect our
customers’ perception of us and may place us at a competitive disadvantage to other offshore drillers.
Pursuant to the Consent Decree, Transocean agreed to take specified actions relating to operations in U.S. waters, including, among
other things, the design and implementation of, and compliance with, additional systems and procedures; blowout preventer
certification and reports; measures to strengthen well control competencies, drilling monitoring, recordkeeping, incident reporting, risk
management and oil spill training, exercises and response planning; communication with operators; alarm systems; transparency and
responsibility for matters relating to the Consent Decree; and technology innovation, with a first emphasis on more efficient, reliable
blowout preventers. The Consent Decree provides for independent auditors for compliance with the Consent Decree and an
independent process safety consultant and requires certain plans, reports and submissions be made and be acceptable to the U.S.
and also requires certain publicly available filings.
In the EPA Agreement, Transocean agreed to, among other things, continue the implementation of certain programs and systems;
comply with certain employment and contracting procedures; engage independent compliance auditors and a process safety
consultant; and give reports and notices with respect to various matters.
The continuing effects of the enhanced regulations may also decrease the demand for drilling services, negatively affect dayrates and
increase out-of-service time, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. We are unable to
predict the full impact that the continuing effects of the enhanced regulations will have on our operations.
In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the EPA Agreement prohibits us from entering into, extending or engaging in certain
business relationships with individuals or entities that are debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or similarly restricted in the
United States. The loss of any of our customers due to such restrictions could, at least in the short term, have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our growth and our business depend on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in
offshore areas.
Our growth and our business depend on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in offshore areas.
Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in
oil and natural gas prices.
Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including the following:
•
•
•
worldwide demand for oil and gas, including economic activity in the U.S. and other large energy-consuming markets;
the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain production levels,
productive spare capacity and pricing;
the level of production in non-OPEC countries;
•
•
•
•
the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;
advances in exploration, development and production technology;
the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;
the rate of decline of existing oil and gas reserves;
26
Table of Contents
•
•
•
•
•
laws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks
of global climate change;
the development and exploitation of alternative fuels;
the development of new technology to exploit oil and gas reserves, such as shale oil;
accidents, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other similar incidents relating to the oil and gas industry; and
the worldwide security and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak
of armed hostilities, civil unrest or other crises in the Middle East or Eastern Europe or other geographic areas or acts of
terrorism.
Demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the
corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. Any prolonged reduction in oil
and natural gas prices could depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity. Perceptions of longer-
term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term
nature of many large-scale development projects. Lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our
services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Oil and gas prices and market expectations of
potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher near-term commodity prices do not
necessarily translate into increased drilling activity since customers’ expectations of longer-term future commodity prices typically
drive demand for our rigs. Also, increased competition for customers’ drilling budgets could come from, among other areas, offshore
areas where we do not currently operate and land-based energy markets in Africa, Russia, China, the Middle East, the U.S. and
elsewhere. The availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, the stage of reservoir
development and political and regulatory environments also affect customers’ drilling campaigns. Worldwide military, political and
economic events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future.
Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized, which may have a material adverse impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and will reduce cash available for distributions.
Our contract backlog represents the firm term of the drilling contract multiplied by the maximum contractual operating rate, which may
be higher than the actual dayrate we receive or we may receive other dayrates included in the contract such as waiting-on-weather
rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate. The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we
receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations.
Several factors could cause rig downtime or a suspension of operations, including:
•
breakdowns of equipment and other unforeseen engineering problems;
•
•
•
•
•
•
work stoppages, including labor strikes;
shortages of material and skilled labor;
surveys by government and maritime authorities;
periodic classification surveys;
severe weather, strong ocean currents or harsh operating conditions; and
force majeure events.
In certain drilling contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero or result in customer credit against future dayrate if, for example,
repairs extend beyond a stated period of time. Our contract backlog currently includes
Table of Contents
27
signed drilling contracts, although, in some cases, we may include contracts represented by other definitive agreements awaiting
contract execution. We may be unable to realize the full amount of our contract backlog due to events beyond our control. Our
customers could experience liquidity issues if commodity prices decline to lower levels for an extended period of time. Liquidity
issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate
these agreements for various reasons, as described under “Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events”
below. Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows and could reduce our cash available for distribution.
Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events.
Drilling contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment.
Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Drilling contracts also customarily provide for either
automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various
circumstances such as non-performance, as a result of significant downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or
operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events. Many of these events are beyond our control.
During periods of depressed market conditions, we are subject to an increased risk of our customers seeking to repudiate their
contracts, including through claims of non-performance. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under their drilling
contracts, including their ability to fulfill their indemnity obligations to us, may also be negatively impacted by an economic downturn.
Our customers often have significant bargaining leverage over us. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable
to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of
time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows and reduce our cash available for distribution. For more information regarding the termination provisions of our drilling contracts,
please read “Business—Drilling Contracts.”
Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and paying distributions to unitholders, and we may
suffer competitive disadvantages.
Upon completion of this offering and the related transactions, we estimate that our consolidated debt (including indebtedness incurred
by the RigCos) will be approximately $43 million. Following this offering, we will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt.
Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources.” Our level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences for our business and future
prospects, including the following:
•
we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, debt service requirements, distributions or other purposes;
we may not be able to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to make distributions because we must
dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt;
we could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest
rates, particularly if we have substantial indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;
we may not be able to meet financial ratios or satisfy certain other conditions included in our credit facilities, which could
result in our inability to meet requirements for borrowings under our credit facilities or a default under our credit facilities
and trigger cross default provisions in our other debt instruments; and
we may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry
conditions than our less levered competitors.

We may require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and other obligations. Our ability to generate cash
depends on many factors beyond our control.
Our ability to make payments on, or refinance, our indebtedness and to fund our working capital needs and planned capital
expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. A significant reduction in our operating cash flows, including as
a result of changes in general economic conditions, timing of contracts or payments, expiration or termination of drilling contracts,
legislative or regulatory conditions, increased competition or other events beyond our control, could increase the need for additional
or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and ability to service our debt and other obligations.
If we are unable to service our indebtedness or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may
include actions such as reducing capital expenditures, reducing distributions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing
indebtedness, seeking additional capital or any combination of the foregoing. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity
securities, existing unitholders may experience dilution. We cannot assure you that any of these alternative strategies could be
affected on satisfactory terms, or at all, or that they would yield sufficient funds to enable us to make required payments on our
indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Reducing or delaying capital expenditures or selling assets could delay future cash
flows. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives.
Our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could significantly adversely affect the
value of our common units. In addition, if we default in the payment of amounts due on any indebtedness, such default would give rise
to an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness and could lead to the possible acceleration of amounts due
under any of our outstanding indebtedness. In the event of any acceleration, we may not have enough cash to repay our outstanding
indebtedness.
Financing agreements, including Transocean’s financing agreements, containing operating and financial restrictions and
other covenants may restrict our business and financing activities.
The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our financing agreements and those of Transocean and any future financing
agreements of Transocean or us could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand
or pursue our business activities. We will be required to comply with the terms of Transocean’s agreements regarding indebtedness
and have agreed to take no actions that would cause Transocean not to be in compliance with such agreements. For example, the
indentures governing Transocean’s outstanding senior notes may restrict our ability to create or permit liens on our assets.
Transocean may incur liens solely for reasons relating to its business that does not affect or benefit us, and it will have no obligation
to take into account the effect of the creation of such liens on us. As such, our ability to incur secured indebtedness will depend in part
on Transocean’s financial condition, capital needs and plans. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the financing agreements may
restrict our ability to:
•
•
pay distributions to our unitholders;
enter into other financing agreements;
•
•
•
•
•
•
incur additional indebtedness;
create or permit liens on our assets;
sell our drilling rigs or the capital stock of our subsidiaries;
change the nature of our business;
make investments;
change the management and/or ownership of our drilling rigs;
29
Table of Contents
•
•
make capital expenditures; and
compete effectively to the extent our competitors are subject to less onerous restrictions.
Transocean may enter into agreements in the future with different or additional restrictions and covenants that will apply to us.
Our ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants, including financial ratios and tests, contained in any financing agreements of
Transocean or us, is dependent on our and/or Transocean’s future performance and may be affected by events beyond our control,
including actions by Transocean and prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions
deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants
in the agreements governing our indebtedness or in current or future debt financing agreements, there could be a default under the
terms of those agreements. If a default occurs under these agreements, lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or
accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Please read “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Restrictions in our debt agreements may prevent us from paying distributions.
The payment of principal and interest on our debt will reduce our cash available for distribution. In addition, our financing agreements
are expected to contain provisions that, upon the occurrence of certain events, permit lenders to terminate their commitments and/or
accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts due and payable, which may prevent us from paying distributions to our
unitholders. These events may include, among others:
•
•
•
•
a failure to pay any principal, interest, fees, expenses or other amounts when due;
a violation of covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios;
a default under any other provision of the financing agreement, as well as a default under any provision of related security
documents;
a material breach of any representation or warranty contained in the applicable financing agreement;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
a default under other indebtedness;
a failure to comply with a final legal judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction;
a bankruptcy or insolvency event;
a suspension or cessation of our business;
the destruction or abandonment of our assets, or the seizure or appropriation thereof by any governmental, regulatory or
other authority if the lenders determine such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability
to satisfy our obligations under or otherwise comply with the applicable financing agreement;
the invalidity, unlawfulness or repudiation of any financing agreement or related security document;
an enforcement of any liens or other encumbrances covering our assets; and
the occurrence of certain other events that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to
satisfy our obligations under or otherwise comply with the applicable financing agreement.

The offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.
The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which has a dominant market
share. Drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often the primary factor in
determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability and the quality and technical capability of services
and equipment are also considered.
The offshore contract drilling industry has historically been cyclical and is impacted by oil and gas price levels and volatility. There
have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates, followed by periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low
dayrates. Changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of excess rig supply may intensify
competition in the industry and result in rigs being idle for long periods of time. In addition, certain competitors have greater financial
resources than we do, which may enable them to better withstand periods of low utilization and compete more effectively on the basis
of price.
During prior periods of high dayrates and rig utilization rates, industry participants have increased the supply of rigs by ordering the
construction of new units. This has historically resulted in an oversupply of rigs and has caused a subsequent decline in dayrates and
rig utilization rates, sometimes for extended periods of time. Presently, there are numerous recently constructed high-specification
floaters and other drilling units that are capable of competing with our rigs that have entered the global market, and there are more that
are under contract for construction. The entry into service of these new units has increased and will continue to increase supply and
could curtail a strengthening, or trigger a reduction, in dayrates as rigs are absorbed into the active fleet or lead to accelerated
stacking of the existing fleet. A significant number of the newbuild units have not been contracted for work, which may intensify price
competition. Any further increase in construction of new units would likely exacerbate the negative impact on dayrates and utilization
rates. Lower dayrates and rig utilization rates could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash available for distribution.
We depend on affiliates of Transocean to assist us in operating and expanding our business.
Our ability to enter into new drilling contracts and expand our customer and supplier relationships will depend largely on our ability to
leverage our relationship with Transocean and its reputation and relationships in the offshore drilling industry. If Transocean suffers
material damage to its reputation, relationships or financial condition, it could adversely affect us and limit the benefits we expect to
derive from our present and future relationship with Transocean. Among other things, such damage may adversely affect
Transocean’s ability to provide services to us and to enter into newbuild, acquisition or sale transactions that may benefit us and may
harm our business and prospects, including our ability to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
renew existing drilling contracts upon their expiration;
obtain new drilling contracts;
efficiently and productively carry out our business activities;
acquire additional assets from Transocean;
successfully interact with shipyards;
obtain financing and maintain insurance on commercially acceptable terms;
maintain satisfactory relationships with suppliers, labor and other third parties; or
enforce our contractual rights against Transocean, including indemnification rights.
Such damage and other adverse affects could arise from events beyond our control, including developments relating to the Macondo
well incident. In addition, pursuant to the master services agreements and the support and secondment agreements, affiliates of
Transocean will provide us with significant operational, administrative, financial and other support services and/or personnel. Our
operational success and ability to execute our growth strategy will depend significantly upon the satisfactory performance of these
services. Please read “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

Our shipyard projects and operations are subject to delays and cost overruns.
Our rigs will undergo shipyard projects from time to time. These shipyard projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns
inherent in any such construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:
•
•
•
•
shipyard availability, failures and difficulties;
shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;
unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;
design and engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
latent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;
unanticipated actual or purported change orders;
disputes with shipyards and suppliers;
failure or delay of third-party vendors or service providers;
availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;
strikes, labor disputes and work stoppages;
customer acceptance delays;
adverse weather conditions, including damage caused by such conditions;
terrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;
unanticipated cost increases; and
difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals.
These factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our rigs undergoing shipyard projects. Delays in the
delivery of these units would result in delay in contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue to us, and may also cause
customers to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the rig pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses. In the event of
termination of any of these drilling contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all.
Our operations also rely on a significant supply of capital and consumable spare parts and equipment to maintain and repair our fleet.
We also rely on the supply of ancillary services, including supply boats and helicopters. Shortages in materials, manufacturing
defects, delays in the delivery of necessary spare parts, equipment or other materials, or the unavailability of ancillary services could
negatively impact our future operations and result in increases in rig downtime and delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet.
Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not be
adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.
Our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss
of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, craterings, fires, explosions and pollution. Contract
drilling requires the use of heavy equipment and exposure to hazardous conditions, which may subject us to liability claims by
employees, customers and other parties. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of
property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, claims by third parties or customers and suspension of operations. Our
offshore fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on site or during mobilization, such as capsizing,
sinking, grounding, collision, piracy, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico area is subject
to hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis, and our
Table of Contents
32
drilling rigs in this region may be exposed to damage or total loss by these storms, some of which may not be covered by insurance.
The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment
involved and injury to or death of rig personnel. Some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and
severity of these extreme weather conditions. Operations may also be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal
drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. We customarily provide
contract indemnity to our customers for certain claims that could be asserted by us relating to damage to or loss of our equipment,
including rigs, and claims that could be asserted by us or our employees relating to personal injury or loss of life.
Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through spillage of hydrocarbons, fuel, lubricants or
other chemicals and substances used in drilling operations, or extensive uncontrolled fires. We may also be subject to property
damage, environmental indemnity and other claims by oil and natural gas companies. There are certain risks associated with the loss
of control of a well, such as blowout, cratering, the cost to regain control of or re-drill the well and remediation of associated pollution.
Our customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us against such risks. In addition, a court may decide that certain indemnities
in our current or future drilling contracts are not enforceable. The law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and
penalties to be against public policy, and the enforceability of an indemnity as to other matters may be limited.
Our insurance policies and drilling contracts contain rights to indemnity that may not adequately cover our losses, and we do not have
insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. We participate in Transocean’s insurance program and have two main types of
coverage: (1) hull and machinery coverage for physical damage to our property and equipment and (2) excess liability coverage
which generally covers offshore risks, such as personal injury, third-party property claims and third-party non-crew claims, including
wreck removal and pollution. We will not generally carry commercial market insurance coverage for loss of revenues unless we are
contractually required or for losses resulting from physical damage to our fleet caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico, including liability for wreck removal costs. Under the hull and machinery coverage for physical damage to our property and
equipment, we generally maintain a $125 million per occurrence deductible, limited to a maximum of $200 million per policy
period. Of such $125 million per occurrence deductible, Transocean has retained the risk of $115 million in excess of $10 million
through Transocean’s wholly-owned captive insurance company. Under the excess liability coverage, we maintain per occurrence
deductibles on our rigs that generally range up to $10 million for various third-party liabilities and an additional aggregate annual
deductible of $50 million, which is self-insured through Transocean’s wholly-owned captive insurance company. We also retain the
risk for any liability in excess of Transocean’s $750 million excess liability coverage. However, pollution and environmental risks
generally are not completely insurable. See “Business—Insurance.”
If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by our insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity
from any agreement, the occurrence could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The amount of
our insurance may also be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss. Our insurance coverage will not in all
situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations. Our coverage includes
annual aggregate policy limits. As a result, we generally retain the risk for any losses in excess of these limits. We generally do not
carry insurance for loss of revenue unless contractually required, and certain other claims may also not be reimbursed by insurance
carriers. Any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs. In addition, we could decide to retain more risk in
the future, resulting in higher risk of losses, which could be material. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in
the future at rates that we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks.
Significant part or equipment shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and
sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our
operations.
Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub-systems
used in our operations exposes us to volatility in the quality, prices and availability
Table of Contents
33
of such items. Certain parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers,
manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider.
Recent industry developments have reduced the number of available suppliers. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party
suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues,
recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers,
adversely impact our operations and revenues or increase our operating costs.
Our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues.
Our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues. Costs for
operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being earned. In addition, should our rigs incur
unplanned downtime while on contract or idle time between drilling contracts, we typically will not reduce the staff on those rigs
because we will use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be
immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to
active rigs or dismissed. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance
expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment, and these
expenses could increase for short or extended periods as a result of regulatory or customer requirements that raise maintenance
standards above historical levels. Contract preparation costs vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and
the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized.
Our drilling contracts may not permit us to fully recoup our cost increases in the event of an increase in expenses.
Our drilling contracts have dayrates that are fixed over the contract term. In order to mitigate the effects of inflation on revenues from
these term contracts, our drilling contracts include escalation provisions. These provisions allow us to adjust the dayrates based on
certain published indices and our historical costs. These provisions are designed to compensate us for certain cost increases,
including wages, insurance and maintenance costs. However, actual cost increases may result from events or conditions that do not
cause correlative changes to the applicable indices. Furthermore, certain indices may be outdated at the time of adjustment. In
addition, the adjustments are normally performed only periodically. For these reasons, the timing and amount received as a result of
the adjustments may differ from the timing and amount of expenditures associated with actual cost increases, which could adversely
affect our cash flow and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, certain of our future drilling contracts may not include such
provisions, which would further expose our results of operations to the effects of inflation on our expenses.
Failure to recruit and retain key personnel could hurt our operations.
We depend on the continuing efforts of highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our
business. Historically, competition for the personnel required for drilling operations has intensified as the number of rigs activated,
added to fleets or under construction increased, leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward
pressure on wages and higher turnover. We may experience a reduction in the experience level of the personnel involved in our
operations as a result of any increased turnover, which could lead to higher downtime and more operating incidents, which in turn
could decrease revenues and increase costs. If increased competition for qualified personnel were to intensify in the future, we may
experience increases in costs or limits on operations.
Table of Contents
34
Our labor costs and the operating restrictions under which we operate could increase as a result of collective bargaining
negotiations and changes in labor laws and regulations.
Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could encourage unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as increase the
chances that such efforts succeed. Unionization efforts, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could
materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions.
We have a significant carrying amount of long-lived assets, which is subject to impairment testing, and we could be required
to recognize losses on impairment of our long-lived assets.
The carrying amount of our property and equipment was $2.0 billion, representing 82 percent and 83 percent of our total assets at
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. In accordance with our critical accounting policies, we review our property and
equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the aggregate carrying amount of our assets held
and used may not be recoverable. Future expectations of lower dayrates or rig utilization rates or changes in market conditions could
lead us to believe that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets is unrecoverable. If we determine that the carrying amount is not
recoverable, we could be required to recognize losses on impairment of our long-lived asset group, which could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.
Any operations outside the United States may involve additional risks.
Although initially all of our operations are expected to be in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, our drilling units are capable of operating in
various regions throughout the world, which may expose us to additional political and other uncertainties, including risks of:
•
•
•
terrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;
seizure, expropriation or nationalization of our equipment;
expropriation or nationalization of our customers’ property;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
repudiation or nationalization of contracts;
imposition of trade or immigration barriers;
import-export quotas;
wage and price controls;
changes in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation and enforcement;
involvement in judicial proceedings in unfavorable jurisdictions;
damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnappings;
complications associated with supplying, repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;
the inability to move income or capital; and
currency exchange fluctuations.
Non-U.S. contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in certain countries in which we may operate,
including laws and regulations relating to the import and export, equipment and operation of drilling units, currency conversions and
repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, and taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel. Any
non-U.S. operations also will be subject to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and other U.S.
laws and regulations governing our international operations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and
other investors, including, with respect to state governments, by state retirement systems, have proposed or adopted divestment and
other initiatives regarding investments in companies that do business with countries that have been designated as state sponsors of
terrorism by the U.S. State Department. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to sanctions
and export restrictions, may subject us to
Table of Contents
35
criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or seizures of assets. Investors could view
any potential violations of OFAC regulations negatively, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our common
units.
Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions
and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries,
including local content requirements for participating in tenders for certain drilling contracts. Many governments favor or effectively
require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies
from, a particular jurisdiction or require use of a local agent or interest owner. In addition, government action, including initiatives by
OPEC, may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected
the amount of exploration and development work by oil companies and may continue to do so.
The shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our
import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate.
Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the import and export of certain goods, services and technology and impose
related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against
certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities,
and we are also subject to the U.S. anti-boycott law.
The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic
sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a
manner materially impacting our operations. Ongoing economic challenges may increase some foreign governments’ efforts to enact,
enforce, amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue. Shipments can be delayed and denied import or
export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing
legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime.
Our ability to operate worldwide will depend on our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel to travel in
and out of, and to work in, the jurisdictions in which we plan to operate. Governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which we
plan to operate may make it difficult for us to move our personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the
approval of these permits. If we are not able to obtain visas and work permits in the future for the employees we will need to operate
our rigs on a timely basis, we might not be able to perform our obligations under future drilling contracts, which could allow our
customers to cancel such contracts. If our customers cancel future drilling contracts, and we are unable to secure replacement drilling
contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, it may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.
If any of our drilling rigs fails to maintain its class certification or fails any required survey, that drilling rig would be unable to
operate, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability.
Every offshore drilling rig is a registered marine vessel and must be “classed” by a classification society. The classification society
certifies that the drilling rig is “in-class,” signifying that such drilling rig has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of
the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the drilling rig’s country of registry and the
international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and
corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake such surveys on application or by official
order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. If any drilling rig does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey or
special survey, the drilling rig will be unable to carry on operations and will be unemployable and uninsurable, which could cause us
to be in violation of certain covenants in our credit facility. Any such inability to carry on operations or be employed could have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.

Interest rate fluctuations could affect our earnings and cash flow.
Our 364-day working capital note payable to an affiliate of Transocean has a floating interest rate, and in the future, we may have
additional debt with floating interest rates. As such, significant movements in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our
earnings and cash flow. In order to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we may use interest rate swaps to effectively fix
a part of our floating rate debt obligations. The principal amount covered by any interest rate swaps will be evaluated and determined
based on our debt level, our expectations regarding future interest rates, our contract backlog and our overall financial risk exposure.
For more information regarding the revolving credit agreement that we expect to enter into, see “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Revolving Credit Facilities.”
Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly, expose us to liability and could limit our operations.
Our business in the offshore drilling industry is affected by laws and regulations relating to the energy industry and the environment,
including international conventions and treaties, and regional, national, state and local laws and regulations. The offshore drilling
industry depends on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and, accordingly, we are directly
affected by the adoption of laws and regulations that, for economic, environmental or other policy reasons, curtail exploration and
development drilling for oil and gas. Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require us to
make significant capital expenditures, such as the installation of costly equipment or operational changes, and may affect the resale
values or useful lives of our rigs. We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory
obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, including greenhouse gases, the management of ballast
waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other
financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. Offshore drilling in certain areas has been curtailed and, in certain
cases, prohibited because of concerns over protection of the environment. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in
administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations.
To the extent new laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore drilling or impose
additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry, in general, or the offshore
drilling industry, in particular, our business or prospects could be materially adversely affected. The operation of our drilling rigs will
require certain governmental approvals. These governmental approvals may involve public hearings and costly undertakings on our
part. We may not obtain such approvals or such approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner. If we fail to timely secure the
necessary approvals or permits, our customers may have the right to terminate or seek to renegotiate their drilling contracts to our
detriment. The amendment or modification of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations curtailing or
further regulating exploratory or development drilling and production of oil and gas could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results or financial condition. Compliance with any such new legislation or regulations could have an adverse
effect on our statements of operations and cash flows.
As an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in some offshore areas, we may be liable for damages and costs incurred in
connection with oil spills or waste disposals related to those operations, and we may also be subject to significant fines in connection
with spills. For example, an oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation
costs for natural resource damages, as well as third-party damages, to the extent that the contractual indemnification provisions in our
drilling contracts are not enforceable or are otherwise insufficient, or if our customers are unwilling or unable to contractually
indemnify us from these risks. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain such indemnities in our future drilling contracts, and our
customers may not have the financial capability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Also, these indemnities may be held to be
unenforceable in certain jurisdictions, as a result of public policy considerations or
Table of Contents
37
for other reasons. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may in some
cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence. These laws and
regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all
applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements or
measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Consent
Decree and the EPA Agreement add to these regulations, requirements and liabilities.
Worldwide financial and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our statement of financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
Worldwide financial and economic conditions could cause our ability to access the capital markets to be severely restricted at a time
when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic
and business conditions. Worldwide economic conditions have in the past impacted, and could in the future impact, the lenders
participating in our credit facilities and our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. A slowdown in economic
activity could reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period of lower oil and natural gas prices. A decline in
oil and natural gas prices could reduce demand for our drilling services and have a material adverse effect on our statement of
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 could result in fines, criminal
penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other
jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or
retaining business. We may operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain
circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. If we are found to be liable for
violations under the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other similar laws, either due to our acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of
others, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Civil penalties under the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA could range up to $10,000 per violation, with a criminal fine up to the
greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others, if larger. Civil
penalties under the accounting provisions of the FCPA can range up to $500,000 per violation and a company that knowingly
commits a violation can be fined up to $25 million per violation. In addition, both the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice could
assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts.
Often, dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly the
appointment of a monitor to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the FCPA.
Regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.
Some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, or GHGs, and
including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In
response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is
attracting increasing attention worldwide.
Legislation to regulate emissions of GHGs has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy
debate, both in the U.S. and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. Some of the
proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that may require substantial reductions in carbon emissions.
Those reductions could be costly and difficult to
Table of Contents
38
implement. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of
international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the United Nations Climate Change
Conference in Doha in 2012.
In the United States, the EPA has undertaken efforts to collect information regarding GHG emissions and their effects. Following a
finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized motor vehicle GHG emissions
standards, the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil. The EPA also issued a final rule to address
permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V
programs commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on January 2, 2011. Facilities containing petroleum and natural
gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year are now required to report annual GHG emissions to the
EPA. To the extent that our operations are subject to the EPA’s GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs.
Because our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties
or international agreements related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy
sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the
worldwide demand for oil and gas or limit drilling opportunities. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international
agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our
business.
We may be subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material
adverse effect on us.
We may in the future be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things,
contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment
matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot
predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or the
potential costs to resolve them may have a material adverse effect on us. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases,
insurers may not remain solvent and policies may not be located. To the extent that one or more pending or future litigation matters is
not resolved in our favor and is not covered by insurance, a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition could result.
Public health threats could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial results.
Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world
could adversely impact our operations. Any quarantine of personnel or inability to access our offices or rigs could adversely affect our
operations. Travel restrictions or operational problems, or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health
threats in the future, may materially impact operations and adversely affect our financial results.
Our information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.
We depend on digital technologies to conduct our offshore and onshore operations, to collect payments from customers and to pay
vendors and employees. Threats to our information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or
attacks continue to grow. In addition, breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for some period of time. Risks associated with
these threats include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss of
intellectual property, proprietary information or customer data; disruption of our customers’ operations; loss or damage to our customer
data delivery systems; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. If such a cyber-incident were to
occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Under the master services agreements and certain other agreements, we will be required to indemnify Transocean for any
damages it may incur, and Transocean will not be required to indemnify us for any damages we may incur, in connection
with its performance of services for us, except to the extent caused by Transocean’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or
fraud.
Pursuant to the master services agreements and certain other agreements, Transocean or its affiliates will provide certain
administrative, technical and management services to us and the RigCos. In connection therewith, we will be required to indemnify
Transocean for any damages it may incur and Transocean will not be required to indemnify us for any damages we may incur in
connection with its performance of these services except to the extent caused by Transocean’s gross negligence, willful misconduct
or fraud except for damages arising from services rendered by Transocean in connection with certain drilling contracts with indemnity
provisions that do not conform to Transocean’s contracting principles, for which Transocean will not indemnify us, regardless of
cause. In addition, Transocean’s aggregate liability for such gross negligence or willful misconduct is limited to 10 times the annual
services fees it receives under the applicable agreement. Our business will be harmed if Transocean and its affiliates fail to perform
these services satisfactorily, if they cancel their agreements with us or if they stop providing these services to us. Please read “Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”
Acts of terrorism, piracy and political and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services, which may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Acts of terrorism and social unrest, brought about by world political events or otherwise, have caused instability in the world’s
financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours.
In addition, acts of terrorism, piracy and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could
affect the markets for drilling services. Insurance premiums could increase and coverage may be unavailable in the future. U.S.
government regulations may effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries. These
regulations could be amended to cover countries where we may wish to operate in the future.
Our drilling contracts do not generally provide indemnification against loss of capital assets or loss revenues resulting from acts of
terrorism, piracy or social unrest. We have limited insurance coverage for physical damage losses resulting from risks, such as
terrorist acts, piracy, vandalism, sabotage, civil unrest, expropriation and acts of war, for our assets, and we do not carry insurance for
loss of revenues resulting from such risks.
Potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which, if Transocean were unable to satisfy its
indemnification obligations to us, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make
distributions to our unitholders.
In connection with this offering, Transocean intends to undertake several corporate restructuring transactions. If a court were to
determine that an entity involved in these restructuring transactions did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange or was
rendered insolvent by reason of its transfer of assets, the court could void the relevant conveyance, in whole or in part, and require
that a transferred asset or its value be returned to the transferring entity for the benefit of creditors. Transocean has agreed to
indemnify us for, among other things, any liabilities arising from a judicial determination that the transferring entity did not receive
reasonably equivalent value for any transferred asset or was rendered insolvent by reason of the transfer. If the above liabilities arose
and Transocean were unable to indemnify us, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially
adversely affected and our cash available for distribution could be reduced.
Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us
Transocean and its affiliates may compete with us, and we are limited in our ability to compete with Transocean.
Pursuant to the omnibus agreement that we and Transocean will enter into in connection with the closing of this offering, Transocean
and its controlled affiliates (other than us, our subsidiaries and any publicly held affiliates of Transocean) generally will agree not to
acquire, own, operate or contract for certain drilling rigs
Table of Contents
40
operating under drilling contracts of five or more years. In addition, we generally will agree not to acquire, own, operate or contract for
certain drilling rigs operating under drilling contracts of less than five years. Relatively few drilling contracts have a term of five years
or greater, particularly in the case of contracts that are not associated with newbuild units. As a result, we expect that Transocean will
effectively have a right of first refusal on most drilling contract opportunities. Additionally, the omnibus agreement contains significant
exceptions that may allow Transocean, any new publicly traded entity that Transocean may form or any of its controlled affiliates to
compete with us, which could harm our business. Furthermore, we have granted to Transocean a right of first offer on any proposed
sale of any of our drilling rigs. Transocean has not granted us any such reciprocal right. As a result of these provisions, we will be
unable to pursue many new business opportunities without Transocean’s consent. Please read “Certain Relationships and Related
Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—Omnibus Agreement.”
Although we control the RigCos, the directors and officers of those companies owe duties to the RigCos and their other
owner, Transocean, which may conflict with the interests of us and our unitholders.
Conflicts of interest may arise as a result of the relationships between us and our unitholders, on the one hand, and the RigCos, and
their other owner, Transocean, on the other hand. Transocean owns a 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos and a
100 percent ownership interest in the Transocean Member. Our directors have duties to influence, in our role as controlling owner, the
decisions made by the RigCos in a manner beneficial to us. At the same time, the directors and officers of the RigCos have a duty to
act for the RigCos in a manner beneficial to all of the RigCos’ owners, including Transocean. While we will have influence in our role
as controlling owner of the RigCos, the directors and officers of the RigCos will exercise decisions of the RigCos and they will have a
duty to act in the best interests of the RigCos. Our board of directors may resolve conflicts of interest between Transocean and us and,
to the extent acting in our role as the controlling owner of the RigCos, has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the
conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in the best interest of us or our unitholders.
For example, conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the allocation of shared overhead expenses to the RigCos and us;
the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates (other than the RigCos), on the
one hand, and the RigCos, on the other hand;
the determination and timing of the amount of cash to be distributed to the RigCos’ owners and the amount of cash to be
reserved for the future conduct of the RigCos’ business;
the decision as to whether the RigCos should make asset or business acquisitions or dispositions, and on what terms;
the determination of the amount and timing of the RigCos’ capital expenditures;
the determination of whether the RigCos should use cash on hand, borrow or issue equity to raise cash to finance
maintenance or expansion capital projects, repay indebtedness, meet working capital needs or otherwise; and
any decision we make to engage in business activities independent of, or in competition with, the RigCos.
Unitholders have limited voting rights.
Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of common units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our
business. We expect to hold annual meetings of the members to elect one or more members of our board of directors and to vote on
any other matters that are properly brought before the meeting. Common unitholders will be entitled to elect only four of the seven
members of our board of directors. The Transocean Member in its sole discretion will appoint the remaining three directors and set the
terms for which those directors will serve. Initially, all four of our elected directors will be elected at our annual meeting and will
Table of Contents
41
serve one-year terms. However, upon the election by the Transocean Member to classify our board of directors, the elected directors
will be elected on a staggered basis and will serve for three-year terms. Our limited liability company agreement also contains
provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions
limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management. Unitholders will have no right to elect the
Transocean Member, and the Transocean Member may not be removed except by a vote of the holders of at least 66 2⁄3 percent of the
outstanding common and subordinated units, including any units owned by the Transocean Member and its affiliates, voting together
as a single class. Any removal of the Transocean Member is subject to the approval of a successor Transocean Member by a unit
majority.
The Transocean Member and its other affiliates own a controlling interest in us and have conflicts of interest and limited
duties to us and our common unitholders, and the Transocean Member and its other affiliates may favor their own interests
to the detriment of us and our other common unitholders.
Following this offering, Transocean will own the Transocean Member interest and a 74.6 percent limited liability company interest in
us, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units, and will own and control the Transocean
Member. We expect that all of our officers and certain of our directors will be directors and/or officers of Transocean and its affiliates
and, as such, they will have fiduciary duties to Transocean that may cause them to pursue business strategies that disproportionately
benefit Transocean or which otherwise are not in the best interests of us or our unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between
Transocean and its affiliates on the one hand, and us and our unitholders on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, Transocean
and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of our unitholders. Please read “—Our limited liability company
agreement limits the duties that the Transocean Member and our directors and officers may have to our unitholders and restricts the
remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by the Transocean Member or our directors and officers.” In addition to conflicts
described elsewhere, these conflicts include, among others, the following situations:
•
•
•
•
•
neither our limited liability company agreement nor any other agreement requires the Transocean Member or Transocean
or its affiliates to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets, and Transocean’s officers and directors
have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the shareholders of Transocean, which may be contrary to
our interests;
our limited liability company agreement provides that the Transocean Member may make determinations or take or decline
to take actions without regard to our or our unitholders’ interests. Specifically, the Transocean Member may exercise its call
right, preemptive rights or registration rights, consent or withhold consent to any merger or consolidation of the company,
appoint any appointed directors or vote for the election of any elected director, vote or refrain from voting on amendments to
our limited liability company agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units, voluntarily withdraw from the company,
transfer (to the extent permitted under our limited liability company agreement) or refrain from transferring its units, the
Transocean Member interest or incentive distribution rights or vote upon the dissolution of the company;
the Transocean Member and our directors and officers have restricted their liabilities and duties they may have under the
laws of the Marshall Islands, while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders, and, as a result of purchasing
common units, unitholders are treated as having agreed to the modified duties and to certain actions that may be taken by
the Transocean Member and our directors and officers, all as set forth in our limited liability company agreement;
the Transocean Member is entitled to reimbursement of all costs incurred by it and its affiliates for our benefit;
our limited liability company agreement does not restrict us from paying the Transocean Member or its affiliates for any
services rendered to us on terms that are fair and reasonable or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any
of these entities on our behalf;
Table of Contents
42
•
•
the Transocean Member may exercise its right to call and purchase our common units if it and its affiliates own more than
80 percent of our common units; and
the Transocean Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion, nor will the unitholders be entitled to dissenter’s rights
of appraisal, regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the exercise of its limited call right.
Although a majority of our directors will over time be elected by common unitholders, the Transocean Member will likely have
substantial influence on decisions made by our board of directors due to its ability to appoint certain of our directors and its significant
ownership of our common units. Upon the consummation of this offering, Transocean will own 23,879,310 of our common units,
representing 57.7 percent of our common units. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units is exercised in full,
Transocean will own 21,254,310 of our common units, representing 51.4 percent of our common units. Common unitholders that own
50 percent or more of our common units will have the ability to request that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected
directors. Therefore, for so long as Transocean owns 50 percent or more of our common units, it will have the ability to request that
cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected directors, which would generally enable Transocean to elect one or more of
the elected directors even after it owns less than 50 percent of our common units. Please read “Certain Relationships and Related
Party Transactions,” “Conflicts of Interest and Duties” and “The Limited Liability Company Agreement.”
Our officers face conflicts in the allocation of their time to our business.
Our officers are not required to work full-time on our affairs and also perform services for Transocean. These other companies conduct
substantial businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest. As a result, there could be material
competition for the time and effort of our officers who also provide services to other companies, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Please read “Management.”
Our limited liability company agreement limits the duties that the Transocean Member and our directors and officers may
have to our unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by the Transocean Member or
our directors and officers.
Our limited liability company agreement provides that our board of directors will have the authority to oversee and direct our
operations, management and policies on an exclusive basis. The Marshall Islands Limited Liability Company Act of 1996, or the
Marshall Islands Act, states that a member or manager’s “duties and liabilities may be expanded or restricted by provisions in a
limited liability company agreement.” As permitted by the Marshall Islands Act, our limited liability company agreement contains
provisions that restrict the standards to which the Transocean Member and our directors and our officers may otherwise be held by
Marshall Islands law. For example, our limited liability company agreement:
•
provides that the Transocean Member may make determinations or take or decline to take actions without regard to our or
our unitholders’ interests. The Transocean Member may consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no
duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting us, our affiliates or our unitholders.
Decisions made by the Transocean Member will be made by persons acting only in the interest of its sole owner,
Transocean. Specifically, the Transocean Member may, among other things, decide to exercise its call right, preemptive
rights or registration rights, consent or withhold consent to any merger or consolidation of the company, appoint any
directors or vote for the election of any director, vote or refrain from voting on amendments to our limited liability company
agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units, voluntarily withdraw from the company, transfer (to the extent
permitted under our limited liability company agreement) or refrain from transferring its units, the Transocean Member
interest or incentive distribution rights or vote upon the dissolution of the company;
•
provides that our directors and officers are entitled to make other decisions in “good faith,” meaning they subjectively
believe that the decision is in, or not adverse to, the best interests of the company;
Table of Contents
43
•
•
generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee
of our board of directors and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those
generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be “fair and reasonable” to us and that, in
determining whether a transaction or resolution is “fair and reasonable,” our board of directors may consider the totality of
the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or
beneficial to us; and
provides that neither the Transocean Member nor our officers or our directors will be liable for monetary damages to us, our
members or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a
court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Transocean Member, our directors or officers or those other persons
engaged in actual fraud or willful misconduct.
Please read “Conflicts of Interest and Duties—Duties.”
Fees and cost reimbursements, which certain affiliates of Transocean will determine for services provided to us and our
subsidiaries, will be substantial, will be payable regardless of our profitability and will reduce our cash available for
distribution to unitholders.
Pursuant to the master services agreements and the support and secondment agreements, we will pay fees for services provided to
us and our subsidiaries by certain affiliates of Transocean, and will reimburse these entities for all expenses they incur on our behalf.
These fees and expenses will include all costs and expenses incurred in providing certain management, advisory, technical and
administrative services to our subsidiaries. In addition, we will pay Transocean a services fee for providing services to us, other than
third-party costs and expenses. We expect the amount of these fees and expenses to be approximately $39 million for the twelve
months ending September 30, 2015. There is no cap on the amount of fees and cost reimbursements that we and our subsidiaries
may be required to pay such affiliates of Transocean pursuant to these agreements. For a description of these agreements, please
read “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions.” The fees and expenses
payable pursuant to these agreements will be payable without regard to our financial condition or results of operations. The payment
of fees to and the reimbursement of expenses of affiliates of Transocean could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to
you.
Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group
from attempting to remove our current management or the Transocean Member or acquiring the company, and even if public
unitholders are dissatisfied, they will be unable to remove the Transocean Member without Transocean’s consent, unless
Transocean’s ownership interest in us is decreased. The effect of such provisions could diminish the trading price of our
common units.
Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a person or group from
attempting to remove our current management or the Transocean Member.
•
•
The unitholders will be unable initially to remove the Transocean Member without its consent because the Transocean
Member and its affiliates will own sufficient units upon completion of this offering to be able to prevent its removal. The vote
of the holders of at least 66 2⁄3 percent of all outstanding common and subordinated units voting together as a single class
is required to remove the Transocean Member. Following the closing of this offering, Transocean will own 74.6 percent of
the outstanding common and subordinated units, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
common units.
If the Transocean Member is removed without “cause” during the subordination period and units held by the Transocean
Member and Transocean are not voted in favor of that removal, all remaining subordinated units will automatically convert
into common units, any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished, and the Transocean Member will
have the right to convert its incentive distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests
based on the fair market value of those interests at the time. A removal of the Transocean Member under
Table of Contents
44
these circumstances would adversely affect the common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation
preference over the subordinated units, which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and
performance tests. Any conversion of the Transocean Member interest or incentive distribution rights would be dilutive to
existing unitholders. Furthermore, any cash payment in lieu of such conversion could be prohibitively expensive. “Cause”
is narrowly defined to mean that with respect to a director or officer, a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final,
non-appealable judgment finding such director or officer liable for intentional fraud or willful misconduct, and with respect to
the Transocean Member, the Transocean Member is in breach of the limited liability company agreement or a court of
competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding the Transocean Member liable for intentional
fraud or willful misconduct against us or our members, in their capacity as such. Cause does not include most cases of
charges of poor business decisions, such as charges of poor management of our business by the directors appointed by
the Transocean Member, so the removal of the Transocean Member because of the unitholders’ dissatisfaction with the
Transocean Member’s decisions in this regard would most likely result in the termination of the subordination period.
Common unitholders, including the Transocean Member as a holder of common units, will be entitled to elect only four of
the seven members of our board of directors. The Transocean Member in its sole discretion will appoint the remaining three
directors.
Common unitholders that own 50 percent or more of our common units will have the ability to request that cumulative voting
be in effect for the election of elected directors. Following such a request, Transocean would generally be able to elect one
or more of the elected directors even after it owns less than 50 percent of our common units.
The Transocean Member can elect to classify our board of directors at any time. Thereafter, the election of the four directors
elected by unitholders would be staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of our elected directors
will be selected each year. In addition, the directors appointed by the Transocean Member will serve for terms determined
by the Transocean Member.

Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings of unitholders,
to nominate directors and to acquire information about our operations as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’
ability to influence the manner or direction of management.
There are no restrictions in our limited liability company agreement on our ability to issue additional equity securities.
Although the Marshall Islands Act does not contain specific provisions regarding “business combinations” between limited
companies organized under the laws of the Republic of Marshall Islands and “interested unitholders,” our limited liability
company agreement includes provisions that impose additional restrictions on our engaging in a business combination
with an interested unitholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an
interested unitholder, subject to certain exceptions. Transocean and certain of its transferees are exempt from these
additional restrictions.
The effect of these provisions may be to diminish the price at which the common units will trade.
The control of the Transocean Member may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.
The Transocean Member may transfer its Transocean Member interest to a third party without the consent of the unitholders. In
addition, our limited liability company agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of the Transocean Member from
transferring their respective limited liability company interests in the Transocean Member to a third party.

The incentive distribution rights of the Transocean Member may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.
The Transocean Member may transfer its incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders.
If the Transocean Member transfers its incentive distribution rights to a third party, Transocean will have less incentive to grow our
company and increase distributions. A transfer of incentive distribution rights by the Transocean Member could reduce the likelihood
of Transocean selling or contributing additional assets to us, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our asset base.
Substantial future sales of our common units in the public market could cause the price of our common units to fall.
We have granted registration rights to Transocean and certain of its affiliates. These unitholders have the right, subject to some
conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering any of our common, subordinated or other equity securities owned by
them or to include those securities in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other unitholders. Upon the closing of
this offering and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units, Transocean will own
23,879,310 common units and 27,586,207 subordinated units and all of the incentive distribution rights (through its ownership of the
Transocean Member). Following their registration and sale under the applicable registration statement, those securities will become
freely tradable. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of common units or other securities, these unitholders
could cause the price of our common units to decline.
You will experience immediate and substantial dilution of $6.33 per common unit.
The assumed initial public offering price of $20.00 per common unit exceeds pro forma net tangible book value of $13.67 per common
unit. Based on the initial public offering price, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution of $6.33 per common unit. This dilution
results primarily because the assets contributed by the Transocean Member and its affiliates are recorded at their historical cost, and
not their fair value, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Please read “Dilution.”
We may issue additional equity securities, including securities senior to the common units, without unitholder approval,
which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.
We may, without the approval of our unitholders, issue an unlimited number of additional units or other equity securities. In addition,
we may issue an unlimited number of units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The
issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:
•
•
our unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;
the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;
•
•
•
because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of
the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;
the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and
the market price of the common units may decline.
Upon the expiration of the subordination period, the subordinated units will convert into common units and will then
participate pro rata with other common units in distributions of available cash.
During the subordination period, which we define elsewhere in this prospectus, the common units will have the right to receive
distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit,
plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution
Table of Contents
46
on the common units from prior quarters, before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the
subordinated units. Distribution arrearages do not accrue on the subordinated units. The purpose of the subordinated units is to
increase the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash from operating surplus to be distributed on the
common units. Upon the expiration of the subordination period, the subordinated units will convert into common units and will then
participate pro rata with other common units in distributions of available cash. See “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company
Agreement Relating to Cash Distributions—Subordination Period,” “—Distributions of Available Cash From Operating Surplus During
the Subordination Period” and “—Distributions of Available Cash From Operating Surplus After the Subordination Period.”
In establishing cash reserves, our board of directors may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to you.
Our limited liability company agreement requires our board of directors to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it
determines are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures. Our limited liability company agreement also permits our board of
directors to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law
or agreements to which we are a party, or to provide funds for future distributions to our members. In addition, our limited liability
company agreement requires our board of directors each quarter to deduct from operating surplus estimated maintenance and
replacement capital expenditures, as opposed to actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, which could reduce the
amount of available cash for distribution. The amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from
operating surplus is subject to review and change by our board of directors at least once a year, provided that any change must be
approved by the conflicts committee of our board of directors. These cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for
distribution to unitholders.
The Transocean Member has a limited call right that may require you to sell your common units at an undesirable time or
price.
If at any time the Transocean Member and its affiliates own more than 80 percent of the common units, the Transocean Member will
have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the
common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than the then-current market price of our common units. The Transocean
Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the
exercise of this limited call right. As a result, you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may
not receive any return on your investment. You may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units. For additional information about
the limited call right, please read “The Limited Liability Company Agreement—Limited Call Right.”
At the completion of this offering and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units,
Transocean, which owns and controls the Transocean Member, will own 57.7 percent of our common units. At the end of the
subordination period, assuming no additional issuances of common units, no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units and the conversion of our subordinated units into common units, Transocean will own 74.6 percent of our
common units.
We can borrow money to pay distributions, which would reduce the amount of credit available to operate our business.
Our limited liability company agreement allows us to make working capital borrowings to pay distributions. Accordingly, if we have
available borrowing capacity, we can make distributions on all our units even though cash generated by our operations may not be
sufficient to pay such distributions. Any working capital borrowings by us to make distributions will reduce the amount of working
capital borrowings we can make for operating our business. For more information, please read “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of our common units, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for
acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.
Interest rates on future borrowings under credit facilities and on debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our
financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price is impacted by our level of our cash
distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented
securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the
yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the
price of our common units, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash
distributions at our intended levels.
There is no existing market for our common units, and a trading market that will provide you with adequate liquidity may not
develop. The price of our common units may fluctuate significantly, and unitholders could lose all or part of their investment
in us.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the common units. After this offering, there will be only 17,500,000 publicly
traded common units, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units. We do not know the
extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of a trading market or how liquid that market might be. Unitholders may
not be able to resell their common units at or above the initial public offering price. Additionally, the lack of liquidity may result in wide
bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of the common units and limit the number of investors who
are able to buy the common units.
The initial public offering price for our common units will be determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the
underwriters and may not be indicative of the market price of the common units that will prevail in the trading market. The market price
of our common units may decline below the initial public offering price. The market price of our common units may also be influenced
by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
our quarterly distributions;
our quarterly or annual results or those of other companies in our industry;
announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;
changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
general economic conditions;
the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units after this offering or changes in financial estimates by analysts;
future sales of our common units; and
the other factors described in these “Risk Factors.”
Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions.
Under some circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under the Marshall
Islands Act, we generally may not make a distribution to unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair
value of our assets. The Marshall Islands Act provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution,
members who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated the Marshall Islands Act will be
liable to the limited liability company for the distribution amount. Assignees who become substituted members are liable for the
obligations of the assignor to
Table of Contents
48
make contributions to the company that are known to the assignee at the time it became a member and for unknown obligations if the
liabilities could be determined from the limited liability company agreement. Liabilities to members on account of their limited liability
company interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the company are not counted for purposes of determining whether a
distribution is permitted.
We have no history operating as a separate publicly traded company and will incur increased costs as a result of being a
publicly traded company.
We have no history operating as a publicly traded company. As a publicly traded company, we will incur significant legal, accounting
and other expenses that we did not incur prior to this offering. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules
implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, require publicly traded entities to adopt various corporate
governance practices that will further increase our costs. Before we are able to make distributions to our unitholders, we must first pay
or reserve cash for our expenses, including the costs of being a publicly traded company. As a result, the amount of cash we have
available for distribution to our unitholders will be affected by the costs associated with being a public company.
Prior to this offering, we have not filed reports with the SEC. Following this offering, we will become subject to the public reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act. We expect these rules and regulations to increase certain of our legal and financial compliance
costs and to make activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, as a result of becoming a publicly traded company, we
are required to have at least three independent directors, create an audit committee and adopt policies regarding internal controls and
disclosure controls and procedures, including the preparation of reports on internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, we
will incur additional costs associated with our SEC reporting requirements.
We also expect to incur significant expenses in order to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Because of the limitations in
coverage for directors, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board or as executive
officers.
We estimate that we will incur approximately $10 million of incremental external costs per year and additional internal costs
associated with being a publicly traded company; however, it is possible that our actual incremental costs of being a publicly traded
company will be higher than we currently estimate.
We will be a “controlled company” under the NYSE rules, and as such we are entitled to exemption from certain NYSE
corporate governance standards, and you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that
are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.
After the consummation of this offering, Transocean will continue to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common
units. As a result, we will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Under the
NYSE rules, a company of which more than 50 percent of the voting power for the election of directors is held by another company or
group is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the
requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that the nominating
committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and
responsibilities, (3) the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a
written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and (4) the requirement of an annual performance evaluation
of the nominating and compensation committees. Accordingly, in the future you may not have the same protections afforded to
stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.

We have been organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not
have a well-developed body of limited liability company law.
Our limited liability company affairs are governed by our limited liability company agreement and by the Marshall Islands Act. The
provisions of the Marshall Islands Act resemble provisions of the limited liability company laws of a number of states in the United
States, most notably Delaware. The Marshall Islands Act also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with
the laws of the State of Delaware and, so long as it does not conflict with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of the Marshall Islands
courts, the non-statutory law (or case law) of the State of Delaware is adopted as the law of the Marshall Islands. There have been,
however, few, if any, court cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the Marshall Islands Act, in contrast to Delaware, which has a
fairly well-developed body of case law interpreting its limited liability company statute. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether
Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as the courts in Delaware. For example, the rights of our unitholders and
the duties of the Transocean Member and our directors and officers under Marshall Islands law are not as clearly established as
under judicial precedent in existence in Delaware. As a result, unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the
face of actions by the Transocean Member and our officers and directors than would unitholders of a similarly organized limited
liability company in the United States.
Because we are organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands, it may be difficult to serve us with legal process or enforce
judgments against us, our directors or our management.
We are organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands. In addition, the Transocean Member is a Cayman Islands exempted
company, and a majority of our directors and some of our officers are or will be non-residents of the United States, and all or a
substantial portion of the assets of these non-residents are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or
impossible for unitholders to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States if unitholders believe that
their rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise. Even if unitholders are successful in bringing an action of this
kind, the laws of the Marshall Islands and of other jurisdictions may prevent or restrict unitholders from enforcing a judgment against
our assets or the assets of the Transocean Member or our directors or officers. For more information regarding the relevant laws of the
Marshall Islands, please read “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities Against Foreign Persons.”
If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results
accurately or prevent fraud, which would likely have a negative impact on the market price of our common units. Pursuant to
the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for so long as we are an
emerging growth company and we may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the
Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
We will be required to disclose material changes made in our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis and we will
be required to assess the effectiveness of our controls annually. However, for as long as we are an “emerging growth company” under
the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We could be an emerging growth
company for up to five years. Please read “Summary—Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company.” Effective internal
controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly
traded limited liability company. We will prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but our internal
controls over financial reporting may not meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities. Our efforts to
develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our
financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
For example, Section 404 will require us, among other things, to annually review and report on the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. We must comply with Section 404 (except for the requirement for an auditor’s
Table of Contents
50
attestation report) beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. Any failure to develop, implement or maintain effective
internal controls or to improve our internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations.
Given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, in addition to our limited
accounting personnel and management resources, we can provide no assurance as to our, or our independent registered public
accounting firm’s, future conclusions about the effectiveness of our internal controls, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts
to comply with Section 404. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting will subject us to
regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business
and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies.
We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We cannot predict if
investors will find our units less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our units less attractive as
a result, there may be a less active trading market for our units and our trading price may be more volatile.
Tax Risks
In addition to the following risk factors, you should read “Business—Taxation of the Company,” “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations” and “Non-United States Tax Considerations” for a more complete discussion of the expected material U.S. federal
and non-U.S. income tax considerations relating to us and the ownership and disposition of our common units.
A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the
taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings,
reducing our cash available for distribution to you.
Some of our subsidiaries will be subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or operate, reducing the amount of cash
available for distribution. Our income taxes are based upon the applicable tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries in which we
operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries.
In computing our tax obligations in these jurisdictions, we are required to take various tax accounting and reporting positions on
matters that are not entirely free from doubt and for which we have not received rulings from the governing authorities. We cannot
assure you that upon review of these positions the applicable authorities will agree with our positions. If a tax authority successfully
challenges our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain
countries, or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure, or if we lose a
material tax dispute in any country, additional tax could be imposed on our subsidiaries, further reducing the cash available for
distribution.
For example, the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, has in prior periods challenged the transfer pricing used by Transocean for
certain charters of drilling rigs—including our rigs—between its subsidiaries. Transocean has settled all challenges of this item for all
years through its 2009 tax year with no material adjustments and it is currently contesting the proposed adjustments for its 2010 and
2011 tax years. However, if the IRS were to prevail in its challenge on this issue for Transocean’s 2010 and 2011 tax years,
Transocean’s U.S. federal income tax liability could materially increase.
Table of Contents
51
Our financial projections are based on transfer pricing policies that are substantively consistent with the resolution of this issue in
Transocean’s prior tax years. If the IRS were to challenge our transfer pricing for bareboat charter payments and be successful in
such a challenge, our U.S. federal income tax liability could increase and there could be a material reduction in our cash available for
distribution.
In addition, changes in our operations could result in additional tax being imposed on us or our subsidiaries in jurisdictions in which
operations are conducted. Please read “Business—Taxation of the Company.”
A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we have operations, are
incorporated or are resident could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could result in a significant
negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.
Over time, we are likely to operate in multiple jurisdictions through our subsidiaries. Consequently, we are subject to changes in
applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could include laws or policies directed
toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates. A material change in the tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their
interpretation, of any country in which we have significant operations, or in which we are incorporated or resident, could result in a
higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings, reducing the cash available for distribution. Potential changes include, but are not
limited to, the examples described below.
For example, we and certain of our subsidiaries are or will be resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom. Changes to the
income tax treaty in force between the United States and the United Kingdom could result in a higher effective tax rate on our
worldwide earnings or require us to incur additional costs, reducing the cash available for distribution.
The United Kingdom could also enact changes to its tax laws or policies that could result in a higher effective tax rate on our
worldwide earnings, thereby reducing the cash available for distribution. Such changes might include, but may not be limited to,
changes in its taxation of earnings of subsidiaries or branches or withholding tax upon distributions to unitholders. Legislation was
recently enacted in the United Kingdom which will substantially increase the taxation of drilling contractors operating in the United
Kingdom sector of the North Sea. As we will not initially have any operations in the North Sea, this change is not expected to impact
us, but other future legislative changes could adversely impact us.
In addition, in the United States, legislative and budget proposals have been introduced that would substantially reform the U.S.
international tax system. For example, in November 2013, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee introduced an international tax reform
discussion draft that proposed a number of international tax changes, including a proposal that could limit the deduction for
intercompany payments in certain circumstances. Any material change in tax laws resulting from this legislative proposal could result
in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings, reducing the cash available for distribution.
Similarly, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, or the OECD, issued an action plan in July 2013 that called
for member states to take action to prevent “base erosion and profit shifting” in situations where payments are made between affiliates
from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. Any material change in tax laws or their interpretation,
resulting from the OECD action plan could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings, reducing the cash available
for distribution.
U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a “passive foreign investment company,” which would have adverse U.S. federal
income tax consequences to U.S. unitholders.
If we were treated as a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. unitholders would
be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to certain distributions on our common units and the gain, if
any, realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common units. We would be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in
which either (i) at least 75 percent
Table of Contents
52
of our gross income consists of “passive income” (generally, dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment
property and certain rents and royalties) or (ii) the average percentage (based on quarterly measurements) of the value of our assets
that produce, or are held for the production of, “passive income” is at least 50 percent. For purposes of these tests, we are deemed to
own our proportionate share of the assets and to receive directly our proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in
which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25 percent of the value of the stock. In addition, income derived from the performance of
services does not constitute “passive income.” If we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during a U.S. unitholder’s holding
period in our common units, then such U.S. unitholder could be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for that year
and all subsequent taxable years in which the U.S. unitholder holds common units, even if we cease to be a PFIC.
Based on our current and projected method of operation, and an opinion of our U.S. counsel, Baker Botts L.L.P., we believe that we
will not be a PFIC for our 2014 taxable year, and we expect that we will not be treated as a PFIC for any future taxable year. We have
received an opinion of our U.S. counsel in support of this position that concludes that the income our subsidiaries earn from our
present drilling contracts should not constitute passive income for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. In addition, we
have represented to our U.S. counsel that we expect that more than 25 percent of our gross income for our 2014 taxable year and
each future year will arise from such drilling contracts or other income our U.S. counsel has opined does not constitute passive
income, and more than 50 percent of the average value of our assets for each such year will be held for the production of such non-
passive income. Assuming the composition of our income and assets is consistent with these expectations, and assuming the
accuracy of other representations we have made to our U.S. counsel for purposes of their opinion, our U.S. counsel is of the opinion
that we should not be a PFIC for our 2014 taxable year or any future year.
While we have received an opinion of our U.S. counsel in support of our position, our counsel has advised us that the conclusions in
this area are not free from doubt and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a court could disagree with this opinion and our
position. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to each
taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future and that we will not become a PFIC
in any taxable year. Please read “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Holders—PFIC Status and Significant Tax
Consequences” for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. unitholders if we are treated as a
PFIC.
The ratio of dividend income to distributions on our common units is subject to business, economic and other uncertainties
as well as tax reporting positions with which the IRS may disagree, which could result in a higher ratio of dividend income to
distributions and adversely affect the value of our common units.
We estimate that less than 20 percent of the total cash distributions made to a purchaser of common units in this offering who owns
those units from the date of this offering through December 31, 2016 will constitute dividend income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The remaining portion of the distributions will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the
purchaser’s tax basis in its common units and thereafter as capital gain. These estimates are based on certain assumptions that are
subject to business, economic, regulatory, competitive and political uncertainties beyond our control. In addition, these estimates are
based on current U.S. federal income tax law and tax reporting positions that we will adopt and with which the IRS could disagree. As
a result of these uncertainties, these estimates may be incorrect and the actual percentage of total cash distributions that will
constitute dividend income could be higher, and any difference could adversely affect the value of the common units. Please read

DILUTION
Dilution is the amount by which the offering price will exceed the net tangible book value per common unit after this offering. On a pro
forma basis as of March 31, 2014, our pro forma net tangible book value would have been $943 million, or $13.67 per common unit.
This remains unchanged when adjusted for the sale by the Transocean Member of 17,500,000 common units in this offering at an
assumed initial public offering price of $20.00 per common unit. Purchasers of common units in this offering will experience
substantial and immediate dilution in net tangible book value per common unit for financial accounting purposes, as illustrated in the
following table.

OUR CASH DISTRIBUTION POLICY AND RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTIONS
The following discussion of our cash distribution policy should be read in conjunction with the specific assumptions included in this
section. In addition, “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” should be read for information regarding statements that do not
relate strictly to historical or current facts and regarding certain risks inherent in our business.
For additional information regarding our historical results of operations, please refer to our historical combined financial statements
and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.
General
Rationale for Our Cash Distribution Policy
Our limited liability company agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash quarterly. This requirement forms the
basis of our cash distribution policy and reflects a basic judgment that our unitholders will be better served by distributing our
available cash rather than retaining it, because, among other reasons, we believe we will generally finance any expansion capital
expenditures from external financing sources. Under our current cash distribution policy, we intend to make minimum quarterly
distributions on our common and subordinated units of $0.3625 per unit, or $1.45 per unit on an annualized basis, to the extent we
have sufficient available cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of costs and expenses, including the payment
of expenses to the Transocean Member and its affiliates. However, other than the requirement in our limited liability company
agreement to distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we have no legal obligation to make quarterly cash distributions in this
or any other amount, and our board of directors has considerable discretion to determine the amount of our available cash each
quarter. Generally, our available cash is our (i) cash on hand at the end of a quarter after the payment of our expenses and the
establishment of cash reserves (including estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures), (ii) cash on hand on the
date of determination resulting from cash distributions received after the end of such quarter from equity interests in any person other
than a subsidiary in respect of operations conducted by such person during the quarter and (iii) if our board of directors so
determines, cash on hand on the date of determination resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. If
we do not generate sufficient available cash from our operations, we may, but are under no obligation to, borrow funds to pay
minimum quarterly distributions to our unitholders.
Limitations on Cash Distributions and Our Ability to Change Our Cash Distribution Policy
Although our limited liability company agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash quarterly, there is no guarantee
that we will make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders at our minimum quarterly distribution rate or any other rate, and we
have no legal obligation to do so. Our cash distribution policy is subject to certain restrictions, as well as the discretion of our board of
directors in determining the amount of our available cash each quarter. The following factors will affect our ability to make cash
distributions, as well as the amount of any cash distributions we make:
•
•
Our cash distribution policy may be subject to restrictions on cash distributions under our revolving credit facility or
financing agreements that we may enter into in the future. Such restrictions may prohibit us from making cash distributions
while an event of default has occurred and is continuing under such revolving credit facility, notwithstanding our cash
distribution policy.
The amount of cash that we distribute and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our board of directors,
taking into consideration the terms of our limited liability company agreement. Specifically, our board of directors will have
the authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of our business and for future cash distributions to our
unitholders, and the establishment of or increase in those reserves could result in a reduction in cash distributions from
levels we currently anticipate pursuant to our stated cash distribution policy. Any decision to establish cash reserves made
by our board of directors in good faith will be binding on our unitholders. Our limited liability company agreement provides
that in order for a determination by our board of directors to be
Table of Contents
59
•
•
considered to have been made in good faith, our board of directors must subjectively believe that the determination is in, or
not adverse to, the best interests of the company.
We will be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and replace our fleet. These expenditures may
fluctuate significantly over time, particularly as drilling rigs near the end of their useful lives. In order to minimize these
fluctuations, we are required to deduct estimated, as opposed to actual, maintenance and replacement capital expenditures
from the amount of cash that we would otherwise have available for distribution to our unitholders. In years when estimated
maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are higher than actual maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures, the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders will be lower than if actual maintenance and
replacement capital expenditures were deducted.
Although our limited liability company agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash, our limited liability
company agreement, including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions, may be amended. During the
subordination period, our limited liability company agreement may not be amended without the approval of our public
common unitholders, except in a limited number of circumstances when our board of directors can amend our limited
liability company agreement without any unitholder approval. For a description of these limited circumstances, please read
“The Limited Liability Company Agreement—Amendment of the Limited Liability Company Agreement—No Unitholder
Approval.” After the subordination period has ended, our limited liability company agreement can be amended with the
approval of a majority of the outstanding common units, including those held by Transocean. At the closing of this offering,
Transocean will own approximately 57.7 percent of our common units (or 51.4 percent if the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional common units is exercised in full) and all of our subordinated units. Please read “The Limited Liability
Company Agreement—Amendment of the Limited Liability Company Agreement.”
•
•
•
•
Under Section 40 of the Marshall Islands Act, we generally may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause our
liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets.
We may lack sufficient cash to pay distributions to our unitholders due to, among other things, changes in our business,
including decreases in total operating revenues, decreases in dayrates, the loss of a drilling rig, increases in operating or
general and administrative expenses, principal and interest payments on outstanding debt, taxes, working capital
requirements, maintenance and replacement capital expenditures or anticipated cash needs. Please read “Risk Factors”
for a discussion of these factors.
Our ability to make distributions to our unitholders depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to
distribute cash to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, the
provisions of any future indebtedness, applicable partnership and limited liability company laws and other laws and
regulations.
If and to the extent our available cash materially declines from quarter to quarter, we may elect to change our current cash
distribution policy and reduce the amount of our quarterly distributions in order to service or repay our debt or fund
expansion capital expenditures.
To the extent that our board of directors determines not to distribute the full minimum quarterly distribution on our common units with
respect to any quarter during the subordination period, the common units will accrue an arrearage equal to the difference between the
minimum quarterly distribution and the amount of the distribution actually paid on the common units with respect to that quarter. The
aggregate amount of any such arrearages must be paid on the common units before any distributions of available cash from operating
surplus may be made on the subordinated units and before any subordinated units may convert into common units. The subordinated
units will not accrue any arrearages. Any shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units with
respect to any quarter during the subordination period may decrease the likelihood that our quarterly distribution rate would increase
in subsequent quarters. Please read “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement Relating to Cash Distributions—
Subordination Period.”

Our Ability to Grow Depends on Our Ability to Access External Capital
Our limited liability company agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders on a quarterly basis. As a
result, we expect that we will rely primarily upon our cash reserves and external financing sources, including borrowings under our
Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility (under which no amounts will be drawn at the closing of this offering) and the issuance of debt
and equity securities, to fund future acquisitions and other expansion capital expenditures. To the extent we are unable to finance
growth with external sources of capital, the requirement in our limited liability company agreement to distribute all of our available
cash and our current cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. In addition, because we will distribute all of
our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest all of their available cash to expand ongoing operations.
We anticipate that our revolving credit facility will restrict our ability to incur additional debt, including through the issuance of debt
securities. To the extent we issue additional units, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we
will be unable to maintain or increase our cash distributions per unit. There are no limitations in our limited liability company
agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to our common units, and our unitholders will have no
preemptive or other rights (solely as a result of their status as unitholders) to purchase any such additional units. If we incur additional
debt (under our revolving credit facility or otherwise) to finance our growth strategy, we will have increased interest expense, which in
turn will reduce the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an
Investment in Us—Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of our common units, our ability to issue equity or incur
debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.”
Our Minimum Quarterly Distribution
Upon the consummation of this offering, our limited liability company agreement will provide for a minimum quarterly distribution of
$0.3625 per unit for each whole quarter, or $1.45 per unit on an annualized basis. Our ability to make cash distributions at the
minimum quarterly distribution rate will be subject to the factors described above under “—General—Limitations on Cash
Distributions and Our Ability to Change Our Cash Distribution Policy.” Quarterly distributions, if any, will be made within 60 days after
the end of each calendar quarter to holders of record on or about the first day of each such month. We will not make distributions for
the period that begins on July 1, 2014 and ends on the day prior to the closing of this offering. We will adjust the amount of our
distribution for the period from the completion of this offering through September 30, 2014 based on the actual length of the period.
The amount of available cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all of our common units and subordinated units, in
each case to be outstanding immediately after this offering, for one quarter and on an annualized basis is summarized in the table

The Transocean Member will also hold the incentive distribution rights, which entitle it to increasing percentages, up to an aggregate
maximum of 50 percent, of the cash we distribute in excess of $0.416875 per unit per quarter; provided that for any fiscal quarter in
which the application of our distribution formula would result in the holders of the common units receiving, in the aggregate, less than
a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter, then the distribution to the holders of the incentive
distribution rights will be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the holders of the common
units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter.
During the subordination period, before we make any quarterly distributions to our subordinated unitholders, our common unitholders
are entitled to receive payment of the full minimum quarterly distribution for such quarter plus any arrearages in distributions of the
minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters. Please read “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement Relating to
Cash Distributions—Subordination Period.” We cannot guarantee, however, that we will pay distributions on our common units at our
minimum quarterly distribution rate or at any other rate in any quarter.
Although holders of our common units may pursue judicial action to enforce provisions of our limited liability company agreement,
including those related to requirements to make cash distributions as described above, our limited liability company agreement
provides that any determination made by our board of directors must be made in good faith and that any such determination will not
be subject to any other standard imposed by the Marshall Islands Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. Our limited
liability company agreement provides that, in order for a determination by our board of directors to be made in “good faith,” our board
of directors must subjectively believe that the determination is in, or not adverse to, the best interests of our company. In making such
determination, our board of directors may take into account the totality of the circumstances or the totality of the relationships between
the parties involved, including other relationships or transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us. Please
read “Conflicts of Interest and Duties.”
The provision in our limited liability company agreement requiring us to distribute all of our available cash quarterly may not be
modified without amending our limited liability company agreement; however, as described above, the actual amount of our cash
distributions for any quarter is subject to fluctuations based on the amount of cash we generate from our business, the amount of
reserves our board of directors establishes in accordance with our limited liability company agreement and the amount of available
cash from working capital borrowings.
The minimum quarterly distribution will also be proportionately adjusted in the event of any distribution, combination or subdivision of
common units in accordance with the limited liability company agreement, or in the event of a distribution of available cash from
capital surplus. Please read “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement Relating to Cash Distributions—Adjustment to
the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distribution Levels.”
In the following section, we present a table consisting of “Estimated Cash Available for Distribution for the Twelve Months Ending
September 30, 2015,” in which we provide our estimated forecast of our ability to generate sufficient cash available for distribution to
support the full payment of our annualized minimum quarterly distribution of $1.45 per unit on our common and subordinated units for
the twelve months ending September 30, 2015.
Estimated Cash Available for Distribution for the Twelve Months Ending September 30, 2015
We forecast that our estimated cash available for distribution for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015 will be approximately
$110 million. This amount would exceed by $10 million the amount of cash available for distribution we must generate to support the
payment of the minimum quarterly distributions for four quarters on our common and subordinated units, in each case to be
outstanding immediately after this offering, for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015. Actual payments of distributions on the
common
Table of Contents
62
units and the subordinated units are expected to be approximately $15.5 million for the period between the estimated closing date of
this offering (August 5, 2014) and September 30, 2014, and we anticipate that our cash available for distribution generated during
such period will be sufficient to pay 100% of the minimum quarterly distribution on all of our common units and subordinated units with
respect to such period. The number of outstanding units on which we have based our estimate does not include any common units
that may be issued under the long-term incentive plan that we will adopt prior to the closing of this offering.
Management has prepared the forecast of estimated cash available for distribution for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015,
and related assumptions set forth below to substantiate our belief that we will have sufficient cash available for distribution to pay the
full minimum quarterly distributions on our common and subordinated units for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015. Please
read “—Forecast Assumptions and Considerations” for further information as to the assumptions we have made for the financial
forecast. This forecast is a forward-looking statement and should be read together with our historical financial statements and
accompanying notes included elsewhere in this prospectus, our unaudited pro forma balance sheet and accompanying notes
included elsewhere in this prospectus and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” This forecast was not prepared with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC or guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view
of our management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents,
to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the assumptions on which we base our belief that we can generate sufficient cash
available for distribution to pay the full minimum quarterly distributions on our common and subordinated units for the twelve months
ending September 30, 2015. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our
future results, and readers of this prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.
The prospective financial information included in this registration statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our
management. Neither Ernst & Young LLP nor any other independent accountants have compiled or performed any procedures with
respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, neither Ernst & Young LLP nor any other
independent accountants express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The report of Ernst & Young LLP
included in this prospectus relates to our historical financial information. Such report does not extend to the prospective financial
information and should not be read to do so.
When considering our financial forecast, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements under
“Risk Factors.” Any of the risks discussed in this prospectus, to the extent they are realized, could cause our actual results
of operations to vary significantly from those that would enable us to generate our estimated cash available for distribution.
We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly the results of any future revisions we may make to the forecast or to
update this forecast to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this prospectus. Therefore, you are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on this prospective financial information.
The following table sets forth our calculation of (a) our forecasted cash available for distribution for the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015 and (b) Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor’s estimated cash available for distribution for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2013. Throughout the forecast period, we have assumed that our
principal assets will consist solely of our 51 percent controlling interest in each of the RigCos, which will own and operate the drilling
rigs in our initial fleet. Unless otherwise noted, the financial information in the table below is presented before Transocean’s 49
percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. Noncontrolling interest for the historical periods presented in the table below
has been calculated as if the noncontrolling interest described herein was in place at January 1, 2013.

In our contract drilling revenues, we recognize amortization associated with our intangible liability attributed to the drilling
contract for Development Driller III. We amortize drilling contract intangible revenues based on the cash flows projected over the
contract period and include such revenues in contract drilling revenues on our combined statements of operations.
Includes amortization of pre-operating revenues related to mobilization to initial locations and payments for customer-requested
upgrades. Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Performance and Other Key Indicators—Contract backlog.”
(3) Planned out-of-service operating and maintenance expense includes projected expenses related to a planned 21 day out of
service period to conduct the special periodic survey (SPS) for Discoverer Inspiration, which is recognized in operating and
maintenance expense, with no comparable activities in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended
December 31, 2013.
(4) Estimated general and administrative expense includes general and administrative costs allocated by Transocean to our
Predecessor. Forecasted general and administrative expense includes an estimated $10 million in incremental general and
administrative expenses that we expect to incur annually as a result of being a publicly traded limited liability company, which
are not included in the historical column. Cash available for distribution attributable to noncontrolling interest equals more than
49 percent of the cash available for distribution because the incremental general and administrative expenses that we expect to
incur as a result of being a publicly traded limited liability company are borne entirely by us and not the RigCos.
(5)
Includes interest expense resulting from the 364-day working capital note payable and commitment fees related to our
anticipated Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Also includes interest earned on long-term accounts receivable from our
customers. We record long-term accounts receivable at their present value and recognize interest income on the outstanding
balance using the effective interest method through the dates of payment.
(6) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense net
of interest income, taxes, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for amortization of prior
certification costs and license fees, non-cash recognition of royalty fees, amortization of the drilling contract intangible and
amortization of pre-operating revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and
external users of financial statements, such as investors, to assess our financial and operating performance. EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to
period and against the performance of other companies in our industry that provide EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA information.
This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization of prior certification costs and license fees, non-cash recognition of royalty fees,
amortization of the drilling contract intangible and amortization of pre-operating revenues, which items are affected by various
and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net
income between periods. We believe that including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial and operating measures
benefits investors in (a) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (b) monitoring our ongoing
financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold common units.
Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from
operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and these measures may vary among other companies.
Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies.
(7) Following this offering, the Transocean Member will retain the obligation for the payment of quarterly patent fees through the
patent expiration, and we will recognize a non-cash expense for the fees paid on our behalf.

(8) Estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures includes estimated planned out-of-service maintenance
expenses, maintenance capital expenditures (including both in-service and out-of-service capital expenditures) and replacement
capital expenditures. Our limited liability company agreement requires that an estimate of the maintenance and replacement
capital expenditures necessary to maintain our asset base be subtracted from operating surplus each quarter, as opposed to
amounts actually spent. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us—In establishing cash reserves, our
board of directors may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to you.”
(9) We record long-term accounts receivable at their present value and recognize interest income using the effective interest method
through the date of payment. The cash proceeds from pre-operating revenues associated with long-term receivables represents
the component of cash proceeds associated with revenues recognized during the period.
(10) Assumes the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units is not exercised.

In our contract drilling revenues, we recognize amortization associated with our intangible liability attributed to the drilling
contract for Development Driller III. We amortize drilling contract intangible revenues based on the cash flows projected over the
contract period and include such revenues in contract drilling revenues on our combined statements of operations.
As described in “Summary—Operational Update,” Discoverer Clear Leader is anticipated to be out of service for maintenance to its
blowout preventer and a scheduled special periodic survey in the third quarter of 2014. If the out of service period on Discover Clear
Leader extends beyond the third quarter of 2014, our revenue may be lower during the forecast period. However, Transocean has
agreed to indemnify us for any lost revenue arising out of the failure to receive an operating dayrate from Chevron for Discoverer
Clear Leader, up to $100 million, for the period commencing on the closing date of this offering through the completion of this special
periodic survey. Any such indemnity payments would be treated as operating surplus under our limited liability company agreement
and as cash available for distribution for purposes of this forecast. As a result of this indemnity, we do not expect that these out of
service periods will reduce the amount of our cash available for distribution.
(2)
Includes amortization of pre-operating revenues related to mobilization to initial locations and payments for customer-requested
upgrades. Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Performance and Other Key Indicators—Contract backlog.”

(4) Forecasted general and administrative expense includes an estimated $10 million in incremental general and administrative
expenses that we expect to incur annually as a result of being a publicly traded limited liability company. Cash available for
distribution attributable to noncontrolling interest equals more than 49 percent of the cash available for distribution because the
incremental general and administrative expenses that we expect to incur as a result of being a publicly traded limited liability

Includes interest expense resulting from the 364-day working capital note payable and commitment fees related to our Five-Year
Revolving Credit Facility. Also includes interest earned on long-term accounts receivable from our customers. We record long-
term accounts receivable at their present value and recognize interest income on the outstanding balance using the effective
interest method through the dates of payment.
(6) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. Please read note 6 to the preceding table for additional
information.
(7) Following this offering, the Transocean Member will retain the obligation for the payment of quarterly patent fees through the
patent expiration, and we will recognize a non-cash expense for the fees paid on our behalf.
(8) Estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures includes estimated planned out-of-service maintenance
expenses, maintenance capital expenditures (including both in-service and out-of-service capital expenditures) and replacement
capital expenditures. Our limited liability company agreement requires that an estimate of the maintenance and replacement

Forecast Assumptions and Considerations
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial forecast and related notes of Transocean Partners LLC present the forecasted results of operations of
Transocean Partners LLC for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015, based on the assumption that:
•
•
we will own a 51 percent interest in each of the RigCos during the forecast period;
we will issue (a) to the Transocean Member (i) 41,379,310 common units and 27,586,207 subordinated units, representing
a 100 percent limited liability company interest in us, (ii) the non-economic Transocean Member interest and (iii) all of the
incentive distribution rights, which will entitle the Transocean Member to increasing percentages of the cash we distribute
in excess of $0.416875 per unit per quarter, and (b) to an affiliate of Transocean the 364-day working capital note payable
of
Table of Contents
68
approximately $43 million for cash proceeds of $43 million, all or a portion of which we will pay to the Transocean Member
for our pro rata share of certain working capital balances; and
•
the Transocean Member will sell 17,500,000 common units to the public in this offering, representing a 25.4 percent limited
liability company interest in us.
Summary of Significant Forecast Assumptions
Contract Drilling Revenues. For the twelve months ending September 30, 2015, we forecast contract drilling revenues of $567
million, compared to contract drilling revenues of $549 million and $517 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the
year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Our forecast of contract drilling revenues is based on projected dayrates multiplied by
the projected revenue efficiency and the projected total number of operating days under the contract during the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015. Forecasted operating revenues assume that all of our drilling rigs are operational, excluding the planned 21 day
out of service period for Discoverer Inspiration, throughout the twelve months ending September 30, 2015.
The following table summarizes our projected dayrates and revenue efficiency for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015 as
well as dayrates and revenue efficiency for the year ended December 31, 2013.

(1) Contract start and completion dates are estimated. Contracts could be longer in duration because of a provision that allows the
customer to finish drilling a well-in-progress and due to other factors not under our control. New contracts do not commence until
the prior contract has been completed.
(2) Represents the maximum contractual operating dayrate, which is subject to change due to cost escalations. The dayrate
includes pre-operating revenues of $22,000 per day for the Discoverer Inspiration contract ending in March 2015 and $19,000
per day for the Discoverer Clear Leader contract ending in September 2014 for various customer requested upgrades and
equipment. The dayrate excludes amortization of drilling contract intangible revenues as well as all other pre-operating
revenues that terminate at the end of the rigs’ current contracts.
The average dayrate actually earned over the term of the contract will reflect various reduced rates received under the contract as a
result of time billed according to standby rates, waiting-on-weather rates, maintenance rates or other similar rates, which typically are
less than the contract dayrate. In addition, the amount shown does not reflect incentive programs, which are typically based on the
rig’s operating performance against a performance curve. During the forecast period, we have assumed that we will not earn any
additional revenues under incentive programs, and the projected dayrates do not assume any escalations.
For the three months ended March 31, 2014, average daily revenue was $533,200, $579,700 and $467,200 for Discoverer Inspiration,
Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III, respectively, and the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our initial fleet was 98
percent. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, average daily revenue was $511,100, $490,100 and $456,800 for Discoverer
Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III, respectively, and the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our initial fleet
was 91 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2013, average daily revenue was $500,700, $450,500 and $416,100 for
Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III, respectively, and the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our
initial fleet was 86 percent.
Table of Contents

(3) Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by the maximum revenue
calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest amount of
contract drilling revenues the drilling unit could earn for the measurement period, excluding amounts related to incentive
provisions. Our revenue efficiency rate varies due to revenues earned under alternative contractual dayrates, such as a waiting-
on-weather rate, repair rate, standby rate, force majeure rate or zero rate, that may apply under certain circumstances.
(4) The dayrate for the remainder of the contract is linked to the standard West Texas Intermediate crude oil price with a floor of $40
per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $400,000 and a ceiling of $70 per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $500,000,
before cost escalation adjustments of $50,000 per day and pre-operating revenues of $19,000 per day.
The projected revenue efficiency for each drilling rig is based on Transocean’s past experience with these drilling rigs and similar
drilling rigs. We do not forecast the number of days during which the rig will earn standby rates, waiting-on-weather rates,
maintenance rates or other similar rates. We do include in our forecast planned out-of-service days. During the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015, we have assumed 21 days during which Discoverer Inspiration will earn no dayrate as it undergoes a planned
shipyard for routine maintenance.
Revenue efficiency was lower in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013 relative to the
year ended December 31, 2012 due to unplanned downtime associated primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea
equipment for each of the rigs in our initial fleet. Total revenue efficiency of our initial fleet in the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2011 was 97 percent and 93 percent, respectively. Total revenue efficiency of our initial fleet in the three months ended March 31,
2014 and 2013 was 98 percent and 77 percent, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, revenue efficiency
for Discoverer Inspiration was 98 percent and 91 percent, respectively; for Discoverer Clear Leader was 97 percent and 97 percent,
respectively; and for Development Driller III was 97 percent and 89 percent, respectively. The increase in revenue efficiency for
Development Driller III in 2012 relative to 2011 was due to less unplanned downtime in 2012 for repairs to the blowout preventer and
other subsea equipment.
A one percent change in annual revenue efficiency of our initial fleet would cause a corresponding change in the cash available for
distribution attributable to Transocean Partners LLC of approximately $2 million.
Our drilling contracts entitle us to cost escalation in dayrates to compensate us for specific cost increases as reflected in certain
publicly available cost indices and certain changes in our actual operating expenses. We have not assumed any cost escalations in
our projected dayrates during the forecast period.
In addition to recurring contracted dayrates, we may also receive mobilization and demobilization fees for drilling rigs before and after
their drilling assignments, and may also receive reimbursement of costs incurred by us at the customer’s request for additional
supplies, personnel and other services not covered by the contracted dayrate. For the purpose of this forecast, we have not included
any revenue or costs associated with additional customer requests, and we have not included any new mobilization fees or
demobilization fees in the forecast as no drilling rigs are expected to be mobilizing or demobilizing during the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015.
In connection with Transocean’s business combination with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in November 2007, Transocean acquired
Development Driller III, which had a drilling contract that included fixed dayrates for future contract drilling services that were below
the then-existing market dayrates available for similar contracts as of the date of the business combination. Accordingly, Transocean
recognized a contract intangible liability, representing the estimated fair value of the drilling contract, which is expected to be
completed in November 2016. We amortize drilling contract intangible revenues of $42,000 per day over the remainder of the contract
period and include such revenues in contract drilling revenues.

Other Revenues. Our forecast assumes estimated other revenues of $10 million during the twelve months ending September 30,
2015, compared to $9 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013 for our
Predecessor. The assumed reimbursable revenues consist primarily of revenues related to customer required services and
equipment and other reimbursable costs. Other revenues are primarily offset by related costs.
Operating and Maintenance Expense. We estimate that we will have operating and maintenance expenses of $273 million during
the twelve months ending September 30, 2015 compared to $245 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and $242
million in the year ended December 31, 2013 for our Predecessor. Forecasted operating and maintenance expenses assume that all
of our drilling rigs are operational throughout the twelve months ending September 30, 2015. Our forecast also assumes the cost level
of operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where our drilling rigs are expected to be located during the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015, is consistent with the cost level for this region during the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year
ended December 31, 2013, as adjusted for expected inflation. The forecast takes into account increases in crewing and other labor
related costs driven predominantly by an increase in demand for qualified and experienced officers and crew and inflation.
All three of our drilling units are equipped with Transocean’s patented dual-activity technology. We entered into patent license
agreements with Transocean for the use of the patented technology through the expiration of the patents in May 2016. Under the
license agreements, we paid to Transocean an aggregate original license cost of $20 million, recorded in other assets. For the twelve
months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, our Predecessor’s amortized deferred license costs were $3
million, recorded in operating and maintenance expense. Under the license agreements, we are required to pay to Transocean
quarterly royalty fees of between three percent and five percent of revenues. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year
ended December 31, 2013, our Predecessor paid a total of $19 million for royalty fees and recognized a corresponding expense,
recorded in operating and maintenance expense. Following this offering, the Transocean Member will retain the obligation for the
payment of the quarterly royalty fees through the patent expiration, and we will recognize a corresponding non-cash expense for the
fees paid on our behalf.
Depreciation Expense. We estimate that our depreciation expense will be $61 million for the twelve months ending September 30,
2015 compared to $66 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and in the year ended December 31, 2013 for our
Predecessor. Forecasted depreciation expense assumes that no drilling rigs are purchased or sold during the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015. We have accounted for depreciation expense in a manner consistent with the historical presentation in the
combined statements of operations of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor. Drilling rigs and equipment are recorded at historical
cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of a drilling rig less its estimated residual value is depreciated on a straight-line basis
over its estimated remaining useful life, which we estimate as of July 1, 2014, to be 30, 31 and 30 years for each of Discoverer Clear
Leader, Discoverer Inspiration and Development Driller III, respectively.
General and Administrative Expense. Forecasted general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015 are based on the following assumptions:
•
•
we will incur approximately $11 million of costs and fees pursuant to the master services agreements that we will enter into
with Transocean. These costs and fees are consistent with our Predecessor’s costs and fees of approximately $10 million
for such services during the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013. Please read
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—Master Services
Agreements”; and
we will incur approximately $10 million in incremental expenses annually as a result of being a publicly traded limited
liability company. These expenses will include costs associated with annual reports to unitholders, tax return preparation,
investor relations, registrar and transfer agent fees, audit fees, legal fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance
costs and executive and director compensation.

Interest Expense (Income), Net. Estimated interest expense (income), net for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015
consists of interest income of $2 million, net of interest expense of $1 million.
Interest income includes $2 million of interest earned on long-term accounts receivable from our customers. We record long-term
accounts receivable at their present value and recognize interest income on the outstanding balance using the effective interest
method through the dates of payment. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, our
Predecessor recognized $4 million of interest income on long-term accounts receivable from customers.
Interest expense consists primarily of a commitment fee related to our anticipated $300 million undrawn Five-Year Revolving Credit
Facility and interest expense resulting from the 364-day working capital note payable, based on an average outstanding principal
amount of $23 million. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, our Predecessor did not
have any interest expense.
Income Tax Expense. Forecasted income tax expense is based on the tax laws and applicable rates in the countries where
operations are conducted and income is earned. The forecasted tax expense for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015 is
primarily comprised of the expected U.S. federal income taxes on the U.S. operations of Discoverer Clear Leader, Discoverer
Inspiration and Development Driller III. Rig movement between taxing jurisdictions and their respective operating structures could
affect the provision for income tax expense. We have assumed that the drilling rigs will remain in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico throughout
the twelve months ending September 30, 2015.
In computing our tax obligations, we are required to take various tax accounting and reporting positions on matters that are not entirely
free from doubt and for which we have not received rulings from the governing authorities. We cannot assure you that upon review of
these positions the applicable authorities will agree with our positions. For example, the IRS has in prior periods challenged the
transfer pricing used by Transocean for certain charters of drilling rigs, including our drilling rigs, between its subsidiaries.
Transocean has settled all challenges of this item for all years through its 2009 tax year with no material adjustments and it is
currently contesting the proposed adjustments for its 2010 and 2011 tax years. In addition, the forecasted income tax expense
assumes that our transfer pricing policies for charters of drilling rigs between our subsidiaries will be consistent with Transocean’s
transfer pricing policies. However, if the IRS successfully challenged our transfer pricing policies, it could result in a material increase
in our U.S. federal income tax expense. Please read “Risk Factors—Tax Risks—A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax
challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries
could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, reducing our cash available for distribution to you” for additional
information.
Estimated Maintenance and Replacement Capital Expenditures. Our limited liability company agreement requires our board of
directors to deduct from operating surplus each quarter an estimate of the present value of the average quarterly maintenance and
replacement capital expenditures to be incurred in the future, as opposed to deducting the actual maintenance and replacement
capital expenditures incurred during the reporting period. The intent of this adjustment is to smooth the disparities in operating surplus
that would be caused by fluctuating maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, such as major capital expenditures
associated with equipment recertifications and special classification surveys and drilling rig replacement, with the objective to deliver
a consistent, stable distribution. The actual cost of capital expenditures and the replacement of the drilling rigs in our fleet will depend
on the factors that cause such out of service time, including, but not limited to, equipment condition, supplier costs, regulatory and
classification requirements, prevailing market conditions for contracting opportunities and the availability and cost of financing for
replacement of assets, at the time of replacement. Our board of directors, with the approval of the conflicts committee, may determine
that one or more of our reserve assumptions should be revised, which could cause our board of directors to change the amount of
estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures. We may elect to finance some or all of future maintenance and
replacement capital expenditures through the issuance of additional common units which could be dilutive to
Table of Contents
72
our existing unitholders. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—We must make substantial capital and
operating expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet, and we may be required to make significant capital
expenditures to maintain our competitiveness and to comply with laws and the applicable regulations and standards of governmental
authorities and organizations, or to execute our growth plan, each of which could negatively affect our financial condition, result of
operations and cash flows and reduce cash available for distribution. In addition, each quarter we are required to deduct estimated
maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus, which may result in less cash available to unitholders
than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted.”
Our initial annual estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures will be $69 million per year. This is attributable to the
substantial capital expenditures we are required to make to maintain our fleet over time and the cost to replace our drilling rigs at the
end of their useful lives, including financing costs. This estimate is based on a number of assumptions including estimated financing
costs, the remaining useful lives of the drilling rigs, estimated out of service costs, drilling rig replacement values based on current
market conditions and the residual value of the drilling rigs.
Regulatory, Industry and Economic Factors
Our forecast for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015 is based on the following assumptions related to regulatory, industry
and economic factors:
•
•
•
•
•
•
no material nonperformance or credit-related defaults by suppliers, customers or vendors;
no new regulation or any interpretation of existing regulations or governmental action that, in either case, would be
materially adverse to our business;
no material accidents, environmental incidents, releases, weather-related incidents, unscheduled downtime or similar
unanticipated events;
no major adverse change in the markets in which we operate resulting from oil production disruptions, reduced demand for
oil or significant changes in the market prices of oil;
no material changes to applicable tax laws, treaties or the interpretation thereof in the markets in which we operate and no
material tax disputes; and
no material changes to market, regulatory and overall economic conditions or in prevailing interest rates.
Noncontrolling Interest. The noncontrolling interest reflects the 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each RigCo that is owned by
the Transocean Member, as those entities will be controlled and consolidated by us. We have assumed that our and the Transocean
Member’s respective ownership interests in the RigCos remains unchanged during the forecast period.
Forecast of Compliance with Debt Covenants. Our ability to make distributions could be affected if we and Transocean do not
remain in compliance with the covenants in our respective financing agreements. We have assumed that we and Transocean will be
in compliance with all of the covenants in such financing agreements during the forecast period. Please read “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a further description
of our financing agreements.

PROVISIONS OF OUR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT RELATING TO CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
Distributions of Available Cash
General
Within 60 days after the end of each quarter, beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2014, we will distribute all of our
available cash (defined below) to unitholders of record on the applicable record date. We will adjust the minimum quarterly
distribution for the period from the closing of this offering through September 30, 2014, based on the actual length of the period.
Definition of Available Cash
Available cash generally means, for each fiscal quarter, all cash on hand at the end of that quarter (including our proportionate share
of cash on hand of subsidiaries we do not wholly own, including the RigCos):
•
less, the amount of cash reserves (including our proportionate share of cash reserves of certain subsidiaries we do not
wholly own, including the RigCos) established by our board of directors to:
•
•
•
provide for the proper conduct of our business (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated
future debt service requirements) subsequent to that quarter;
comply with applicable law, any debt instruments or other agreements; and
provide funds for distributions to our unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters (provided that our board
of directors may not establish cash reserves for distributions if the effect of the establishment of such reserves will
prevent us from paying the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units and any cumulative arrearages on
such common units for the current quarter);
•
•
plus, all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash resulting from cash distributions received after the end
of such quarter on equity interests in any person other than a subsidiary held by us or any of our subsidiaries, which
distributions are paid by such person in respect of operations conducted by such person during such quarter;
plus, if our board of directors so determines, all or any portion of the cash on hand (including our proportionate share of
cash on hand of subsidiaries we do not wholly own, including the RigCos) on the date of determination of available cash
for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made subsequent to the end of such quarter.
The purpose and effect of the last bullet point above is to allow our board of directors, if it so decides, to use cash from working capital
borrowings made after the end of the quarter but on or before the date of determination of available cash for that quarter to pay
distributions to unitholders. Under our limited liability company agreement, working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that
are made under a credit facility, commercial paper facility or similar financing arrangement, and in all cases are used solely for
working capital purposes or to pay distributions to members and with the intent of the borrower to repay such borrowings within twelve
months with funds other than from additional working capital borrowings.
Intent to Distribute the Minimum Quarterly Distribution
We intend to distribute to the holders of common units and subordinated units on a quarterly basis at least the minimum quarterly
distribution of $0.3625 per unit, or $1.45 per unit per year, to the extent we have sufficient cash on hand to pay the distribution after we
establish cash reserves and pay fees and expenses, including reimbursements of expenses to the Transocean Member and its
affiliates. The amount of available cash from operating surplus needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution for one quarter on all
units outstanding immediately after this offering is approximately $25 million. However, there is no guarantee that we will pay
74
Table of Contents
the minimum quarterly distribution on our units in any quarter. Even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked, the
amount of distributions paid and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our board of directors, taking into
consideration the terms of our limited liability company agreement.
Incentive Distribution Rights
The Transocean Member currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum
of 50 percent, of the cash we distribute from operating surplus (as defined below) in excess of $0.416875 per unit per quarter;
provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the application of our distribution formula would result in the holders of the common units
receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter, then the distribution to
the holders of the incentive distribution rights will be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to
the holders of the common units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter. The maximum
distribution of 50 percent does not include any distributions the Transocean Member or its affiliates may receive on common or
subordinated units that they own. Please read “—Incentive Distribution Rights” below for additional information.
Operating Surplus and Capital Surplus
General
All cash distributed to unitholders will be characterized as either being paid from “operating surplus” or “capital surplus.” We treat
distributions of available cash from operating surplus differently than distributions of available cash from capital surplus.
Operating Surplus
We define operating surplus as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
$50.0 million (as described below); plus
all of our cash receipts (or our proportionate share of cash receipts in the case of subsidiaries that are not wholly owned)
after the closing of this offering, excluding cash from interim capital transactions (as defined below), provided that cash
receipts from the termination of a commodity hedge, currency hedge or interest rate hedge prior to its stipulated settlement
or termination date shall be included in operating surplus in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life
of such commodity hedge, currency hedge or interest rate hedge; plus
working capital borrowings made after the end of a quarter but on or before the date of determination of operating surplus
for that quarter; plus
cash distributions on equity interests in any entity other than subsidiaries held by us or any of our subsidiaries received
after the end of the quarter but on or before the date of determination of operating surplus for that quarter in respect of
operations of such entity and not from sources that would constitute interim capital transactions if paid by us; plus
cash distributions (including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights) paid in respect of equity issued, other
than equity issued in this offering, to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures in respect of the period from
the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction, development, replacement, improvement or
expansion of a capital asset and ending on the earlier to occur of the date the capital asset commences commercial service
and the date that it is abandoned or disposed of; less
cash distributions (including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights) paid in respect of equity issued, other
than equity issued in this offering, to pay interest and related fees on debt incurred, or to pay distributions on equity issued,
to finance the expansion capital expenditures referred to in the prior bullet point; less
Table of Contents
75
•
•
•
•
all of our operating expenditures (as defined below), which includes estimated maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures, after the closing of this offering; less
the amount of cash reserves established by our board of directors to provide funds for future operating expenditures; less
all working capital borrowings not repaid within twelve months after having been incurred or repaid within such twelve
month period with the proceeds of additional working capital borrowings; less
any cash loss realized on dispositions of assets acquired using investment capital expenditures.
As described above, operating surplus does not reflect actual cash on hand that is available for distribution to our unitholders and is
not limited to cash generated by operations. For example, it includes a provision that will enable us, if we choose, to distribute as
operating surplus up to $50.0 million of cash we receive in the future from non-operating sources such as asset sales, issuances of
securities and long-term borrowings that would otherwise be distributed as capital surplus. In addition, the effect of including, as
described above, certain cash distributions on equity interests in operating surplus will be to increase operating surplus by the
amount of any such cash distributions. As a result, we may also distribute as operating surplus up to the amount of any such cash that
we receive from non-operating sources.
The proceeds of working capital borrowings increase operating surplus and repayments of working capital borrowings are generally
operating expenditures (as described below) and thus reduce operating surplus when repayments are made. However, if working
capital borrowings, which increase operating surplus, are not repaid during the twelve-month period following the borrowing, they will
be deemed repaid at the end of such period, thus decreasing operating surplus at such time. When such working capital borrowings
are in fact repaid, they will not be treated as a further reduction in operating surplus because operating surplus will have been
previously reduced by the deemed repayment.
We define interim capital transactions as (i) borrowings, refinancings or refundings of indebtedness (other than working capital
borrowings and items purchased on open account or for a deferred purchase price in the ordinary course of business) and sales of
debt securities, (ii) issuances of equity securities, (iii) sales or other dispositions of assets, other than sales or other dispositions of
inventory, accounts receivable and other assets in the ordinary course of business and sales or other dispositions of assets as part of
normal asset retirements or replacements and (iv) capital contributions received.
We define operating expenditures as all of our cash expenditures, including, but not limited to, taxes, reimbursements of expenses of
the Transocean Member and its affiliates, officer, director and employee compensation, interest payments, estimated maintenance
capital expenditures, payments made in the ordinary course of business under interest rate hedge contracts, currency hedge contracts
and commodity hedge contracts (provided that payments made in connection with the termination of any interest rate hedge contract,
currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract prior to the stipulated settlement or termination date specified therein will be
included in operating expenditures in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of such interest rate hedge
contract, currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract and amounts paid in connection with the initial purchase of an interest
rate hedge contract, currency hedge contract or a commodity hedge contract will be amortized over the life of such interest rate hedge
contract, currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract), maintenance and replacement capital expenditures (as discussed in
further detail below), and repayment of working capital borrowings; provided, however, that operating expenditures will not include:
•
•
•
repayments of working capital borrowings where such borrowings have previously been deemed to have been repaid (as
described above);
payments (including prepayments and prepayment penalties) of principal of and premium on indebtedness, other than
working capital borrowings;
expansion capital expenditures, investment capital expenditures or actual maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures (which are discussed in further detail under “—Capital Expenditures” below);
Table of Contents
76
•
•
•
payment of transaction expenses (including taxes) relating to interim capital transactions;
distributions to our members; or
repurchases of limited liability company interests (excluding repurchases we make to satisfy obligations under employee
benefit plans).
Capital Surplus
Capital surplus is defined in our limited liability company agreement as any distribution of available cash in excess of our operating
surplus. Accordingly, except as described above, capital surplus would generally be generated by:
•
•
•
•
borrowings other than working capital borrowings;
sales of our equity and debt securities;
sales or other dispositions of assets, other than inventory, accounts receivable and other assets sold in the ordinary course
of business or as part of ordinary course retirement or replacement of assets; and
capital contributions received.
Characterization of Cash Distributions
Our limited liability company agreement requires that we treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating surplus until the
sum of all available cash distributed since the closing of this offering equals the operating surplus from the closing of this offering
through the end of the quarter immediately preceding that distribution. Our limited liability company agreement requires that we treat
any amount distributed in excess of operating surplus, regardless of its source, as capital surplus. Our limited liability company
agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the consideration for the issuance of units, which is as a return of
capital. We do not anticipate that we will make any distributions from capital surplus.
Capital Expenditures
Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are those cash expenditures required to maintain, over the long-term, the
operating capacity, asset base or operating income of the company. In our limited liability company agreement, we refer to these
expenditures as “maintenance capital expenditures.” Examples of maintenance and replacement capital expenditures include
expenditures associated with maintenance, modifying an existing drilling rig or acquiring a new drilling rig to the extent such
expenditures are incurred to maintain the operating capacity, asset base or operating income of the fleet. Maintenance and
replacement capital expenditures will also include interest and related fees (including periodic net payments under related interest
rate swap agreements) on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued (including the amount of any incremental distributions
made to the holders of our incentive distribution rights) to finance the construction of a capital improvement and paid in respect of the
construction period, which we define as the period beginning on the date that we enter into a binding construction contract and ending
on the earlier of the date that the capital improvement commences commercial service or the date that the capital improvement is
abandoned or disposed of. Debt incurred to pay or equity issued to fund construction period interest payments, and distributions on
such equity (including the amount of any incremental distributions made to the holders of our incentive distribution rights), will also be
considered maintenance and replacement capital expenditures.
Expansion capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred to increase, over the long-term, the operating capacity, asset base or
operating income of the company. Examples of expansion capital expenditures include expenditures associated with acquiring a new
drilling rig or improving an existing drilling rig to the extent those expenditures increase, over the long term, the operating capacity,
asset base or operating income of the company. Expansion capital expenditures will also include interest and related fees (including
periodic net payments under
Table of Contents
77
related interest rate swap agreements) on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued (including the amount of any incremental
distributions made to the holders of our incentive distribution rights) to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures paid
in respect of the construction period.
Investment capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that are neither maintenance and replacement capital expenditures
nor expansion capital expenditures. Investment capital expenditures largely will consist of capital expenditures made for investment
purposes. Examples of investment capital expenditures include traditional capital expenditures for investment purposes, such as
purchases of equity securities, as well as other capital expenditures that might be made in lieu of such traditional investment capital
expenditures, such as the acquisition of a capital asset for investment purposes.
Capital expenditures that are made in part for maintenance and replacement capital purposes, investment capital purposes and/or
expansion capital purposes will be allocated as maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, investment capital expenditures
or expansion capital expenditures by our board of directors.
Because maintenance and replacement capital expenditures can be very large and vary significantly in timing, the amount of actual
maintenance and replacement capital expenditures may differ substantially from period to period, which could cause similar
fluctuations in the amounts of operating surplus, adjusted operating surplus and available cash for distribution to our unitholders if we
subtracted actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus each quarter. Accordingly, to eliminate
the effect on operating surplus of these fluctuations, our limited liability company agreement requires that an amount equal to an
estimate of the average quarterly maintenance and replacement capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating capacity of
or the revenue generated by our capital assets over the long-term be subtracted from operating surplus each quarter, as opposed to
the actual amounts spent. In our limited liability company agreement, we refer to these estimated maintenance and replacement
capital expenditures to be subtracted from operating surplus as “estimated maintenance capital expenditures.” The amount of
estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by
our board of directors at least once a year, provided that any change must be approved by our conflicts committee. The estimate will
be made at least annually and whenever an event occurs that is likely to result in a material adjustment to the amount of our
maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, such as a major acquisition or the introduction of new governmental regulations
that will affect the fleet. For purposes of calculating operating surplus, any adjustment to this estimate will be prospective only. For a
discussion of the amounts we have allocated toward estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, please read “Our
Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions.”
The use of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures in calculating operating surplus will have the following
effects:
•
•
•
•
it will reduce the risk that actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures in any one quarter will be large enough
to make operating surplus less than the minimum quarterly distribution to be paid on all the units for that quarter and
subsequent quarters;
it may reduce the need for us to borrow to pay distributions;
it will be more difficult for us to raise our distribution above the minimum quarterly distribution and pay incentive
distributions to the Transocean Member; and
it will reduce the likelihood that a large maintenance and replacement capital expenditure in a period will prevent
Transocean from being able to convert some or all of its subordinated units into common units since the effect of an
estimate is to spread the expected expense over several periods, mitigating the effect of the actual payment of the
expenditure on any single period.
78
Table of Contents
Subordination Period
General
Our limited liability company agreement provides that, during the subordination period (which we define below), the common units will
have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus each quarter in an amount equal to $0.3625 per
common unit, which amount is defined in our partnership agreement as the minimum quarterly distribution, plus any arrearages in the
payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters, before any distributions of available cash from
operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units. These units are deemed “subordinated” because for a period of time,
referred to as the subordination period, the subordinated units will not be entitled to receive any distributions until the common units
have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages from prior quarters. Furthermore, no arrearages will accrue or
be payable on the subordinated units. The practical effect of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that, during the
subordination period, there will be available cash to be distributed on the common units.
Subordination Period
Except as described below, the subordination period will begin on the closing date of this offering and will extend until the first
business day following the distribution of available cash in respect of any quarter beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2019,
that each of the following tests are met:
•
•
aggregate distributions of available cash from operating surplus on the outstanding common units, subordinated units and
any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units with respect to each of
the three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods immediately preceding such date equaled or exceeded $1.45
(the annualized minimum quarterly distribution) on all outstanding common units and subordinated units and any other
outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units, in each case in respect of such
periods;
the adjusted operating surplus for each of the three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods immediately
preceding such date equaled or exceeded $1.45 (the annualized minimum quarterly distribution) on all of the common
units, subordinated units and any other units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units that
were outstanding during such periods on a fully diluted weighted average basis; and
•
there are no arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units.
Expiration Upon Removal of the Transocean Member
In addition, if the unitholders remove the Transocean Member other than for cause and no units held by the Transocean Member and
its affiliates voted in favor of the removal:
•
•
•
the subordinated units held by any person will immediately and automatically convert into common units on a one-for-one
basis;
all cumulative common unit arrearages on the common units will be extinguished and the subordination period will end;
the holders of the incentive distribution rights (initially, the Transocean Member) will have the right to convert their incentive
distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests.
Expiration of the Subordination Period
When the subordination period ends upon satisfaction of the test described above or upon removal of the Transocean Member as
described above, each outstanding subordinated unit will convert into one common unit and will thereafter participate pro rata with the
other common units in distributions of available cash.
Table of Contents
Adjusted Operating Surplus
79
Adjusted operating surplus is intended to reflect the cash generated from operations during a particular period and therefore excludes
net drawdowns of reserves of cash established in prior periods. Adjusted operating surplus for any period consists of:
•
•
•
•
•
•
operating surplus generated with respect to that period (excluding any amounts attributable to the item described in the first
bullet point under the caption “—Operating Surplus and Capital Surplus—Operating Surplus” above); less
any net increase in working capital borrowings with respect to that period; less
any net decrease in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period not relating to an operating
expenditure made with respect to that period; plus
any net decrease in working capital borrowings with respect to that period; plus
any net increase in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period required by any debt instrument for
the repayment of principal, interest or premium; plus
any net decrease made in subsequent periods to cash reserves for operating expenditures initially established with respect
to that period to the extent such decrease results in a reduction in adjusted operating surplus in subsequent periods.
Distributions of Available Cash From Operating Surplus During the Subordination Period
We will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter during the subordination period in the following
manner:
•
•
•
•
first, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount
equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter;
second, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount
equal to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during
the subordination period;
third, 100 percent to the subordinated unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each subordinated unit an amount equal
to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter; and
thereafter, in the manner described in “—Incentive Distribution Rights” below.
The preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.
Distributions of Available Cash From Operating Surplus After the Subordination Period
We will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter after the subordination period in the following
manner:
•
•
first, 100 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding unit an amount equal to the minimum
quarterly distribution for that quarter; and
thereafter, in the manner described in “—Incentive Distribution Rights” below.
The preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.
80
Table of Contents
Transocean Member Interest
The Transocean Member owns a transferrable non-economic limited liability company interest in us, which does not entitle it to
receive cash distributions. However, the Transocean Member owns common units, subordinated units and incentive distribution rights
(as further explained below) in us and may in the future own other equity securities in us and is, or will be, entitled to receive
distributions on any such interests.
Incentive Distribution Rights
Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from
operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved. The Transocean
Member will hold the incentive distribution rights following completion of this offering. The incentive distribution rights may be
transferred separately from the Transocean Member interest. Any transfer by the Transocean Member of the incentive distribution
rights would not change the percentage allocations of quarterly distributions with respect to such rights.
If for any quarter:
•
•
we have distributed available cash from operating surplus to the common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal
to the minimum quarterly distribution; and
we have distributed available cash from operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to
eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution;
then, we will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders in the following
manner:
•
•
•
•
first, 100 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.416875 per unit for that quarter (the
“first target distribution”);
second, 85 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, and 15 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro rata,
until each unitholder receives a total of $0.453125 per unit for that quarter (the “second target distribution”);
third, 75 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, and 25 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro rata, until
each unitholder receives a total of $0.543750 per unit for that quarter (the “third target distribution”); and
thereafter, 50 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, and 50 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro rata.
In each case, the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders to eliminate
any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth above assume that we
do not issue additional classes of equity securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any quarter in which the application of the
formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of
available cash for such quarter, then the distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution rights will be reduced, pro rata, to the
extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of
available cash for such quarter.
Percentage Allocations of Available Cash From Operating Surplus
The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of the additional available cash from operating surplus among the
unitholders and the holders of the incentive distribution rights up to the various target distribution levels. The amounts set forth under
“Marginal Percentage Interest in Distributions” are the percentage interests of the unitholders and the holders of the incentive
distribution rights in any available cash

from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column “Total Quarterly Distribution Target
Amount,” until available cash from operating surplus we distribute reaches the next target distribution level, if any. The percentage
interests shown for the unitholders and the holders of the incentive distribution rights for the minimum quarterly distribution are also
applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth
below assume that there are no arrearages on common units.

Distributions From Capital Surplus
How Distributions From Capital Surplus Will Be Made
We will make distributions of available cash from capital surplus, if any, in the following manner:
•
•
first, 100 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, until the minimum quarterly distribution is reduced to zero, as described below;
second, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each common unit, an amount of available
cash from capital surplus equal to any unpaid arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common
units; and
•
thereafter, as if such distributions were from operating surplus.
The preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.
Effect of a Distribution from Capital Surplus
The limited liability company agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the consideration for the issuance
of the units, which is a return of capital. Each time a distribution of capital surplus is made, the minimum quarterly distribution and the
target distribution levels will be reduced in the same proportion as the distribution had to the fair market value of the common units
prior to the announcement of the distribution. Because distributions of capital surplus will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution,
after any of these distributions are made, it may be easier for the Transocean Member to receive incentive distributions and for the
subordinated units to convert into common units. However, any distribution of capital surplus before the minimum quarterly distribution
is reduced to zero cannot be applied to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution or any arrearages.
Once we reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to zero, we will then make all future distributions
50 percent to the holders of units and 50 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights (initially, the Transocean Member;
provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the application of our distribution formula would result in the holders of the common units
receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter, then the distribution to
the holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to
the holders of the common units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter).

82
Adjustment to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distribution Levels
In addition to adjusting the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels to reflect a distribution of capital surplus, if we
combine our common units into fewer common units or subdivide our common units into a greater number of common units, we will
proportionately adjust:
•
•
•
•
the minimum quarterly distribution;
the target distribution levels;
the initial unit price; and
the arrearages per common unit in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units.
For example, if a two-for-one split of the common units should occur, the minimum quarterly distribution, the target distribution levels
and the initial unit price would each be reduced to 50 percent of its initial level. If we combine our common units into a lesser number
of units or subdivide our common units into a greater number of units, we will combine our subordinated units or subdivide our
subordinated units, using the same ratio applied to the common units. We will not make any adjustment by reason of the issuance of
additional units for cash or property.
Distributions of Cash Upon Liquidation
If we dissolve in accordance with the limited liability company agreement, we will sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process
called liquidation. We will apply the proceeds of liquidation in the manner set forth below.
If, as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed liquidation, the average closing price for our common
units for the preceding 20 trading days (the “current market price”) is greater than the sum of:
•
•
any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the
subordination period; plus
the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a
partial liquidation);
then the proceeds of the liquidation will be applied as follows:
•
•
•
first, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount
equal to the current market price of our common units;
second, 100 percent to the subordinated unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each subordinated unit an amount
equal to the current market price of our common units; and
thereafter, 50 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, 50 percent to holders of incentive distribution rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving, in the
aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation, then the application of the proceeds of liquidation to the
holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate application of the
proceeds of liquidation to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation.
Table of Contents
83
If, as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed liquidation, the current market price of our common
units is equal to or less than the sum of:
•
any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the
subordination period; plus
•
the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a
partial liquidation);
then the proceeds of the liquidation will be applied as follows:
•
•
•
first, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount
equal to the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection
with a partial liquidation);
second, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount
equal to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during
the subordination period;
third, 100 percent to the subordinated unitholders, until we distribute for each outstanding subordinated unit an amount
equal to the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection
with a partial liquidation); and
•
thereafter, 50 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, 50 percent to holders of incentive distribution rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving, in the
aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation, then the application of the proceeds of liquidation to the
holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate application of the
proceeds of liquidation to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation.
The immediately preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.

(1) Represents cash used to fund capital expenditures.
(2) An operating day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period
after commencement of operations.
(3) Average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenues earned per operating day. Our average daily revenue fluctuates
relative to market conditions and our revenue efficiency. Average daily revenues increased in the three months ended March 31,
2014 relative to the three months ended March 31, 2013 due to an increase in revenue efficiency resulting from lower unplanned
downtime and an increase in operating dayrates associated with cost escalation adjustments that reflect increases in our
operating costs. Average daily revenues decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 relative to the year ended
December 31, 2012 due to a decrease in revenue efficiency resulting from unplanned downtime. This decrease was slightly
offset by an increase in operating dayrates associated with cost escalation adjustments that reflect increases in our operating
costs.
(4) Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by the maximum revenue
calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest amount of
contract drilling revenues the drilling unit could earn for the measurement period, excluding amounts related to incentive
provisions. Our revenue efficiency rate varies due to revenues earned under alternative contractual dayrates, such as a waiting-
on-weather rate, repair rate,

standby rate, force majeure rate or zero rate, that may apply under certain circumstances. Revenue efficiency increased in the
three months ended March 31, 2014 relative to the three months ended March 31, 2013 resulting from lower unplanned
downtime associated primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea equipment. Revenue efficiency was lower in
the year ended December 31, 2013 relative to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to unplanned downtime associated
primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea equipment.
(5) Rig utilization is defined as the total number of operating days divided by the total number of rig calendar days in the
measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Our rig utilization rate declines as a result of idle and stacked rigs and during
shipyard and mobilization periods to the extent these rigs are not earning revenues.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the historical
unaudited condensed combined financial statements and related notes and the audited combined financial statements and related
notes of our Predecessor included elsewhere in this prospectus. Among other things, those combined financial statements include
more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from
those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified
below and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this prospectus.
The following discussion assumes that our business was operated as a separate entity prior to its inception. The interest in the
assets, liabilities and operations of our Predecessor will be acquired in a reorganization under common control and have therefore
been recorded at Transocean’s historical values. The unaudited condensed combined financial statements and the audited combined
financial statements, the results of which are discussed below, have been carved out of the consolidated financial statements of
Transocean, which operated the rigs in our fleet during the periods presented. Transocean’s drilling rigs and other assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses that do not relate to the rigs to be acquired by us are not included in our unaudited condensed combined
financial statements and our audited combined financial statements. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
reflected in our unaudited condensed combined financial statements and our audited combined financial statements include all
expenses allocable to our business, but may not be indicative of those that would have been incurred had we operated as a separate
public entity for all periods presented or of future results.
The combined net assets and results of operations of 100 percent ownership in each of two ultra-deepwater drillships (Discoverer
Inspiration and Discoverer Clear Leader) and one semi-submersible drilling rig (Development Driller III) are collectively referred to as
our “Predecessor.”
Business
We are a growth-oriented limited liability company recently formed by Transocean, one of the world’s largest offshore drilling
contractors, to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. Our initial assets consist of a
51 percent interest in three ultra-deepwater drilling rigs that are currently operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We generate revenue
through contract drilling services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and work crews on a
dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.
The historical results discussed below, and the unaudited condensed combined financial statements and related notes and the
audited combined financial statements and related notes of what we refer to as “our Predecessor” included elsewhere in this
prospectus, represent 100 percent of the combined results of operations of all three drilling rigs in our initial fleet.
Upon the completion of this offering, we will own a 51 percent interest in each of the RigCos. We will control each RigCo through our
ownership of the majority of its shares or limited liability company interests. The Transocean Member will own the remaining 49
percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos.
The RigCos own the following three drilling rigs:
•
the ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Inspiration, which commenced operations in 2010 and is currently under a contract
with Chevron through April 2020;
Table of Contents
88
•
•
the ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Clear Leader, which commenced operations in 2009 and is currently under a
contract with Chevron through September 2018; and
the ultra-deepwater semi-submersible drilling rig Development Driller III, which commenced operations in 2009 and is
currently under a contract with BP through November 2016.
As discussed below under “—Operating Results—Items You Should Consider When Evaluating Our Historical Financial
Performance and Assessing Our Future Prospects,” upon closing of this offering, we will only own a 51 percent interest in each of the
RigCos and thus will be entitled to only 51 percent of the RigCos’ distributions, if any. References in this “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” to the “RigCos” when used in a historical context refer to Transocean
Partners LLC Predecessor, and when used in the present tense or prospectively refers to the RigCos and their subsidiaries.
Upon the closing of this offering, our interest in the RigCos will represent our only cash-generating asset. We anticipate growing by
acquiring additional drilling rigs and operations indirectly through additional rig-owning and rig-operating entities and by acquiring
additional equity interests in the RigCos.
Our contract drilling services operations are currently concentrated in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Although rigs can be moved from one
region to another, the cost of moving rigs and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to
fluctuate somewhat between regions. Still, significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig
mobility. We consider that our fleet operates in a single, global market for the provision of contract drilling services. The location of our
rigs and the allocation of resources to operate or upgrade rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our customers.
Our Drilling Contracts
The current contracts to provide offshore drilling services associated with the drilling rigs in our initial fleet were individually
negotiated and vary in their terms and provisions. We generally obtain most of our drilling contracts through competitive bidding
against other contractors and direct negotiations with operators. Our current drilling contracts provide for payment on a dayrate basis,
with higher rates for periods while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates or zero rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling
operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions some of
which are beyond our control. Our current drilling contracts extend over a stated term, but may be longer in duration depending on
wells in progress and other factors not under our control.
Our current drilling contracts with customers are cancellable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination
payment. Such payments, however, may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Our contracts also provide for either
automatic termination, or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various
circumstances such as non-performance, in the event of extended downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or
operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events. Some of these events are beyond our control. The
contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an
additional term. Our contracts also include a provision that allows the customer to extend the contract to finish drilling a well-in-
progress.
Performance and Other Key Indicators
Contract backlog. Contract backlog represents the maximum contract drilling revenues that can be earned considering the
contractual operating dayrate in effect during the firm contract period and represents the basis for the maximum revenues in our
revenue efficiency measurement. To determine maximum revenues for purposes of calculating revenue efficiency, however, we
include the revenues earned for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation or other incentive provisions, which are
excluded from the amounts presented for contract backlog.
Table of Contents
89
Our contract backlog includes only firm commitments, which are represented by signed drilling contracts. The contractual operating
dayrate may be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive or an alternative contractual dayrate, such as a waiting-on-
weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate, may apply under certain circumstances. The contractual operating
dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or
suspension of operations. In certain contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated
period of time.
At June 12, 2014, the contract backlog and current contract terms, dayrates and customers for our initial fleet were as follows:

(1) Contract start and completion dates are estimated. Contract start dates depend on delivery by shipyards, testing and customer
acceptance. Contracts could be longer in duration depending on wells in progress and other factors not in our control.
Completion dates represent our current estimate of the earliest date the contract for each rig is likely to expire. New contracts do
not commence until the prior contract has been completed.
(2) Represents the maximum contractual operating dayrate, which is subject to change due to cost escalations. The dayrate
includes pre-operating revenues of $22,000 per day for the Discoverer Inspiration contract ending in March 2015 and $19,000
per day for the Discoverer Clear Leader contract ending in September 2014 for various customer requested upgrades and
equipment. The dayrate excludes amortization of drilling contract intangible revenues as well as all other pre-operating
revenues that terminate at the end of the rigs’ current contracts.
The average dayrate actually earned over the term of the contract will reflect various reduced rates received under the contract as a
result of time billed according to standby rates, waiting-on-weather rates, maintenance rates or other similar rates, which typically are
less than the contract dayrate. In addition, the amount shown does not reflect incentive programs, which are typically based on the
rig’s operating performance against a performance curve. Please read “—Average Daily Revenue” and “—Revenue Efficiency” for
additional information.
(3) The dayrate for the remainder of the contract is linked to the standard West Texas Intermediate crude oil price with a floor of $40
per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $400,000 and a ceiling of $70 per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $500,000,
before cost escalation adjustments of $50,000 per day and pre- operating revenues of $19,000 per day.

The actual amounts of revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will differ from the amounts and
periods shown in the tables above due to various factors, including shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime and
other factors that result in lower applicable dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate. Additional factors that could affect the
amount and timing of actual revenue to be recognized include customer liquidity issues and contract terminations, which are available
to our customers under certain circumstances.
Average daily revenue. Average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenues earned per operating day. An operating day is
defined as a calendar day during which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period after commencement of
operations. The average daily revenue for our initial fleet was as follows:

Our average daily revenue fluctuates relative to market conditions and our revenue efficiency.
Average daily revenues increased in the three months ended March 31, 2014 relative to the three months ended December 31, 2013
due to an increase in revenue efficiency resulting from lower unplanned downtime and an increase in operating dayrates associated
with cost escalation adjustments that reflect increases in our operating costs.

Average daily revenues decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013 relative to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to a
decrease in revenue efficiency resulting from unplanned downtime. This decrease was slightly offset by an increase in operating
dayrates associated with cost escalation adjustments that reflect increases in our operating costs.
Revenue efficiency. Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by the
maximum revenue calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage. Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest
amount of contract drilling revenues the drilling unit could earn for the measurement period, excluding amounts related to incentive
provisions. The revenue efficiency rates for our initial fleet were as follows:

Operating Results
Items You Should Consider When Evaluating Our Historical Financial Performance and Assessing Our Future Prospects
You should consider the following facts when evaluating our historical results of operations and assessing our future prospects:
•
We do not own all of the interests in the RigCos. As a result, our cash flow will not include distributions on the
Transocean Member’s interest in the RigCos. Upon the completion of this offering, we will own a 51 percent interest in
each RigCo through our ownership of the majority of each RigCo’s shares or limited liability company interests. The
Transocean Member will own the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each RigCo. We and the Transocean
Member have entered into governing documents for each of the RigCos that govern the ownership and management of
each of the RigCos. Each of the RigCos is managed by its board of directors. Pursuant to such governing documents, we
are able to control the election of these boards of directors as the majority interest owner. Subject to the approval of the
board of directors of each of the RigCos, each RigCo will transfer its available cash to its equityholders each quarter. In
determining the amount of cash available for distribution to us by the RigCos and by us to our unitholders, the board of
directors of each of the RigCos and our board of directors must approve the amount of cash reserves to be set aside,
including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, working capital and other matters.
Distributions by the RigCos to the Transocean Member in respect of its ownership interest in the RigCos will not be
included in our cash flow in the future.

Our historical combined results of operations reflect allocated administrative costs that may not be indicative of
future administrative costs. The administrative costs included in the Predecessor’s unaudited condensed combined
financial statements and audited combined financial statements have been determined by allocating to us a portion of
Transocean’s administrative costs incurred by other entities in the Transocean corporate group. These shared costs are
charged to the respective RigCos at cost, or in some cases at cost plus a margin specified in the master services
agreements and are allocated based on rig type, with a greater portion of costs charged to the larger drilling rigs compared
to the smaller drilling rigs. These allocated costs may not be indicative of our future administrative costs. In connection with
this offering, we will enter into master services agreements pursuant to which subsidiaries of Transocean will provide
management, administrative, financial and other support services to us, and we will reimburse such subsidiaries of
Transocean for costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of those services, and pay a service fee,
under such agreements.
We will incur additional general and administrative expense as a publicly traded company. We expect we will incur
approximately $10 million annually in additional general and administrative expenses as a publicly traded limited liability
company that we have not previously incurred, including costs associated with annual reports to unitholders, tax return
preparation, investor relations, registrar and transfer agent fees, audit fees, legal fees, incremental director and officer
liability insurance costs, directors’ compensation and maintaining our U.K. offices.
We expect to enter into a credit agreement and issue a 364-day working capital note payable in connection with
this offering. As a result, our operating results will include interest expense for commitment fees and outstanding
borrowings. In connection with the offering, we expect to enter into the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility and this new
agreement may not be on the same terms as Transocean’s financing agreements. Our Predecessor currently has no debt
and thus has not recognized any interest expense in its combined statements of operations. We will have a $43 million
364-day working capital note payable and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Following the
completion of this offering, we will have interest expense related to the 364-day working capital note payable and
commitment fees. For descriptions of our current financing agreements, please read “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Revolving credit facilities.”
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
We believe the principal factors that will affect our future results of operations include:
•
•
the offshore drilling market, including the impact of enhanced regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, supply
and demand, rig utilization rates, dayrates, customer drilling programs, commodity prices, stacking of rigs, reactivation of
rigs, effects of new rigs on the market and effects of declines in commodity prices, which influence the demand for offshore
drilling services, and a downturn in the global economy or market outlook for our various geographical operating sectors
and classes of rigs;
the terms of our customer drilling contracts, including contract backlog, force majeure provisions, contract commencements,
contract extensions, contract terminations, contract option exercises, contract revenues, contract awards and rig
mobilizations;
•
•
•
•
our ability to successfully employ our drilling rigs at economically attractive dayrates as our current contracts are completed
or are otherwise terminated;
the number and availability of our drilling rigs, including our ability to purchase the four drilling rigs (or majority interest
therein) that Transocean will be required to offer us or any other drilling rigs in the future;
the effective and efficient technical management of our drilling rigs;
accidents, natural disasters, adverse weather, equipment failures or other events outside of our control that, together with
shipyard and planned maintenance, will result in downtime;

our ability to maintain good relationships with our existing customers and to increase the number of customer relationships;
investments in recruitment, retention and personnel development initiatives;
our ability to obtain and maintain major oil and gas company approvals and to satisfy their quality, technical, health, safety
and compliance standards;
the effects of regulation, litigation and compliance with the Consent Decree, the EPA Agreement or any similar agreement
relating to the Macondo well incident;
debt levels, including impacts of a financial and economic downturn;
the level of any distributions on our common units;
changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations of any country in which we are resident or in which we have operations, or a
loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our transfer pricing policies in certain countries;
changes in our ownership interests in the RigCos; and
our access to capital required to acquire additional drilling rigs or equity interests in the RigCos and/or to implement our
business strategy.
Please read “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks inherent in our business that will also affect our future results of operations.
Inflation
All of our drilling rigs operate under long-term contracts. As of July 7, 2014, the average remaining contract term was approximately
4.1 years for our drilling rigs. All of these contracts have dayrates that are fixed over the contract term. In order to mitigate the effects of
inflation on revenues from long-term contracts, all of our long-term contracts include escalation provisions. These provisions allow us
to adjust the dayrates based on certain publicly available cost indices and certain changes in our actual operating expenses.
However, because these escalations are normally performed on a periodic basis, the timing and amount awarded as a result of such
adjustments may differ from actual cost increases, which could adversely affect the stability of the RigCos and our cash flow and
ability to make cash distributions.

Operating revenues. Contract drilling revenues increased for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2013 primarily due to approximately $29 million of increased revenues due to higher revenue efficiency resulting
from reduced downtime associated primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea equipment in the same period in the
prior year and approximately $3 million of increased revenues due to cost escalation provisions.
Costs and expenses. Operating and maintenance costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2014
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013 primarily due to blowout preventer recertification costs recognized in the same
period in the current year.
Income tax expense. The following income tax expense data represents the historical of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor tax
structure, which includes the subsidiaries of Transocean that have interests in the drilling rigs in the Company’s initial fleet and the
associated rig-operating companies. For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, our annual effective tax rates were
8.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively, based on income before income taxes. The tax effect of settlements of prior year tax
liabilities and changes in prior year tax estimates are all treated as discrete period tax expenses or benefits. For the three months
ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the effect of the various discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of less than $1 million. For
the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, these discrete tax items resulted in effective tax rates of 8.7 percent and 10.8
percent, respectively, on income before income taxes.

Operating revenues. Contract drilling revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012 primarily due to approximately $64 million of decreased revenues due to lower revenue efficiency caused by
downtime associated primarily with repairs to blowout preventers and other subsea equipment. This was partially offset by
approximately $23 million of increased revenues due to improved contract terms and cost escalation provisions.
Costs and expenses. Operating and maintenance costs and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $9 million of increased personnel costs,
(b) approximately $5 million of increased costs for allocated fleet costs on shared personnel and shared equipment, (c) approximately
$4 million of increased costs for required well control system recertification and (d) approximately $4 million of increased costs for
between well maintenance on subsea equipment, including the well control system.
Income tax expense. The following income tax expense data represents the historical of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor tax
structure, which includes the subsidiaries of Transocean that have interests in the drilling rigs in the Company’s initial fleet and the
associated rig-operating companies. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, our annual effective tax rates were 10.4
percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, based on income before income taxes. The tax effect of settlements of prior year tax liabilities
and changes in prior year tax estimates are all treated as discrete period tax expenses or benefits. For the years ended December 31,
2013 and 2012, the effect of the various discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of less than $1 million, and a net tax benefit
of $2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, these discrete tax items resulted in effective tax rates of
10.8 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, on income before income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and uses of cash

Transocean uses a centralized approach to the cash management system for and financing of its operations. The cash generated and
used by our operations is transferred to Transocean and Transocean funds our operating and investing activities as needed. We had
no bank accounts and the cash and cash equivalents held by Transocean were not allocated to us for any period presented.
Accordingly, we have presented the transfers of cash to and from Transocean’s cash management system in our net investment on
our unaudited condensed combined balance sheets and our combined balance sheets, and in net distributions to or from Transocean
in our financing activities on our unaudited condensed combined statements of cash flows and our audited combined statements of
cash flows.
The following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities and our cash and cash

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to changes in working capital and a decrease in revenue efficiency
of our rigs.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased due to a reduction of maintenance and replacement capital expenditures for the fleet.
Sources and uses of liquidity
We operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs are to finance the purchase of additional drilling rigs and
other capital expenditures, fund investments (including the equity portion of investments in drilling rigs), fund working capital, maintain
cash reserves against fluctuations in operating cash flows and pay distributions. We expect to fund our short-term liquidity needs
through cash on hand at the closing of this offering, borrowings under credit facilities provided by commercial banks or by Transocean
affiliates, cash generated from operations and debt and equity financings.
Table of Contents
97
We will have established separate bank accounts for the RigCos. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity following this offering to
include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of additional debt and equity
securities. Generally, our long-term sources of funds will be cash from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt and
equity financings. Because we will distribute all of our available cash, we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources,
including bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and other expansion capital
expenditures. We believe our current resources, including the potential borrowings under our credit facilities, are sufficient to meet our
working capital requirements for our current business for at least the next twelve months.
Our access to debt and equity markets may be limited due to a variety of events, including, among others, industry conditions, general
economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry. Our ability to access such markets may be
restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to
changing economic and business conditions. An economic downturn could have an impact on the lenders participating in our credit
facilities or on our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.
We intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit per quarter, which equates to approximately $25 million per
quarter, or approximately $100 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of common and subordinated units to be
outstanding immediately after completion of this offering. We do not have a legal obligation to pay this distribution. Please read “Our
Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions.”
Estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures
Subject to the approval of the board of directors of each of the RigCos, each RigCo will transfer its available cash to its equityholders
each quarter. In determining the amount of cash available for transfer, the board of directors of each of the RigCos and our board of
directors determines the amount of cash reserves to set aside, including reserves for future maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures, working capital and other matters. Because of the substantial capital expenditures the RigCos are required to make to
maintain their fleet, the RigCos’ initial annual estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures will be $69 million per
year, which is comprised of $50 million for long-term maintenance and society classification surveys and $19 million, including
financing costs, for replacing our rigs at the end of their useful lives.
The estimate of $19 million per year for future rig replacement is based on assumptions regarding the remaining useful life of the
RigCos’ rigs, a net investment rate applied on reserves, replacement values of the RigCos’ rigs based on current market conditions,
and the residual value of the rigs. The actual cost of replacing the rigs in the RigCos’ fleet will depend on a number of factors,
including prevailing market conditions, drilling contract operating dayrates and the availability and cost of financing at the time of
replacement. Our limited liability company agreement allows our board of directors to deduct from our operating surplus each quarter
estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, as opposed to actual maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures, in order to reduce disparities in operating surplus caused by fluctuating maintenance and replacement capital
expenditures, such as society classification surveys and rig replacement. Our board of directors, with the approval of the conflicts
committee, may determine that one or more of our assumptions should be revised, which could cause our board of directors to
increase the amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures. We may elect to finance some or all of our
maintenance and replacement capital expenditures through the issuance of additional common units which could be dilutive to
existing unitholders. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—We must make substantial capital and operating
expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of our fleet, and we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to
maintain our competitiveness and to comply with laws and the applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and
organizations, or to execute our growth plan, each of which could negatively affect our financial condition, result of operations and
cash flows and reduce distributable cash flow. In addition, each quarter we are required to deduct estimated maintenance and
replacement capital

expenditures from operating surplus, which may result in less cash available to unitholders than if actual maintenance and
replacement capital expenditures were deducted” and “—If capital expenditures are financed through cash from operations or by
issuing debt or equity securities, our ability to make cash distributions may be diminished, our financial leverage could increase or our
unitholders could be diluted.”
As our fleet matures and expands, our long-term maintenance expenses will likely increase. We are not aware of any regulatory
changes or environmental liabilities that would have a material impact on our current or future operations.
Revolving credit facilities
In March 2014, we entered into credit agreements with a Transocean affiliate, establishing credit facilities with an aggregate
borrowing capacity of $300 million that will expire on March 31, 2017. We may borrow under the credit facilities at the applicable U.S.
federal rate as issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. As of July 7, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit
facilities. At the closing of this offering, we expect to terminate these credit agreements.
In connection with the proposed transactions, we will enter into a credit agreement with a Transocean affiliate to establish a
committed $300 million five-year revolving credit facility that allows for uncommitted increases in amounts agreed to by Transocean
and us, or the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. We may borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the
adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin, or the revolving credit facility margin, or (2) the base rate specified in the credit
agreement plus the revolving credit facility margin, less one percent per annum. The revolving credit facility margin will fluctuate
based on our leverage ratio. Throughout the term of the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, we expect to pay a commitment fee on
the daily unused amount of the underlying commitment, which is expected to range from 0.225 percent to 0.325 percent depending on
our leverage ratio. Among other things, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility is expected to include limitations on creating liens,
incurring subsidiary debt, transactions with affiliates, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and the sale of substantially all assets.
The Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility is also expected to include a covenant imposing a maximum ratio of debt to Adjusted
EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of 5.0 to 1.0, with certain adjustments during a specified acquisition period. Borrowings under
the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default.
364-day working capital note payable
On or before the closing of this offering, we will enter into agreements with an affiliate of Transocean to establish a working capital
note payable of approximately $43 million that will mature 364 days following its issuance. We will enter into the 364-day working
capital note payable in exchange for cash proceeds of $43 million. The 364-day working capital note payable is payable at maturity
and bears interest at a rate equal to the rate for Eurocurrency loans under our Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts under the
364-day working capital note payable may be repaid early without penalty, and amounts repaid cannot be reborrowed.
Encumbered assets
Transocean has a $900 million three-year secured revolving credit facility established under a bank credit agreement dated
October 25, 2012, that is scheduled to expire on October 25, 2015 (the “Transocean Three-Year Secured Revolving Credit Facility”).
Transocean’s borrowings under the Transocean Three-Year Secured Revolving Credit Facility are secured by three of its ultra-
deepwater floaters, including the ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Inspiration. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013,
Transocean had no borrowings outstanding under the Transocean Three-Year Secured Revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, the aggregate carrying amount of the ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Inspiration was $700 million and
$706 million, respectively.
On June 30, 2014, Transocean terminated the Transocean Three-Year Secured Revolving Credit Facility and the related security
agreement with respect to the ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Inspiration.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We have prepared our unaudited condensed combined financials statements and our combined financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our estimates, including those related to our materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, goodwill and other
intangibles, income taxes, allocated costs and related party transactions. These estimates require significant judgments and
assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies and estimates, and we have discussed the development, selection
and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the Transocean board of directors. For a
discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to our Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements—Note 2—
Significant Accounting Policies and Notes to Combined Financial Statements—Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies.
As a company with less than $1 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined
in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to opt out of
the exemption that allows emerging growth companies to extend the transition period for complying with new or revised financial
accounting standards. This election is irrevocable.
Income Taxes
We are organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and expect to be resident in the
U.K. for taxation purposes. We will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain of our controlled affiliates
are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized, conduct business or own assets. For this purpose, “controlled
affiliates” include the RigCos.
•
•
The Republic of the Marshall Islands—Because we and our controlled affiliates do not conduct business or operations in
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, neither we nor our controlled affiliates will be subject to income, capital gains, profits
or other taxation under current Marshall Islands law. As a result, any distributions from our controlled affiliates are not
subject to Marshall Islands taxation.
United Kingdom—We and certain of our controlled affiliates expect to be residents of the U.K. for taxation purposes. We
expect that any distributions from our controlled affiliates generally will be exempt from taxation in the U.K. under the
applicable exemption for distributions from subsidiaries. As a result, we do not expect to be subject to a material amount of
taxation in the United Kingdom as a consequence of our U.K. residency for tax purposes.

United States—We and our controlled affiliates will be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a
result, we and our controlled affiliates will be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent we earn (i) certain types of
income from U.S. sources or (ii) income that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in
the U.S. and attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S. We do not expect to earn a material amount of such
income. However, certain of our controlled affiliates will conduct drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and will be
subject to taxation by the U.S. on their net income.
Cayman Islands— The Cayman Islands will not impose any income, capital gains, profits, withholding or other taxation on
us, our controlled affiliates or on any distributions we or they may make.
Our tax liability in any given year could be affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements, and treaties, currency exchange
restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction. Although our annual tax provision is based on the best
information available at the time, a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are
determined.
We maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures in our jurisdictions of operation, and the provisions and benefits resulting from
changes to those liabilities are included in our annual tax provision along with related interest. Tax exposure items may include
potential challenges to permanent establishment positions, intercompany pricing, disposition transactions, and withholding tax rates
and their applicability. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by
judicial means, but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which could cause us to revise past
estimates. A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our transfer pricing policies in certain countries could
materially affect our tax liability in a given year.
We review our liabilities on an ongoing basis and, to the extent audits or other events cause us to adjust the liabilities accrued in prior
periods, we recognize those adjustments in the period of the event. We do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the future
impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates related to our annual tax provision because changes to our tax liabilities are
dependent on numerous factors that cannot be reasonably projected. These factors include, among others, the amount and nature of
additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement
through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; and the potential for changes in the taxes paid to one country
that either produce, or fail to produce, offsetting tax changes in other countries.
Estimates, judgments and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially realized.
When it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of certain deferred tax assets, such as foreign tax credit
carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards, will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount of the deferred
tax assets that is considered to be unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our
deferred tax assets.
In connection with this offering, Transocean has agreed to indemnify Transocean Partners LLC for any tax liabilities we or our
subsidiaries may incur with respect to operations prior to this offering.
Transocean operated the assets of our Predecessor through its subsidiaries in the U.S. and Switzerland, and we have provided for
income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which we operate and earn income. Our Predecessor’s annual tax
provision was based on expected taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various
jurisdictions in which it operated and earned income. The determination of our Predecessor’s annual tax provision and evaluation of
their tax positions involves interpretation of tax laws in the various jurisdictions and requires significant judgment and the use of
estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and
tax credits. Transocean is currently undergoing examinations in the U.S. for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. At March 31, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, our Predecessor’s liability for estimated tax exposures in our jurisdictions of operation was approximately $14
million and $13 million, respectively.

Drilling Rigs
The carrying amount of property and equipment is subject to various estimates, assumptions, and judgments related to capitalized
costs, useful lives and salvage values and impairments. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of our
property and equipment was $2.0 billion, representing 82 percent and 83 percent of our total assets, respectively.
Capitalized costs. We capitalize costs incurred to enhance, improve and extend the useful lives of our property and equipment and
expense costs incurred to repair and maintain the existing condition of our rigs. Capitalized costs increase the carrying amounts and
depreciation expense of the related assets, which also impact our results of operations.
Useful lives and salvage values. We depreciate our assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives after
allowing for salvage values. We estimate useful lives and salvage values by applying judgments and assumptions that reflect both
historical experience and expectations regarding future operations, rig utilization and asset performance. Useful lives of rigs are
difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors, including (a) technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and gas
exploration and development, (b) changes in market or economic conditions, and (c) changes in laws or regulations affecting the
drilling industry. Applying different judgments and assumptions in establishing the useful lives would likely result in materially
different net carrying amounts and depreciation expense for our assets. We reevaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when
certain events occur that directly impact the useful lives of the rigs, including changes in operating condition, functional capability and
market and economic factors. When evaluating the remaining useful lives of rigs, we also consider major capital upgrades required to
perform certain contracts and the long-term impact of those upgrades on future marketability. At December 31, 2013, a hypothetical
one-year increase in the useful lives of all of our rigs would cause a decrease in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $2
million and a hypothetical one-year decrease would cause an increase in our annual depreciation expense of approximately $2
million.
Long-lived assets
We review the aggregate carrying amount of our long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, for potential impairment when
events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the aggregate carrying amount of our drilling units and related equipment
may not be recoverable. We determine recoverability by evaluating the aggregate estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
based on projected dayrates and utilization of our drilling units. When an impairment of our assets is indicated, we measure the
impairment as the amount by which the aggregate carrying amount of our drilling units and related equipment exceeds the aggregate
estimated fair value. We measure the fair value of our drilling units and related equipment by applying a variety of valuation methods,
incorporating a combination of cost, income and market approaches, using projected discounted cash flows and estimates of the
exchange price that would be received for the assets in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets in an orderly
transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. In the three months ended March 31, 2014 and years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not identify any events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of our long-
lived assets was unrecoverable.
Goodwill
We conduct impairment testing for our goodwill annually as of October 1 and more frequently, on an interim basis, when an event
occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset may have
declined below its carrying value. We test goodwill at the reporting
Table of Contents
102
unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which
financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management. We have determined that we have a single reporting unit
for this purpose.
Before testing goodwill, we consider whether or not to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or
circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount and whether the two-step impairment test is required. If, as the result of our qualitative assessment, we determine that the two-
step impairment test is required, or, alternatively, if we elect to forgo the qualitative assessment, we test goodwill for impairment by
comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit.
We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using a variety of valuation methods, incorporating both income and market
approaches, including projected discounted cash flows, publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples. To develop the
projected cash flows associated with our reporting unit, which are based on estimated future dayrates and rig utilization, we consider
key factors that include assumptions regarding future commodity prices, credit market conditions and the effect these factors may
have on our contract drilling operations and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers. We discount the projected cash flows
using a long-term, risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which is based on our estimate of the investment returns that market
participants would require for our reporting unit. We derive publicly traded company multiples for companies with operations similar to
our reporting units using observable information related to shares traded on stock exchanges and, when available, observable
information related to recent acquisitions. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, we consider goodwill impaired
and perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
Because our business is cyclical in nature, the results of our impairment testing are expected to vary significantly depending on the
timing of the assessment relative to the business cycle. Altering either the timing of or assumptions used in our reporting unit’s fair
value calculations could result in an estimate that is significantly below its carrying amount, which may indicate its goodwill is
impaired. In the three months ended March 31, 2014, we did not identify any indicators of impairment of our goodwill. In the years
ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, as a result of our annual impairment testing, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired.
At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our Predecessor had $213 million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business
combinations.
After the offering, our unit price and associated total company market capitalization will be considered in the determination of
reporting unit fair value. A prolonged or significant decline in our unit price could provide evidence of a need to record a material
impairment of goodwill.

Contingencies
Insurance Matters
103
The drilling rigs in our fleet are covered under Transocean’s hull and machinery and excess liability insurance program, which is
comprised of commercial market and captive insurance policies that Transocean renews annually on May 1. We pay the premiums
with respect to the drilling rigs in our fleet. As of July 7, 2014, under Transocean’s insurance program, the insured value of the drilling
rigs in our initial fleet was approximately $2.0 billion. Transocean does not generally carry commercial market insurance coverage for
loss of revenues unless it is contractually required. Transocean generally retains the risk for losses resulting from physical damage to
our fleet caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including liability for wreck removal costs, through its wholly-owned
captive insurance company with an aggregate annual limit of $750 million.
Hull and machinery coverage. Transocean has hull and machinery insurance for physical damage to its drilling rigs, which also
covers the rigs in our fleet, and allocates to us the costs attributed to our fleet. Effective May 1, 2014, under its hull and machinery
program, Transocean generally maintains a $125 million per occurrence deductible, limited to a maximum of $200 million per policy
period. Of such $125 million per occurrence deductible, Transocean has retained the risk of $115 million in excess of $10 million
through its wholly-owned captive insurance company. For the rigs in our fleet, we retain the risk of the $10 million per occurrence
deductible relating to physical damage insurance provided by Transocean’s wholly-owned captive insurance company. Subject to the
same shared deductible, we also have coverage for an amount equal to 50 percent of a rig’s insured value for combined costs
incurred to mitigate damage to a rig and wreck removal. Any excess wreck removal costs are generally covered to the extent of our
remaining excess liability coverage.
Excess liability coverage. Transocean has excess liability coverage insurance, which also covers the rigs in our fleet, and allocates
to us the costs attributed to our fleet. Effective May 1, 2014, Transocean carried $700 million of commercial excess liability coverage,
excluding deductibles and Transocean’s self-insured retention, noted below, which generally covers offshore risks such as personal
injury, third-party property claims, and third-party non-crew claims, including wreck removal and pollution. Our excess liability
coverage has (1) separate $10 million per occurrence deductibles on collision liability claims and (2) separate $5 million per
occurrence deductibles on crew personal injury claims and on other third-party non-crew claims. Through its wholly owned captive
insurance company, Transocean has retained the risk of the primary $50 million excess liability coverage. We generally retain the risk
for any liability losses in excess of $750 million.
Other insurance coverage. Transocean carries additional insurance, which it extends to our operations. Effective May 1, 2014,
Transocean carried $100 million of additional insurance that generally covers expenses that would otherwise be assumed by the well
owner, such as costs to control the well, redrill expenses and pollution from the well. This additional insurance provides coverage for
such expenses in circumstances in which we have legal or contractual liability arising from our gross negligence or willful
misconduct.
See Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements—Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies—Retained risk, Notes to
Combined Financial Statements—Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies—Retained risk and “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in
Our Business—Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not
be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.”
Concentration of Credit Risk
We have only two customers. The market for our services is the offshore oil and gas industry, and the customers consist primarily of
major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas producers and government-owned oil companies. Ongoing credit evaluations
of our customers are performed and generally do not require collateral in our business agreements. Reserves for potential credit
losses are maintained when necessary.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We have entered into credit agreements and may enter into additional financial instruments, credit agreements or bank credit
agreements that may expose us to interest rate risk.
Interest Rate Risk
We do not currently have any financial instruments or borrowings under credit facilities established by bank credit agreements that
expose us to interest rate risk. In March 2014, we entered into credit agreements with a Transocean affiliate, establishing credit
facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $300 million, under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of July 7, 2014. In
connection with the closing of this offering, we expect to issue the 364-day working capital note payable and to enter into a credit
agreement with a Transocean affiliate to establish an additional revolving credit facility. Amounts owed under the 364-day working
capital note payable and borrowings drawn under such credit facilities will bear interest at a variable rate and will expose us to
interest rate risk.

us that the statistical and graphical information contained herein is drawn from its database and other sources. We do not have any
knowledge that the information provided by Wood Mackenzie is inaccurate in any material respect. In connection therewith, Wood
Mackenzie has advised that: (i) certain of the information provided is based on estimates or subjective judgments, (ii) the information
in the databases of other offshore drilling data collection agencies may differ from the information in Wood Mackenzie’s database and
(iii) while Wood Mackenzie has taken reasonable care in the compilation of the statistical and graphical information and believes it to
be accurate and correct, data collection is subject to limited audit and validation procedures. Wood Mackenzie’s classifications of
ultra-deepwater, deepwater and midwater differ from ours. Wood Mackenzie classifies ultra-deepwater as water depths of greater than
4,921 feet (1,500 meters), deepwater as water depths of between 1,312 feet (400 meters) and 4,921 feet (1,500 meters) and shelf as
water depths of less than 1,312 feet (400 meters). Unless otherwise noted, references to ultra-deepwater, deepwater and shelf in this
section follow Wood Mackenzie’s classifications.
Overview
Offshore drilling companies’ primary business is to contract drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews predominantly on a
dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells. Oil and gas wells can be split into three main categories: exploration, development and
production.
Offshore Rig Classification
Offshore drilling rigs, which are also called mobile offshore drilling units, or MODUs, are represented by four main categories:
jackups, tender rigs, semisubmersibles and drillships. The discussion in this prospectus focuses on semisubmersibles and drillships
that can operate in deepwater and ultra-deepwater. Ultra-deepwater rigs can and do operate in shallower water depths.
Semisubmersibles. Semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be partially submerged by means of a water ballast system such
that the lower column sections and pontoons are below the water surface during drilling operations. Although most semisubmersible
rigs are relocated with the assistance of tugs, some units are self-propelled and move between locations under their own power when
afloat on pontoons. Semisubmersibles are either moored or dynamically positioned. Moored rigs maintain their position over a well
through the use of an anchoring system, and dynamically positioned rigs employ a computer-controlled dynamic positioning thruster
system.
Drillships. Drillships are generally self-propelled vessels, shaped like conventional ships, and are the most mobile of the major rig
types. Drillships are equipped with a computer-controlled dynamic positioning thruster system, which allows them to maintain position
without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station keeping systems. Deepwater drillships typically have greater
deck load and storage capacity than semisubmersible rigs. This enables them to carry more supplies on board, which provides
logistical and resupply efficiency benefits for customers. However, drillships are better suited to operations in calmer sea states and
typically do not work in areas considered to be harsh environments.
Our Operating Environment
Our initial fleet is capable of operating in water depths from 1,500 feet to 12,000 feet. As such, our initial fleet, which consists of ultra-
deepwater rigs, is capable of operating in the ultra-deepwater and deepwater offshore environments.

Market for Offshore Drilling
106
The market for offshore drilling rigs and associated services reflects oil companies’ demand for equipment for drilling exploration,
appraisal and development wells and for performing maintenance on existing production wells. Activity levels of exploration and
production, or E&P, companies and their associated capital expenditures are to a large extent driven by the worldwide demand for
energy, including crude oil and natural gas. Demand for hydrocarbons drives commodity prices which in turn impact E&P companies’
ability to fund investments in exploration, development and production activities.
In addition to absolute levels of demand from oil companies, the offshore drilling industry has experienced a steep change in the
technical specifications for rigs required for many regions. Factors such as water depth, more advanced well designs, deeper drilling
depth, high pressure and temperature, sub-salt, and harsh environments, as well as heightened regulatory standards, are driving the
need for more sophisticated drilling units. As hydrocarbons are produced from more challenging environments, demand for modern,
technologically advanced MODUs is expected to grow.
The global offshore drilling market is becoming more specialized as new technology enables drilling activities in deeper waters and
harsher environments, facilitating exploration and development drilling in new geographical areas. As a result, new market segments
are developing related to water depth, technical capacities and rig types required to meet changes in rig requirements from oil
companies.
Market for Ultra-Deepwater Rigs
The following map illustrates exploration and appraisal wells drilled at deepwater and ultra-deepwater depths from 2003 to 2013.
Deepwater oil and gas production is increasing in importance. Evolving drilling technology combined with the continued growth in
energy demand has led to several new deepwater basins and plays being discovered in recent years. These discoveries mark the
beginning of an increasing strategic focus on deepwater and have delivered a backlog of deepwater development projects, with
Brazil, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West Africa as the key ultra-deepwater markets. Outside of these core regions, activity continues to
grow in new basins such as the Mediterranean, East Africa and the South China Sea. Because these discoveries have been
concentrated in deepwater, the majority of the global ultra-deepwater fleet operates in this space; however, the design of ultra-
Table of Contents
107
deepwater drilling rigs gives them the flexibility to operate in the ultra-deepwater market where there is growing interest in exploration
and development activity. Ultra-deepwater rigs represent the newest and most modern segment of the offshore fleet and have
capabilities that are attractive to E&P companies operating in many water depths.
Key Drivers of Demand for Offshore Drilling
The key demand drivers for the offshore drilling industry are the global demand for energy, the price of oil, capital expenditure
allocation by E&P companies, exploration and development activity, market conditions for deepwater production and the regulatory
environment.
While not a direct driver of demand for the offshore drilling industry, the supply and demand balance of deepwater and ultra-
deepwater MODUs has a direct impact on dayrates, which in turn impact offshore drilling demand via project economics.
Global Energy Demand
Wood Mackenzie forecasts annual global energy demand to grow from approximately 89 billion barrels of oil equivalent, or bnboe, in
2013 to approximately 102 bnboe in 2020, with hydrocarbons contributing approximately 53 percent in 2013 and 52 percent in 2020.
Economic growth in Asia is leading to robust energy demand growth, especially in China.
The following chart illustrates historical annual global hydrocarbon demand for 2000 and 2013 and forecasted annual global demand
through 2020 and the actual or forecasted compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, as applicable, between each of those periods.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts global hydrocarbon demand to increase from 47.7 bnboe in 2013 to 54.3 bnboe in 2020. This represents a
compound annual growth rate of 1.9 percent for the period from 2013 to 2020. The growth in the demand for oil is supported by
China’s increase in demand due to the rapid expansion of its transportation fleet. The ease by which oil is transported has created a
truly global market and is a key reason for oil being the dominant energy source today.
Table of Contents
108
Wood Mackenzie forecasts global gas demand to grow at a projected compound annual growth rate of 2.9 percent from 2013 to 2020,
a compounded annual growth rate that is one percent higher than oil during that same period. Gas demand is controlled by increasing
penetration in the power generation and industrial sectors globally. These two sectors are projected to account for over 70 percent of
the growth over the forecast period. Of this forecasted demand growth, the increase is more pronounced in Asia, most notably in
China, North America, and the Middle East. In North America, low gas prices have caused natural gas to displace existing coal
capacity in the power sector, which Wood Mackenzie anticipates will continue into the future.
The following figure illustrates historical oil and gas demand by region from 2000 through 2013 and forecasted oil and gas demand by
region for 2014 through 2030.
Deepwater production currently contributes seven percent of global oil supply, and Wood Mackenzie expects deepwater’s
contribution to increase to 10 percent by 2020. Deepwater production remains a key growth area, with output forecasted to grow from
5.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, or mmboe/d, in 2013 to 10.2 mmboe/d in 2020. Brazil, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Angola
remain the largest contributors to this growth.
Table of Contents
Oil Prices
109
Since the 2008 financial crisis, which saw a significant drop in oil prices, oil prices have recovered and remained relatively stable
around $100 per barrel level since late 2010. Until at least 2019, Wood Mackenzie expects that oil will have a somewhat protected
market share because of the reliance on oil in the transport and petrochemical sectors. Policies and technologies to reduce oil
consumption currently under development are unlikely to have a large impact during this period as the widespread adoption of these
policies and technologies is expected to be gradual.
Wood Mackenzie’s long-term oil price forecast points to a flat outlook in real terms from 2014 levels with oil trading between $90 per
barrel and $100 per barrel through 2020. The chart below illustrates the historical spot prices for Brent oil from 2007 through 2013 and
the Wood Mackenzie forecast of oil prices from 2014 to 2020.
Wood Mackenzie’s forecast takes account of the cost of marginal new sources of supply to help assess the floor for oil prices.
Production from new oil projects is needed to meet oil demand in the medium term and prices must provide an incentive to bring
these developments on stream.
The profile of breakeven prices and related production from new projects set forth in the chart below is based on Wood Mackenzie’s
comprehensive database of upstream projects and their economics. Wood Mackenzie has assessed the breakeven price required for
all the probable developments (i.e., developments with investment authorization expected in short term) within its database. These
are future projects that have firm development plans, but which have not yet received final investment decision.
Table of Contents
110
The chart below illustrates the global snapshot as of November 2013 of the breakeven prices based on Brent oil prices per barrel for
the current portfolio of probable developments, which are broken out by project type, together with new development drilling in U.S.
tight oil plays. These projects in total are projected to contribute approximately 11 million barrels per day, or MMbbl/d, of new
production by 2019 under existing development plans.
Ultra-deepwater and deepwater projects are competitive on a breakeven standpoint with other project types. As the chart above
illustrates, projected weighted average breakeven prices for ultra-deepwater and deepwater projects are lower than those of oil sands
thermal, oil sands mining and U.S. tight oil projects (including shale oil) and, because of the large field sizes, compare favorably with
shallow water developments.
Upstream Capital Expenditures
Wood Mackenzie expects that upstream capital expenditures will continue to increase, driven by increased spending in North
American onshore shale oil, shale gas, tight oil and tight gas projects, LNG projects in Australia and deepwater projects in Brazil, the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Growth in upstream capital expenditure, currently approximately three percent per year, has
slowed since the double digit increases seen from 2009 to 2012. However, Wood Mackenzie expects capital expenditure growth to
rebound in 2016 when it forecasts seven percent growth.

111
The following chart illustrates historical and forecasted offshore capital expenditures by water depth and includes on stream, under-
development, probable (investment authorization expected in short term) and potential assets (where development authorization is
expected before 2020). The long-term inflation for all developments is assumed to be two percent. This chart does not account for yet-
to-find developments.
Although the deepwater and ultra-deepwater sectors comprised 12 percent of 2013 overall upstream capital expenditures, their share
of offshore capital expenditures is expected to double, rising to approximately 25 percent by 2020. This growing proportion of
spending on deepwater and ultra-deepwater is a manifestation of the long-term strategic commitment of E&P companies to these
sectors.
Exploration and Discoveries
Between 2003 and 2013, deepwater projects attracted 41 percent of global exploration and appraisal expenditures, but comprised 45
percent of the volumes discovered—meaning that discovery costs in deepwater were lower than non-deepwater. E&P companies
achieved significantly better exploration success in deepwater than in the continental shelf and onshore, and added on average, three
times the volume per well. The higher cost of deepwater operations was offset by better financial returns and greater discovery sizes
relative to the continental shelf.
2012 and 2013 saw a drop in the volumes discovered as the two key areas that drove recent high volumes, the Santos Basin in Brazil
and the Rovuma and Tanzanian Coastal basins in East Africa, were less prolific. In these areas across this period the number of
exploration wells dropped, success rates were lower and discovery sizes were smaller. These key areas may be beginning to mature,
particularly as operators turn toward appraisal and development.
Global annual exploration and appraisal spending tripled between 2003 and 2013, but the proportion of spending by water depth
showed relatively little change over the same period.
Table of Contents
112
The following charts illustrate, by water depth, the total and per well exploration and appraisal expenditures and the discovered
volumes of reserves for the years 2003 to 2013.
From 2003 to 2007, 30 percent of discovered volumes came from deepwater environments. By contrast, deepwater contributed 50
percent of the volumes discovered from 2008 to 2013, due to the emergence of the pre-salt play in Brazil’s Santos Basin and new gas
provinces in East Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.
Deepwater basins are characterized by large average discovery sizes, which from 2003 to 2013 have been on average three times
the size of discoveries outside deepwater basins. Volumes from these discoveries were highly weighted towards oil from 2003 to
2011. However, the emergence of the East African gas province steered a dramatic swing towards gas, with gas contributing three-
quarters of discovered volumes in 2012.
Table of Contents
113
The following chart illustrates the volumes of oil and gas discovered and the reserves added per well, by water depth from 2003
through 2013.
The unlocking of the pre-salt potential in Brazil’s Santos and Campos basins in 2006 rejuvenated a previously flat annual discovered
volume trend. In 2010, explorers added nearly 45 bnboe of reserves and achieved an average discovery size of over 100 mmboe.
Almost 30 bnboe of these reserves were added from 14 large discoveries, including play-opening discoveries in the Rovuma basin in
East Africa and the Sinai-Levant in Israel.
Gas accounts for just over half of the volumes discovered on an oil equivalent basis. The emergence of the East African Gas Province
(Mozambique and Tanzania) and the Eastern Mediterranean gas play (notably Israel), has resulted in a surge in discovered gas
volumes, rising to nearly 80 percent of volumes in 2012. In 2013, gas accounted for 55 percent of the discovered volumes.

The following map illustrates the volume (in bnboe) of discovered reserves from 2003 through 2013 in deepwater and ultra-deepwater
depths.
Market Conditions in the Ultra-Deepwater Market
Wood Mackenzie expects long-term market conditions in the ultra-deepwater market will be strong as operators continue to venture
into deeper water targeting increasingly complex and deep reservoirs. As such, the demand for wells in deepwater and ultra-
deepwater is forecasted to increase in the coming years with the growth most marked in ultra-deepwater depths.
The following chart illustrates historical well demand from 2008 through 2013 and the forecasted well demand from 2014 through
2020 by water depth.

Recent licensing activity also demonstrates increasing interest in deepwater as E&P companies look to explore new frontiers and
discover new plays. This significant reloading of exploration portfolios in recent years, particularly by the major oil companies, reflects
the strategic importance of deepwater as companies look to areas where they can access and which are prospective for material
discoveries. Deepwater is therefore an increasingly important part of the major oil companies’ long-term strategies.
The following chart depicts the net licensed acreage held by national oil companies, or NOCs, international oil companies, or IOCs,
and other major oil companies (which includes BP, Chevron, Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell, Statoil and Total) at deepwater and ultra-
deepwater depths in the period from 2003 to 2013.
Supply and Demand for Deepwater Rigs
The supply and demand for deepwater rigs is broadly in balance; however, until the end of 2015, market expectations have softened
as operators pause and take stock of capital allocation across their portfolios after a sustained period of investment. Meanwhile,
newbuild deepwater rigs built to cater for the long-term growth of the sector continue to enter the market. After 2015, mid and long-
term expectations are for the market to tighten and return to a long-term trend of approximately 10 percent compounded average
growth in drilling activity. In order to meet the expected requirements of the market, approximately 76 more MODUs would have to be
built by 2020 than are currently scheduled if deepwater activity is not going to be significantly constrained.
The tightness in the deepwater rig market has been driven by increasing demand for high-specification rigs, which has outstripped the
supply of newbuilds. This has been driven by:
•
•
•
an accelerated shift to newbuild rigs by operators in the wake of the Macondo well incident, which set in motion increasing
regulation and heightened the focus on risk mitigation by the operators;
a marked shift into frontier areas as competition picks up and drilling environments get progressively more extreme (water
depth, total depth, reservoir conditions); and
more remote drilling environments.
The chart below illustrates historical supply and demand for deepwater rigs from 2010 through 2013 and forecasted supply and
demand for deepwater rigs from 2014 through 2020. The historical rig supply includes all MODUs that can operate in water depths
greater than 1,312 feet. Forecasted rig supply includes MODUs currently under construction, firm contracts and options that have
been exercised. Forecasted rig supply also takes into account rig attrition by removing MODUs from operating in water depths greater
than 1,312 feet after the age of 35 years (removing approximately 121 rigs from the deepwater fleet by 2020). Forecasted rig demand
takes into account that not all of the fleet spends all of its time in water depths greater than 1,312 feet, especially

the lower specification midwater segment of the fleet. Additionally, the calculation for rig demand was initially expressed in total well
days required and was converted to number of rigs and assumes that when demand exceeds supply the excess will be filled by new
deepwater MODUs.
The rig supply is the total number of rigs in the fleet and has not been reduced to account for the marketed fleet.
Rigs built prior to 1990 currently provide 31 percent of the total deepwater rig capacity; however, the current regulatory environment,
combined with the operators’ increasingly demanding criteria for rig selection, favors newer rigs. As a result, although these older rigs
are serviceable, questions are being raised about the outlook for the older segment of the fleet in the heightening regulatory
environment and with the increasing operational demands of the operators.
Dayrates
Until the end of 2015, the market for deepwater rigs is expected to be soft due to a slow down in new projects and newbuilds coming
into the market without contracts. Wood Mackenzie expects the market will tighten in the mid-term as deepwater activity returns to the
long-term trend of strong growth. As new supply has come into the market, a bifurcation has occurred with the newer ultra-deepwater
rigs commanding higher average dayrates than older deepwater rigs. This development has been driven by a continued shift by
operators into more challenging drilling environments (remoter, deeper, increasingly harsh sub-surface conditions) combined with
rising regulatory standards. This has meant that the older deepwater rigs are being increasingly displaced by the newer generation of
rigs.
Based on the market fundamentals, Wood Mackenzie believes the long term outlook for dayrates remains robust.

BUSINESS
We are a growth-oriented limited liability company recently formed by Transocean, one of the world’s largest offshore drilling
contractors, to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. Our initial assets consist of 51
percent interests in the RigCos that own and operate three ultra-deepwater drilling rigs that are currently operating in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico. Transocean owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. We generate revenue through
contract drilling services, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and work crews on a dayrate
basis to large international energy companies to drill oil and gas wells.
Our drilling rigs currently operate under long-term contracts with Chevron and BP, two leading international energy companies, with
an average remaining contract term of approximately 4.1 years as of July 7, 2014. We believe that our drilling contracts will generate
stable and reliable cash flows over their term. We intend to use the relationships and expertise of Transocean to re-contract our fleet
when the existing contracts expire and identify opportunities to expand our fleet through acquisitions.
The following table provides information about the rigs in our initial fleet:

(3) The dayrate for the remainder of the contract is linked to the standard West Texas Intermediate crude oil price with a floor of $40
per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $400,000 and a ceiling of $70 per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $500,000,
before cost escalation adjustments of $50,000 per day and pre- operating revenues of $19,000 per day.
Our Relationship with Transocean
One of our principal strengths is our relationship with Transocean. Transocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract
drilling services for oil and gas wells. As of July 7, 2014, Transocean owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 77
mobile offshore drilling units, including our initial drilling rigs. As of July 7, 2014, Transocean’s fleet, including the rigs in our fleet,
consisted of 46 high-specification floaters (ultra-deepwater, deepwater and harsh environment semisubmersibles and drillships), 21
midwater floaters and 10 high-specification jackups. At such date, Transocean also had nine ultra-deepwater drillships and five high-
specification jackups under construction or under contract to be constructed.
We believe that our relationship with Transocean will provide us with access to leading international energy companies, as well as
suppliers and other key service providers for our industry. We also believe that Transocean’s operational and managerial expertise
will enable us to compete more effectively for contract opportunities than other contract drilling companies similar in size to us.
Under an omnibus agreement to be entered into on or before the closing of this offering, Transocean will grant us a right of first offer
for its remaining ownership interests in each of the RigCos should Transocean decide to sell such interests. Transocean also will be
required to offer us the opportunity to purchase not less than a 51 percent interest in four of the six drillships listed below within the
five years following the closing of this offering at a purchase price equal to the greater of the fair market value (taking into account the
anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts) or the all-in construction cost, plus transaction costs. Transocean will
select which of these rigs it will offer to us, the timing of the offers and whether it will offer us the opportunity to purchase a greater than
51 percent interest in any offered rig.

In addition, subject to specified exceptions, Transocean and its controlled affiliates (other than any publicly held affiliates of
Transocean) will be required to offer us the opportunity to purchase any drilling rigs that Transocean acquires or contracts to build
after the closing date of this offering that are subject to a drilling contract with a remaining term of five years or longer, and any existing
drilling rigs in its fleet that were constructed in 2009 or later are placed under an extension or a new drilling contract with a term of five
years or longer, in each case excluding any unexercised customer option to extend the drilling contract. We refer to such drilling rigs,
together with any related contracts and associated assets, as Five-Year Drilling Rigs. In addition, we generally will agree not to
acquire, own, operate or contract for certain drilling rigs operating under drilling contracts of less than five years. Relatively few drilling
contracts have a term of five years or greater, particularly in the case of contracts that are not associated with newbuild units. As a
result, we expect that Transocean will effectively have a right of first refusal on most drilling contract opportunities. Please read
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—Omnibus Agreement.”
The consummation and timing of any acquisitions from Transocean will depend upon, among other things, our ability to obtain any
necessary consents, the determination that the acquisition is appropriate for our business at that particular time, our ability to agree on
mutually acceptable terms of purchase, including price, and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms.
Following this offering, Transocean will retain a significant interest in us through its ownership of common and subordinated units,
representing an aggregate 74.6 percent limited liability company interest in us, and all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe
that Transocean is motivated to facilitate the growth of our distributions per unit, including through future contribution or sales to us of
additional rigs and its remaining interests in each of the RigCos. In addition to the drillships discussed above, Transocean has a
number of newer rigs that are operating under long-term drilling contracts and rigs under construction. Although Transocean is not
obligated to offer these rigs to us, we believe that these rigs would be particularly suitable for future contribution or sale to us. Any
publicly held affiliates of Transocean would not be subject to the restrictions on competition contained in the omnibus agreement;
however, Transocean does not have any current plan to form such an affiliate that would focus on Five-Year Drilling Rigs.
Business Strategies
Our primary business objectives are to operate and maintain our fleet to generate stable cash flows and increase our quarterly cash
distributions per unit over time. We intend to accomplish these objectives by executing the following business strategies:
Grow through strategic acquisitions. We intend to pursue strategic opportunities to grow our company and fleet through
acquisitions from Transocean or third parties that will enable us to increase our quarterly distributions per unit. Pursuant to
the omnibus agreement, Transocean will be required, under certain circumstances, to offer us the opportunity to purchase
its remaining interests in one or more of the RigCos, as well as certain drilling rigs (including a majority ownership interest
in four of the ultra-deepwater drillships that are currently under construction and are supported by long-term contracts).
Pursue assets with contracts that help maintain stable cash flows. We are focused on generating and maintaining
stable cash flows by pursuing drilling rigs operated under long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties. We believe
that employing our rigs under long-term contracts will improve the stability and predictability of our cash flows and should
also contribute to our growth strategy by facilitating our access to debt and equity financing. We also believe that our
relationship with Transocean will enhance our ability to compete for contract opportunities.
Conduct safe, efficient and reliable operations. We participate in Transocean’s programs designed to maintain and
improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of all our operations, which are vital to our ability to retain and attract our
customers. We believe that our relationship with Transocean and our relatively young and high-specification fleet will
enable us to operate safely, efficiently and cost effectively. We expect that these factors will enhance our ability to secure
additional long-term contracts and extend existing contracts, enabling us to maintain high asset utilization.

Maintain a modern and reliable fleet. We have one of the most capable and technologically advanced fleets in the
industry. We plan to invest both in growing our modern and reliable fleet and in continually maintaining the quality and
operational integrity of our assets. Each of our drilling rigs represents the latest generation technology and is equipped with
Transocean’s patented dual-activity technology, which improves efficiency in both exploration and development drilling.
We believe that investing in high-quality assets with proven and reliable drilling rig technology is an important component
in our strategy to provide our customers with safe and reliable operations and services.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths:
•
•
•
Relationship with Transocean provides industry expertise and facilitates our growth strategy. Transocean
specializes in operations in technically demanding regions of the global offshore drilling industry with a particular focus on
ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling services. Transocean believes its mobile offshore drilling fleet is one of the
most versatile fleets in the world, consisting of drillships, semisubmersibles and high-specification jackups used in support
of offshore drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis. We believe that our relationship with
Transocean will facilitate our acquisition and growth strategy, provide access to premier customers and suppliers and allow
us to capitalize on Transocean’s operational expertise. In addition, we believe that our relationship with Transocean will
assist us in securing new contracts for our rigs as we complete our current contracts. We believe Transocean’s history as
an efficient and reliable contractor and its operational and management expertise will enhance our ability to obtain new
long-term contracts.
Long-term contracts with high-quality customers promote stable cash flows. All of our revenues and associated cash
flows are derived from our existing long-term contracts. Our rigs are contracted to high-quality, creditworthy customers for
an average remaining contract term of approximately 4.1 years as of July 7, 2014. Our drilling contracts provide for payment
on a fixed-dayrate basis for the applicable contract term. We believe these agreements will enhance cash flow
dependability and predictability, providing us with the financial stability we need to make cash distributions and obtain
financing for future growth.
High-quality, well-maintained, modern and young fleet provides strong operational results. We believe that we have
one of the most capable, technologically advanced and efficient fleets in the offshore drilling industry and that we can
become a preferred provider of offshore drilling services. Our fleet is comprised of technologically advanced drilling rigs
designed to operate in ultra-deepwater environments, as well as in deepwater and midwater environments. All of our rigs
were placed into service in 2009 or 2010, with an average age of approximately 4.4 years as of July 7, 2014. In general,
customers prefer newer, more technologically advanced rigs. Accordingly, we expect to have relatively low maintenance
and replacement capital expenditures, high utilization rates and efficient and reliable operations.
Financial flexibility to execute growth strategy. Upon the closing of this offering, we expect to have an undrawn
committed $300 million revolving credit facility with an affiliate of Transocean that allows for uncommitted increases in
amounts to be agreed upon by Transocean and us. We expect that our borrowing capacity under this credit facility, as well
as access to the capital markets and other financing sources, will be conducive to the execution of our acquisition strategy
and enable us to pursue other expansion opportunities.
Experienced leadership team. Our management team has an average of over 20 years of experience in the energy
industry. Our management team has established strong relationships with customers, suppliers and other industry
participants, which we believe will be beneficial to us in pursuing our business strategies.

Drilling Fleet
Fleet Overview
Our initial fleet consists of two ultra-deepwater drillships and one ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rig. All of our drilling rigs are ultra-
deepwater floaters, which we define as drilling units equipped with high pressure mud pumps and the capability to drill in water
depths of 7,500 feet or greater. Our drilling rigs are mobile and can be moved to new locations in response to customer demand. They
are designed to operate in locations away from port for extended periods of time and have living quarters for the crews, a helicopter
landing deck and storage space for drill pipe, riser and drilling supplies.
Drillships are generally self-propelled vessels, shaped like conventional ships, and are the most mobile of the major rig types. Both of
our high-specification drillships are equipped with a computer-controlled dynamic positioning thruster system, which allows them to
maintain position without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station-keeping systems. Ultra-deepwater drillships
typically have greater deck load and storage capacity than semisubmersible rigs. This enables them to carry more supplies on board,
which provides logistical and resupply efficiency benefits for customers. However, drillships are better suited to operations in calmer
sea conditions and typically do not operate in areas considered to be harsh environments. Our drillships are equipped with
Transocean’s patented dual-activity technology, which employs structures, equipment and techniques using two drilling stations
within a dual derrick to allow these drillships to perform simultaneous tasks in a parallel, rather than a sequential, manner, reducing
critical path activity, to improve efficiency in both exploration and development drilling.
Semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be partially submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower
column sections and pontoons are below the water surface during drilling operations. These rigs are capable of maintaining their
position over a well either through a computer-controlled dynamic positioning thruster system, as is the case for Development Driller
III, or the use of an anchoring system. Although most semisubmersible rigs are relocated with the assistance of tugs, some units,
including Development Driller III, are self-propelled and move between locations under their own power when afloat on pontoons. In
addition, semisubmersibles are capable of operating in rougher sea conditions than drillships.

enhanced top drive system, an expanded high-pressure mud-pump system, a variable deckload of 20,000 metric tons, completion
capabilities and Transocean’s patented dual-activity technology. Our Enhanced Enterprise-class drillships offer improved reliability,
increased pipe handling capacity, two blowout preventer (BOP) stacks and flexible fluid capabilities. The primary derrick is rated to
2.5 million pounds, which enables increased water depth and drilling depth and heavier casing loads. Discoverer Inspiration and
Discoverer Clear Leader also have crude oil storage capacity for up to 120,000 barrels that can be used during testing. Both rigs are
capable of operating in moderate environments and are equipped for drilling in water depths of up to 12,000 feet. The information

Development Driller III, respectively, and the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our initial fleet was 98 percent. For the year ended
December 31, 2013, average daily revenue was $500,700, $450,500 and $416,100 for Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear
Leader and Development Driller III, respectively, and the revenue efficiency of the rigs in our initial fleet was 86 percent.
(4) The dayrate for the remainder of the contract is linked to the standard West Texas Intermediate crude oil price with a floor of $40
per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $400,000 and a ceiling of $70 per barrel resulting in a contract dayrate of $500,000,
before cost escalation adjustments of $50,000 per day and pre- operating revenues of $19,000 per day.
The contract backlog represents the maximum contract drilling revenues that can be earned considering only the contractual
operating dayrate in effect during the firm contract period and represents the basis for the maximum revenues in our revenue
efficiency measurement.
Our contract backlog includes only firm commitments, which are represented by signed drilling contracts, although, in some cases, we
may include contacts represented by other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution. Our contract backlog excludes
revenues for mobilization and demobilization, contract preparation, and customer reimbursables. The actual amounts of revenues
earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may differ from the backlog amounts and periods shown in the table
below due to various factors, including shipyard and maintenance projects, downtime and other factors. Downtime, caused by
unscheduled repairs, maintenance, weather and other operating factors, may result in lower applicable dayrates than the full
contractual operating dayrate. Additionally, if a contract were to terminate automatically or be terminated by the customer without the
payment of a termination fee the actual amount of revenues earned may be substantially lower than the backlog reported. See “—
Drilling Contracts.”
Additional factors that could affect the amount and timing of actual revenue to be recognized include customer liquidity issues and
contract terminations, which are available to our customers under certain circumstances.
Drilling Contracts
Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services are individually negotiated and vary in their terms and provisions. Our current
drilling contracts were directly negotiated. We expect to obtain most of our future drilling contracts through competitive bidding against
other contractors and direct negotiations with operators. Our drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with
higher rates for periods while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates or zero rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling
operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our
control.
A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or
covering a stated term. Certain of our drilling contracts with customers may be cancelable for the convenience of the customer only
upon payment of an early termination payment. Such
Table of Contents
126
payments, however, may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic
termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various
circumstances such as non-performance, in the event of extended downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or
operational issues, or periods of extended downtime due to force majeure events. Many of these events are beyond our control. The
contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an
additional term. Our contracts also include a provision that allows the customer to extend the contract to finish drilling a well in
progress. During periods of depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to renegotiate firm drilling contracts to reduce their
obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts. Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for
the period of the suspension. If our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely
basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts
are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in
Our Business—Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events.”
Consistent with standard industry practice, our customers generally assume, and indemnify us against, well control and subsurface
risks under dayrate drilling contracts. Under all of our current drilling contracts, the operator indemnifies us for pollution damages in
connection with reservoir fluids stemming from operations under the contract and we indemnify the operator for pollution from
substances in our control that originate from the rig, such as diesel used onboard the rig or other fluids stored onboard the rig and
above the water surface. Also, under all of our current drilling contracts, the operator indemnifies us against damage to the well or
reservoir and loss of subsurface oil and gas and the cost of bringing the well under control. However, our drilling contracts are
individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from the operator against the liabilities discussed above can
vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated. In
some instances, we have agreed and may contractually agree upon certain limits to our indemnification rights and can be responsible
for damages up to a specified maximum dollar amount, which amount is usually $5 million or less, although the amount can be
greater depending on the nature of our liability. In some instances in which we are indemnified for damages to the well, we have the
responsibility to re-drill the well at a reduced dayrate. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no
assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations.
See “Item Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance
and indemnities from our customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.”
The interpretation and enforceability of a contractual indemnity depends upon the specific facts and circumstances involved, as
governed by applicable laws, and may ultimately need to be decided by a court or other proceeding which will need to consider the
specific contract language, the facts and applicable laws. In connection with the Macondo well incident, a court refused to enforce
Transocean’s indemnity in respect of certain penalties and punitive damages under the Clean Water Act. The law generally considers
contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy, and the enforceability of an indemnity as to other
matters may be limited. The inability or other failure of our customers to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us could have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Courts also restrict
indemnification for criminal fines and penalties.
The terms of the drilling contracts for Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III generally conform to
the summary description above. In addition, Transocean has provided a financial and performance guarantee for the contract for
Development Driller III. Transocean is under no obligation to continue to provide such guarantees in the future or to extend the current
parent guarantee for any amendment or extension of the current drilling contract.

Seasonality
127
In general, seasonal factors do not have a significant direct effect on our business. Our drilling rigs are currently operating in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico, which experiences hurricane season between June 1st and November 30th each year. Although weather conditions
during parts of the year could adversely impact the operation of our rigs, generally such operational interruptions do not have a
significant impact on our revenues. Please read “—Drilling Contracts.”
Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2013, our customers were Chevron and BP, accounting for approximately 67 percent and 33
percent, respectively, of our combined operating revenues. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—We currently
derive all our revenues from two customers, and the loss of either of these customers or a dispute that leads to a loss of a customer
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.” Typical customers for the types
of rigs included in our initial fleet are leading international oil companies or their affiliates, government controlled oil companies and
independent oil companies.
Competition
The offshore drilling market is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which has a dominant market share.
Drilling contracts are generally awarded through competitive bidding processes, where our customers and potential customers’ main
considerations are price, quality and technical capability of services and equipment. Industry supply and demand economics play an
important role in the contractual terms, including the dayrates, we and our customers ultimately agree to. As a result of these
economic forces, in general, and the increased number of newbuild units entering the drilling market, specifically, our ability to obtain
future drilling contracts, if at all, may be subject to increased competition and impact our dayrates and utilization rates. Please read
“Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—The offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price
competition.”
In recent years, oil companies have placed increased emphasis on exploring for hydrocarbons in deeper waters. This deepwater
focus is due, in part, to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost effective. Therefore,
water depth capability is a key component in determining rig suitability for a particular drilling project. We believe that our fleet of
recently constructed high-specification drilling rigs provides us with a competitive advantage over competitors with older fleets.
Employees
We require highly skilled personnel to operate our drilling units. Consequently, we conduct extensive personnel recruiting, training
and safety programs. At December 31, 2013, there were approximately 560 employees associated with the operation of the rigs in our
initial fleet, substantially all of which are Transocean employees that will provide services to us under our contracts with Transocean.
None of the employees associated with our operations are members of labor unions and our relationship with our labor force is good,
although portions of Transocean’s global workforce are unionized in parts of the world where we could operate in the future.
Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as
increase the chances that such efforts succeed. Additional unionization efforts, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or
work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions. Please read “Risk Factors—Any operations
outside the United States may involve additional risks.”

Joint Venture, Agency and Sponsorship Relationships
In some areas of the world where our drilling rigs may operate in the future, local customs and practice or governmental requirements
necessitate the formation of joint ventures with local participation. We may or may not control these joint ventures. Local laws or
customs in some areas of the world also effectively mandate establishment of a relationship with a local agent or sponsor. When
appropriate in these areas, we will enter into agency or sponsorship agreements.
Insurance
We participate in Transocean’s insurance program. Transocean’s hull and machinery and excess liability insurance program is
comprised of commercial market and captive insurance policies that we renew annually on May 1. We periodically evaluate our
insurance limits and self-insured retentions. As of July 7, 2014, the insured value of our drilling rig fleet was approximately $2.0
billion.
We generally do not carry commercial market insurance coverage for loss of revenues, unless it is contractually required, or for losses
resulting from physical damage to our fleet caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including liability for wreck
removal costs.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contingencies—Insurance Matters.”
Notes to Combined Financial Statements—Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies—Retained Risk and “Risk Factors—Risks
Inherent in Our Business—Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and indemnities from our
customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.”
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to a variety of global environmental regulations. We monitor environmental regulation in each country of
operation and, while we see an increase in general environmental regulation, we have made and will continue to make the required
expenditures to comply with current and future environmental requirements. Together with Transocean, we make expenditures to
further our commitment to environmental improvement and the setting of a global environmental standard as part of Transocean’s
wider corporate responsibility effort. We assess the environmental impacts of our business, specifically in the areas of greenhouse
gas emissions, discharges and waste management. Our actions are designed to reduce risk in our current and future operations, to
promote sound environmental management and to create a proactive environmental program. To date, we have not incurred material
costs in order to comply with recent environmental legislation, and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will
have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, consolidated results of operations or cash flows.
For a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation, see “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—Compliance with or
breach of environmental laws can be costly, expose us to liability and could limit our operations” and “—Regulation of greenhouse
gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.”
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws and regulations which apply to our operations in the United States, where we
currently operate. While laws vary widely between jurisdictions, the laws and regulations below address environmental issues similar
to those in many jurisdictions in which we are likely to operate.
Heightened environmental concerns in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well
permitting process and, in general, have adversely affected drilling decisions of oil and natural gas companies. In the United States,
our operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or
governmental approvals; control the discharge of
129
Table of Contents
materials into the environment; remove and cleanup materials that may harm the environment; or otherwise comply with the protection
of the environment. We are subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA, the U.S. Coast Guard, or the Coast Guard, the National
Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, BOEM, and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, BSEE, as well as classification societies
such as the American Bureau of Shipping. The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board set safety standards and
are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards, and the CBP is authorized to inspect
vessels at will. Coast Guard regulations also require annual inspections and periodic drydock inspections or special examinations of
our vessels.
Furthermore, any drillships that we may operate in United States waters, including the U.S. territorial sea and the 200 nautical mile
exclusive economic zone around the United States, would have to comply with OPA and CERCLA requirements, among others, that
impose liability for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges of oil or other hazardous
substances, other than discharges related to drilling.
In addition, as described below, we are subject to additional restrictions and requirements as a result of the Consent Decree and the
EPA Agreement, both of which arose out of the Macondo well incident.
Oil Pollution Act. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, as amended, and related regulations impose a variety of requirements
on “responsible parties” related to the prevention and/or reporting of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in
waters of the United States. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel or the
lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. Under OPA, responsible parties are jointly, severally, and
strictly liable (unless the discharge of pollutants results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God, or an act of war)
for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges, or threatened discharges, of pollutants from their
vessels. OPA defines these “other damages” to include:
•
•
•
•
•
natural resource damages and the costs of assessment thereof;
real and personal property damage;
net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees, and other lost revenues;
lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resource damages; and
net cost of public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire, safety, or health hazards and loss
of subsistence use of natural resources.
OPA preserves the right to recover damages under other existing laws, including maritime tort law. In addition, OPA specifically
permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries,
and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. In some cases, states that have enacted such
legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners’ responsibilities under these laws.
CERCLA. The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as
CERCLA or the “Superfund” law, imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of
persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons
include the owner or operator of a facility where a release occurred, the owner or operator of a vessel from which there is a release,
and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at a particular site. Persons who are or
were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the cost of
cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Prior
owners and operators are also subject to liability under CERCLA. It is also not uncommon for third parties to file claims for personal
injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate wastes in the
course of our routine operations that may be classified as hazardous substances.

Table of Contents
OCSLA. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection
applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the outer continental shelf. Included among these are regulations that require the
preparation of spill contingency plans and establish air quality standards for certain pollutants, including particulate matter, volatile
organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Specific design and operational standards may apply to
outer continental shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Following the Macondo well incident, the BSEE issued and
proposed various new regulations for offshore operations. Among these is the Final Drilling Safety Rule which finalizes safety reforms
that were put in place following the Macondo incident and includes requirements for safety equipment, well control systems, and
blowout prevention practices on offshore oil and gas operations. Violations of such regulations or lease conditions related to the
environment issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions
curtailing operations and canceling leases. Such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution.
Clean Water Act. The United States Clean Water Act, or CWA, prohibits the discharge of pollutants in United States navigable
waters unless authorized by a permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for unauthorized discharges.
The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies
available under OPA and CERCLA. The EPA has enacted rules governing the regulation of ballast water discharges and other
discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels within U.S. waters. Under these rules, certain commercial vessels are
required to obtain a CWA permit regulating and authorizing such normal discharges. This permit, which the EPA has designated as
the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels, or VGP, was most recently revised by the
EPA in March 2013 and the new VGP requirements became effective in December 2013. It incorporates the current U.S. Coast Guard
requirements for ballast water management as well as supplemental ballast water requirements, and includes limits applicable to
specific discharge streams, such as deck runoff, bilge water and gray water.
NISA. The U.S. National Invasive Species Act, or NISA, was enacted in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms
being released into U.S. ports through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign ports. Under NISA, on March 23, 2012, the U.S.
Coast Guard issued a final rule establishing standards for the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharged
in U.S. waters and requiring the phase-in of Coast Guard approved ballast water management systems. The rule, which went into
effect on June 21, 2012, adopts ballast water discharge standards for vessels calling on U.S. ports and intending to discharge ballast
water equivalent to those set in IMO’s BWM Convention. The final rule requires that ballast water discharge have no more than 10
living organisms per milliliter for organisms between 10 and 50 micrometers in size. For organisms larger than 50 micrometers, the
discharge can have 10 living organisms per cubic meter of discharge. New ships constructed on or after December 1, 2013, must
comply with these standards and some existing ships must comply by their first dry dock after January 1, 2014. The Coast Guard will
review the practicability of implementing a more stringent ballast water discharge standard and publish the results no later than
January 1, 2016.
Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, which often
involve lengthy permitting procedures, impose difficult and costly compliance measures, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas,
and subject operators to substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply.
Some of these laws contain criminal sanctions in addition to civil penalties. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur
frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly compliance or limit contract drilling opportunities, including
changes in response to a serious marine incident that results in significant oil pollution or otherwise causes significant adverse
environmental impact, such as the April 2010 Macondo well incident, could adversely affect our financial results. Although significant
capital expenditures may be required to comply with these governmental laws and regulations, such compliance has not materially
adversely affected our earnings or competitive position. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with
the environmental regulations to which we are subject.
Table of Contents
131
We may also be affected by or subject to permitting and other requirements under a variety of other environmental laws not discussed
above, such as the federal Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, National Environmental Policy
Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
IMO. The United States is one of approximately 169 member countries to the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, a
specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of
international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. The IMO provides international regulations governing shipping and
international maritime trade. IMO regulations have been widely adopted by U.N. member countries, and in the United States, these
regulations have been expanded upon. The requirements contained in the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of
Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, govern much of our drilling operations. Among other
requirements, the ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management
system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and
procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies.
The IMO has also adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or MARPOL, including Annex VI to
MARPOL which sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of
ozone depleting substances. Annex VI, which applies to all ships, fixed and floating drilling rigs and other floating platforms, imposes
a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with even more stringent
controls on sulfur emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling rigs, Annex VI imposes various survey and
certification requirements. Moreover, 2008 amendments to Annex VI require the imposition of progressively stricter limitations on
sulfur emissions from ships. These limitations require that fuels of vessels in covered Emission Control Areas, or ECAs, contain no
more than one percent sulfur. The North American ECA became effective in August 2012, capping the sulfur limit in marine fuel at one
percent, which has been the capped amount for the North Sea and Baltic Sea ECAs since July 1, 2010. The North Sea ECA
encompasses all of the North Sea and the full length of the English Channel. These capped amounts are to decrease progressively
until they reach 0.5 percent by January 1, 2020 for non-ECA areas and 0.1 percent by January 1, 2015 for ECA areas, including the
North American ECA. The amendments also establish new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine
engines, depending on their date of installation.
The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for oil pollution in international waters and the territorial waters
of the signatory to such conventions such as the Ballast Water Management Convention, or BWM Convention. The BWM
Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements (beginning
in 2009), to be replaced in time with a requirement for mandatory ballast water treatment. The BWM Convention will not become
effective until 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35
percent of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant shipping. Though this has not occurred to date, the IMO has passed a resolution
encouraging the ratification of the BWM Convention and calling upon those countries that have already ratified to encourage the
installation of ballast water management systems on new ships. Under the requirements of the BWM Convention for rigs with ballast
water capacity of more than 5000 cubic meters that were constructed in 2011 or before, ballast water management exchange or
treatment will be accepted until 2016. From 2016 (or not later than the first intermediate or renewal survey after 2016), only ballast
water treatment will be accepted by the BWM Convention. All of our drilling rigs are in substantial compliance with the proposed terms
of the BWM Convention.
The IMO has also adopted the International Convention for Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage of 2001, or Bunker
Convention. The Bunker Convention provides a liability, compensation and compulsory insurance system for the victims of oil
pollution damage caused by spills of bunker oil. Under the Bunker Convention, ship owners must pay compensation for pollution
damage (including the cost of preventive measures) caused in the territory, including the territorial sea of a State Party, as well as its
exclusive economic
Table of Contents
132
zone or equivalent area. Registered owners of any seagoing vessel and seaborne craft over 1,000 gross tons, of any type
whatsoever, and registered in a State Party, or entering or leaving a port in the territory of a State Party, must maintain insurance
which meets the requirements of the Bunker Convention and must obtain a certificate issued by a State Party attesting that such
insurance is in force. The State issued certificate must be carried on board at all times. We believe that all of our drilling rigs are
currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations.
On July 15, 2011, the IMO approved mandatory measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping. The
amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships add a new Chapter 4 on energy
efficiency requiring compliance with the Energy Efficiency Design Index, or EEDI, for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency
Management Plan, or SEEMP, for all ships. Other amendments to Annex VI add new definitions and requirements for survey and
certification, including the format for the International Energy Efficiency Certificate. The regulations apply to all ships of 400 gross tons
and above and entered into force on January 1, 2013. These new rules will likely affect the operations of vessels that are registered in
countries that are signatories to MARPOL Annex VI or vessels that call upon ports located within such countries. The implementation
of the EEDI and SEEMP standards could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. The IMO is also considering the
development of market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships.
The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be
passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulation may have on our operation.
Other. In addition to the statutes and regulations above, our operations subject us to liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the
Refuse Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Seaman’s Manslaughter Act and state analogues to OPA.
Consent Decree and EPA Agreement. We are not party to the Consent Decree or the EPA Agreement. However, because we are
an affiliate of Transocean, our operations in the waters of the United States are subject to the safety, environmental, reporting,
operational and other requirements of the Consent Decree and the EPA Agreement. These requirements are in addition to the
regulations applicable to all industry participants and may add additional costs and liabilities.
Pursuant to the Consent Decree, Transocean agreed to take specified actions relating to operations in U.S. waters, including, among
other things, the design and implementation of, and compliance with, additional systems and procedures; blowout preventer
certification and reports; measures to strengthen well control competencies, drilling monitoring, recordkeeping, incident reporting, risk
management and oil spill training, exercises and response planning; communication with operators; alarm systems; transparency and
responsibility for matters relating to the Consent Decree; and technology innovation, with a first emphasis on more efficient, reliable
blowout preventers.
The Consent Decree also provides for the appointment of (i) an independent auditor to review, audit and report on Transocean’s
compliance with the injunctive provisions of the Consent Decree and (ii) an independent process safety consultant to review, report
on and assist with respect to the process safety aspects of the Consent Decree, including operational risk identification and risk
management. The Consent Decree requires certain plans, reports and submissions be made and be acceptable to the U.S. and also
requires certain publicly available filings.
In the EPA Agreement, Transocean agreed to, among other things, continue the implementation of certain programs and systems;
comply with certain employment and contracting procedures; engage independent compliance auditors and a process safety
consultant; and give reports and notices with respect to various matters. Subject to certain exceptions, the EPA Agreement prohibits
Transocean and its affiliates from entering into, extending or engaging in certain business relationships with individuals or entities
that are debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or similarly restricted. In addition, if we or Transocean fail to comply with the
terms of the EPA Agreement, we may be subject to suspension, debarment or statutory disqualification.
Table of Contents
Classification
133
Our drilling rigs are classed by either Det Norske Veritas, or DNV, or the American Bureau of Shipping, or ABS, and all hold valid
classification and statutory certificates. Every offshore drilling rig is a registered marine vessel and must be “classed” by a
classification society. The classification society certifies that the drilling rig is “in-class,” signifying that such drilling rig has been built
and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the
drilling rig’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. Classification societies are
considered non-governmental organizations that establish and maintain technical standards for the construction and operation of
ships and offshore structures. DNV and ABS are also recognized by flag states as entities authorized to conduct regular statutory
surveys as part of the flag state requirements.
Properties
Other than our drilling rigs, we do not own any material property.
Legal Proceedings
In the future we may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters.
Taxation of the Company
We are organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and expect to be resident in the
United Kingdom for taxation purposes. We will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain of our
controlled affiliates are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized, conduct business or own assets. For this
purpose, “controlled affiliates” include the RigCos.
Marshall Islands
Because we and our controlled affiliates do not conduct business or operations in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, neither we nor
our controlled affiliates will be subject to income, capital gains, profits or other taxation under current Marshall Islands law. As a result,
distributions we receive from our controlled affiliates are not expected to be subject to Marshall Islands taxation.
United Kingdom
We and certain of our controlled affiliates expect to be a resident of the United Kingdom for taxation purposes. We expect that the
distributions we receive from our controlled affiliates generally will be exempt from taxation in the United Kingdom under applicable
exemptions for distributions from subsidiaries. As a result, we do not expect to be subject to a material amount of taxation in the
United Kingdom as a consequence of our U.K. residency for taxation purposes.
United States
We and our controlled affiliates are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, we and our controlled
affiliates will be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent we earn (i) certain types of income from U.S. sources or (ii) income
that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and attributable to a permanent
establishment in the United States. However, certain of our controlled affiliates conduct drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico;
such affiliates will be subject to taxation by the United States on their net income and may be required to withhold U.S. federal tax
from distributions they make to us. See discussion under “Risk Factors—Tax Risks—A loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax
challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries
could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, reducing our cash available for distribution to you” relating to previous and
current challenges by the IRS to Transocean’s transfer pricing for charters of drilling rigs between its subsidiaries.

Cayman Islands
134
According to our Cayman Islands counsel, Harney Westwood & Riegels, there is currently no Cayman Islands income or profits tax,
capital gains or capital transfer tax payable by us or any of our controlled affiliates. No withholding tax will be imposed by the Cayman
Islands on any distributions we or any of our controlled affiliates may make.

MANAGEMENT
Management of Transocean Partners LLC
Our limited liability company agreement provides that our board of directors has authority to oversee and direct our operations,
management and policies on an exclusive basis. Our executive officers will manage our day-to-day activities consistent with the
policies and procedures adopted by our board of directors. Certain of our current executive officers and directors are also executive
officers or directors of Transocean or its affiliates.
Upon the completion of this offering, our board of directors will consist of three members, Esa Ikäheimonen, Glyn A. Barker and
Kathleen S. McAllister, each of whom was elected by the Transocean Member in its capacity as initial holder of our common units.
Our board has determined that Mr. Barker satisfies the independence standards established by the New York Stock Exchange, or
NYSE. After the completion of this offering, but prior to our first annual meeting of unitholders in 2015, the elected directors may elect
an additional elected director and the Transocean Member expects to appoint three additional directors to serve on our board,
provided that the number of elected directors must, immediately after such appointment, exceed the number of appointed directors.
The three initial directors elected by the Transocean Member in its capacity as initial holder of our common units together with any
such additional elected director will serve until our annual meeting in 2015, at which time directors for such positions (who may be
incumbent directors) will be elected by our common unitholders, which will include Transocean. Following our first annual meeting of
unitholders in 2015, our board will consist of seven members, three of whom will be appointed by the Transocean Member in its sole
discretion and four of whom will be elected by our common unitholders. Directors appointed by the Transocean Member will serve as
directors for terms determined by the Transocean Member. Directors elected by our common unitholders will initially serve one year
terms. Our limited liability company agreement allows the Transocean Member to elect to classify our board of directors at any time.
Upon such election by the Transocean Member, the directors elected by our common unitholders will be divided into three classes
serving staggered three-year terms. One of the four directors elected by our common unitholders will be designated as the Class I
elected director and will serve until our first annual meeting of unitholders after the Transocean Member’s election, another of the four
directors will be designated as the Class II elected director and will serve until our second annual meeting of unitholders after the
Transocean Member’s election, and the remaining two directors will be designated as our Class III elected directors and will serve
until our third annual meeting of unitholders after the Transocean Member’s election. At each annual meeting of unitholders thereafter,
directors will be elected to succeed the class of directors whose terms have expired by a plurality of the votes of the common
unitholders. Directors elected by our common unitholders will be nominated by the board of directors or by any member or group of
members that holds at least 10 percent of the outstanding common units. Nevertheless, one or more of the four initial directors elected
by Transocean may be nominated by the Board of Directors and thereafter be reelected at the 2015 or subsequent annual meetings.
Our governance documents require that, at all times, at least a majority of the members of our board of directors be U.K. tax residents.
Each outstanding common unit is entitled to one vote on matters subject to a vote of common unitholders. For more information,
please read “The Limited Liability Company Agreement—Voting Rights.”
Our executive officers will continue to provide services to us after the closing of this offering under the support or secondment
agreements. All of the personnel that will conduct our business immediately following the closing of this offering, including our
executive officers, will be employed or contracted by Transocean and its affiliates, but we sometimes refer to these individuals in this
prospectus as our employees. Please read “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the
Transactions—Master Services Agreements.”
Our officers and the other individuals providing services to us or our subsidiaries may face a conflict regarding the allocation of their
time between our business and the other business interests of Transocean or the other companies they serve. However, the amount
of time our officers will allocate between our business and the business of Transocean or the other companies they serve will vary
from time to time depending on various
Table of Contents
136
circumstances and needs of the businesses, such as the level of strategic activities of the businesses. Our officers intend to devote as
much time to the management of our business and affairs as is necessary for the proper conduct of our business and affairs.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Under the rules of the NYSE, we are a “controlled company” for the purposes of the NYSE’s corporate governance rules because
Transocean indirectly holds more than 50 percent of the voting power of our company for the election of directors. Following this
offering, we intend to utilize some or all of the “controlled company” exemptions of the NYSE corporate governance standards. These
exemptions will free us from the obligation to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements that would otherwise
require us, among other things, to have a board of directors composed of a majority of independent directors, to have a compensation
committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee composed of independent directors.
Audit Committee
We are required to have an audit committee of at least three members within one year of the date our common units are first listed on
the NYSE, and all of our audit committee members are required to meet the independence and financial literacy tests established by
the NYSE and the Exchange Act. The members of our audit committee are not required to be independent of Transocean. Our audit
committee will, among other things, review our external financial reporting, engage our external auditors and oversee our internal
audit activities and procedures and adequacy of our internal accounting controls. Our audit committee will initially be composed of
one director, Mr. Barker. Our board has determined that Mr. Barker satisfies the independence standards established by the NYSE.
Mr. Barker qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” for purposes of SEC rules and regulations. In accordance with NYSE and
SEC phase-in provisions for companies listing in connection with initial public offerings, we expect to appoint additional directors
meeting applicable audit committee independence standards to serve as the second and third members of our audit committee within
90 days and one year, respectively, after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.
Conflicts Committee
We will also have a conflicts committee ultimately composed of at least two members of our board of directors. The conflicts
committee will be available at the board’s discretion to review specific matters that the board believes may involve conflicts of interest.
The conflicts committee will determine if the resolution of the conflict of interest is fair and reasonable to us. The members of the
conflicts committee may not be officers or employees of us or directors, officers or employees of the Transocean Member or its
affiliates, and must meet the independence standards established by the NYSE to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors
and certain other requirements. In addition, the members of our conflicts committee cannot own any interest in us or our subsidiaries,
the Transocean Member or any affiliate of the Transocean Member other than common units and awards, if any, under our long-term
incentive plan. Certain of our directors may be outside directors of Transocean and may therefore meet the independence standards
established by the NYSE, but any such directors nevertheless would not be eligible to serve on the conflicts committee as a result of
their relationship with Transocean. Any matters approved by the conflicts committee will be conclusively deemed to be fair and
reasonable to us, approved by all of our members, and not a breach by our directors, the Transocean Member or its affiliates of any
duties any of them may owe us or our unitholders. Our initial conflicts committee will be comprised of two or more additional directors
who will be appointed after the closing of this offering. For additional information about the conflicts committee, please read “Conflicts
of Interest and Duties—Conflicts of Interest.”
Table of Contents
Board Leadership Structure
137
Our board of directors has chosen not to combine the positions of chief executive officer and chairman of the board. Our board
believes that separating these positions allows our chairman of the board to preside over the board as it provides advice to, and
oversight of, management and the company’s operations. The board recognizes the attention that the chief executive officer is
required to devote to his or her position and the additional commitment the position of chairman of the board requires. The board
believes that having separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time. The directors appointed by the
Transocean Member may designate a chairman of the board of directors.
Board Role in Risk Oversight
Our corporate governance guidelines will provide that our board of directors is responsible for reviewing the process for assessing the
major risks facing us and the options for their mitigation. This responsibility will be largely satisfied by our audit committee, which is
responsible for reviewing and discussing with management and our registered public accounting firm our major risk exposures and
the policies management has implemented to monitor such exposures, including our financial risk exposures and risk management
policies.
The Transocean Member
Whenever the Transocean Member makes a determination or takes or declines to take an action in its capacity as a member, our
limited liability company agreement provides that it is entitled to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other
action free of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) or obligation existing at law, in equity or otherwise whatsoever to us or any
member, and to the fullest extent permitted by law the Transocean Member is not required to act in good faith or in the best interests of
us or any member. Specifically, the Transocean Member will be considered to be acting free of any fiduciary duty or obligation if it
exercises its call right, preemptive rights or registration rights, appoints any directors or votes for the appointment of any director, votes
or refrains from voting on amendments to our limited liability company agreement that require a vote of the outstanding units,
voluntarily withdraws from the company, transfers (to the extent permitted under our limited liability company agreement) or refrains
from transferring its units, the Transocean Member interest or the incentive distribution rights it owns or votes upon the dissolution of
the company.

Esa Ikäheimonen was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors in May 2014. Mr. Ikäheimonen is Executive Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer of Transocean. Before being named Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer in November 2012, Mr.
Ikäheimonen served as a consultant to Transocean from September 2012 to November 2012. He has served as a non-executive
director and the chairman of the audit committee of Ahlstrom Corporation since April 2011. Mr. Ikäheimonen served as Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Seadrill Ltd. from August 2010 to September 2012, and he served as Executive Vice

Europe Oil Products, Finance Director, Shell Scandinavia, and Finance Director, Shell Finland. Mr. Ikäheimonen received his Master
of Laws degree from the University of Turku in Finland in 1989.
Table of Contents
138
We believe Mr. Ikäheimonen’s extensive knowledge of our company, Transocean and the drilling industry provides the board with
valuable experience.
Kathleen S. McAllister was appointed as a director in July 2014 and has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since
June 2014. From June 2014 to July 2014, Ms. McAllister also served as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. From December 2011 to
June 2014, Ms. McAllister served as Vice President and Treasurer of Transocean. From March 2011 to December 2011, she served
as Assistant Treasurer of Transocean. Ms. McAllister joined Transocean in 2005 as Director of Tax Reporting and subsequently
served as Finance Director for the Americas Business Unit and the North America Division. Before joining Transocean, she served in
various tax, treasury and finance roles at Helix Energy Solutions Group, Veritas DGC Inc. and Baker Hughes Inc. and began her
career at Deloitte & Touche. Ms. McAllister earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting from the University of Houston in
1989.
We believe that it is important for the company’s chief executive officer to serve on the board of directors, as the chief executive officer
brings a perspective to board decisions that is important for the company. In addition, Ms. McAllister brings an industry and
competitive perspective to the board, which assists the board in making strategic decisions.
Garry Taylor was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer in July 2014. Since November 2012, Mr. Taylor has also served as Global
Finance Director for Transocean. Mr. Taylor previously served as Finance Director for Transocean’s Europe and Africa business unit
from March 2011 to October 2012 and as Assistant Controller, Global Field Accounting from July 2009 to February 2011. Mr. Taylor
joined Transocean in 1998 as Finance & Administration Manager and has served in various finance and accounting positions of
increasing responsibility throughout Transocean’s global organization. Before joining Transocean, Mr. Taylor served in various
finance roles for companies based in Aberdeen, Scotland. Mr. Taylor is a fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.
Mr. Taylor earned a Master of Arts degree in Accounting & Economics from the University of Aberdeen in 1987.
Glyn A. Barker was appointed as a director in July 2014. Mr. Barker served as Vice Chairman-U.K. of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(PwC) from 2008 to 2011. He was also responsible for PwC’s strategy and business development for the geographic areas of Europe,
the Middle East, Africa and India. Mr. Barker joined PwC in 1975 and became an audit partner in 1987. He then established PwC’s
private equity-focused Transactions Services business and led it globally. He joined the Management Board of PwC in the UK as
Head of the Assurance Practice in 2002. In 2006, he became UK Managing Partner and served in that role until 2008. Mr. Barker is a
non-executive director of Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) (since 2012), Auctus Industries plc (since 2014), Berkeley Group Holdings plc
(LON: BKG) (since 2012) and Aviva plc (LON: AV) (since 2012) and Chairman of IMCO Holdings Ltd (since 2012). He is also Deputy
Chairman of the English National Opera Company (since 2009). Mr. Barker received his Bachelor of Science degree in Economics &
Accounting in 1975 from the University of Bristol and is a Chartered Accountant.
We believe that Mr. Barker should serve on the board of directors because his experience in international business and financial and
strategic expertise enhance the board of directors’ understanding of key issues in its global business operations.
We currently do not employ any of our executive officers and rely solely on Transocean to provide us with personnel who will perform
executive officer services for our benefit pursuant to the support or secondment agreements and who will be responsible for our day-
to-day management subject to the direction of our board of directors. Transocean also provides certain advisory and operational
management services to our fleet and will provide management, administrative, financial and other support services to us pursuant to
the master services agreements and the support or secondment agreements.

Reimbursement of Expenses
139
The Transocean Member will be entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred on our behalf. In addition, we will reimburse
Transocean or its affiliates for expenses incurred pursuant to the master services agreements that we will enter into with Transocean.
Please read “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—Master Services
Agreements.”
Executive Compensation
We have not paid any compensation to our directors or officers nor accrued any obligations with respect to management incentive or
retirement benefits prior to this offering. Under the support or secondment agreements, we will reimburse Transocean or its affiliates
for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of executive officers and other administrative services
to us. In addition, we will pay Transocean a services fee for providing these services to us. We expect that we will pay approximately
$4 million in total under the support or secondment agreements for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015. We have
estimated this amount based on the experience of Transocean, which is a public company. The amount of our reimbursement to
Transocean or its affiliates for the time of our officers will depend on an estimate of the percentage of time our officers will spend on
our business and will be based upon a percentage of the salary and benefits Transocean or its affiliates will pay to such officers after
the closing of this offering. We expect that Ms. McAllister will devote substantially all of her business time to our company, and that Mr.
Taylor will devote approximately 15 percent of his business time to our company. Transocean or its affiliates will provide for the
compensation of Ms. McAllister and Mr. Taylor in accordance with its own policies and procedures. We do not expect to pay any
additional compensation to our officers other than with respect to any awards that may be granted under the equity incentive
compensation plan we intend to adopt prior to the completion of this offering as described below under “—Long-Term Incentive Plan.”
Officers and employees of affiliates of Transocean may participate in employee benefit plans and arrangements sponsored by
Transocean or its affiliates, including plans that may be established in the future. Please read “Certain Relationships and Related
Party Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—Master Services Agreements” and “—Support and Secondment
Agreements.”
Compensation of Directors
Our officers or officers of Transocean who also serve as our directors will not receive additional compensation for their service as
directors but may receive director fees in lieu of other compensation paid by Transocean. We anticipate that each non-management
director (which includes non-management directors of Transocean who are also serving as our directors) will receive compensation
for attending meetings of our board of directors, as well as committee meetings. We expect non-management directors will each
receive a director fee of $75,000 per year and an annual award of restricted units under the equity incentive compensation plan we
intend to adopt prior to the completion of this offering having a grant date fair market value of $75,000. The chairman of each of the
audit and conflicts committees will receive an additional fee of $15,000 and $10,000 per year, respectively. In addition, each director
will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses in connection with attending meetings of the board of directors or committees. Each
director will be fully indemnified by us for actions associated with being a director to the extent permitted under Marshall Islands law.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
We intend to adopt the Transocean Partners LLC 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan (“ICP”) for our employees and non-employee
directors and for employees of our affiliates who are seconded to us or who provide services to us. We may issue our non-employee
directors, executive officers and other employees and employees of our affiliates long-term equity based awards under the plan,
which awards will be intended to attract and retain qualified employees and non-employee directors, to encourage the sense of
proprietorship of such persons, and to stimulate the active interests of such persons in the development and financial success of our
company. All determinations with respect to awards to be made under our ICP will be made by our board of
Table of Contents
140
directors or, with respect to employees, any committee thereof that may be established for such purpose or by any delegate of the
board of directors or such committee, subject to applicable law and the terms of the ICP, which we refer to as the administrator. The
following description reflects the principal terms that are currently expected to be included in the ICP.
General
The ICP will provide for the grant, from time to time at the discretion of the administrator, of unit awards, restricted units, phantom units,
unit options, unit appreciation rights, distribution equivalent rights and other unit-based awards. The ICP will limit the number of units
that may be delivered pursuant to awards to 3,448,276 common units, subject to proportionate adjustment in the event of unit splits
and similar events. Common units subject to awards that are canceled, forfeited, or otherwise terminated without delivery of the
common units will be available for delivery pursuant to other awards. However, common units that are withheld or tendered to pay
taxes or an exercise price with respect to an award, including through net settlement, will reduce the number of units available and
will not again be available for delivery pursuant to other awards. Any units we repurchase on the open market using the proceeds
from the exercise of an award will not increase the number of units available for delivery pursuant to other awards. To the extent
permitted by law and applicable exchange listing rules, substitute awards and units issued in place of outstanding awards will not be
counted against the units available under the ICP.
Restricted Units and Phantom Units
A restricted unit is a common unit that is subject to forfeiture. Upon vesting, the forfeiture restrictions lapse and the recipient holds a
common unit that is not subject to forfeiture. A phantom unit is a notional unit that entitles the grantee to receive a common unit upon
the vesting of the phantom unit or, on a deferred basis, upon specified future dates or events or, in the discretion of the administrator,
cash equal to the fair market value of a common unit. The administrator may make grants of restricted and phantom units under the
ICP that contain such terms, consistent with the ICP, as the administrator may determine are appropriate, including the period over
which restricted or phantom units will vest.
Distributions made by us with respect to awards of restricted units may be subject to the same vesting requirements as the restricted
units, in which case such distributions will be held and paid upon vesting of the restricted units.
Distribution Equivalent Rights
The administrator, in its discretion, may also grant distribution equivalent rights, either as standalone awards or in tandem with other
awards. Distribution equivalent rights are rights to receive an amount in cash, restricted units or phantom units equal to all or a portion
of the cash distributions made on units during the period an award remains outstanding.
Unit Options and Unit Appreciation Rights
The ICP also permits the grant of options covering common units. Unit options represent the right to purchase a number of common
units at a specified exercise price. Unit appreciation rights represent the right to receive the appreciation in the value of a number of
common units over a specified exercise price, either in cash or in common units. Unit options and unit appreciation rights may be
granted to such eligible individuals and with such terms as the administrator may determine, consistent with the ICP; however, a unit
option or unit appreciation right must have an exercise price equal to at least the fair market value of a common unit on the date of
grant. Unit appreciation rights may be granted in tandem with unit options, in which case the holder of the tandem award may exercise
the unit option or the unit appreciation right but not both. The term of a unit option or a unit appreciation right may not exceed 10 years.
Table of Contents
Unit Awards
141
Awards covering common units may be granted under the ICP with such terms and conditions, including restrictions on transferability,
as the administrator may establish.
Other Unit-based Awards
The ICP also permits the grant of “other unit-based awards,” which are awards that, in whole or in part, are valued or based on or
related to the value of a common unit. The vesting of an other unit-based award may be based on a participant’s continued service,
the achievement of performance criteria or other measures. Other unit-based awards that vest based on performance criteria are
referred to in the ICP as “performance units.” On vesting or on a deferred basis upon specified future dates or events, an other unit-
based award may be paid in cash and/or in units (including restricted units), or any combination thereof as the administrator may
determine.
Source of Common Units
Common units to be delivered with respect to awards may be newly issued units, common units acquired by us in the open market or
from an affiliate, common units already owned by us, or any combination of the foregoing. If we issue new common units upon the
grant, vesting or payment of awards under the ICP, the total number of common units outstanding will increase.
Anti-Dilution Adjustments and Change in Control
If an “equity restructuring” event occurs that could result in an additional compensation expense under applicable accounting
standards if adjustments to awards under the ICP with respect to such event were discretionary, the administrator will equitably adjust
the number and type of units covered by each outstanding award and the terms and conditions of such award to equitably reflect the
restructuring event, and the administrator will adjust the number and type of units with respect to which future awards may be granted
under the ICP. With respect to other similar events, including, for example, a combination or exchange of units, a merger or
consolidation or recapitalization or reorganization, the administrator shall have discretion to adjust awards in the manner it deems
appropriate and to make equitable adjustments, if any, with respect to the number of units available under the ICP and the kind of
units or other securities available for grant under the ICP, including the number and type of units subject to outstanding awards.
Furthermore, upon any such event, including a change in control of us, the administrator will generally have discretion to (i) accelerate
the time of exercisability or vesting or payment of an award, (ii) require awards to be surrendered in exchange for a cash payment or
substitute other rights or property for the award, or (iii) provide for the award to be assumed by a successor or one of its affiliates, with
appropriate adjustments thereto. Absent one of these events, the exercise or purchase price of an outstanding award may not be
reduced, nor may an outstanding unit option or unit appreciation right be canceled in exchange for cash or another award with a
reduced exercise price or purchase price without the approval of our unitholders.
Termination of Employment
The consequences of the termination of a grantee’s employment with us or our affiliates or membership on our board of directors will
generally be determined by the administrator in the terms of the relevant award agreement.
Amendment or Termination of ICP
The administrator, at its discretion, may terminate the ICP at any time with respect to the common units for which a grant has not
previously been made. Subject to the rules of the principal securities exchange on which our common units are traded, the
administrator also has the right to alter or amend the ICP or any part of it from time to time or to amend any outstanding award made
under the ICP, provided that no change in any outstanding award may be made that would materially impair the vested rights of the
participant without the consent of the affected participant or result in taxation to the participant under Section 409A of the Code.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our units that will be owned upon the consummation of this offering by:
•
•
•
•
each person known by us to be a beneficial owner of more than five percent of the units;
each of our directors;
each of our named executive officers; and
all of our directors and executive officers as a group.
The amounts and percentage of units beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the
determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a
security if that person has or shares “voting power,” which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or
“investment power,” which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. Except as indicated by
footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all units shown as beneficially
owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable.
Percentage of total units to be beneficially owned after this offering is based on 41,379,310 common units outstanding. The table
assumes that the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units is not exercised.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
After this offering, the Transocean Member, a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean, will own 23,879,310 common units and
27,586,207 subordinated units, representing a 74.6 percent limited liability company interest in us. If the underwriters exercise in full
their option to purchase additional common units, the Transocean Member will own 21,254,310 common units and 27,586,207
subordinated units, representing a 70.8 percent limited liability company interest in us. The Transocean Member will also own the
non-economic Transocean Member interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights. In addition, the Transocean Member will
own a 49 percent non-controlling interest in each of the RigCos that own and operate the drilling rigs in our initial fleet. Transocean’s
ability, as the sole owner of the Transocean Member, to control the appointment of three of the seven members of our board of
directors and to approve certain significant actions we may take, and the Transocean Member’s common and subordinated unit
ownership and its right to vote the subordinated units as a separate class on certain matters mean that Transocean will have the
ability to exercise significant influence regarding our management.
Distributions and Payments to the Transocean Member and Its Affiliates
The following table summarizes the distributions and payments to be made by us to the Transocean Member and its affiliates in
connection with the formation, ongoing operation and upon liquidation. These distributions and payments were determined by and
among affiliated entities and, consequently, are not the result of arm’s-length negotiations.

converted into common units, in each case for an amount
equal to the fair market value of those interests. Please read
“The Limited Liability Company Agreement—Withdrawal or
Removal of the Transocean Member.”
Upon our liquidation, the members, including the Transocean
Member with respect to our common and subordinated units,
will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions as described
in “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement
Relating to Cash Distributions—Distributions of Cash Upon
Liquidation.”
Agreements Governing the Transactions
We and other parties will enter into the various agreements that will effect the transactions, including our acquisitions of interests in
the RigCos, the vesting of assets in, and the assumption of liabilities by, us and our subsidiaries. These agreements will not be the
result of arm’s-length negotiations and they, or any of the transactions that they provide for, may not be effected on terms at least as
favorable to the parties to these agreements as they could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties. All of the transaction expenses
incurred in connection with these transactions will be paid from the proceeds of this offering.

Omnibus Agreement
147
On or before the closing of this offering, we and the RigCos will enter into an omnibus agreement with Transocean, the Transocean
Member and certain of Transocean’s other subsidiaries. The following discussion describes certain provisions of the omnibus
agreement.
Noncompetition. Under the omnibus agreement, Transocean will agree, and will cause its controlled affiliates (other than us, our
subsidiaries and any publicly held affiliates of Transocean) to agree, not to acquire, own, operate or contract for any drilling rig that
was constructed in 2009 or later and is operating under a contract for five or more years. For purposes of determining the length of the
contract for purposes of the omnibus agreement, the drilling contract will be deemed to commence on the commencement date of the
drilling contract or the date of execution of an extension related thereto and does not include any unexercised customer option to
extend the term of such drilling contract. We refer to these drilling rigs, together with any related contracts and any associated assets,
as “Five-Year Drilling Rigs” and to all other drilling rigs, together with any related contracts and any associated assets, as “Non-Five-
Year Drilling Rigs.” The restrictions in this paragraph will not prevent Transocean or any of its controlled affiliates (including us and
our subsidiaries, except as set forth below) from:
(1)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting for Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs;
(2)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting one or more Five-Year Drilling Rigs if Transocean offers to sell the drilling rig to
us for the greater of (x) acquisition price or (y) its fair market value (taking into account, among other things, the anticipated
cash flows under the associated drilling contracts), plus in either case any additional taxes (including tax credits used and
benefits foregone), flag administration, financing, debt premium prepayment or make-whole costs, consent fees, transaction
costs, financial advisory, legal and other similar costs associated with the transfer to us at the time of the acquisition (which
we refer to as “break-up costs”);
(3)  constructing any drilling rig that, upon commencement of its drilling contract, will become a Five-Year Drilling Rig (and
acquiring, owning, operating or contracting such rig that is constructed) if, either after the entry into such drilling contract or
upon commencement of such drilling contract, Transocean offers to sell such Five-Year Drilling Rig to us (x) for the all-in
construction price (if the offer was made after the entry into the drilling contract) or (y) for the greater of (1) the all-in
construction price or (2) its fair market value (taking into account the anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling
contracts), plus any break-up costs (if the offer was made upon commencement of the drilling contract);
(4)  putting a Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig under contract for five or more years and acquiring, owning and operating such rig if,
either before or after the time such rig becomes a Five-Year Drilling Rig, Transocean offers to sell the Non-Five-Year
Drilling Rig to us for its fair market value (taking into account, among other things, the anticipated cash flows under the
associated drilling contracts) plus any break-up costs (x) after the time it becomes a Five-Year Drilling Rig and (y) at each
renewal or extension of that contract for a term of five years or longer;
(5)  acquiring one or more Five-Year Drilling Rigs as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business or package of
assets and owning, operating or contracting for those drilling rigs; provided, however, that:
(a) if less than a majority of the value of the business (before taking into account any debt or other associated liabilities) or assets to
be acquired is attributable to Five-Year Drilling Rigs, as determined in good faith by Transocean’s board of directors, Transocean
may consummate the acquisition of the business or assets but must promptly thereafter offer to sell such Five-Year Drilling Rig(s) to
us for the greater of (x) their acquisition price or (y) their fair market value (taking into account, among other things, the anticipated
cash flows under the associated drilling contracts), plus any break-up costs; and

148
(b) if a majority or more of the value of the business (before taking into account any debt or other associated liabilities) or assets to be
acquired is attributable to Five-Year Drilling Rigs, as determined in good faith by Transocean’s board of directors, Transocean must
notify us of the proposed acquisition in writing in advance of acquiring such business or assets. We will, not later than the 10th
calendar day following receipt of such notice, notify Transocean if we wish to acquire any Five-Year Drilling Rig forming part of that
business or package of assets in cooperation and simultaneously with Transocean acquiring the Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs forming
part of that business or package of assets. If we do not notify Transocean of our intent to pursue the acquisition within such 10
calendar days, Transocean may proceed with the acquisition but then must offer to sell Five-Year Drilling Rigs to us as provided in
paragraph (a) above;
(6)  acquiring a noncontrolling interest in any company, business or pool of assets;
(7)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting any Five-Year Drilling Rig if we do not fulfill our obligation to purchase such
drilling rig in accordance with the terms of any existing or future agreement;
(8)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting a Five-Year Drilling Rig subject to the offers to us described in paragraphs (2),
(3), (4) and (5)(a) above pending our determination whether to accept such offers and pending the closing of any offers we
accept;
(9)  providing rig management, operating or similar services relating to any drillship or other drilling rig, including pursuant to a
transition services agreement, operating agreement, bareboat charter or other similar agreement;
(10) owning or operating a Five-Year Drilling Rig that Transocean owns and operates as of the closing of this offering
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, all drilling rigs under construction or contracted to be constructed that have or are
contemplated to have a related drilling contract for five or more years) and that is not included in the fleet of drillships and
other drilling rigs to be contributed to us in connection with the closing of this offering;
(11) acquiring, owning, operating or contracting any Five-Year Drilling Rig if we have previously advised Transocean that we
consent to such acquisition, operation or contract; or
(12) acquiring, owning, operating or contracting any Five-Year Drilling Rig in transactions with any other members of the
Transocean group.
If Transocean or any of its controlled affiliates (other than us, our subsidiaries and any publicly held affiliates of Transocean) acquires,
owns, operates or contracts for Five-Year Drilling Rigs pursuant to any of the exceptions described above, it may not subsequently
enter into any new drilling contracts for such Five-Year Drilling Rigs without again complying with the provisions described above.
The omnibus agreement does not prohibit Transocean from forming a new publicly traded entity that will not be subject to the
omnibus agreement and that may compete with us.
In addition, under the omnibus agreement we will agree, and will cause our subsidiaries to agree, not to acquire, own, operate or
contract for any Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs. The restrictions in this paragraph will not prevent us from:
(1)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting any Five-Year Drilling Rig;
(2)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting one or more Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs if we offer to sell such Non-Five-Year
Drilling Rig to Transocean for the greater of (x) acquisition price or (y) its fair market value (taking into account the
anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts), plus any break-up costs;
(3)  constructing any drilling rig that, upon commencement of its drilling contract, will become a Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig (and
acquiring, owning, operating or contracting such rig once constructed) if, either after the entry into the drilling contract or
upon commencement of the drilling contract, we offer to sell such Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig to Transocean (x) for the all-in
construction price (if the offer was made after the entry into the drilling contract) or (y) for the greater of (a) the all-in
construction price or (2) its fair market value, plus any break-up costs (if the offer was made upon commencement of such
drilling contract);

(4)  putting a Five-Year Drilling Rig under contract for less than five years and acquiring, owning and operating such rig if,
either before or after the time such rig becomes a Non-Five-Year Rig, we offer to sell such Five-Year Drilling Rig to
Transocean for its fair market value (taking into account the anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts)
plus any break-up costs (x) after the time it becomes a Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig and (y) at each renewal or extension of
that contract (other than a renewal or extension with the existing customer for that rig) for less than five years;
(5)  acquiring one or more Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business or
package of assets and owning, operating or contracting such Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig; provided, however, that:
(a) if less than a majority of the value of the business (before taking into account any debt or other associated liabilities) or assets
acquired is attributable to Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs, as determined in good faith by the conflicts committee of our board of directors,
we may consummate the acquisition of the business or assets but must promptly thereafter offer to sell such Non-Five-Year Drilling
Rig to Transocean for the greater of (x) their acquisition price or (y) their fair market value (taking into account, among other things, the
anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts), plus any break-up costs; and
(b) if a majority or more of the value of the business (before taking into account any debt or other associated liabilities) or assets
acquired is attributable to Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs, as determined in good faith by the conflicts committee of our board of directors,
we must notify Transocean of the proposed acquisition in writing in advance of acquiring such business or assets. Transocean will,
not later than the 10th calendar day following receipt of such notice, notify us if it wishes to acquire any Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig
forming part of that business or package of assets in cooperation and simultaneously with our acquiring the Five-Year Drilling Rigs
forming part of that business or package of assets. If Transocean does not notify us of its intent to pursue the acquisition within such

(10)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting any Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig if Transocean has previously advised us that it
consents to such acquisition, operation or contract; or
(11)  acquiring, owning, operating or contracting any Non-Five-Year Drilling Rig in transactions with any other members of our
company group.
Upon a change of control of us or the Transocean Member, the noncompetition provisions of the omnibus agreement will terminate
immediately. Upon a change of control of Transocean, the noncompetition provisions of the omnibus agreement applicable to
Transocean will terminate at the time that is the later of the date of the change of control and the date on which all of our outstanding
subordinated units have converted to common units.
Transocean’s Obligation to Offer Ultra-Deepwater Drilling Rigs. Under the omnibus agreement, Transocean also will be required
to offer us the opportunity to purchase not less than a 51 percent interest in four of the following six drillships that are currently under
construction within the five years following the closing of this offering at the greater of fair market value (taking into account the
anticipated cash flows under the
Table of Contents
150
associated drilling contracts) or the all-in construction cost, plus transaction costs: Deepwater Invictus, Deepwater Thalassa,
Deepwater Proteus, Deepwater Pontus, Deepwater Poseidon and Deepwater Conqueror.
Right of First Offer on Drilling Rigs. Under the omnibus agreement, we and our subsidiaries will grant to Transocean a right of first
offer on any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of any Five-Year Drilling Rigs or Non-Five-Year Drilling Rigs owned by us.
This right of first offer will not apply to (a) a sale, transfer or other disposition of drilling rigs between any affiliated subsidiaries or
(b) merger with or into, or sale of substantially all of the assets to, an unaffiliated third-party.
Prior to engaging in any negotiation regarding any drilling rig’s disposition with respect to a Five-Year Drilling Rig or any Non-Five-
Year Drilling Rig with a non-affiliated third-party, we will deliver a written notice to Transocean setting forth the material terms and
conditions of the proposed transaction. During the 30-day period after the delivery of such notice, we and Transocean will negotiate in
good faith to reach an agreement on the transaction. If we do not reach an agreement within such 30-day period, we will be able
within the next 180 calendar days to sell, transfer, dispose or re-contract the drilling rig to a third party (or to agree in writing to
undertake such transaction with a third party) on terms generally no less favorable to the third party than those offered pursuant to the
written notice.
Upon a change of control of us or the Transocean Member, the provisions of the omnibus agreement relating to the right of first offer
with respect to the drilling rigs will terminate immediately.
Rights of First Offer on the Equity Interests in the RigCos. Under the omnibus agreement, Transocean has granted us a right of
first offer on its remaining ownership interests in each of the RigCos should Transocean decide to transfer, assign, sell or otherwise
dispose of such interests. Under the omnibus agreement, we and our subsidiaries will grant a similar right of first offer to Transocean
on any proposed transfer, assignment, sale or other disposition of any equity interests in each of the RigCos. Any such right of first
offer will be subject to our and Transocean’s ability to agree on mutually acceptable terms of purchase, including price. These rights
of first offer will not apply to a transfer, assignment, sale or other disposition of any equity interest in the RigCos between any
controlled affiliates.
Prior to engaging in any negotiation regarding any disposition of equity interests in any of the RigCos to an unaffiliated third party, we
or Transocean, as the case may be, will deliver a written notice to the other party setting forth the proposed material terms and
conditions of the proposed transactions. During the 30-day period after the delivery of such notice, we and Transocean will negotiate
in good-faith to reach an agreement on the transaction. If we do not reach an agreement within such 30-day period, we or
Transocean, as the case may be, will be able, within the next 180 days, to transfer, assign, sell or otherwise dispose of any equity
interest in the RigCos to an unaffiliated third party (or agree in writing to undertake such transaction with a third party) on terms
generally no less favorable to us or Transocean, as the case may be, than those included in the written notice.
Upon a change of control of us or the Transocean Member, the provisions of the omnibus agreement relating to the right of first offer
with respect to the equity interests in the RigCos will terminate automatically. Upon a change of control of Transocean, the right of first
offer provisions applicable to Transocean under the omnibus agreement will terminate at the later of (a) the date on which all of the
outstanding subordinated units have converted into common units and (b) the date of the change of control of Transocean.
Indemnification. Under the omnibus agreement, Transocean will indemnify us after the closing of this offering for a period of five
years against certain environmental and human health and safety liabilities with respect to the assets contributed or sold to us to the
extent arising prior to the time they were contributed or sold to us. Liabilities resulting from a change in law after the closing of this
offering are excluded from the environmental indemnity. There is an aggregate cap of $10 million on the amount of indemnity
coverage provided by Transocean for such environmental and human health and safety liabilities. No claim for indemnification may
be made unless the aggregate dollar amount of all claims exceeds $500,000, in which case Transocean is liable for claims only to the
extent such aggregate amount exceeds $500,000.

151
Transocean will also indemnify us to the full extent of any liabilities related to:
•
•
•
•
certain defects in title to Transocean’s assets contributed or sold to the RigCos and any failure to obtain, prior to the time
they were contributed, certain consents and permits necessary to conduct, own and operate such assets, which liabilities
arise within three years after the closing of this offering;
any judicial determination substantially to the effect that the Transocean affiliate that transferred any of our initial assets to
us pursuant to the contribution agreement did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange therefor or was
rendered insolvent by such transfer;
tax liabilities attributable to the operation of the assets contributed or sold to the RigCos prior to the closing of this offering;
and
any lost revenue arising out of the failure to receive an operating dayrate from Chevron for Discoverer Clear Leader, up to
$100 million, for the period commencing on the closing date of this offering through the completion of its 2014 special
periodic survey. As a result of this indemnity, we do not expect that the out of service periods described in “Summary—
Operational Update” will reduce the amount of our cash available for distribution.
In addition, Transocean will indemnify us after the closing of this offering against any liabilities arising out of the Macondo well
incident occurring prior to this offering and any liabilities (other than taxes) arising from Transocean’s or its subsidiaries’ failure to
comply with the Consent Decree, the EPA Agreement or any similar decree or agreement. There is no monetary cap on the amount of
the indemnity provided by Transocean related to the Macondo well incident, the Consent Decree, the EPA Agreement or any similar
decree or agreement. However, these indemnities does not cover or include any amount of consequential damages, including lost
profits or revenues.
Amendments. The omnibus agreement may not be amended without the prior approval of the conflicts committee of our board of
directors if the proposed amendment will, in the reasonable discretion of our board of directors, adversely affect holders of our
common units.
Master Services Agreements

Transocean or its affiliates will provide certain administrative, technical and non-executive management services to us and the
RigCos and any of our other subsidiaries. The agreement has an initial term of five years.
Each of the master services agreements may be terminated prior to the end of its term by us (i) upon 90 days’ written notice for any
reason in the sole discretion of our board of directors or (ii) immediately upon written notice if Transocean or its affiliates (other than us
and our subsidiaries) breaches any material obligation of the master services agreements and such breach shall continue for a period
of 90 days after written notice has been delivered. Each of the master services agreements may be terminated prior to the end of its
term by Transocean upon 90 days’ written notice of (i) a change of control of us or (ii) removal of the Transocean Member. In addition,
each of the master services agreements may be terminated prior to the end of its term by either us or Transocean within 90 days of the

Each month, we will reimburse Transocean for the cost of all direct labor, materials and expenses incurred in connection with the
provision of these services, plus an allocated portion of Transocean’s shared and pooled direct costs, indirect costs and general and
administrative costs as determined by Transocean’s internal accounting procedures. In addition, we will pay Transocean a fee equal
to the greater of (i) five percent of its costs and expenses incurred in connection with providing services to us for the month or, in the
case of the provision of capital spares or inventory, a four percent markup on the capital spare or inventory plus a four percent markup
on the allocable share of the costs of providing such services and, (ii) the markup required by applicable transfer pricing rules. If
Transocean incurs costs and expenses from third parties in the course of subcontracting the performance of services, we must
reimburse Transocean at cost and are not required to pay a service fee, unless required by applicable transfer pricing rules. Amounts
payable under the master services agreements must be paid within 30 days after Transocean submits to us invoices for such fees,
costs and expenses.
Under the master services agreements, we will indemnify Transocean and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
subcontractors against all actions which may be brought against them in connection with the services it performs under the master
services agreements, except to the extent caused by Transocean’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud. Transocean will
only indemnify us for damages brought in connection with the services it performs under the master services agreements to the extent
caused by such gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud except for damages arising from services rendered by Transocean in
connection with certain drilling contracts with indemnity provisions that do not conform to Transocean’s contracting principles, for
which Transocean will not indemnify us, regardless of cause. Transocean’s obligation to indemnify us for gross negligence or willful
misconduct is limited to 10 times the annual services fee in the calendar year period prior to the occurrence giving rise to the
damages, and Transocean will generally have limited obligations to us for any failure to perform under such agreement in the
absence of such indemnity.
We expect that we will pay approximately $11 million in total under the master services agreements for the twelve months ending
September 30, 2015.
Support and Secondment Agreements
We do not currently and do not intend to have any direct employees. We rely on Transocean to provide us with our executives, the rig
crews and other personnel pursuant to secondment agreements. All persons provided to us pursuant to secondment agreements will
remain on the payroll and benefit plans of Transocean but will be under our day-to-day control and management. We will reimburse
Transocean for the pro rata gross payroll costs of each seconded employee in proportion to the time allocated to us by the seconded
employee, including base pay, any incentive compensation and any benefits costs. We will also reimburse Transocean for any
applicable unemployment taxes, Social Security taxes, workers compensation coverage and severance costs (and any foreign
equivalents of such taxes) in the amount allocable to the secondment. Transocean will invoice us quarterly for amounts payable
under the secondment agreement. The secondment agreement may be terminated by Transocean or us upon 90 days written notice.
Certain administrative professionals, including our chief financial officer, will be provided to us by Transocean pursuant to a support
agreement. The persons providing services to us pursuant to a support agreement will remain on Transocean’s payroll and will
perform their services on or at Transocean’s facilities. Transocean will be solely responsible for all matters pertaining to their
employment, compensation and discharge. Such persons may spend only a portion of their time providing services to us and they
may be engaged in other work separate from support services on our behalf. We will reimburse Transocean for the pro rata expenses
associated with the compensation and benefits of all persons covered by the support agreement according to the time spent by each
person in providing us support services as well as certain direct costs and expenses incurred in offering the services. The support
agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of Transocean and us.
We are also responsible under both the secondment agreements and support agreement for any excise, sales, use, transfer, stamp,
documentary, filing, recordation or similar taxes and any value added, goods and services or
Table of Contents
154
similar recoverable indirect and other similar taxes imposed as a result of a secondment agreement or support agreement. In addition,
we will indemnify Transocean for any liabilities that may arise from events with respect to the seconded employees or personnel
providing services under a support agreement, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of
such persons. Transocean will indemnify us for any liabilities that may arise from the failure of Transocean to carry out its duties for
the payment of payroll, costs and expenses for seconded employees or personnel providing services under a support agreement, or
the provision of benefits related thereto.
RigCo Governing Documents
At the closing of this offering, we will own a 51 percent ownership interest in each of the RigCos and control their operations and
activities. The Transocean Member owns a 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. We and the Transocean Member
have entered into governing documents for each of the RigCos that govern the ownership and management of each of the RigCos.
Each of the RigCos is managed by its board of directors. Pursuant to such governing documents, we are able to control the election of
these boards of directors as the majority interest owner. Subject to the approval of the board of directors of each of the RigCos, each
RigCo will transfer its available cash to its equityholders each quarter. Approval of the conflicts committee of our board of directors will
be required to amend the RigCos’ governing documents.

On or before the closing of this offering, we will enter into a contribution agreement with the Transocean Member and certain of its
subsidiaries that will effect certain of the transactions described under “Summary—Formation Transactions,” including the transfer of
51 percent of the ownership interest in each of the RigCos.
Revolving Credit Facilities
In March 2014, we entered into credit agreements with a Transocean affiliate, establishing credit facilities with an aggregate
borrowing capacity of $300 million that will expire on March 31, 2017. We may borrow under the credit facilities at the applicable U.S.
federal rate as issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. At the closing of this offering, we expect to terminate these credit
agreements.
Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility
On or before the closing of this offering, we will enter into an agreement with an affiliate of Transocean establishing a five-year
revolving credit facility with a committed borrowing capacity of $300 million to be used to fund working capital requirements,
acquisitions and other general company purposes and that allows for uncommitted increases in amounts to be agreed upon by
Transocean and us. We may borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered
Rate plus a margin, or the revolving credit facility margin, or (2) the base rate specified in the credit agreement plus the revolving
credit facility margin, less one percent per annum. The revolving credit facility margin will fluctuate based on our leverage ratio.
Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”
364-Day Working Capital Note Payable and Related Agreements
On or before the closing of this offering, we will issue a 364-day working capital note payable of approximately $43 million to an
affiliate of Transocean. We will enter into this note payable in exchange for cash proceeds of $43 million, all or a portion of which we
will pay to the Transocean Member for our pro rata share of certain working capital balances. The 364-day working capital note
payable is payable at maturity and bears interest at a rate equal to the rate for Eurocurrency loans under our Five-Year Revolving
Credit Facility. Amounts under the 364-day working capital note payable may be repaid early without penalty, and amounts repaid
cannot be reborrowed.

155
The proceeds from the 364-day note will be used as partial consideration for contributed working capital in connection with our
acquisition of interests in the RigCos. In connection with the acquisition, an affiliate of Transocean has agreed to guarantee the
payment of any receivables held by the RigCos at the closing of the acquisition. In addition, the assignment and bill of sale
agreements for the acquisition will contain a true-up mechanism whereby we will pay an affiliate of Transocean for the amount by
which our pro rata share of actual net working capital as determined within 60 days after the acquisition exceeds our pro rata share of
estimated net working capital at the time of the acquisition and the Transocean affiliate will pay us if such actual net working capital is
less than such estimated net working capital.
Procedures for Review, Approval and Ratification of Related Person Transactions
The board of directors will adopt a related party transactions policy in connection with the closing of this offering that will provide that
the board of directors or its authorized committee will review all related person transactions that are required to be disclosed under
SEC rules and, when appropriate, authorize or ratify all such transactions. In the event that the board of directors or its authorized
committee considers ratification of a related person transaction and determines not to so ratify, the related party transactions policy
will provide that our management will make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul the transaction.
The related party transactions policy will provide that, in determining whether or not to recommend the approval or ratification of a
related person transaction, the board of directors or its authorized committee should consider all of the relevant facts and
circumstances available, including but not limited to:
•
•
whether there is an appropriate business justification for the transaction;
the benefits that accrue to us as a result of the transaction;
•
•
•
•
•
the terms available to unrelated third parties entering into similar transactions;
the impact of the transaction on a director’s independence (in the event the related person is a director, an immediate family
member of a director or an entity in which a director or an immediate family member of a director is a partner, unitholder,
member or executive officer);
the availability of other sources for comparable products or services;
whether it is a single transaction or a series of ongoing, related transactions; and
whether entering into the transaction would be consistent with the code of business conduct and ethics.
The related party transactions policy described above will be adopted in connection with the closing of this offering and, as a result,
the related party transactions described above under “—Agreements Governing the Transactions” were not reviewed under such
policy.

Conflicts of Interest
156
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND DUTIES
Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between the Transocean Member and its affiliates,
including Transocean, on the one hand, and us and our unaffiliated members, on the other hand. Our board of directors has a duty to
manage us in a manner it believes is beneficial to us. We expect that certain of our executive officers and a majority of our directors
will also be directors and/or officers of Transocean or its affiliates and, as such, they will owe fiduciary duties to Transocean that may
cause them to pursue business strategies that disproportionately benefit Transocean or which otherwise are not in the best interests
of us or our unitholders. These officers have fiduciary duties to those entities and not to us. As a result of these relationships, conflicts
of interest may arise between us and our unaffiliated members on the one hand, and Transocean and its other affiliates, including the
Transocean Member, on the other hand. Our directors have duties to influence, in our role as controlling owner, the decisions made
by the RigCos in a manner beneficial to us. At the same time, the directors and officers of the RigCos have a duty to act for the
RigCos in a manner beneficial to all of the RigCos’ owners, including Transocean. While we will have influence in our role as
controlling owner of the RigCos, the directors and officers of the RigCos will exercise decisions of the RigCos and they will have a
duty to act in the best interests of the RigCos. Our board of directors may resolve conflicts of interest between Transocean and us and,
to the extent acting in our role as the controlling owner of the RigCos, has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the
conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not be in the best interest of us or our unitholders.
Our company affairs are governed by our limited liability company agreement and the Marshall Islands Act. The provisions of the
Marshall Islands Act resemble provisions of the limited liability company laws of a number of states in the United States, most notably
Delaware. We are not aware of any material difference in unitholder rights between the Marshall Islands Act and the Delaware
Limited Liability Company Act. The Marshall Islands Act also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the
laws of the State of Delaware and, so long as it does not conflict with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of the Marshall Islands
courts, the non-statutory law or “case law” of the courts of the State of Delaware is adopted as the law of the Marshall Islands. There
have been few, if any, court cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the Marshall Islands Act, in contrast to Delaware, which has a
fairly well-developed body of case law interpreting its limited liability company statute. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether
Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as courts in Delaware. For example, the rights of our unitholders and
responsibilities of the Transocean Member and its affiliates and our directors and our officers under Marshall Islands law are not as
clearly established as under judicial precedent in existence in Delaware. Due to the less-developed nature of Marshall Islands law,
our public unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests or seeking remedies in the face of actions by the
Transocean Member, its affiliates and our directors and our officers or our controlling unitholders than would unitholders of a limited
liability company organized in the United States.
Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions replacing the fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by the
Transocean Member and our directors and officers with contractual standards governing their duties and the methods of resolving
conflicts of interest. Our limited liability company agreement also specifically defines the remedies available to unitholders for actions
taken by the Transocean Member or our directors or officers that, without these defined liability standards, might constitute breaches
of those duties.
Our board of directors will not be in breach of its obligations under the limited liability company agreement or duties to us or the
unitholders if the resolution of the conflict is:
•
•
approved by the conflicts committee, which our limited liability company agreement defines as “special approval,” although
our board of directors is not obligated to seek such approval;
approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by the
Transocean Member or any of its affiliates, although neither the Transocean Member nor our board of directors are
obligated to seek such approval;
Table of Contents
157
•
•
determined by our board of directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or
available from unrelated third parties, but our board of directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an
independent third party; or
determined by our board of directors to be fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships
between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.
If our board of directors seeks or obtains approval from the conflicts committee, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision,
the conflicts committee acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company challenging
such determination, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. If our
board of directors does not seek or obtain approval from the conflicts committee or our unitholders and our board of directors
determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth
in the third and fourth bullet points above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, our board of directors, including board
members affected by the conflict, acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company
challenging such determination, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such
presumption. Unless the resolution of a conflict is specifically provided for in our limited liability company agreement, our board of
directors or the conflicts committee of our board of directors may consider any factors it determines in good faith to consider when
resolving a conflict. When our limited liability company agreement requires someone to act in good faith, it requires that person to
subjectively believe that he is acting in a manner that is in, or not adverse to, the best interests of the company or that the
determination to take or not to take action meets the specified standard, for example, a transaction on terms no less favorable to the us
than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or is “fair and reasonable” to us. In taking such action,
such person may take into account the totality of the circumstances or the totality of the relationships between the parties involved,
including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us. If that person has the required subjective belief,
then the decision or action will be conclusively deemed to be in good faith for all purposes under our limited liability company
agreement. Please read “Management—Committees of the Board of Directors—Conflicts Committee” for information about the
conflicts committee of our board of directors.
Conflicts of interest could arise in the situations described below, among others.
Actions taken by our board of directors may affect the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders or accelerate
the right to convert subordinated units.
The amount of cash that is available for distribution to unitholders is affected by decisions of our board of directors regarding such
matters as:
•
•
the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales;
cash expenditures;
•
•
•
•
borrowings;
estimates of maintenance and replacement capital expenditures;
the issuance of additional units; and
the creation, reduction or increase of reserves in any quarter.
Our board of directors determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is classified
as a maintenance and replacement capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which
does not reduce operating surplus. These determinations can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders and to the
Transocean Member and the ability of the subordinated units to convert into common units.
Table of Contents
158
In addition, our board of directors may use an amount, initially equal to $50.0 million, which would not otherwise constitute available
cash from operating surplus, in order to permit the payment of cash distributions on the units and incentive distribution rights. All of
these actions may affect the amount of cash distributed to our unitholders and the Transocean Member and may facilitate the
conversion of subordinated units into common units.
In addition, borrowings by us and our affiliates do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by the Transocean Member or our
directors or officers to our unitholders, including borrowings that have the purpose or effect of:
•
•
enabling the Transocean Member or its affiliates to receive distributions on any subordinated units held by them or the
incentive distribution rights; or
accelerating the expiration of the subordination period.
For example, in the event we have not generated sufficient cash from our operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our
common units and our subordinated units, our limited liability company agreement permits us to borrow funds, which would enable us
to make this distribution on all outstanding units. Please read “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement Relating to
Cash Distributions—Subordination Period.”
Our limited liability company agreement provides that we and our subsidiaries may borrow funds from the Transocean Member and its
affiliates.
Neither our limited liability company agreement nor any other agreement requires Transocean to pursue a business strategy
that favors us or utilizes our assets or dictates what markets to pursue or grow. Transocean’s directors and executive
officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of Transocean, which may be contrary to our
interests.
Because we expect that certain of our executive officers and a majority of our directors will also be directors and/or officers of
Transocean or its affiliates, such officers and directors will have fiduciary duties to Transocean that may cause them to pursue
business strategies that disproportionately benefit Transocean or which otherwise are not in our best interests.
Our officers face conflicts in the allocation of their time to our business.
Our officers, who are employed by Transocean and perform executive officer functions for us pursuant to agreements with
Transocean, are not required to work full-time on our affairs and also perform services for affiliates of Transocean. Transocean
conducts substantial businesses and activities of its own in which we have no economic interest. As a result, there could be material
competition for the time and effort of our officers who also provide services to Transocean, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We will reimburse the Transocean Member and its affiliates for expenses.
Pursuant to our limited liability company agreement, we will reimburse the Transocean Member and its affiliates for costs and
expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our limited liability company agreement provides that our board of
directors will determine the expenses that are allocable to us. Please read “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”
and “Management—Reimbursement of Expenses.”
Table of Contents
159
Common unitholders will have no right to enforce obligations of Transocean and its affiliates under agreements with us.
No agreement between us, on the one hand, and Transocean and its affiliates, on the other, will grant to the unitholders, separate and
apart from us, the right to enforce the obligations of Transocean and its affiliates in our favor.
Contracts between us, on the one hand, and Transocean and its affiliates, on the other, will not be the result of arm’s-length
negotiations.
Neither our limited liability company agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts and arrangements between us and
Transocean and its affiliates are or will be the result of arm’s-length negotiations. Our limited liability company agreement generally
provides that any affiliated transaction, such as an agreement, contract or arrangement between us and Transocean and its affiliates
that does not receive unitholder or conflicts committee approval, must be:
•
•
determined by our board of directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or
available from unrelated third parties, but our board of directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an
independent third party; or
determined by our board of directors to be “fair and reasonable” to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships
between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.
Affiliates of Transocean, which will provide certain management and administrative services to us, may also enter into additional
contractual arrangements with any of its affiliates on our behalf; however, there is no obligation of the Transocean Member and its
affiliates to enter into any contracts of this kind.
Common units are subject to the Transocean Member’s limited call right.
The Transocean Member may exercise its right to purchase common units as provided in our limited liability company agreement or
assign this right to one of its affiliates or to us free of any liability or obligation to us or our members. The Transocean Member is not
obligated to obtain a fairness opinion, nor shall unitholders have dissenters’ rights of appraisal, regarding the value of the common
units to be purchased by the Transocean Member upon the exercise of this limited call right. As a result, a common unitholder may
have common units purchased from the unitholder at an undesirable time or price. Please read “The Limited Liability Company
Agreement—Limited Call Right.”
We may choose not to retain separate counsel, accountants or others for ourselves or for the holders of common units.
The attorneys, independent accountants and others who perform services for us have been retained by our board of directors.
Attorneys, independent accountants and others who perform services for us are selected by our board of directors or the conflicts
committee and may perform services for Transocean and its affiliates. We may choose to retain separate counsel, independent
accountants or other service providers for ourselves or the holders of common units in the event of a conflict of interest between
Transocean and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or the holders of common units, on the other, depending on the nature of the
conflict. We do not intend to do so in most cases.

Except as provided in the omnibus agreement, the Transocean Member’s affiliates, including Transocean, may compete with
us and neither the Transocean Member nor its affiliates nor our directors and officers have any obligation to present
business opportunities to us.
Under the omnibus agreement, Transocean will agree and will cause its controlled affiliates to agree, for so long as Transocean
controls us, not to engage in the businesses described above under the caption “Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions—Agreements Governing the Transactions—Omnibus Agreement—Noncompetition.” Except as provided above,
affiliates of the Transocean Member are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in
direct competition with us. Furthermore, the omnibus agreement does not prohibit Transocean from forming a new publicly traded
entity that will not be subject to the omnibus agreement and that may compete with us. In addition, under our limited liability company
agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, will not apply to the Transocean Member, its affiliates or
our directors and officers. As a result, neither the Transocean Member nor any of its affiliates nor any of our directors and officers will
have any obligation to present business opportunities to us other than as provided in the omnibus agreement.
Duties
The duties owed to unitholders by the Transocean Member and its affiliates and our directors and officers are generally set forth in our
limited liability company agreement. The Marshall Islands Act provides that Marshall Islands limited liability companies may, in their
limited liability company agreements, expand or restrict the fiduciary duties owed by members or directors to the company or another
member or director.
In addition, we and our subsidiaries have entered into two master services agreements and one or more support services or
secondment agreements, and may enter into additional agreements with Transocean and certain of its subsidiaries. In the
performance of their obligations under these agreements, Transocean and its subsidiaries are not held to a fiduciary standard of care
but rather to the standards of care specified in the relevant agreement.
As permitted by the Marshall Islands Act, our limited liability company agreement contains various provisions replacing any fiduciary
duties that might otherwise be owed by the Transocean Member or by our directors and officers with contractual standards governing
the duties of the Transocean Member and our directors and officers and the methods of resolving conflicts of interest. These
provisions, among other things, allow the Transocean Member and our directors and officers to take into account the interests of other
parties in addition to our interests when resolving conflicts of interest. We believe this is appropriate and necessary because many of
our directors and officers have fiduciary duties to Transocean and its affiliates, and might otherwise have fiduciary duties to our
members as well. Without these provisions, the Transocean Member’s and our directors’ and officers’ ability to make decisions
involving conflicts of interest would be restricted. We believe these provisions strengthen our ability to attract and retain experienced
and capable directors and officers. These provisions disadvantage the common unitholders because, among other things, they restrict
the rights and remedies available to members for actions that, without these provisions, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty, as
described below and permit the Transocean Member and our directors and officers to take into account the interests of third parties in
addition to our interests when resolving conflicts of interest.
Table of Contents
The following is a summary of:
161
•
•
•
the duties imposed on the Transocean Member and our directors and officers by the Marshall Islands Act;
material modifications of these duties contained in our limited liability company agreement; and
certain rights and remedies of unitholders contained in our limited liability company agreement and the Marshall Islands
Act.
Marshall Islands law fiduciary duty standards
The Marshall Islands Act does not specifically provide that members or directors or
officers of limited liability companies have any statutory fiduciary duties. Because
the Marshall Islands Act provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it
uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and, so long as it does not conflict
with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of the Marshall Islands courts, the non-
statutory law or “case law” of the courts of the State of Delaware is adopted as the
law of the Marshall Islands, it is possible that, in the absence of provisions in the
limited liability company agreement to the contrary, a Marshall Islands court could
determine that certain fiduciary duties would apply to the members and directors
and officers of a Marshall Islands limited liability company, in accordance with
Delaware case law.
Limited liability company agreement modified
standards
Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions that permit or consent
to conduct by the Transocean Member and its affiliates and our directors and
officers that might otherwise raise issues as to compliance with fiduciary duties
under the laws of the Marshall Islands. For example, our limited liability company
agreement provides that, to the extent permitted by law, when the Transocean
Member takes actions provided under the limited liability company agreement, it
may act without any fiduciary obligation to us or the unitholders whatsoever. These
provisions may restrict the obligations to which the Transocean Member and our
directors and officers might otherwise be held. Our limited liability company
agreement generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of
conflicts of interest not involving a vote of unitholders and that are not approved by
the conflicts committee of our board of directors must be:
•
•
determined by our board of directors to be on terms no less favorable to us
than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third
parties, but our board of directors is not required to obtain confirmation to
such effect from an independent third party; or
determined by our board of directors to be “fair and reasonable” to us, taking
into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved,
including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or
advantageous to us.
Table of Contents
162
Rights and remedies of unitholders
If approval from the conflicts committee is sought, then it will be presumed that, in
making its decision, the conflicts committee acted in good faith, and in any
proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company challenging
such determination, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have
the burden of overcoming such presumption. If approval from the conflicts
committee is not sought, and our board of directors determines that the resolution
or course of action taken with respect to the conflict of interest satisfies either of the
standards set forth in the bullet points above, then it will be presumed that, in
making its decision, our board of directors acted in good faith, and in any
proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company, the person
bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such
presumption. These standards may reduce the obligations to which our board of
directors might otherwise be held.
In addition to the other more specific provisions limiting the obligations of the
Transocean Member and our directors and officers, our limited liability company
agreement further provides that the Transocean Member and our officers and
directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our members for errors of
judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the
Transocean Member or our officers or directors acted in bad faith or engaged in
fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with
knowledge that conduct was unlawful. However, this limitation does not apply to
any claims made under the federal securities laws.
The provisions of the Marshall Islands Act resemble the provisions of the limited
liability company act of Delaware. For example, like Delaware, the Marshall
Islands Act favors the principles of freedom of contract and enforceability of limited
liability company agreements and allows our limited liability company agreement
to contain terms governing the rights of our unitholders. The rights of our
unitholders, including voting and approval rights and the ability of the company to
issue additional units, are governed by the terms of our limited liability company
agreement. Please read “The Limited Liability Company Agreement.”
As to remedies of unitholders, the Marshall Islands Act generally provides that a
member may institute legal action on behalf of the company to recover damages
from a third party where managers have refused to institute the action or where an
effort to cause those managers to do so is not likely to succeed. These actions
include actions against the Transocean Member for breach of its duties or of our
limited liability company agreement. In addition, the statutory or case law of some
jurisdictions may permit a member to institute legal action on behalf of himself and
all other similarly situated limited partners to recover damages from the board of
directors for violations of its fiduciary duties to the members.

Table of Contents
By purchasing our common units, each common unitholder will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by the provisions in our
limited liability company agreement, including the provisions discussed above. Please read “Description of the Common Units—
Transfer of Common Units.” This is in accordance with the policy of the Marshall Islands Act favoring the principle of freedom of
contract and the enforceability of limited liability company agreements. The failure of a member to sign our limited liability company
agreement does not render our limited liability company agreement unenforceable against that person.
Under the limited liability company agreement, we must indemnify the Transocean Member and our directors and officers to the fullest
extent permitted by law, against liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by the Transocean Member or these other persons. We must
provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that these persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. We also must provide this indemnification
for criminal proceedings except when the Transocean Member or these other persons acted with knowledge that their conduct was
unlawful. Thus, the Transocean Member and our directors and officers could, among other things, be indemnified for their negligent
acts if they met the requirements set forth above. To the extent that these provisions purport to include indemnification for liabilities
arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is contrary
to public policy and therefore unenforceable. Please read “The Limited Liability Company Agreement—Indemnification.”

The Units
164
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMON UNITS
The common units and the subordinated units represent limited liability company interests in us. The holders of units are entitled to
participate in company distributions and exercise the rights and privileges available to members under our limited liability company
agreement. For a description of the relative rights and privileges of holders of common units and subordinated units in and to
company distributions, please read this section and “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement Relating to Cash
Distributions.” For a description of the rights and privileges of members under our limited liability company agreement, including
voting rights, please read “The Limited Liability Company Agreement.”
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Duties
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will serve as registrar and transfer agent for the common units. We pay all fees charged by the
transfer agent for transfers of common units, except the following, which must be paid by unitholders:
•
•
surety bond premiums to replace lost or stolen certificates, taxes and other governmental charges;
special charges for services requested by a holder of a common unit; and
•
other similar fees or charges.
There is no charge to unitholders for disbursements of our cash distributions. We will indemnify the transfer agent, its agents and each
of their stockholders, directors, officers and employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted
for its activities in that capacity, except for any liability due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified
person or entity.
Resignation or Removal
The transfer agent may resign, by notice to us, or be removed by us. The resignation or removal of the transfer agent will become
effective upon our appointment of a successor transfer agent and registrar and its acceptance of the appointment. If a successor has
not been appointed or has not accepted its appointment within 30 days after notice of the resignation or removal, the Transocean
Member may, at the direction of our board of directors, act as the transfer agent and registrar until a successor is appointed.
Transfer of Common Units
By transfer of common units in accordance with our limited liability company agreement, each transferee of common units will be
admitted as a member with respect to the common units transferred when such transfer and admission is reflected in our books and
records. Each transferee, with or without executing our limited liability company agreement:
•
•
•
agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of our limited liability company agreement;
represents that the transferee has the power, authority and capacity to enter into our limited liability company agreement;
and
gives the consents, acknowledgements and waivers contained in our limited liability company agreement, such as the
approval of all transactions and agreements we are entering into in connection with our formation and this offering.
We are entitled to treat the nominee holder of a common unit as the absolute owner in the event such nominee is the record holder of
such common unit. In such case, the beneficial holder’s rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a
result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the nominee holder.
Table of Contents
165
Common units are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing the transfer of securities. Until a common unit has
been transferred on our register, we and the transfer agent are entitled to treat the record holder of the common unit as the absolute
owner, except as otherwise required by law or stock exchange regulations.

Organization and Duration
We were organized on February 6, 2014 and have a perpetual existence.
Purpose
Our purpose under the limited liability company agreement is to engage in any business activities that may lawfully be engaged in by
a limited liability company pursuant to the Marshall Islands Act.
Although our board of directors has the ability to cause us or our subsidiaries to engage in activities other than the provision of
offshore drilling services, it has no current plans to do so and our limited liability company agreement provides that it may decline to
do so free of any fiduciary duty or obligation whatsoever to us or the members, including any duty to act in the best interests of us or
our members other than as may be required by law. Our board of directors has the authority to oversee and direct our operations,
management and policies on an exclusive and irrevocable basis. Transocean will provide executive officers for our benefit pursuant
to agreements that we will enter into with Transocean in connection with this offering.
Cash Distributions
Our limited liability company agreement specifies the manner in which we will make cash distributions to holders of our common units
and other limited liability company interests, including to the holders of our incentive distribution rights. For a description of these cash
distribution provisions, please read “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement Relating to Cash Distributions.”
Capital Contributions
Unitholders are not obligated to make additional capital contributions, except as described below under “—Limited Liability.”
Voting Rights
The following is a summary of the unitholder vote required for the approval of the matters specified below. Matters that require the
approval of a “unit majority” require:
•
during the subordination period, the approval of (i) a number of outstanding common units equal to or exceeding the sum of
(1) a majority of the outstanding common units, plus (2) 50 percent of the number of outstanding common units held by the
Transocean Member and its affiliates, voting as a single class, and (ii) a majority of the subordinated units, voting as a
single class; and

after the subordination period, the approval of a majority of the outstanding common units, voting as a single class.
In voting their common units and subordinated units the Transocean Member and its affiliates will have no duty or obligation
whatsoever to us or our members, including any duty to act in good faith or in the best interests of us or our members.
Each outstanding common unit is entitled to one vote on each matter subject to a vote of common unitholders except for voting for
elected directors following the effective date of a cumulative voting request, as discussed below.
We will hold a meeting of the members every year to elect one or more members of our board of directors and to vote on any other
matters that are properly brought before the meeting. Prior to this offering, the Transocean Member has elected three directors to
serve on our board. After completion of this offering, but prior to our first annual meeting in 2015, the three initial elected directors may
elect an additional initial elected director. The Transocean Member will also have the right to appoint three additional members of our
board of directors, provided that the number of elected directors must, immediately after such appointment, exceed the number of
appointed directors. The initial elected directors will serve until our annual meeting in 2015, at which time they will be elected by our
common unitholders, which include Transocean, for one-year terms, subject to the Transocean Member electing to classify the
directors (as described below). Subordinated units will not be voted in the election of such directors.
The Transocean Member may, in its sole discretion, elect to classify the elected members of our board of directors by submitting
written notice to our board of directors. Prior to the effective date of such election, which our limited liability company agreement calls
the “Transocean classification election date,” each elected director will serve for a term ending on the next succeeding annual
meeting of the members. Following the Transocean classification election date, the elected directors will be divided into three
classes: class I, class II and class III. Each elected director will serve for a term ending on the third succeeding annual meeting
following the meeting at which directors of that class were elected, except that any elected director first designated as a class I
director will serve for a term ending on the first succeeding annual meeting and any elected director first designated as a class II
director will serve for a term ending on the second succeeding annual meeting. The determination of which elected directors initially
will serve in which class will be made by the board of directors.
At any time, non-Transocean members that own 50% or more of the outstanding common units may request that cumulative voting be
in effect for the election of elected directors, referred to in our limited liability company agreement as a “cumulative voting request.”
Following the effective date of a cumulative voting request, each holder of common units that are entitled to vote for elected directors
will be entitled to cast as many votes as shall equal the number of votes which the holder would be entitled to cast for an election of
elected directors absent cumulative voting multiplied by the number of elected directors to be elected. A holder entitled to so vote may
cast all such votes for a single director, or for any two or more directors, as the holder sees fit.
Unitholder Approval Required and Voting Rights

Certain amendments may be made by our board of directors

Applicable Law; Forum, Venue and Jurisdiction
Our limited liability company agreement is governed by Marshall Islands law. Our limited liability company agreement requires that
any claims, suits, actions or proceedings:
•
arising out of or relating in any way to the limited liability company agreement (including any claims, suits or actions to
interpret, apply or enforce the provisions of the limited liability company agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities
among members or of members to us, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the members or us),
Table of Contents
169
•
•
•
•
brought in a derivative manner on our behalf,
asserting a claim of breach of duty (including a fiduciary duty) owed by any director, officer or other employee of us or the
Transocean Member, or owed by the Transocean Member, to us or the members,
asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Marshall Islands Act, or
asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine,
shall be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any other court located in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction), unless otherwise provided for by
Marshall Islands law, regardless of whether such claims, suits, actions or proceedings sound in contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, are
based on common law, statutory, equitable, legal or other grounds, or are derivative or direct claims. By purchasing a common unit, a
member is irrevocably consenting to these limitations and provisions regarding claims, suits, actions or proceedings and submitting to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or such other Delaware courts) in connection with any
such claims, suits, actions or proceedings. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of
incorporation or similar governing documents have been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with
any action, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our limited liability company agreement to be inapplicable or
unenforceable in such action.
Limited Liability
Under the Marshall Islands Act, a limited liability company may not make a distribution to a member if, after the distribution, all
liabilities of the limited liability company, other than liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company interests and
liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the company, would exceed the fair value of the assets of
the limited liability company. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited liability company, the Marshall
Islands Act provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the
assets of the limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the non-recourse liability. The
Marshall Islands Act provides that a member who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution
was in violation of the Marshall Islands Act shall be liable to the limited liability company for the amount of the distribution for three
years. Under the Marshall Islands Act, a purchaser of units who becomes a member of a limited liability company is liable for the
obligations of the transferor to make contributions to the company, except that the transferee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to
him at the time he became a member and that could not be ascertained from the limited liability company agreement.
Our subsidiaries conduct business in several jurisdictions, and we may have subsidiaries that conduct business in other jurisdictions
in the future. Maintenance of our limited liability may require compliance with legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we and
our subsidiaries conduct business, which may include qualifying to do business in those jurisdictions.
Limitations on the liability of members for the obligations of a limited liability company have not been clearly established in many
jurisdictions. If, by virtue of our equity interests in our subsidiaries or otherwise, it were determined that we were conducting business
in any jurisdiction without compliance with the applicable limited liability company or similar statute, or that the right or exercise of the
right by the members as a group to remove or replace the Transocean Member, to approve some amendments to our limited liability
company agreement, or to take other action under our limited liability company agreement constituted “participation in the control” of
our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction, then the members could be held personally liable for our
obligations under the law of that jurisdiction. We will operate in a manner that our board of directors considers reasonable and
necessary or appropriate to preserve the limited liability of the members.
Table of Contents
Issuance of Additional Interests
170
The limited liability company agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited amount of additional limited liability company interests
and options, rights and warrants to buy limited liability company interests for the consideration and on the terms and conditions
determined by our board of directors without the approval of the unitholders.
It is possible that we will fund acquisitions through the issuance of additional common units, subordinated units or other equity
securities and the issuance of debt securities. Holders of any additional common units we issue will be entitled to share equally with
the then-existing holders of common units in our distributions of available cash. In addition, the issuance of additional common units
or other equity securities interests may dilute the value of the interests of the then-existing holders of common units in our net assets.
In accordance with Marshall Islands law and the provisions of our limited liability company agreement, we may also issue additional
limited liability company interests that, as determined by our board of directors, have special voting rights to which the common units
are not entitled. In addition, our limited liability agreement does not prohibit the issuance by our subsidiaries of equity interests, which
may effectively rank senior to the common units.
The Transocean Member and its affiliates will have the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its
affiliates, to purchase common units, subordinated units or other equity securities whenever, and on the same terms that, we issue
those securities to persons other than the Transocean Member and its affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain its and its
affiliates’ percentage interest, including its interest represented by common units and subordinated units, that existed immediately
prior to each issuance. The other holders of common units will not have similar preemptive rights to acquire additional common units
or other limited liability company interests.
Tax Status
The limited liability company agreement provides that the company will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
Amendment of the Limited Liability Company Agreement
General
Amendments to our limited liability company agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of our board of directors.
However, our board of directors will have no duty or obligation to propose any amendment and our limited liability company
agreement provides that it may decline to do so free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to us or our members or any other person or
entity, including, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any duty to act in good faith or in the best interests of us or the
members. In order to adopt a proposed amendment, other than the amendments discussed below, approval of our board of directors,
the Transocean Member and a unit majority is required.
Prohibited Amendments
No amendment may be made that would:
(1)  enlarge the obligations of any member without its consent, unless approved by at least a majority of the type or class of
limited liability company interests so affected; or
(2)  enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the amounts distributable,
reimbursable or otherwise payable by us to the Transocean Member or any of its affiliates without the consent of the
Transocean Member, which may be given or withheld at its option.
171
Table of Contents
The provision of our limited liability company agreement preventing the amendments having the effects described in clauses (1) and
(2) above can be amended upon the approval of the holders of at least 90 percent of the outstanding units voting together as a single
class (including units owned by the Transocean Member and its affiliates). Upon completion of this offering, the owner of the
Transocean Member will own 74.6 percent of our outstanding common and subordinated units, assuming no exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units.
No Unitholder Approval
Our board of directors may generally make amendments to our limited liability company agreement with the approval of the
Transocean Member but without the approval of any other member to reflect:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
a change in our name, the location of our principal place of business, our registered agent or our registered office;
the admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of members in accordance with our limited liability company agreement;
a change that our board of directors determines to be necessary or appropriate for us to qualify or to continue our
qualification as a limited liability company or an entity in which the members have limited liability under the laws of any
jurisdiction;
a change in our fiscal year or taxable year and related changes;
an amendment that is necessary, upon the advice of our counsel, to prevent us or our officers or directors or the
Transocean Member or their or its directors, officers, trustees or agents from in any manner being subjected to the
provisions of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, the U.S. Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or “plan asset”
regulations adopted under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (or ERISA) whether or not
substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently applied or proposed;
an amendment that the board of directors determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the authorization of
issuance of any class or series of membership interests pursuant to our limited liability company agreement;
an amendment that our board of directors determines to be necessary or appropriate for the authorization of additional
limited liability company interests or rights to acquire limited liability company interests, including any amendment that our
board of directors determines is necessary or appropriate in connection with any modification of the incentive distribution
rights made in connection with the issuance of additional limited liability company interests or rights to acquire limited
liability company interests, provided that, any such modifications and related issuance of limited liability company interests
have received approval by a majority of the members of the conflicts committee of our board of directors;
any amendment expressly permitted in the limited liability company agreement to be made by our board of directors acting
alone;
an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a merger agreement that has been approved under the terms of
the limited liability company agreement;
•
any amendment that our board of directors determines to be necessary or appropriate for the formation by us of, or our
investment in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity, in connection with our
conduct of activities permitted by our limited liability company agreement;
•
certain conversions, mergers or conveyances as set forth in our limited liability company agreement;
Table of Contents
172
•
any amendment related to most aspects of the provisions in the limited liability company agreement covering nominations
of elected directors, meetings, committees, chairman, officers, member proposals brought before annual meetings and
conduct of meetings; or
•
any other amendments substantially similar to any of the matters described in the preceding bullets.
In addition, our board of directors may make amendments to the limited liability company agreement with the approval of the
Transocean Member but without the approval of any other member if our board of directors determines that those amendments:
•
•
•
•
•
do not adversely affect the members (or any particular class of members) in any material respect;
are necessary or appropriate to satisfy any requirements, conditions, or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive,
order, ruling or regulation of any Marshall Islands authority;
are necessary or appropriate to facilitate the trading of limited liability company interests or to comply with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any securities exchange on which the limited liability company interests are or will
be listed, or admitted to trading;
are necessary or appropriate for any action taken by our board of directors relating to splits or combinations of units under
the provisions of the limited liability company agreement; or
are necessary or appropriate to effect the intent expressed in this prospectus or the intent of the provisions of the limited
liability company agreement or are otherwise contemplated by the limited liability company agreement.
Opinion of Counsel and Unitholder Approval
Our board of directors will not be required to obtain an opinion of counsel that an amendment will not result in a loss of limited liability
to the members if one of the amendments described above under “—Amendment of the Limited Liability Company Agreement—No
Unitholder Approval” should occur. No other amendments to our limited liability company agreement will become effective without the
approval of holders of at least 90 percent of the outstanding units voting as a single class unless we obtain an opinion of counsel to
the effect that the amendment will not affect the limited liability under applicable law of any of our members.
In addition to the above restrictions, any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any type
or class of outstanding units in relation to other classes of units will require the approval of at least a majority of the type or class of
units so affected. Any amendment that reduces the voting percentage required to take any action must be approved by the written
consent or affirmative vote of members whose aggregate outstanding units constitute not less than the voting requirement sought to
be reduced.
Merger, Sale, Conversion or Other Disposition of Assets
A merger, consolidation or conversion of us requires the approval of our board of directors and the Transocean Member, and in
declining to consent to a merger, consolidation or conversion, our board of directors may act in its sole discretion to the fullest extent
permitted by law. In addition, our limited liability company agreement generally prohibits our board of directors, without the prior
approval of the holders of at least a unit majority, from causing us to, among other things, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of our assets, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, including by way of merger,
consolidation or other combination or sale of ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Our board of directors may, however, mortgage,
pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of our assets without the prior approval of a unit majority. Our
board of directors may also determine to sell all or substantially all of our assets under a foreclosure or other realization upon those
encumbrances without the approval of a unit majority. Finally, our board of directors may consummate any merger with another limited
liability entity without the prior approval of our unitholders if we are the surviving entity in the transaction, our board of directors has
received an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability and tax matters, the transaction
Table of Contents
173
would not result in an amendment to our limited liability agreement requiring unitholder approval, each of our units will be an identical
unit of our company following the transaction, and the membership interests to be issued by us in such merger do not exceed 20
percent of our outstanding membership interests (other than incentive distribution rights) immediately prior to the transaction.
If conditions specified in our limited liability company agreement are satisfied, our board of directors, may, without any vote of
unitholders, convert us or any of our subsidiaries into a new limited liability entity or merge us or any of our subsidiaries into, or
convey some or all of our assets to, a newly formed entity if the sole purpose of that merger or conveyance is to effect a mere change
in our legal form into another limited liability entity. The unitholders are not entitled to dissenters’ rights of appraisal under our limited
liability company agreement or applicable law in the event of a conversion, merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our
assets, or any other similar transaction or event.
Special Vote Required for Combinations with Interested Unitholders
Our limited liability company agreement includes a provision that is based upon the Delaware law regarding business combinations.
This provision provides that, in general, we may not engage in a business combination with an interested unitholder for a period of
three years after the time of the transaction in which the person became an interested unitholder.
The prohibition on business combinations with interested unitholders does not apply in some cases, including if:
•
•
•
our board of directors, prior to the time of the transaction in which the person became an interested unitholder, approves
(1) the business combination or (2) the transaction which resulted in such person becoming an interested unitholder;
upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in such person becoming an interested unitholder, the interested
unitholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting units of the company at the time the transaction commenced; or
the business combination is approved by the board of Directors and authorized at an annual meeting or special meeting of
unitholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2⁄3% of the outstanding voting units of the
company, voting as a single class, which are not owned by the interested unitholder.
As defined in our limited liability company agreement, an interested member generally includes any person that is the owner of 15%
or more of the outstanding voting units of the company or (ii) that is an affiliate or associate of the company and was the owner of 15%
or more of the outstanding voting units at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to the date on which it is sought to be
determined whether such person is an interested unitholder, and also the affiliates and associates of such person; provided, however,
that the term interested unitholder does not include (a) the Transocean Member, any Transocean Direct Transferee (as defined
below), any Transocean Indirect Transferee (as defined below) or any of their respective affiliates or successors or any “group” (as
such term is used in Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act, or Rule 13d-5) or any member of any such “group”; (b) any person whose
ownership of voting units in excess of the 15% limitation is the result of (i) action taken solely by the company or (ii) the conversion of
the combined interest; provided that such person will be an interested unitholder if thereafter such person acquires additional voting
units, except as a result of (x) further corporate action not caused, directly or indirectly, by such person or (y) the exercise of the limited
preemptive right under our limited liability company agreement; or (c) any person to the extent its ownership is attributable to that
person’s participation in as a bona fide underwriter in an offering of units. For the purpose of determining whether a person is an
interested unitholder, the voting units deemed to be in issue will include voting units deemed to be owned by the person (through the
application of the definition of “owner” (as defined in our limited liability company agreement)) but shall not include any other unissued
voting units which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights,
warrants or options, or otherwise.
174
Table of Contents
“Transocean Direct Transferee” means any person that acquires (in a transaction in which the Transocean Member or any affiliate or
successor or any “group” as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 or any member of any such “group” assigns its rights (with respect to the
units transferred in the transaction) to not be deemed to be an interested unitholder) directly from either the Transocean Member or
any of its affiliates or successors or any “group” (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5), or any member of any such “group,” beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the then outstanding voting units.
“Transocean Indirect Transferee” means any person that acquires (in a transaction in which a Transocean Direct Transferee or any
affiliate or successor or any “group” as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 or any member of any such “group” assigns its rights (with
respect to the units transferred in the transaction) to not be deemed to be an interested unitholder) directly from any Transocean Direct
Transferee or any other Transocean Indirect Transferee beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then outstanding voting units.
“Voting Units” means, with respect to the company or any other entity that is not a corporation, any equity interest entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors or any other governing body of such entity, but with respect to the company, does not include the
Transocean Member Interest, and means, with respect to any corporation, stock of any class or series entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors. Every reference above to a percentage of voting units refers to such percentage of the votes of such voting units.
Although our limited liability company agreement contains the provisions described above, under Marshall Islands law there is
generally no prohibition on business combinations with interested unitholders.
Termination and Dissolution
We will continue as a limited liability company until terminated or converted under our limited liability company agreement. We will
dissolve:
(1)  upon the election of our board of directors to dissolve us, if approved by the holders of units representing a unit majority;
(2)  except as otherwise permitted by our limited liability company agreement or the Marshall Islands Act, at any time there are
no members;
(3)  upon the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of us pursuant to the Marshall Islands Act; or
(4)  upon the withdrawal or removal of the Transocean Member or any successor to the Transocean Member interest or any
other event that results in its ceasing to be the Transocean Member other than by reason of a transfer of the Transocean
Member interest in accordance with the limited liability company agreement or withdrawal or removal following approval
and admission of a successor.
Upon a dissolution under clause (4), the holders of a unit majority may also elect, within specific time limitations, to continue our
business on the same terms and conditions described in the limited liability company agreement by appointing an entity to hold the
Transocean Member interest that is approved by the holders of units representing a unit majority.
Liquidation and Distribution of Proceeds
Upon our dissolution, unless we are continued as a new limited liability company, the liquidator authorized to wind up our affairs,
acting with all of the powers of our board of directors that are necessary or appropriate, will liquidate our assets and apply the
proceeds of the liquidation as provided in “Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement Cash Distributions—Distributions
of Cash Upon Liquidation.” The liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of our assets for a reasonable period or distribute
assets to members in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to our members.

175
Withdrawal or Removal of the Transocean Member
The initial holder of the Transocean Member interest is Transocean Partners Holdings Limited. When we refer in this prospectus to
“removal” or “withdrawal” of the Transocean Member, technically, we are referring to the termination of the rights of the Transocean
Member. For example, if at the time of any such removal or withdrawal, the Transocean Member owns common units, following any
such removal or withdrawal, the Transocean Member would technically continue to be a member owning common units. It would not,
however, continue to be the Transocean Member we refer to in this prospectus, since it would no longer have the rights that make it
the Transocean Member.
Except as described below, the Transocean Member has agreed not to withdraw voluntarily prior to June 30, 2024, without obtaining
the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding common units held by the Transocean
Member and its affiliates, and furnishing an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability. On or after June 30, 2024, the Transocean
Member may withdraw without first obtaining approval of any unitholder by giving 90 days’ written notice, and that withdrawal will not
constitute a violation of the limited liability company agreement. Notwithstanding the information above, the Transocean Member may
withdraw without unitholder approval upon 90 days’ notice to the members if at least 50 percent of the outstanding units are held or
controlled by one person and its affiliates other than the Transocean Member and its affiliates. In addition, the limited liability company
agreement permits the Transocean Member to sell or otherwise transfer all of its Transocean Member interest in us without the
approval of the unitholders. Please read “—Transfer of Transocean Member Interest” and “—Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights.”
Upon withdrawal of the Transocean Member under any circumstances, other than as a result of a transfer by the Transocean Member
of all or a part of its Transocean Member interest in us, the holders of a majority of the outstanding common units and subordinated
units, voting as separate classes, may select a successor to that withdrawing member. If a successor is not elected, we will be
dissolved, wound up and liquidated, unless within a specified period of time after that withdrawal, the holders of a unit majority agree
in writing to continue our business and to appoint a successor member that will have the rights held by the Transocean Member.
Please read “—Termination and Dissolution.”
The Transocean Member may not be removed unless that removal is approved by the vote of the holders of not less than 66 2⁄3
percent of the outstanding common and subordinated units, including units held by the Transocean Member and its affiliates, voting
together as a single class. The ownership of more than 33 1⁄3 percent of the outstanding units by the Transocean Member and its
affiliates or controlling our board of directors would provide the practical ability to prevent the Transocean Member’s removal. At the
closing of this offering, the Transocean Member and its affiliates will own 74.6 percent of the outstanding common and subordinated
units, assuming no exercise of the option to purchase additional common units. Any removal of the Transocean Member is also
subject to the successor to the Transocean Member being approved by a unit majority.
Our limited liability company agreement also provides that if the Transocean Member is removed under circumstances where cause
does not exist and units held by the Transocean Member and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal:
•
•
•
the subordination period will end and all outstanding subordinated units will immediately convert into common units on a
one-for-one basis;
any existing arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units will be extinguished;
the Transocean Member will have the right to convert its Transocean Member interest into common units or to receive cash
in exchange for such interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in our limited liability company agreement; and
Table of Contents
176
•
the holders of the incentive distribution rights (initially, the Transocean Member) will have the right to convert the incentive
distribution rights it owns into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests.
In the event of removal of the Transocean Member under circumstances where cause exists or withdrawal of the Transocean Member
where that withdrawal violates the limited liability company agreement, a successor member that will own the Transocean Member
interest will have the option to purchase the Transocean Member interest and incentive distribution rights owned by such departing
member that owned the Transocean Member interest for a cash payment equal to the fair market value of those interests. Under all
other circumstances where the member that has the rights of the Transocean Member withdraws or is removed by the members, such
departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest will have the option to require the successor member to purchase the
Transocean Member interest of such departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest and its incentive distribution
rights for their fair market value. In each case, this fair market value will be determined by agreement between the departing member
that owned the Transocean Member interest and the successor member that will own the Transocean Member interest. If no
agreement is reached, an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the departing member that
owned the Transocean Member interest and the successor member that will own the Transocean Member interest will determine the
fair market value. Or, if the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest and the successor member that will own
the Transocean Member interest cannot agree upon an expert, then an expert chosen by agreement of the experts selected by each
of them will determine the fair market value.
If the option described above is not exercised by either the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest or the
successor member that will own the Transocean Member interest, the departing member’s Transocean Member interest and its
incentive distribution rights will automatically convert into common units equal to the fair market value of those interests as determined
by an investment banking firm or other independent expert selected in the manner described in the preceding paragraph.
In addition, we will be required to reimburse the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest for all amounts due to
such departing member, including, without limitation, any employee-related liabilities, including severance liabilities, incurred for the
termination of any employees employed by such departing member or its affiliates for our benefit.
Transfer of Transocean Member Interest
The Transocean Member and its affiliates may at any time transfer its Transocean Member interest and all or any portion of common
units or subordinated units to one or more persons, without unitholder approval.
Transfer of Ownership Interests in the Transocean Member
At any time, the members of the Transocean Member may sell or transfer all or part of their respective limited liability company
interests in the Transocean Member to an affiliate or a third party without the approval of our unitholders.
Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights
At any time, the Transocean Member may sell or transfer its incentive distribution rights to an affiliate or third party without the
approval of our unitholders.

Change of Management Provisions
177
Our limited liability company agreement contains specific provisions that are intended to discourage a person or group from
attempting to remove the Transocean Member or otherwise change management. For example, the limited liability company
agreement provides that if the Transocean Member is removed under circumstances where cause does not exist and units held by the
Transocean Member and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal:
•
•
•
•
the subordination period will end and all outstanding subordinated units will immediately convert into common units on a
one-for-one basis;
any existing arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units will be extinguished;
the Transocean Member will have the right to convert its Transocean Member interest into common units or to receive cash
in exchange for such interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in our limited liability company agreement; and
the holders of the incentive distribution rights (initially, the Transocean Member) will have the right to convert its incentive
distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests.
Limited Call Right
If at any time the Transocean Member and its affiliates hold more than 80 percent of the then-issued and outstanding limited liability
company interests of any class, the Transocean Member will have the right, which it may assign in whole or in part to any of its
affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the remaining limited liability company interests of the class held by unaffiliated
persons as of a record date to be selected by the Transocean Member, on at least 10 but not more than 60 days’ notice, at a price
equal to the greater of (x) the average of the daily closing prices of the limited liability company interests of such class over the 20
trading days preceding the date three days before the notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (y) the highest price paid by
the Transocean Member or any of its affiliates for limited liability company interests of such class during the 90-day period preceding
the date such notice is first mailed. The Transocean Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion, nor will the unitholders be
entitled to dissenter’s rights of appraisal, regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the exercise of this
limited call right and has no fiduciary duty in determining whether to exercise this limited call right.
As a result of the Transocean Member’s right to purchase outstanding limited liability company interests, a holder of limited liability
company interests may have the holder’s limited liability company interests purchased at an undesirable time or price. Please read
“Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us—The Transocean Member has a limited call right that may require you to sell
your common units at an undesirable time or price.” The tax consequences of the exercise of this call right to a unitholder are the
same as a sale by that unitholder of common units in the market. Please read “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—
U.S. Holders—Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Units” and “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Non-
U.S. Holders—Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Units.”
Board of Directors
Under our limited liability company agreement, our board of directors has the authority to oversee and direct our operations, policies
and management on an exclusive and irrevocable basis. Our board of directors also has the authority to construe and interpret our
limited liability company agreement and to act upon any such construction or interpretation. Any such construction or interpretation of
our limited liability company agreement by our board of directors and any action taken pursuant thereto and any determination made
by our board of directors in good faith will, in each case, be conclusive and binding for all purposes. As of the closing of this offering,
our board of directors consists of the directors named in “Management,” each of whom is an elected
Table of Contents
178
director and all of whom shall serve a term extending until the 2015 annual meeting. Prior to our first annual meeting of unitholders in
2015, the elected directors may elect an additional elected director and the Transocean Member intends to appoint three additional
directors to serve on our board, provided that the number of elected directors must, immediately after such appointment, exceed the
number of appointed directors. Following our annual meeting in 2015, our board of directors will consist of seven individuals, three of
whom will be appointed by the Transocean Member and four of whom will be elected by our common unitholders, which includes the
Transocean Member.
Nominations for persons for election as elected directors may only be made at a meeting at which elected directors are to be elected.
Such nominations can only be made by or at the direction of our board of directors or (if our board of directors has determined that
elected directors will be elected at the meeting) by any member or group of members other than the Transocean member or its
affiliates, that holds beneficially 10 percent or more of the outstanding common units, provided written notice is supplied and subject
to certain timing requirements set forth in our limited liability company agreement. The notice must set forth for each person nominated
for election:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the person’s name, age, business address and residential address;
the person’s occupation or employment;
a certification that such person meets the qualifications of an elected director;
a certification as to whether such person is, and intends to remain, a U.K. tax resident;
a certification as to whether such person meets the criteria for service on the conflicts committee;
certain information about the person required to be disclosed under Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and
a description of certain relationships and compensation arrangements between the nominee and the nominating member
or group of members.
The notice must set forth for each member or group giving the notice, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is
made:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the member’s, group’s or beneficial owner’s name and address;
certain information regarding the member’s, group’s or beneficial owner’s or their immediate families’, direct or indirect
interest in us, including, among others, any voting agreements, derivative instruments, pledges, rights to distributions or
performance-related fees;
a representation that such member, group or beneficial owner is a record holder, is entitled to vote at such meeting and
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person;
a description of all agreements between such member, group or beneficial owner and each proposed nominee;
a representation whether such member, group or beneficial owner intends to deliver a form of proxy to holders of
outstanding interests or otherwise solicit proxies or votes; and
any other information relating to such member, group or beneficial owner that would be required under Section 14 of the
Exchange Act.
The Transocean Member may remove an appointed board member with or without cause at any time. “Cause,” with respect to a
director, generally means a court’s finding such director or officer liable for actual fraud or willful misconduct and with respect to the
Transocean Member. Any and all of the board members appointed by the Transocean Member may be removed for cause at a
properly called meeting of the members by a majority vote of the outstanding units, voting as a single class. If any appointed board
member is removed, resigns or is otherwise unable to serve as a board member, the Transocean Member may fill the vacancy. Any
and all of the board members elected by the common unitholders may be removed at any time for cause by the
Table of Contents
179
affirmative vote of a majority of the other board members or at a properly called meeting of the members by a majority vote of the
outstanding common units. If any elected board member is removed, resigns or is otherwise unable to serve as a board member, the
vacancy may be filled by a majority of the other elected board members then serving.
Meetings; Voting
Unitholders who are record holders of units on the record date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, meetings of our members
and to act upon matters for which approvals may be solicited.
We are required to hold a meeting of the members every year to elect one or more members of our board of directors and to vote on
any other matters that are properly brought before the meeting. Any action that is required or permitted to be taken by the unitholders
may be taken either at a meeting of the unitholders or, if authorized by the board, without a meeting if consents in writing describing
the action so taken are signed by holders of the number of units necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting. Meetings of
the unitholders may be called by our board of directors or by unitholders owning at least 20 percent of the outstanding units of the
class for which a meeting is proposed. Unitholders may vote either in person or by proxy at meetings. The holders of 33 1⁄3 percent of
the outstanding units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a
quorum unless any action by the unitholders requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of the units, in which case the
quorum will be the greater percentage.
Each record holder of a unit may vote according to the holder’s percentage interest in us, although additional limited liability company
interests having special voting rights could be issued. Please read “—Issuance of Additional Interests.” Units held in nominee or
street name account will be voted by the broker or other nominee in accordance with the instruction of the beneficial owner unless the
arrangement between the beneficial owner and his nominee provides otherwise. Except as the limited liability company agreement
otherwise provides, subordinated units will vote together with common units as a single class.
Any notice, demand, request report, or proxy material required or permitted to be given or made to record holders of common units
under the limited liability company agreement will be delivered to the record holder by us or by the transfer agent.
Voting Rights of Incentive Distribution Rights
For so long as a majority of the incentive distribution rights are held by the Transocean Member, the holders of the incentive
distribution rights will not be entitled to vote such incentive distribution rights except as may otherwise be required by law. The
holders of the incentive distribution rights, in their capacity as such, will be deemed to have approved any matter approved by the
Transocean Member.
If less than a majority of the incentive distribution rights are held by the Transocean Member, the incentive distribution rights will be
entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of unitholders, other than (i) the election of elected directors and (ii) amendments and
other matters that our board of directors determines do not adversely affect the holders of the incentive distribution rights as a whole in
any material respect. On any matter in which the holders of incentive distribution rights are entitled to vote, such holders will vote
together with the subordinated units, prior to the end of the subordination period, or together with the common units, thereafter, in
either case as a single class. The incentive distribution rights will be treated in all respects as subordinated units or common units, as
applicable, when sending notices of a meeting, calculating required votes, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar
purposes under the limited liability company agreement. The relative voting power of the incentive distribution rights and the
subordinated units or common units, as applicable, will be set in the same proportion as cumulative cash distributions, if any, in
respect of the incentive distribution rights for the four consecutive quarters prior to the record date for the vote bears to the cumulative
cash distributions in respect of such class of units for such four quarters.
Table of Contents
Status as Member
180
Except as described above under “—Limited Liability,” the common units will be fully paid, and unitholders will not be required to
make additional contributions. By transfer of common units in accordance with our limited liability company agreement, each
transferee of common units will be admitted as a member with respect to the common units transferred when such transfer and
admission is reflected in our books and records.
Indemnification
Under the limited liability company agreement, in most circumstances, we will indemnify each of the following persons, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, from and against all losses, claims, damages or similar events arising by reason of such person’s status as
such:
(1)  the Transocean Member or any successor owning the Transocean Member interest;
(2)  any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;
(3)  any person who is or was an affiliate of the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean Member
interest;
(4)  any person who is or was an officer, director, member, fiduciary or trustee of any entity described in (1), (2) or (3) above;
(5)  any person who is or was serving as a director, officer, member, fiduciary or trustee of another person at the request of our
board of directors, the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;
(6)  any person designated by our board of directors; and
(7)  the members of our board of directors and our officers.
Any indemnification under these provisions will only be out of our assets. Unless it otherwise agrees, the Transocean Member or any
departing member owning the Transocean Member interest will not be personally liable for or have any obligation to contribute or
lend funds or assets to us to enable us to effectuate indemnification. We may purchase insurance against liabilities asserted against
and expenses incurred by persons for our activities, regardless of whether we would have the power to indemnify the person against
liabilities under the limited liability company agreement.
Reimbursement of Expenses
Our limited liability company agreement requires us to reimburse the members of our board of directors for their out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in the course of their service to us. Our limited liability company agreement also requires us to reimburse the
Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest for all expenses it incurs or payments it
makes on our behalf and all other expenses allocable to us or otherwise incurred by such member in connection with acting in its role
as the Transocean Member. These expenses include expenses allocated to us or such member by our board of directors.
Books and Reports
We will keep appropriate books and records of our business. The books will be maintained for financial reporting purposes on an
accrual basis. For tax and fiscal reporting purposes, our fiscal year is the calendar year.
We are required to furnish or make available to record holders of common units, within 105 days after the close of each fiscal year, an
annual report containing audited financial statements and a report on those financial statements by our independent registered public
accounting firm. Except for our fourth quarter, we are required to also furnish or make available summary financial information within
50 days after the close of each quarter.

Table of Contents
Right to Inspect Our Books and Records
The limited liability company agreement provides that a member can, for a purpose reasonably related to his interest as a member,
upon reasonable written demand stating the purpose of such demand and at the member’s own expense, have furnished to the
member:
•
•
•
a current list of the name and last known address of each member;
copies of the limited liability company agreement, the certificate of formation of the company and related amendments; and
certain information regarding the status of our business and financial condition.
Our board of directors may, and intends to, keep confidential from the members trade secrets or other information the disclosure of
which our board of directors believes in good faith is not in our best interests or that we are required by law or by agreements with
third parties to keep confidential.
Registration Rights
Under the limited liability company agreement, we have agreed to register for resale under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws any common units, subordinated units or other limited liability company interests proposed to be sold by any holder or
holders of at least 25% of the outstanding interests, other than the Transocean Member interest. We are obligated to pay all expenses
incidental to the registration, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and expenses of counsel and advisors of
any selling unitholders. Please read “Units Eligible for Future Sale.”
Table of Contents
182
After the sale of the common units offered by this prospectus and assuming that the underwriters do not exercise their option to
purchase additional common units, the Transocean Member and its affiliates will hold an aggregate of 23,879,310 common units and
UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE
27,586,207 subordinated units. All of the subordinated units will convert into common units at the end of the subordination period. The
sale of these common and subordinated units could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading
market that may develop.
Rule 144
The common units sold in this offering will generally be freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the
Securities Act. None of our directors or officers owned any common units prior to this offering; however, they may purchase common
units. Additionally, any common units owned by an “affiliate” of ours may not be resold publicly except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or under an exemption, such as Rule 144. Rule 144 permits securities acquired by
affiliates of the issuer to be sold into the public market in an amount that does not exceed, during any three-month period, the greater
of:
•
•
one percent of the total number of the common units outstanding, which will equal approximately          common units
immediately after this offering; or
the average weekly reported trading volume of the common units for the four calendar weeks prior to the sale.
Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to specific manner of sale provisions, holding period requirements, notice requirements and
the availability of current public information about us. A person who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of ours at any time during
the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned his common units for at least six months (provided we are in
compliance with the current public information requirement) or one year (regardless of whether we are in compliance with the current
public information requirement), would be entitled to sell those common units under Rule 144 without regard to the volume limitations,
manner of sale provisions and notice requirements of Rule 144.
Our Limited Liability Company Agreement and Registration Rights
Our limited liability company agreement provides that we may issue an unlimited number of limited liability company interests of any
type without a vote of the unitholders. Any issuance of additional common units or other equity securities would result in a
corresponding decrease in the proportionate ownership interest in us represented by, and could adversely affect the cash
distributions to and market price of, common units then outstanding. Please read “The Limited Liability Company Agreement—
Issuance of Additional Interests.”
Under our limited liability company agreement, the Transocean Member and its affiliates have the right to cause us to register under
the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws the offer and sale of any common units that they hold. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the limited liability company agreement, these registration rights allow the Transocean Member and its affiliates or their
assignees holding any common units or other equity securities to require registration of any of these common units or other equity
securities and to include any of these common units in a registration by us of other common units, including common units offered by
us or by any unitholder. The Transocean Member and its affiliates will continue to have these registration rights for two years
following its withdrawal or removal as the Transocean Member. In connection with any registration of this kind, we have agreed to
indemnify each unitholder participating in the registration and its officers, directors and controlling persons from and against any
liabilities under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws arising from the registration statement or prospectus. We will
bear all costs and
Table of Contents
183
expenses incidental to any registration, excluding any underwriting discounts and commissions. Except as described below, the
Transocean Member and its affiliates may sell their common units in private transactions at any time, subject to compliance with
applicable laws.
Lock-Up Agreements
We, our directors and executive officers, our subsidiaries and the Transocean Member and its affiliates, including Transocean, have
agreed not to sell any common units for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions and
extensions. Please read “Underwriting.”
Registration Statement on Form S-8
We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act following this offering to register all common units
issued or reserved for issuance under our long-term incentive plan. We expect to file this registration statement as soon as practicable
after this offering. Common units covered by the registration statement on Form S-8 will be eligible for sale in the public market,
subject to applicable vesting requirements and the terms of applicable lock-up agreements described above.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to prospective unitholders
and, unless otherwise noted in the following discussion, is the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P., our U.S. counsel, insofar as it contains
legal conclusions with respect to matters of U.S. federal income tax law. The opinion of our U.S. counsel is dependent on the
accuracy of factual representations made by us to them, including descriptions of our operations contained herein. This discussion is
based upon provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
administrative rulings and court decisions, all as in effect or existence on the date of this prospectus and all of which are subject to
change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.
The following discussion applies only to beneficial owners of common units that own the common units as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, for investment purposes) and is not intended to be applicable to all categories of
investors, such as unitholders subject to special tax rules (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, dealers in securities,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, traders in securities that elect the mark-to-market method of accounting
for their securities, S corporations, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, tax-exempt organizations, retirement plans or individual retirement accounts or former citizens or long-term
residents of the United States), persons who will hold the units as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other
integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that own (actually or under applicable constructive ownership
rules) 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our equity that is entitled to vote, or persons that have a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, each of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized
below. If a partnership or other entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial
owner of our common units, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common units, you are urged to consult your tax
advisor regarding the tax consequences to you of the partnership’s ownership and disposition of our common units.
No ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS regarding any matter affecting us or our prospective unitholders. The opinions
and statements made herein may be challenged by the IRS and, if so challenged, may not be sustained upon review in a court. This
discussion does not contain information regarding any aspect of non-income taxation or state, local or foreign taxation.
THIS SUMMARY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON UNITS. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR REGARDING
THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE OWNERSHIP AND
DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON UNITS IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN SITUATION.
Treatment as a Corporation
We are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Consequently, among other things, U.S. Holders (as defined
below) will not be directly subject to U.S. federal income tax on our income, but rather will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
certain distributions received from us and dispositions of units as described below.
U.S. Holders
The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to U.S. Holders of our common
units. As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our common units that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, is:
•
an individual U.S. citizen or resident,
Table of Contents
185
•
a corporation (or other entity that is classified as a corporation) organized under the laws of the United States or any of its
political subdivisions,
•
•
an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust has a valid
election in effect to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Distributions
Subject to the discussion under “—U.S. Holders—PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences” below, the gross amount of any
distributions to a U.S. Holder made by us with respect to our common units will constitute dividends to the extent of our current-year or
accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of our current-year
and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis
in its common units and will reduce (but not below zero) such basis. A distribution in excess of our current-year and accumulated
earnings and profits and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in our common units will be treated as capital gain. U.S. Holders that are
corporations generally will not be entitled to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to distributions they receive from us
because we are not a U.S. corporation. Dividends received with respect to our common units generally will be treated as “passive
category income” for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Generally, dividends paid with respect to our common units to a U.S. Holder that is an individual, trust or estate, or Non-Corporate
U.S. Holder, will be treated as “qualified dividend income,” which is taxable to such Non-Corporate U.S. Holder at preferential capital
gain tax rates provided that: (i) the common units are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such
as The New York Stock Exchange) or we are eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that
the IRS has determined is satisfactory and which includes an exchange of information program; (ii) we are not a PFIC for the taxable
year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we are, have been or will
be, as discussed below under “—U.S. Holders—PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences”); (iii) the Non-Corporate U.S.
Holder has owned the common units on which such dividends are paid for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60
days before the date on which the common units become ex-dividend (and has not entered into certain risk limiting transactions with
respect to such common units); and (iv) the Non-Corporate U.S. Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with
respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. The preferential tax rate on dividends will not apply to dividends
received to the extent that the Non-Corporate U.S. Holder elects to treat such dividends as “investment income,” which may be offset
by investment expense.
Special rules may apply to any dividends paid to a Non-Corporate U.S. Holder if such dividends are (i) treated as qualified dividend
income eligible for the preferential tax rates described above and (ii) “extraordinary dividends.” In general, an extraordinary dividend
is any dividend with respect to a common unit if the amount of such dividend is equal to or in excess of 10 percent of a Non-Corporate
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis (or fair market value upon such holder’s election) in such common unit. In addition, extraordinary
dividends include dividends that (i) have ex-dividend dates during the same period of 365 consecutive days and (ii) in the aggregate,
equal or exceed 20 percent of a Non-Corporate U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis (or fair market value upon such holder’s election). If
we pay an extraordinary dividend on our common units that is treated as qualified dividend income, then any loss recognized by a
Non-Corporate U.S. Holder from the sale or exchange of such common units will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of
the amount of such dividend.
186
Table of Contents
Ratio of Dividend Income to Distributions
We will compute our earnings and profits for each taxable year in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. We estimate
that less than 20 percent of the total cash distributions received by a purchaser of common units in this offering that holds such
common units through December 31, 2016 will constitute dividend income (which is subject to U.S. taxation in the manner described
under “—U.S. Holders—Distributions” above). The remaining portion of these distributions, determined on a cumulative basis, will be
treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the purchaser’s tax basis in its common units and thereafter as capital
gain. These estimates are based upon the assumption that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit on our
common units during the referenced period and on other assumptions with respect to our earnings, capital expenditures and cash
flow for this period. These estimates and assumptions are subject to, among other things, numerous business, economic, regulatory,
competitive and political uncertainties that are beyond our control. Further, these estimates are based on current U.S. federal income
tax law and tax reporting positions that we will adopt and with which the IRS could disagree. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that
these estimates will prove to be correct. The actual percentage of total cash distributions that will constitute dividend income could be
higher or lower, and any differences could be material or could materially affect the value of the common units.
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Units
Subject to the discussion under “—U.S. Holders—PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences” below, a U.S. Holder generally
will recognize capital gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our units in an amount equal to the difference
between the amount realized by the U.S. Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in such units. The U.S. Holder’s initial tax basis in its units generally will be the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the units, and
that tax basis will be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any distributions on the units that are treated as non-taxable
returns of capital (as discussed above under “—U.S. Holders—Distributions”). Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital
gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Non-
Corporate U.S. Holders may be eligible for preferential rates of U.S. federal income tax in respect of long-term capital gains. A U.S.
Holder’s ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations. Such capital gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source
income or loss, as applicable, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.
PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences
The treatment of U.S. Holders could differ materially and adversely from that described above if, at any relevant time, we were a PFIC.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which either:
•
•
at least 75 percent of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (generally, dividends, interest,
gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties); or
the average percentage (based on quarterly measurements) of the value of the assets held by us that produce, or are held
for the production of, passive income is at least 50 percent.
For this purpose, we are deemed to own our proportionate share of the assets and to receive directly our proportionate share of the
income of any other corporation (such as our drilling rig owning subsidiaries) in which we own, directly, or indirectly, at least 25
percent of the value of the stock. In addition, income earned, or deemed earned, by us in connection with the performance of services
would not constitute passive income.
Based on our current and projected methods of operation, and an opinion of our U.S. counsel, Baker Botts L.L.P., we do not believe
that we are or will be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. We have received the
Table of Contents
187
opinion of our U.S. counsel in support of this position that concludes that the income our subsidiaries earn from our present drilling
contracts should not constitute passive income for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. In addition, we have represented
to our U.S. counsel that we expect that more than 25 percent of our gross income for our 2014 taxable year and each future year will
arise from such drilling contracts or other income our U.S. counsel has opined does not constitute passive income, and more than 50
percent of the average value of our assets for each such year will be held for the production of such non-passive income. Assuming
the composition of our income and assets is consistent with these expectations, and assuming the accuracy of other representations
we have made to our U.S. counsel for purposes of their opinion, our U.S. counsel is of the opinion that we should not be a PFIC for
our 2014 taxable year or any future year.
Distinguishing between contractual arrangements treated as generating rental income, which may constitute passive income for
purposes of determining our PFIC status, and those treated as generating services income involves weighing and balancing
competing factual considerations, and there is no legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our specific method of operation.
Conclusions in this area therefore remain matters of interpretation. We are not seeking a ruling from the IRS on the treatment of
income generated from our drilling contracts or charters, and the opinion of our counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court. Thus,
while we have received an opinion of counsel in support of our position, it is possible that the IRS or a court could disagree with this
position. Moreover, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to any
taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future and that we will not become a PFIC
in any future year.
As discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder would be subject to different
taxation rules depending on whether or not the U.S. Holder makes (i) an election to treat us as a “qualified electing fund,” which we
refer to as a “QEF election” or (ii) a “mark-to-market” election with respect to our common units, as discussed below. If we are a PFIC,
a U.S. Holder will be subject to the PFIC rules described herein with respect to any of our subsidiaries that are PFICs. However, the
mark-to-market election discussed below will likely not be available with respect to shares of such PFIC subsidiaries. In addition, if a
U.S. Holder owns our common units during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, such holder must file an annual report with the IRS.
Taxation of U.S. Holders Making a Timely QEF Election
If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election, or an Electing Holder, in a taxable year, then for that and for all subsequent taxable
years in which such holder has held the common units and we are a PFIC, the Electing Holder must include in income for such
holder’s taxable year its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for our taxable years that end with or within
the taxable year for which that holder is reporting, regardless of whether or not the Electing Holder received distributions from us in
that year. The Electing Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common units will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings
and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that were previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the Electing
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in common units and will not be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder generally will recognize
capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common units. A U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect
to any year that we are a PFIC by filing IRS Form 8621 with its U.S. federal income tax return. If contrary to our expectations, we
determine that we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, we will endeavor (but will not be required) to provide each U.S. Holder
with the information necessary to make the QEF election described above.
Taxation of U.S. Holders Making a “Mark-to-Market” Election
If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year and, as we anticipate, our units were treated as “marketable stock,” then, as an
alternative to making a QEF election, a U.S. Holder would be allowed to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to our common
units, provided the U.S. Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury
Regulations. If that election is made,
Table of Contents
188
the U.S. Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the U.S.
Holder’s common units at the end of the taxable year over the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common units. The U.S. Holder also
would be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common units over
the fair market value of the common units at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in
income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its common units would be adjusted to reflect any such
income or loss recognized. Gain recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common units would be treated as
ordinary income, and any loss recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the common units would be treated as
ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included in income by the U.S.
Holder. Because the mark-to-market election only applies to marketable stock, however, it would not apply to a U.S. Holder’s indirect
interest in any of our subsidiaries that were determined to be PFICs.
Taxation of U.S. Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or Mark-to-Market Election
If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder that does not make either a QEF election or a mark-to-market
election for that year or a Non-Electing Holder, would be subject to adverse tax rules with respect to (1) any excess distribution
(generally, the portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on our common units in a taxable year in excess of
125 percent of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter,
the Non-Electing Holder’s holding period for the common units), and (2) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition
of the units. Under these special rules:
•
•
•
the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder’s aggregate holding period for the
common units;
the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the taxable year we were first treated as a
PFIC with respect to the Non-Electing Holder would be taxed as ordinary income in the current year; and
the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the highest rate of
tax on ordinary income in effect for the applicable class of taxpayers for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed tax
deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax liability as if that tax liability had been due for each such
other taxable year.
Unless a Non-Electing Holder makes a QEF election or a mark-to-market election with respect to the common units, a Non-Electing
Holder that holds common units during a period in which we are a PFIC will be subject to the rules described above for that period
and all subsequent taxable years in which the Non-Electing Holder holds common units, even if we cease to be a PFIC.
Classification as a PFIC may have other adverse tax consequences, including in the case of individual U.S. Holders, the denial of a
step-up in the basis of the common units at death.
The PFIC rules are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to their
investment in the common units and the advisability of choosing to make a QEF election or a mark-to-market election in the event we
were to be treated as a PFIC.
Non-U.S. Holders
The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to Non-U.S. Holders of our
common units. As used herein, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our common units (other than a partnership or an
entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. Holder.
Table of Contents
Distributions
189
Distributions we pay to a Non-U.S. Holder with respect to the common units will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or
withholding tax unless the distributions are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and,
if an income tax treaty applies, such distributions are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S.
Holder). Except to the extent otherwise provided under an applicable income tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be taxed in
the same manner as a U.S. Holder on distributions that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade
or business. Effectively connected distributions received by a corporate Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject to an additional U.S.
branch profits tax at a 30 percent rate (or, if applicable, a lower treaty rate).
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Units
In general, a Non-U.S. Holder is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain resulting from the sale,
exchange or other disposition of our common units unless (i) the gain from the disposition of units is effectively connected with the
Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of such U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, such gain is attributable to a U.S.
permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder) or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual present in the United States
for 183 days or more during the taxable year in which the gain is recognized and certain other conditions are met. Except to the extent
otherwise provided under an applicable income tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be taxed in the same manner as a U.S.
Holder on gains recognized that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Effectively
connected gains recognized by a corporate Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject to an additional U.S. branch profits tax at a 30
percent rate (or, if applicable, a lower treaty rate).
Medicare Tax
Certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts will be subject to an additional 3.8 percent tax, or the Medicare Tax, on all
or a portion of their “net investment income,” which may include all or a portion of the dividends on our common units and net capital
gains from the disposition of our common units. U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are urged to consult their tax
advisors regarding the applicability of the Medicare Tax to their income and gains in respect of their investment in our common units.
Information Reporting Regarding Foreign Financial Assets
Individual U.S. Holders that hold certain “foreign financial assets” (which generally includes stock and other securities issued by a
foreign person unless held in account maintained by a financial institution) that exceed certain thresholds are required to report to the
IRS information relating to such assets. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these
rules. Significant penalties may apply for failure to satisfy these reporting obligations. Individual U.S. Holders are urged to consult
their tax advisors regarding the effect of these reporting obligations, if any, on their investment in our units.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In general, payments to a non-corporate U.S. Holder of distributions or the proceeds of a disposition of common units will be subject
to information reporting. These payments to a non-corporate U.S. Holder also may be subject to backup withholding if the non-
corporate U.S. Holder:
•
•
•
fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;
is notified by the IRS that it has failed to report all interest or corporate distributions required to be reported on its U.S.
federal income tax returns; or
in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.
190
Table of Contents
Non-U.S. Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying their
status on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-ECI or W-8IMY, as applicable.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, a unitholder generally may obtain a credit for any amount withheld against its
liability for U.S. federal income tax (and obtain a refund of any amounts withheld in excess of such liability) by timely filing a U.S.
federal income tax return with the IRS.

NON-UNITED STATES TAX CONSIDERATIONS
Marshall Islands Tax Consequences
The following is the opinion of Watson, Farley & Williams LLP, our counsel as to matters of the laws of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands, and the current laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands applicable to persons who do not reside in, maintain offices in or
engage in business in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Because we and our subsidiaries do not and do not expect to conduct business or operations in the Republic of the Marshall Islands,
and because all documentation related to this offering will be executed outside of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, under current
Marshall Islands law you will not be subject to Marshall Islands taxation or withholding on distributions, including upon distribution
treated as a return of capital, we make to you as a unitholder. In addition, you will not be subject to Marshall Islands stamp, capital
gains or other taxes on the purchase, ownership or disposition of common units, and you will not be required by the Republic of the
Marshall Islands to file a tax return relating to your ownership of common units.
United Kingdom Tax Consequences
The following is a discussion of the material U.K. tax consequences that may be relevant to prospective unitholders who are persons
not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom (and who are persons who have not been resident for tax purposes in the United
Kingdom), or “non-U.K. Holders.”
Prospective unitholders who are, or have been, resident in the United Kingdom are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding
the potential U.K. tax consequences to them of an investment in our common units. For this purpose, a company incorporated outside
of the U.K. will be treated as resident in the United Kingdom in the event its central management and control is carried out in the
United Kingdom.
The discussion that follows is based upon existing U.K. legislation and current H.M. Revenue & Customs practice as of the date of
this prospectus, both of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax
consequences to vary substantially from the consequences of unit ownership described below.
We are not required to withhold U.K. tax when paying distributions to unitholders.
Under U.K. taxation legislation, non-U.K. Holders will not be subject to tax in the United Kingdom on income or profits, including
chargeable (capital) gains, in respect of the acquisition, holding, disposition or redemption of the common units, provided that:
•
•
such holders do not use or hold and are not deemed or considered to use or hold their common units in the course of
carrying on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom; and
such holders do not have a branch or agency or permanent establishment in the United Kingdom to which such common
units are used, held or acquired.
A non-U.K. Holder that carries on a business in the United Kingdom through a partnership is subject to United Kingdom tax on
income derived from the business carried on by the partnership in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, because we are organized as a
limited liability company (and not a partnership), we expect that non-U.K. Holders will not be considered to be carrying on business in
the United Kingdom for the purposes of U.K. taxation solely by reason of the acquisition, holding, disposition or redemption of their
common units.

The underwriters and the representatives are collectively referred to as the “underwriters” and the “representatives,” respectively. The
underwriters are offering the common units subject to their acceptance of the common units from the selling unitholder and subject to
prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the
common units offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other
conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the common units offered by this prospectus if any such common
units are taken. However, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for the common units covered by the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional common units described below. The underwriting agreement also provides that if an underwriter defaults, the
purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may also be increased or the offering may be terminated.
The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the common units directly to the public at the public offering price listed on the cover
page of this prospectus and part to certain dealers at the public offering price less a concession not to exceed $         per common unit.
After the initial offering of the common units, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the
representatives. The offering of the units by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters’ right
to reject any order in whole or in part. Sales of units made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriters.
The selling unitholder has granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up
to an aggregate of 2,625,000 additional common units at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less
underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering their option to
purchase additional units, if any, made in connection with the offering of the common units offered by this prospectus. To the extent
the option is exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase about the same percentage
of the additional common units as the number listed next to the underwriter’s name in the preceding table bears to the total number of
common units listed next to the names of all underwriters in the preceding table.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc.
The selling unitholder will pay to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. an aggregate structuring fee equal to 0.5% of
the gross proceeds from this offering, or $         ($         if the underwriters exercise the option to purchase additional common units in
full) for providing advice regarding the capital structure of our company, the terms of the offering, the terms of our limited liability
company agreement and the terms of certain other agreements between us and our affiliates.
We estimate that the total expenses of this offering, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions and structuring fees, will be
approximately $6.9 million, all of which will be paid by the selling unitholder.
The underwriters have informed us and the selling unitholder that they do not intend sales to discretionary accounts to exceed 5% of
the total number of common units offered by them.
Our common units have been approved, subject to official notice of issuance, on the NYSE under the symbol “RIGP.”
We, all of our directors and executive officers, the Transocean Member and certain of its affiliates have agreed that, without the prior
written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc., on behalf of the underwriters, and subject to specified
exceptions, we and they will not, during the period ending 180 days after the date of this prospectus, or the restricted period:
•
•
•
offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any common units or any
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common units;
file any registration statement with the SEC relating to the offering of any common units or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for common units; or
enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences
of ownership of the common units;
whether any such transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of common units or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise. In addition, we and each such person agrees that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and
Barclays Capital Inc., on behalf of the underwriters, we or such other person will not, during the restricted period, make any demand
for, or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any common units or any security convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for common units.
The restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph to do not apply to:
•
•
the sale of common units to the underwriters; or
the issuance by us of common units upon the exercise of an option or a warrant or the conversion of a security outstanding
on the date of this prospectus of which the underwriters have been advised in writing;
Table of Contents
195
•
•
transactions by any person other than us relating to common units or other securities acquired in open market transactions
after the completion of the offering of the common units; provided that no filing under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, is
required or voluntarily made in connection with subsequent sales of the common units or other securities acquired in such
open market transactions; or
the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act for the transfer of common units,
provided that (i) such plan does not provide for the transfer of common units during the restricted period and (ii) to the extent
a public announcement or filing under the Exchange Act, if any, is required or voluntarily made regarding the establishment
of such plan, such announcement or filing shall include a statement to the effect that no transfer of common units may be
made under such plan during the restricted period.
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc., in their sole discretion, on behalf of the underwriters, may release the common
units and other securities subject to the lock-up agreements described above in whole or in part at any time with or without notice.
In order to facilitate the offering of the common units, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise
affect the price of the common units. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more common units than they are obligated to purchase
under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number
of common units available for purchase by the underwriters under the option to purchase additional units. The underwriters can close
out a covered short sale by exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing common units in the open market. In determining the
source of common units to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market price of
common units compared to the price available under the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also sell common units in
excess of the over-allotment option, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by
purchasing common units in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned
that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect
investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase,
common units in the open market to stabilize the price of the common units. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of
the common units above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the common units. The
underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time.
We, the Transocean Member and certain of its affiliates, including Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd., have agreed to indemnify
the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to
time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking and other
services for us and our affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of certain of the
underwriters are lenders under Transocean’s credit facilities.
Furthermore, certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates may, from time to time, enter into arms-length transactions with
us in the ordinary course of their business. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their
respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such
investment and securities activities may involve securities or instruments of the company. The underwriters and their respective
affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
Table of Contents
196
securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such
securities and instruments.
Standard Chartered Bank will not effect any offers or sales of the common units in the United States unless it is through one or more
U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by the regulations of FINRA.
A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on websites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group
members, if any, participating in this offering. The representatives may agree to allocate a number of common units to underwriters for
sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to the underwriters that
may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.
Pricing of the Offering
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common units. The initial public offering price will be determined by
negotiations between us, the selling unitholder and the representatives. Among the factors that will be considered in determining the
initial public offering price will be our future prospects and those of our industry in general, our sales, earnings and certain other
financial and operating information in recent periods, and the price-earnings ratios, price-sales ratios, market prices of securities and
certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to ours. The estimated initial public offering
price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus is subject to change as a result of market conditions and other factors.
Selling Restrictions
Other than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the underwriters that would permit a public offering of the securities
offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The securities offered by this prospectus may
not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this prospectus or any other offering material or advertisements in connection with
the offer and sale of any such securities be distributed or published in any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in
compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this prospectus comes are
advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the distribution of this prospectus. This
prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities offered by this prospectus in any
jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.

Kong) other than with respect to common units which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only
to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap.571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules
made thereunder.

ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES AGAINST FOREIGN PERSONS
We are organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands as a limited liability company. The Transocean Member is organized under
the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company. The Marshall Islands and the Cayman Islands have a less developed
body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provide protections for investors to a significantly lesser extent.
Most of our directors and officers and those of our subsidiaries are residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial
portion of the assets of our directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for
United States investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us, our directors or officers, the Transocean Member
or our subsidiaries or to realize against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon
the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. The Transocean Member has
agreed to be served with process with respect to actions based on the offering and sale of the common units. To bring a claim against
the Transocean Member, you may serve the Transocean Member’s Corporate Secretary, c/o Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling
Inc., 4 Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046, the U.S. agent appointed for that purpose.
Watson, Farley & Williams LLP, our counsel as to Marshall Islands law, has advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the
courts of the Marshall Islands would (1) recognize or enforce against us or our directors or officers judgments of courts of the United
States based on civil liability provisions of applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; or (2) impose liabilities against us or our
directors and officers in original actions brought in the Marshall Islands, based on these laws.
Harney Westwood & Riegels, our counsel as to Cayman Islands law, has advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts
of the Cayman Islands would (1) recognize or enforce against the Transocean Member judgments of courts of the United States
based on civil liability provisions of applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; or (2) impose liabilities against the Transocean
Member in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, based on these laws.
LEGAL MATTERS
The validity of the common units and certain other legal matters, including tax matters, with respect to the laws of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands will be passed upon for us by our counsel as to Marshall Islands law, Watson, Farley & Williams LLP, New York,
New York. Certain other legal matters, including tax matters with respect to U.S. law, will be passed upon for us by Baker Botts L.L.P.,
Houston, Texas. Certain matters with respect to this offering will be passed upon for the underwriters by Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.,
Washington, D.C.

TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC
INTRODUCTION TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED BALANCE SHEET
The  unaudited  pro  forma  combined  balance  sheet  and  the  notes  thereto  present  the  combined  financial  position  of  Transocean
Partners  LLC  (“Transocean  Partners”)  after  giving  effect  to  the  transactions  described  below.  The  unaudited  pro  forma  combined
balance sheet has been derived from the unaudited condensed combined balance sheet of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor,
Transocean  Partners’  predecessor  for  accounting  purposes  (the  “Predecessor”),  as  of  March  31,  2014.  The  unaudited  pro  forma
combined balance sheet and notes thereto should be read together with the Predecessor’s historical unaudited condensed combined
financial statements and the notes thereto, as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, and audited historical
combined financial statements and the notes thereto, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
Transocean  Partners  will  own  the  controlling  interests  in  rig-owning  companies  and  rig-operating  companies  (collectively,  the
“RigCos”) that will own and operate the assets and operations associated with the ultra-deepwater  drillships Discoverer Inspiration
a n d Discoverer  Clear  Leader  and  the ultra-deepwater  semisubmersible Development  Driller  III  (collectively,  the  “Predecessor
Business”), effective upon closing of the initial public offering of Transocean Partners (the “IPO”). The contribution of the assets and
liabilities of the Predecessor Business to Transocean Partners Holdings Limited (the “Transocean Member”) and the subsequent
contribution of the assets and liabilities of the Predecessor Business by the Transocean Member to Transocean Partners will be
recorded at historical cost, as each such transaction is a reorganization under common control.
The  adjustments  reflected  in  the  unaudited  pro  forma  combined  balance  sheet  are  based  on  currently  available  information  and
certain estimates and assumptions. However, management believes the assumptions are reasonable for presenting the significant
effects of the contemplated transactions and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions, which are
directly attributable to the offering transactions and are factually supportable, in the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet.
The pro forma adjustments have been prepared as if the transactions to be effected in connection with the closing of this offering had
taken place on March 31, 2014. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet may not be indicative of the financial position that actually
would have resulted if Transocean Partners had completed the transactions on the date indicated or Transocean Partners’ financial
position at any future date.
Transactions
The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet gives effect to the following transactions:
•
the Transocean Member will contribute to Transocean Partners a 51 percent ownership interest in each of the holding
companies that owns one of the RigCos, and in exchange, Transocean Partners will issue to the Transocean Member of
41,379,310 common units and 27,586,207 subordinated units, representing a 60 percent and a 40 percent, respectively,
limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners, the non-economic Transocean Member interest and all of the
incentive distribution rights, which entitle the Transocean Member to increasing percentages of the cash that Transocean
Partners distributes in excess of $0.416875 per unit per quarter;
•
•
•
Transocean Partners will issue a 364-day working capital note payable to a Transocean subsidiary for cash proceeds, all
or a portion of which Transocean Partners will pay to the Transocean Member for Transocean Partners’ pro rata share of
certain working capital balances;
the Transocean Member will sell to the public 17,500,000 common units in the IPO, representing a 25.4 percent limited
liability company interest in Transocean Partners; and
Transocean  Partners  will  establish  a  $300  million  revolving  credit  facility  under  a  credit  agreement  with  a  Transocean
affiliate (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility”).
The effect on the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet of certain of the transactions described above is more fully described
in the notes to the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet.

$—    
   
 
$—
In connection with the proposed transactions, we will enter into a credit agreement to establish a $300 million five-year  revolving
credit facility (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility”). We may borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the
adjusted  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (“LIBOR”)  plus  a  margin  that  will  fluctuate  based  on  our  leverage  ratio  (the “Five-Year
Revolving Credit Facility Margin”) or (2) the base rate specified in the credit agreement plus the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility
Margin, less one percent per annum. Throughout the term of the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, we expect to pay a commitment
fee on the daily unused amount of the underlying commitment, which ranges from 0.225 percent to 0.325 percent. At March 31, 2014,
based  on  our  unaudited  pro  forma  combined  balance  sheet,  we  would  have  had  no  letters  of  credit  issued  and  outstanding,  no
borrowings outstanding, and $300 million of available borrowing capacity under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility.

balances of the

Predecessor. At March 31, 2014, the pro forma initial working capital balances included accounts receivable, excluding a contributed
balance of $21 million, materials and supplies and prepaid assets. The 364-day working capital note payable is payable at maturity
and bears interest at a rate equal to the rate for Eurocurrency loans under our Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts under the
364-day working capital note payable may be repaid early without penalty, and amounts repaid cannot be reborrowed.

Long-term tax liability

In exchange for the contribution by the Transocean Member to Transocean Partners of a 51 percent ownership interest in each of its
holding company subsidiaries that owns each of the RigCos, Transocean Partners will issue to the Transocean Member 41,379,310
common  units  and  27,586,207  subordinated  units  representing  a  100  percent  limited  liability  company  interest  in  Transocean
Partners, the non-economic Transocean Member interest and all of the Transocean Partners’ incentive distribution rights.

After  the  transactions,  the  members’  equity  amounts  of  the  common  unit  holders  and  the  subordinated  unit  holders  would  be
60 percent and 40 percent of total members’ equity. Common units accrue cumulative cash distributions for any quarter during the
subordination period in which they do not receive the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit.
Transocean  Partners  will  not  receive  any  proceeds  from  the  sale  by  the  Transocean  Member  of  common  units  in  the  offering,
including any proceeds from the sale of common units pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units.

The Transocean Member also owns the non-economic Transocean Member interest in Transocean Partners, which does not entitle it
to  receive  cash  distributions  in  respect  of  such  interest.  The  Transocean  Member  will  also  hold  the  incentive  distribution  rights
following  the  completion  of  this  offering,  which  entitle  it  to  receive  an  increasing  percentage  of  the  Transocean  Partners’  cash
distributions in excess of $0.416875 per unit per quarter.

The subordinated units may convert to common units if Transocean Partners has earned and paid at least the minimum quarterly
distribution  on  each  outstanding  common  and  subordinated  unit  for  any  three  consecutive  non-overlapping  four  quarter  periods
ending on or after June 30, 2019, provided there are no arrearages in the common units at such time. The subordination period also
will end upon the removal of the Transocean Member, other than for cause, if the units held by the Transocean Member and its
affiliates are not voted in favor of such removal. When the subordination period ends, all remaining subordinated units will convert into
common units on a one-for-one basis, and the common units will no longer be entitled to arrearages. See “Provisions of Our Limited
Liability Company Agreement Related to Cash Distributions—Subordination Period” elsewhere in this prospectus.

49 percent ownership interest in each of the holding company subsidiaries that owns each of the RigCos, which will be presented as
noncontrolling interest.

TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Transocean Partners LLC (“Transocean Partners”), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, was formed on February 6, 2014, by
Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. (together with its affiliates, unless the context
requires otherwise, “Transocean” or “Parent”), to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs.
The drilling units in the fleet are currently located in the United States (“U.S.”) Gulf of Mexico. The condensed combined financial
statements of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Predecessor”) include 100 percent of the combined
results of operations, assets and liabilities of the ultra-deepwater drillships Discoverer Inspiration  and Discoverer Clear Leader and
the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible Development Driller III (collectively, the “Predecessor Business”).
Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies
Presentation—The  condensed  combined  financial  statements  of  the  Predecessor  have  been  prepared  from  Transocean’s
accounting  records.  The  condensed  combined  financial  statements  reflect  the  combined  historical  results  of  operations,  financial
position and cash flows of the Predecessor Business as if such operations and assets had been combined for all periods presented.
All  transactions  among  the  Predecessor  Business  within  the  Predecessor  have  been  eliminated.  We  have  prepared  the
accompanying unaudited condensed combined financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Pursuant to such rules and regulations, these financial statements do not include all disclosures
required  by  U.S.  GAAP  for  complete  financial  statements.  The  condensed  combined  financial  statements  reflect  all  adjustments,
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the interim periods. Such adjustments are considered to be of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise noted. Operating results
for the three months ended March 31, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2014 or for any future period. The accompanying condensed combined financial statements and notes thereto should
be read in conjunction with the audited combined financial statements and notes thereto as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
Transocean uses a centralized approach to treasury services to perform cash management for the operations of its affiliates. The cash
generated and used by our operations is transferred to Transocean, and Transocean funds our operating and investing activities as
needed. We had no bank accounts, and Transocean’s cash and cash equivalents were not allocated to us for any period presented.
Accordingly, we have presented the transfers of cash to and from Transocean’s treasury as adjustments to our net investment on our
condensed  combined  balance  sheets  and  as  net  distributions  to  Parent  in  our  financing  activities  on  our  condensed  combined
statements  of  cash  flows.  We  have  not  included  any  interest  expense  for  intercompany  cash  advances  from  Transocean,  since
Transocean has not historically allocated interest expense for intercompany advances to us.
Accounting estimates—To prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.,
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those
related to our materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, goodwill and drilling contract intangible liability, income
taxes,  allocated  costs  and  related  party  transactions.  We  base  our  estimates  and  assumptions  on  historical  experience  and  on
various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from
such estimates.

TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
(Unaudited)
Allocated  indirect  and  overhead  costs—The  condensed  combined  statements  of  operations  include  allocated  indirect  and
overhead costs for certain functions historically performed by Transocean and not previously allocated to the Predecessor Business,
including allocations of indirect operating and maintenance costs and expenses for onshore operational support services such as
engineering,  procurement  and  logistics  and  general  and  administrative  costs  and  expenses  related  to  executive  oversight,
accounting, treasury, tax, legal, and information technology. In the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized
such allocated operating and maintenance costs of $6 million and $7 million, respectively, including $5 million in each three month
period  for  personnel  costs.  In  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2014  and  2013,  we  recognized  such  allocated  general  and
administrative costs of $2 million, including $2 million and $1 million, respectively, for personnel costs.
Accounts receivable—We  record  long-term  accounts  receivable  at  their  present  value  and  recognize  interest  income  using  the
effective interest method through the date of payment. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the aggregate carrying amount of
o u r long-term  accounts  receivable  was  $18  million  and  $22  million,  respectively,  recorded  in  other  assets  on  our  condensed
combined balance sheets, which had weighted average effective interest rates of 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
Subsequent events—We have evaluated subsequent events through June 20, 2014, the date on which our financial statements
were available to be issued.
Note 3—New Accounting Pronouncements
Recently adopted accounting standards
Income taxes—Effective January 1, 2014, we adopted the accounting standards update that requires an unrecognized tax benefit to
be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss
or a tax credit carryforward if net settlement is required or expected. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
on  or  after  December  15,  2013.  Our  adoption  did  not  have  a  material  effect  on  our  condensed  combined  balance  sheets  or  the
disclosures contained in our notes to condensed combined financial statements.
Recently issued accounting standards
Presentation of financial statements—Effective January 1, 2015, we will adopt the accounting standards update that changes the
criteria  for  reporting  discontinued  operations.  The  update  expands  the  disclosures  for  discontinued  operations  and  requires  new
disclosures related to the disposal of individually significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations.
The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. We do not expect that our adoption
will  have  a  material  effect  on  our  condensed  combined  balance  sheets  or  the  disclosures  contained  in  our  notes  to  condensed
combined financial statements.
Revenue from contracts with customers—Effective January 1, 2017, we will adopt the accounting standards update that requires
an  entity  to  recognize  revenue  to  depict  the  transfer  of  promised  goods  or  services  to  customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The update is effective for interim and
annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  December  15,  2016.  We  are  evaluating  the  requirements  to  determine  the  effect  such
requirements may have on our revenue recognition policies; however, we do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect
on our condensed combined balance sheets or the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed combined financial statements.

Note 4—Income Taxes

TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
(Unaudited)
Tax  rate—Transocean  Ltd.,  a  holding  company  and  Swiss  resident,  is  exempt  from  cantonal  and  communal  income  tax  in
Switzerland, but is subject to Swiss federal income tax. At the federal level, qualifying net dividend income and net capital gains on
the  sale  of  qualifying  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  exempt  from  Swiss  federal  income  tax.  Consequently,  Transocean  Ltd.’s
dividends from its subsidiaries and capital gains from sales of investments in its subsidiaries are exempt from Swiss federal income
tax.
Our provision for income taxes was prepared on a separate return basis with consideration to the laws and rates applicable in the
jurisdictions in which we operated and earned income.
In  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2014  and  2013,  our  estimated  annual  effective  tax  rates  were  8.5  percent  and  10  percent,
respectively. These rates were based on estimated annual income before income taxes for each period after adjusting for various
discrete items, including certain immaterial adjustments to prior period tax expense.
Unrecognized tax benefits—The  liabilities  related  to  the  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  including  related  interest  and  penalties  that
were recognized as a component of income tax expense, were as follows (in millions):
Unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties

In  the  year  ending  December  31,  2014,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  existing  liabilities  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  could
increase or decrease primarily due to the progression of open audits. However, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential
changes in our existing liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to various uncertainties, such as the unresolved nature of various
audits.
Tax returns—Our results are reported in federal and local tax returns filed in the U.S. and Switzerland. With few exceptions, we are
no longer subject to examinations of our tax matters for years prior to 2010.
Note 5—Credit Agreements
In March 2014, we entered into credit agreements with a Transocean affiliate, establishing three credit facilities with an aggregate
borrowing capacity of $300 million that will expire on March 31, 2017. We may borrow under the credit facilities at the applicable U.S.
federal rate as issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. As of March 31, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the
credit agreements.
Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies
Retained risk—Transocean has a hull and machinery and excess liability insurance program that is comprised of commercial market
and  captive  insurance  policies  that  Transocean  renews  annually  on  May  1.  As  of  March  31,  2014,  the  insured  value  of  the
Predecessor’s  drilling  units  under  this  program  was  approximately  $1.8  billion.  Transocean  does  not  generally  carry  commercial
market  insurance  coverage  for  loss  of  revenues  or  for  losses  resulting  from  physical  damage  to  our  fleet  caused  by  named
windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including liability for wreck removal costs.
Table of Contents
F-13
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
(Unaudited)
Hull and machinery coverage—Transocean has hull and machinery insurance for physical damage to its drilling rigs, which also
covers the rigs in our fleet, and allocates to us the costs attributed to our fleet. We retain the risk for the deductibles relating to physical
damage insurance for our fleet. At March 31, 2014, under Transocean’s hull and machinery program, we generally maintained a
$125 million per occurrence deductible, limited to a maximum of $200 million per policy period. Of such $125 million per occurrence
deductible, Transocean has retained the risk of $115 million in excess of $10 million through Transocean’s wholly-owned captive
insurance company. Subject to the same shared deductible, we also have coverage for an amount equal to 50 percent of a rig’s
insured  value  for  combined  costs  incurred  to  mitigate  damage  to  a  rig  and  wreck  removal.  Any  excess  wreck  removal  costs  are
generally covered to the extent of our remaining excess liability coverage.
Excess liability coverage—Transocean has excess liability coverage insurance, which also covers the rigs in our fleet, and allocates
to  us  the  costs  attributed  to  our  fleet.  At  March  31,  2014,  Transocean  carried  $820  million  of  commercial  market  excess  liability
coverage, exclusive of deductibles and self-insured retention, noted below, which generally covers offshore risks such as personal
injury, third-party  property  claims,  and third-party  non-crew  claims,  including  wreck  removal  and  pollution.  Our  excess  liability
coverage  has  (1)  separate  $10  million  per  occurrence  deductibles  on  collision  liability  claims  and  (2)  separate  $5  million  per
occurrence  deductibles  on  crew  personal  injury  claims  and  on  other third-party  non-crew  claims.  Through  Transocean’s  wholly
owned captive insurance company, Transocean has retained the risk of the primary $50 million excess liability coverage. In addition,
Transocean generally has retained the risk for any liability losses in excess of $870 million.
Other  insurance  coverage—Transocean  carries  additional  insurance,  which  it  extends  to  our  operations.  At  March  31,  2014,
Transocean carried $100 million of additional insurance that generally covers expenses that would otherwise be assumed by the well
owner, such as costs to control the well, redrill expenses and pollution from the well. This additional insurance provides coverage for
such  expenses  in  circumstances  in  which  we  have  legal  or  contractual  liability  arising  from  our  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct.
Note 7—Related Party Transactions
Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc.—Under an existing master services agreement with Transocean Offshore Deepwater
Drilling,  Inc.  (“TODDI”),  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Transocean,  the  Predecessor  obtained  services  and  assistance  for  certain
activities,  including  accounting,  legal,  finance,  marketing,  treasury,  insurance,  global  procurement,  and  technical  services.  In  the
three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized costs of $8 million and $9 million, respectively, recorded in operating
and maintenance costs and expenses, for such services and assistance. In the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we
paid  $13  million  and  $8  million,  respectively,  settled  through  our  net  investment,  for  materials  and  supplies  purchased  through
TODDI’s procurement services.
Also under the existing master services agreement, TODDI administered insurance coverage with and processed claims through
Transocean’s commercial market and captive insurance policies (see Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies). In the three months
ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $3 million, recorded in operating and maintenance costs and expenses, for the
insurance costs allocated to us for our drilling rigs.
TODDI and its affiliates charged to us under the existing master services agreement for crew personnel provided to us to operate our
drilling rigs. In the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized costs of $24 million and $22 million, respectively,
recorded in operating and maintenance costs and expenses, for such personnel costs. In the three months ended March 31, 2014 and
2013, we recognized costs of $1 million and
Table of Contents
F-14
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
(Unaudited)
$2  million,  respectively,  recorded  in  operating  and  maintenance  costs  and  expenses,  for  the  proportion  of  the  benefit  costs  that
covered the personnel supporting our operations.
All  three  of  our  drilling  units  are  equipped  with  Transocean’s  patented dual-activity  technology. Dual-activity  technology  employs
structures, equipment and techniques using two drilling stations within a dual derrick to perform drilling tasks. Dual-activity technology
allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner and reduces critical path activity,
improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling. We entered into license agreements with TODDI for the use of the
patented  technology  through  the  expiration  of  the  patents  in  May  2016.  Under  the  license  agreements,  we  paid  to  TODDI  an
aggregate original license cost of $20 million, recorded in other assets. In the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we
recognized amortization of the license costs of $1 million, recorded in operating and maintenance costs and expenses. At March 31,
2014 and December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of the deferred license cost was $6 million and $7 million, respectively. Under the
license agreements, we also pay to TODDI quarterly royalty fees of between 3 percent and 5 percent of revenues. In the three months
ended  March  31,  2014  and  2013,  we  recognized  royalty  fees  of  $5  million,  recorded  in  operating  and  maintenance  costs  and
expenses.
In March 2014, we entered into credit agreements with a Transocean affiliate, establishing three credit facilities with an aggregate
borrowing capacity of $300 million that will expire on March 31, 2017. See Note—5 Credit Agreements.
Note 8—Supplemental Cash Flow Information
In the three months ended March 31, 2014, we transferred to the Parent’s other drilling units certain equipment with an aggregate net
carrying amount of $18 million, primarily all of which was from Development Driller III, and we recorded the non-cash investing activity
with a corresponding entry to our net investment.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Member of Transocean Partners LLC
We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor (the Predecessor) as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related combined statements of operations, net investment, and cash flows for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Predecessor’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are  free  of  material  misstatement.  We  were  not  engaged  to  perform  an  audit  of  the  Predecessor’s  internal  control  over  financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Predecessor’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of
Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the combined results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Transocean Partners LLC (“Transocean Partners”), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, was formed on February 6, 2014, by
Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. (together with its affiliates, unless the context
requires otherwise, “Transocean” or “Parent”), to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs.
The drilling units in the fleet are currently located in the United States (“U.S.”) Gulf of Mexico. The combined financial statements of
Transocean  Partners  LLC  Predecessor  (“we”,  “us”,  “our”  or  the  “Predecessor”)  include  100  percent  of  the  combined  results  of
operations, assets and liabilities of the ultra-deepwater  drillships Discoverer Inspiration  and Discoverer Clear Leader  and  the ultra-
deepwater semisubmersible Development Driller III (collectively, the “Predecessor Business”).
Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies
Presentation—The combined financial statements of the Predecessor have been prepared from Transocean’s accounting records.
The  combined  financial  statements  reflect  the  combined  historical  results  of  operations,  financial  position  and  cash  flows  of  the
Predecessor Business as if such operations and assets had been combined for all periods presented. All transactions among the
Predecessor Business within the Predecessor have been eliminated.
Transocean uses a centralized approach to treasury services to perform cash management for the operations of its affiliates. The cash
generated and used by our operations is transferred to Transocean, and Transocean funds our operating and investing activities as
needed. We had no bank accounts, and Transocean’s cash and cash equivalents were not allocated to us for any period presented.
Accordingly, we have presented the transfers of cash to and from Transocean’s treasury as adjustments to our net investment on our
combined balance sheets and as net distributions to parent in our financing activities on our combined statements of cash flows. We
have not included any interest expense for intercompany cash advances from Transocean, since Transocean has not historically
allocated interest expense for intercompany advances to us.
Accounting estimates—To prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.,
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those
related to our materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, goodwill and drilling contract intangible liability, income
taxes,  allocated  costs  and  related  party  transactions.  We  base  our  estimates  and  assumptions  on  historical  experience  and  on
various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from
such estimates.
Operating revenues and expenses—We recognize operating revenues as they are realized and earned and can be reasonably
measured, based on contractual dayrates, and when collectability is reasonably assured. In connection with drilling contracts, we may
receive  revenues  for  preparation  and  mobilization  of  equipment  and  personnel  or  for  capital  improvements  to  rigs.  We  defer  the
revenues earned and incremental costs incurred that are directly related to contract preparation and mobilization and recognize such
revenues and costs over the primary contract term of the drilling project using the straight-line method. We amortize, in operating and
maintenance costs and expenses, the fees related to contract preparation, mobilization and capital upgrades on a straight-line basis
over the estimated firm period of drilling, which is consistent with the general pace of activity, level of services being provided and
dayrates being earned over the life of the contract. For contractual daily rate contracts, we recognize the losses for loss contracts as
such  losses  are  incurred.  We  recognize  the  costs  of relocating  drilling  units  without  contracts  as  such  costs  are  incurred.  Upon
completion of drilling contracts, we
Table of Contents
F-21
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
recognize in earnings any demobilization fees received and expenses incurred. We defer capital upgrade revenues received and
recognize such revenues over the primary contract term of the drilling project. We depreciate the actual costs incurred for the capital
upgrade on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. We defer the periodic survey and drydock costs incurred in
connection with obtaining regulatory certification to operate our rigs and well control systems on an ongoing basis, and we recognize
such costs over the period until the next survey using the straight-line method. We defer costs associated with the license fee that we
paid for the use of Transocean’s patented dual-activity and recognize such amortized costs using the straight-line method through the
license and patent expiration in May 2016 (see Note 10—Related Party Transactions).
Included in our contract drilling revenues, we recognize amortization associated with our drilling contract intangible liability attributed
to the drilling contract for Development Driller III. We amortize drilling contract intangible revenues based on the cash flows projected
over  the  contract  period  and  include  such  revenues  in  contract  drilling  revenues  on  our  combined  statements  of  operations.  See
Note 5—Goodwill and Intangible Liability.
Our other revenues represent those derived from customer reimbursable revenues. We recognize customer reimbursable revenues as
we bill our customers for reimbursement of costs associated with certain equipment, materials and supplies, subcontracted services,
employee bonuses and other expenditures, resulting in little or no net effect on operating income since such recognition is concurrent
with the recognition of the respective reimbursable costs in operating and maintenance expense.
Allocated indirect and overhead costs—The combined statements of operations include allocated indirect and overhead costs for
certain  functions  historically  performed  by  Transocean  and  not  previously  allocated  to  the  Predecessor  Business,  including
allocations of indirect operating and maintenance costs and expenses for onshore operational support services such as engineering,
procurement and logistics and general and administrative costs and expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury,
tax, legal, and information technology. We have applied these allocations based on relative values of net property and equipment and
operating  and  maintenance  expenses.  We  believe  the  assumptions  underlying  the  combined  financial  statements,  including  the
assumptions regarding allocation of costs from Transocean, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the combined financial statements do not
include all of the costs that we would have incurred had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented and may not
reflect the combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company during the periods
presented. In the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized such allocated operating and maintenance costs of
$28 million and $22 million, including $21 million and $17 million, respectively, for personnel costs. In the years ended December 31,
2013 and 2012, we recognized such allocated general and administrative costs of $10 million and $9 million, respectively, including
$6 million in each year for personnel costs.
Income taxes—We provide for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are
conducted and income is earned. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary
differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the applicable jurisdictional tax
rates in effect at year end. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of
the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We also record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from
net operating losses incurred during the year in certain jurisdictions and for other deferred tax assets where, in our opinion, it is more
likely than not that the financial statement benefit of these losses will not be realized. Additionally, we record a valuation allowance for
foreign tax credit carryforwards to reflect the possible expiration of these benefits prior to their utilization.
We maintain liabilities for estimated tax exposures in our jurisdictions of operation, and we recognize the provisions and benefits
resulting from changes to those liabilities in our income tax expense or benefit along with
Table of Contents
F-22
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
related interest and penalties. Tax exposure items may include potential challenges to qualification for treaty benefits, intercompany
pricing, disposition transactions, and withholding tax rates and their applicability. These tax exposures are resolved primarily through
the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means, but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or
other factors, which could cause us to revise past estimates. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has previously challenged
and is currently challenging our transfer pricing relating to certain bareboat charters. If the IRS successfully challenged our transfer
pricing policies, it could result in a material increase in our U.S. federal income tax expense. See Note 4—Income Taxes.
Accounts receivable—We derive a majority of our revenues from services to international oil companies. We evaluate the credit
quality  of  our  customers  on  an  ongoing  basis,  and  we  do  not  generally  require  collateral  or  other  security  to  support  customer
receivables. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts on a case-by-case basis, considering changes in the financial position
of a customer, when we believe the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur. At December 31, 2013 and
2012, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts.
We record long-term accounts receivable at their present value and recognize interest income using the effective interest method
through the date of payment. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the aggregate carrying amount of our long-term accounts receivable
was  $22  million  and  $33  million,  respectively,  recorded  in  other  assets  on  our  combined  balance  sheets,  which  had  weighted
average effective interest rates of approximately 10 percent and seven percent, respectively.
Materials and supplies—We record materials and supplies at their average cost less an allowance for obsolescence. We estimate
the  allowance  for  obsolescence  based  on  historical  experience  and  expectations  for  future  use  of  the  materials  and  supplies.  At
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the allowance for obsolescence was $2 million and $1 million, respectively.
Property and equipment—The carrying amounts of our property and equipment, consisting primarily of offshore drilling rigs and
related equipment, are based on our estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful lives and salvage
values of our rigs. These estimates, assumptions and judgments reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future
industry conditions and operations. At December 31, 2013, the aggregate carrying amount of our property and equipment represented
approximately 83 percent of our total assets.
We compute depreciation using the straight-line method after allowing for salvage values. We capitalize expenditures for newbuilds,
renewals,  replacements  and  improvements,  including  capitalized  interest,  if  applicable,  and  we  recognize  the  expense  for
maintenance and repair costs as incurred. For newbuild construction projects, we also capitalize the initial preparation, mobilization
and commissioning costs incurred until the drilling unit is placed into service. Upon sale or other disposition of an asset, we recognize
a net gain or loss on disposal of the asset, which is measured as the difference between the net carrying amount of the asset and the
net proceeds received.
The estimated original useful lives of our drilling units was 35 years. From time to time, we may review the estimated remaining useful
lives of our drilling units when events occur or circumstances change, and we may extend the useful life when such events and
circumstances indicate that a drilling unit can operate beyond its remaining useful life.
Long-lived  assets—We  review  the  aggregate  carrying  amount  of  our long-lived  assets,  principally  property  and  equipment,  for
potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the aggregate carrying amount of our drilling units
and related equipment may not be recoverable. We determine
Table of Contents
F-23
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
recoverability by evaluating the aggregate estimated undiscounted future net cash flows based on projected dayrates and utilization
of our drilling units. When an impairment of our assets is indicated, we measure the impairment as the amount by which the aggregate
carrying amount of our drilling units and related equipment exceeds the aggregate estimated fair value. We measure the fair value of
our drilling units and related equipment by applying a variety of valuation methods, incorporating a combination of cost, income and
market approaches, using projected discounted cash flows and estimates of the exchange price that would be received for the assets
in  the  principal  or  most  advantageous  market  for  the  assets  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market  participants  as  of  the
measurement date. In the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not identify any events or circumstances that indicated
that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets was unrecoverable.
Goodwill—We conduct impairment testing for our goodwill annually as of October 1 and more frequently, on an interim basis, when
an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may have declined below its carrying
value. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment
that  constitutes  a  business  for  which  financial  information  is  available  and  is  regularly  reviewed  by  management.  We  have
determined that we have a single reporting unit for this purpose. Before testing goodwill, we consider whether or not to first assess
qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether the two-step impairment test is required. If, as the
result of our qualitative assessment, we determine that the two-step impairment test is required, or, alternatively, if we elect to forgo
the qualitative assessment, we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill,
to the fair value of the reporting unit.
We  estimate  the  fair  value  of  our  reporting  unit  using  projected  discounted  cash  flows,  publicly  traded  company  multiples  and
acquisition multiples. To develop the projected cash flows associated with our reporting unit, which are based on estimated future
dayrates  and  rig  utilization,  we  consider  key  factors  that  include  assumptions  regarding  future  commodity  prices,  credit  market
conditions  and  the  effect  these  factors  may  have  on  our  contract  drilling  operations  and  the  capital  expenditure  budgets  of  our
customers. We discount the projected cash flows using a long-term, risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which is based on
our estimate of the investment returns that market participants would require for each of our reporting units. We derive publicly traded
company multiples for companies with operations similar to our reporting units using observable information related to shares traded
on stock exchanges and, when available, observable information related to recent acquisitions. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount
exceeds its fair value, we consider goodwill impaired and perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
In the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, as a result of our annual impairment testing, we concluded that our goodwill was
not impaired.
Contingencies—We perform assessments of our contingencies on an ongoing basis to evaluate the appropriateness of our liabilities
and disclosures for such contingencies. We establish liabilities for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable
and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated. We recognize corresponding assets for those loss contingencies
that we believe are probable of being recovered through insurance. Once established, we adjust the carrying amount of a contingent
liability upon the occurrence of a recognizable event when facts and circumstances change, altering our previous assumptions with
respect  to  the  likelihood  or  amount  of  loss.  We  recognize  expense  for  legal  costs  as  they  are  incurred,  and  we  recognize  a
corresponding asset for those legal costs only if we expect such legal costs to be recovered through insurance.
Net  investment—Net  investment  on  our  combined  balance  sheets  represents  Transocean’s  historical  investment  in  us,  our
accumulated earnings and the net effect of cash transactions with, and allocations from, Transocean.
Subsequent events—We have evaluated subsequent events through May 7, 2014, the date on which our financial statements were
available to be issued. See Note 11—Subsequent Events.

Recently issued accounting standards
Income taxes—Effective January 1, 2014, we will adopt the accounting standards update that requires an unrecognized tax benefit to
be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss
or a tax credit carryforward if net settlement is required or expected. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
on or after December 15, 2013. We do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on our combined balance sheets or the
disclosures contained in our notes to combined financial statements.
Presentation of financial statements—Effective January 1, 2015, we will adopt the accounting standards update that changes the
criteria  for  reporting  discontinued  operations.  The  update  expands  the  disclosures  for  discontinued  operations  and  requires  new
disclosures related to the disposal of individually significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations.
The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. We do not expect that our adoption
will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated balance sheets or the disclosures contained in our notes to consolidated
financial statements.
Note 4—Income Taxes
Tax  rate—Transocean  Ltd.,  a  holding  company  and  Swiss  resident,  is  exempt  from  cantonal  and  communal  income  tax  in
Switzerland, but is subject to Swiss federal income tax. At the federal level, qualifying net dividend income and net capital gains on
the  sale  of  qualifying  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  exempt  from  Swiss  federal  income  tax.  Consequently,  Transocean  Ltd.’s
dividends from its subsidiaries and capital gains from sales of investments in its subsidiaries are exempt from Swiss federal income
tax.
Our provision for income taxes was prepared on a separate return basis with consideration to the tax laws and rates applicable in the
jurisdictions  in  which  we  operated  and  earned  income.  The  components  of  our  provision  for  income  taxes  were  as  follows

We  considered  the  earnings  of  the  Predecessor  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested.  As  such,  we  have  not  provided  for  taxes  on  these
unremitted earnings. If there were to be a distribution of these unremitted earnings, such distribution would be subject to withholding
taxes in the U.S. At December 31, 2013, the amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings related to our activities was approximately
$135 million. If all of these indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the Predecessor were distributed, the earnings would be subject
to estimated taxes of between $6 million and $8 million.

In the years ended December 31, 2013 and, 2012, we recognized interest and penalties of less than $1 million associated with the
unrecognized tax benefits and recorded as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2013, if recognized, $13 million
of the unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, would favorably impact the effective tax rate.
It  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  existing  liabilities  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  could  increase  or  decrease  in  the  year  ending
December 31, 2014, primarily due to the progression of open audits. However, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential
changes in our existing liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to various uncertainties, such as the unresolved nature of various
audits.

Tax returns—Our results are reported in federal and local tax returns filed in the U.S. and Switzerland. With few exceptions, we are
no longer subject to examinations of our tax matters for years prior to 2010.
Note 5—Goodwill and Intangible Liability
Goodwill—The Parent allocated to us a portion of the carrying amount of its goodwill, measured as of January 1, 2012, based on the
fair market value of our net property and equipment relative to the fair market value of the Parent’s reporting unit, including our net
property and equipment. The allocated goodwill was $213 million. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, our goodwill was $213 million.
We have not recognized any impairments of the originally allocated carrying amount of goodwill.
Intangible liability—In  connection  with  Transocean’s  business  combination  with  GlobalSantaFe  Corporation  in  November  2007,
Transocean  acquired Development  Driller  III,  which  had  a  drilling  contract  that  included  fixed  dayrates  for  future  contract  drilling
services that were below the then-existing market dayrates available for similar contracts as of the date of the business combination.
Accordingly, Transocean recognized a contract intangible liability, representing the estimated fair value of the Development Driller III
drilling contract, which is expected to be completed in November 2016. The gross carrying amounts of our drilling contract intangible
liability and accumulated amortization were as follows (in millions):

equipment, which are due in the year ending December 31, 2014, were $31 million.
Retained risk—Transocean has a hull and machinery and excess liability insurance program that is comprised of commercial market
and  captive  insurance  policies  that  Transocean  renews  annually  on  May  1.  As  of  December  31,  2013,  the  insured  value  of  the
Predecessor’s drilling units under this program was approximately
Table of Contents
F-27
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
$1.8 billion. Transocean does not generally carry commercial market insurance coverage for loss of revenues or for losses resulting
from physical damage to our fleet caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including liability for wreck removal costs.
Hull and machinery coverage—Transocean has hull and machinery insurance for physical damage to its drilling rigs, which also
covers the rigs in our fleet, and allocates to us the costs attributed to our fleet. We retain the risk for the deductibles relating to physical
damage insurance for our fleet. At December 31, 2013, under Transocean’s hull and machinery program, we generally maintained a
$125 million per occurrence deductible, limited to a maximum of $200 million per policy period. Of such $125 million per occurrence
deductible, Transocean has retained the risk of $115 million in excess of $10 million through Transocean’s wholly-owned captive
insurance company. Subject to the same shared deductible, we also have coverage for an amount equal to 50 percent of a rig’s
insured  value  for  combined  costs  incurred  to  mitigate  damage  to  a  rig  and  wreck  removal.  Any  excess  wreck  removal  costs  are
generally covered to the extent of our remaining excess liability coverage.
Excess liability coverage—Transocean has excess liability coverage insurance, which also covers the rigs in our fleet, and allocates
to us the costs attributed to our fleet. At December 31, 2013, Transocean carried $820 million of commercial market excess liability
coverage, exclusive of deductibles and self-insured retention, noted below, which generally covers offshore risks such as personal
injury, third-party  property  claims,  and third-party  non-crew  claims,  including  wreck  removal  and  pollution.  Our  excess  liability
coverage  has  (1)  separate  $10  million  per  occurrence  deductibles  on  collision  liability  claims  and  (2)  separate  $5  million  per
occurrence  deductibles  on  crew  personal  injury  claims  and  on  other third-party  non-crew  claims.  Through  Transocean’s  wholly
owned captive insurance company, Transocean has retained the risk of the primary $50 million excess liability coverage. In addition,
Transocean generally has retained the risk for any liability losses in excess of $870 million.
Other  insurance  coverage—Transocean  carries  additional  insurance,  which  it  extends  to  our  operations.  At  December  31,  2013,
Transocean carried $100 million of additional insurance that generally covers expenses that would otherwise be assumed by the well
owner, such as costs to control the well, redrill expenses and pollution from the well. This additional insurance provides coverage for
such  expenses  in  circumstances  in  which  we  have  legal  or  contractual  liability  arising  from  our  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct.
Guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds—At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no guarantees, letters of credit or surety
bonds issued or outstanding.
Encumbered assets—Transocean  has  a  $900  million three-year secured revolving credit facility established under a bank credit
agreement dated October 25, 2012, that is scheduled to expire on October 25, 2015 (the “Transocean Three-Year Secured Revolving
Credit Facility”). Transocean’s borrowings under the Transocean Three-Year Secured Revolving Credit Facility are secured by three
of  its ultra-deepwater  floaters,  including  the ultra-deepwater  drillship Discoverer  Inspiration.  At  December  31,  2013  and  2012,
Transocean had no borrowings outstanding under the Transocean Three-Year Secured Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31,
2013  and  2012,  the  aggregate  carrying  amount  of  the ultra-deepwater  drillship Discoverer  Inspiration  was  $706  million  and
$726 million, respectively.
Note 7—Operating Segments, Geographic Analysis and Major Customers
Operating segments—We operate in a single operating segment for the provision of contract drilling services to our customers. The
location of our rigs and the allocation of our resources to build or upgrade rigs are determined by the activities and needs of our
customers.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
Geographic  analysis—For  the  years  ended  December  31,  2013  and  2012,  we  earned  100  percent  of  our  combined  operating
revenues in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, 100 percent of our assets were in the U.S.
Major  customers—For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2013,  Chevron  Corporation  and  BP  plc  accounted  for  approximately
67  percent  and  33  percent,  respectively,  of  our  combined  operating  revenues.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  Chevron
Corporation and BP accounted for approximately 68 percent and 32 percent, respectively, of our combined operating revenues.

(a) These amounts represent additions to property and equipment for which we had accrued a corresponding liability for settlement
(b)
with the Parent through our net investment.
In the year ended December 31, 2012, the Parent transferred certain equipment to Development Driller III from another of its
drilling units, and we recorded the non-cash capital addition with a corresponding entry to our net investment.
Note 9—Risk Concentration
Credit risk—Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily trade receivables. We derive
all of our revenues from services to two international oil companies. We are not aware of any significant credit risks related to our
customer base and do not generally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables.
Note 10—Related Party Transactions
Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc.—Under an existing master services agreement with Transocean Offshore Deepwater
Drilling,  Inc.  (“TODDI”),  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Transocean,  the  Predecessor  obtained  services  and  assistance  for  certain
activities,  including  accounting,  legal,  finance,  marketing,  treasury,  insurance,  global  procurement,  and  technical  services.  In  the
years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized costs of $35 million and $28 million, respectively, recorded in operating
and maintenance costs and expenses, for such services and assistance. In the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we paid
$38 million and $29 million, respectively, settled through our net investment, for materials and supplies purchased through TODDI’s
procurement services.
Also under the existing master services agreement, TODDI administered insurance coverage with and processed claims through
Transocean’s commercial market and captive insurance policies (see Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies). In the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $13 million and $14 million, respectively, recorded in operating and maintenance costs
and expenses, for the insurance costs allocated to us for our drilling rigs.
Table of Contents
F-29
TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC PREDECESSOR
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—continued
TODDI and its affiliates charged to us under the existing master services agreement for crew personnel provided to us to operate our
drilling rigs. In the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized costs of $91 million and $81 million, respectively,
recorded in operating and maintenance costs and expenses, for such personnel costs. In the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012, we recognized costs of $9 million and $8 million, respectively, recorded in operating and maintenance costs and expenses, for
the proportion of the benefit costs that covered the personnel supporting our operations.
All  three  of  our  drilling  units  are  equipped  with  Transocean’s  patented  dual-activity  technology.  Dual-activity  technology  employs
structures, equipment and techniques using two drilling stations within a dual derrick to perform drilling tasks. Dual-activity technology
allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner and reduces critical path activity,
improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling. We entered into license agreements with TODDI for the use of the
patented  technology  through  the  expiration  of  the  patents  in  May  2016.  Under  the  license  agreements,  we  paid  to  TODDI  an
aggregate  original  license  cost  of  $20  million,  recorded  in  other  assets.  In  the  years  ended  December  31,  2013  and  2012,  we
recognized  amortization  of  the  license  costs  of  $3  million,  recorded  in  operating  and  maintenance  costs  and  expenses.  At
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying amount of the deferred license cost was $7 million and $10 million, respectively. Under
the license agreements, we also pay to TODDI quarterly royalty fees of between 3 percent and 5 percent of revenues. In the years
ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized royalty fees of $19 million and $21 million, respectively, recorded in operating
and maintenance costs and expenses.
Note 11—Subsequent Events
Subsequent to December 31, 2013, we entered into credit agreements with a Transocean affiliate, establishing credit facilities with an
aggregate borrowing capacity of $300 million that will expire on March 31, 2017. We may borrow under the credit facilities at the
applicable U.S. federal rate as issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. As of May 7, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding
under the credit facilities.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Member of Transocean Partners LLC
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Transocean Partners LLC (the Company) as of April 25, 2014. This balance
sheet is the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this balance sheet based on
our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our
audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
In  our  opinion,  the  balance  sheet  referred  to  above  presents  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Transocean
Partners LLC at April 25, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

THIS SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF TRANSOCEAN PARTNERS LLC,
dated as of                     , 2014, is entered into by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company,
together with any other Persons who become Members in the Company or parties hereto as provided herein. In consideration of the
covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS
Section 1.1 Definitions. The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary, applied
to the terms used in this Agreement.
“Adjusted Operating Surplus” means, with respect to any period, Operating Surplus generated with respect to such period: (a) less
(i) the amount of any net increase in Working Capital Borrowings (or the Company’s proportionate share of any net increase in
Working Capital Borrowings in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) with respect to such period and (ii) the amount of
any net decrease in cash reserves for Operating Expenditures (or the Company’s proportionate share of any net decrease in cash
reserves for Operating Expenditures in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) with respect to such period not relating to
an Operating Expenditure made with respect to such period, and (b) plus (i) the amount of any net decrease in Working Capital
Borrowings (or the Company’s proportionate share of any net decrease in Working Capital Borrowings in the case of Subsidiaries that
are not wholly owned) with respect to such period; (ii) the amount of any net increase in cash reserves (or the Company’s
proportionate share of any net increase in cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) for Operating
Expenditures required by any debt instrument for the repayment of principal, interest or premium; and (iii) the amount of any net
decrease made in subsequent periods to cash reserves for Operating Expenditures initially established with respect to such period to
the extent such decrease results in a reduction in Adjusted Operating Surplus in subsequent periods pursuant to clause (a)(ii) above.
Adjusted Operating Surplus does not include that portion of Operating Surplus included in clause (a)(i) of the definition of Operating
Surplus. To the extent that disbursements made, cash received or cash reserves established, increased or reduced after the end of a
period are included in the determination of Operating Surplus for such period (as contemplated by the proviso in the definition of
“Operating Surplus”) such disbursements, cash receipts and changes in cash reserves shall be deemed to have occurred in such
period (and not in any future period) for purposes of calculating increases or decreases in Working Capital Borrowings or cash
reserves during such period.
“Affiliate” means (except with respect to Section 14.7), with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly through
one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Person in question. As used herein, the term
“control” means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
“Agreed Value” means the fair market value of the applicable property or other consideration at the time of contribution or distribution,
as the case may be, as determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall use such methods as it determines to be
appropriate to allocate the aggregate Agreed Value of Contributed Properties contributed to the Company Group in a single or
integrated transaction among each separate property on a basis proportional to the fair market value of each Contributed Property.
Table of Contents
A-1
“Agreement” means this Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Transocean Partners LLC, as it
may be amended, supplemented or restated from time to time.

provided in Section 7.2 and to vote on any other matters brought before the meeting in accordance with this Agreement.
“Appointed Directors” means the members of the Board of Directors appointed by the Transocean Member in accordance with the
provisions of Article VII.

a director, officer, manager, general partner or managing member or is, directly or indirectly, the owner of 20% or more of any class of
voting stock or other voting interest entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or other governing body of such entity; (b) any
trust or other estate in which such Person has at least a 20% beneficial interest or as to which such Person serves as trustee or in a
similar fiduciary capacity; and (c) any relative or spouse of such Person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same principal
residence as such Person.
“Audit Committee” means the audit committee of the Board of Directors, which shall be composed of a minimum of three members of
the Board of Directors then serving who meet the independence standards required of directors who serve on an audit committee of a
board of directors established by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and meet the
standards for audit committee composition established by the National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are listed or
admitted to trading.
“Available Cash” means, with respect to any Quarter ending prior to the Liquidation Date:
(a) the sum of (i) all cash and cash equivalents of the Company Group (or the Company’s proportionate share of cash and cash
equivalents in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) on hand at the end of such Quarter, (ii) if the Board of Directors so
determines, all or any portion of additional cash and cash equivalents of the Company Group (or the Company’s proportionate share
of cash and cash equivalents in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) on hand on the date of determination of Available
Cash with respect to such Quarter resulting from Working Capital Borrowings made subsequent to the end of such Quarter, and (iii) all
cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of Available Cash resulting from cash distributions received after the
end of such Quarter from any Group Member’s equity interest in any Person (other than a Subsidiary), which distributions are paid by
such Person in respect of operations conducted by such Person during such Quarter, less
(b) the amount of any cash reserves (or the Company’s proportionate share of cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not
wholly owned) established by the Board of Directors to (i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Company Group
(including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future debt service requirements of the Company Group)
subsequent to such Quarter, (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or
other agreement or obligation to which any Group Member is a party or by which it is bound or its assets are subject and (iii) provide
funds for distributions under Sections 6.2 or 6.3 in respect of any one or more of the next four Quarters; provided, however, that the
Board of Directors may not establish cash reserves pursuant to (iii) above if the effect of establishing such reserves would be that the
Company is unable to distribute the Minimum Quarterly Distribution on all Common Units, plus any Cumulative Common Unit
Arrearage on all Common Units, with respect to such Quarter; and, provided further, that disbursements made by a Group Member or
cash reserves established, increased or reduced after the end of such Quarter but on or before the date of determination of Available
Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be deemed to have been made, established, increased or reduced, for purposes of
determining Available Cash, within such Quarter if the Board of Directors so determines.

acquisition, construction, development, replacement or expansion of, or addition or improvement to, capital assets by such Person, in
each case if and to the extent such acquisition, construction, development, replacement, expansion, addition or improvement is made
to increase, over the long term, the operating capacity, asset base or operating income of the Company Group, in the case of clauses

with this initial contribution. In exchange for these Capital Contributions by the Initial Transocean Member to the Company, the

Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no Member shall have priority over any other Member either as
to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions.

of Membership Interests and Derivative Membership Interests pursuant to this Section 5.4, (ii) the conversion of the Combined Interest
into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) reflecting the admission of such additional Members in the books and records
of the Company as the Record Holder of such Membership Interest, and (iv) all additional issuances of Membership Interests and

Company, no Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance of any Membership
Interest, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter created. The Transocean Member shall have the right, which it may from
time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates, to purchase Membership Interests from the Company whenever, and on
the same terms that, the Company issues Membership Interests to Persons other than the Transocean Member and its Affiliates, to
the extent necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the Transocean Member and its Affiliates equal to that which existed
immediately prior to the issuance of such Membership Interests.
Section 5.7 Splits and Combinations.
(a) Subject to Sections 5.7(d) and 6.4 (dealing with adjustments of distribution levels), the Company may make a Pro Rata distribution
of Membership Interests to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Membership Interests so long as, after
any such event, each Member shall have the same
Table of Contents
A-23
Percentage Interest in the Company as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis (including any Common
Unit Arrearage or Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage) or stated as a number of Units are proportionately adjusted.
(b) Whenever such a Pro Rata distribution, subdivision or combination of Membership Interests is declared, the Board of Directors
shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at
least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice. The
Board of Directors also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Membership
Interests to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination. The Board of Directors
shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.
(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Company shall issue Certificates to the Record Holders
of Membership Interests as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Membership Interests held by such Record
Holders, or the Board of Directors may adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such
changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total number of Membership Interests Outstanding, the Company shall require,
as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder
immediately prior to such Record Date.
(d) The Company shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units. If a distribution,
subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for the provisions of this Section 5.7(d), each
fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit).

provided, further, that for any Quarter in which the application of the formula in this Section 6.2(a) would result in the holders of the
Common Units receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of Available Cash for such Quarter, then

provided, further, that for any Quarter in which the application of the formula in this Section 6.2(b) would result in the holders of the
Common Units receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of Available Cash for such Quarter, then
the distribution to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall be reduced, Pro Rata, to the extent necessary to cause the
aggregate distribution to the holders of the Common Units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of Available Cash for
such Quarter.
Section 6.3 Distributions of Available Cash from Capital Surplus. Available Cash that is distributed and deemed to be Capital Surplus

Common Units receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of Available Cash for such Quarter, then
the distribution to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall be reduced, Pro Rata, to the extent necessary to cause the
aggregate distribution to the holders of the Common Units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of Available Cash for
such Quarter.
Section 6.4 Adjustment of Target Distribution Levels. The Target Distributions, Common Unit Arrearages and Cumulative Common
Unit Arrearages shall be proportionately adjusted in the event of any distribution, combination or subdivision (whether effected by a
distribution payable in Units or otherwise) of Units or other Membership Interests in accordance with Section 5.7. In the event of a
distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be from Capital Surplus, the then applicable Target Distributions shall be reduced in
the same proportion that the distribution had to the fair market value of the Common Units prior to the announcement of the
distribution. If the Common Units are publicly traded on a National Securities Exchange, the fair market value will be the Current
Market Price before the announcement of the distribution. If the Common Units are not publicly traded, the fair market value will be

Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement, the Contribution Agreement, Master Services Agreements, the Credit Agreement, the Working
Capital Note Payable any Group Member Agreement of any other Group Member and the other agreements described in or filed as
exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement that are related to the transactions contemplated by the IPO Registration Statement; and
(ii) agrees that the execution, delivery or performance by the Company, the Board of Directors, the Transocean Member, any Group
Member or any Affiliate of any of them of this Agreement or any agreement authorized or permitted under this Agreement (including
the exercise by the Transocean Member or any Affiliate of the Transocean Member of the rights accorded pursuant to Article XV) shall
not constitute a breach by the Board of Directors or the Transocean Member of any duty that the Board of Directors or the Transocean
Member may owe the Company or the Non-Transocean Members or any other Persons under this Agreement (or any other

Section 7.2 The Board of Directors; Election and Appointment; Term; Manner of Acting.
(a) As of the Closing Date, the Board of Directors consists of the following three individuals, all of whom shall serve until the 2015
Annual Meeting and each of whom is an Elected Director: Esa Ikäheimonen, Kathleen S. McAllister and Glyn A. Barker. After the
Closing Date and prior to the 2015 Annual Meeting, (i) such Elected Directors may elect an additional Elected Director and (ii) the
Transocean Member may appoint three additional directors as Appointed Directors; provided, that the number of Elected Directors
must, immediately after such appointment, exceed the number of Appointed Directors. Following the 2015 Annual Meeting, the Board
of Directors shall consist of seven individuals, three of whom shall be Appointed Directors and four of whom shall be Elected
Directors.
Table of Contents
A-28
(b) Prior to the Transocean Classification Election Date, each director shall serve for a term ending on the next succeeding Annual
Meeting and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall serve until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his
earlier death, resignation or removal. The “Transocean Classification Election Date” shall occur upon the effectiveness of the notice
by the Transocean Member that it has elected to cause the Board of Directors to become a classified board as specified in this
Section 7.2(b). Such date shall be the date of receipt of such notice unless otherwise specified by the Transocean Member in such
notice to be a different date within 180 days following the date of receipt of such notice. Solely upon the written consent of the
Transocean Member, the following provisions set forth in this paragraph to classify the Board of Directors shall take place effective
upon and commencing as of the Transocean Classification Election Date. The Elected Directors shall be divided into three classes:
Class I, Class II and Class III. Each Elected Director shall serve for a term ending on the third succeeding Annual Meeting following
the Annual Meeting at which directors of that class were elected; provided, however, that the Elected Directors first designated as
Class I directors shall serve for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting next following the date of their designation as Class I directors,
the Elected Directors first designated as Class II directors shall serve for a term expiring at the second Annual Meeting next following
the date of their designation as Class II directors, and the Elected Directors first designated as Class III directors shall serve for a term
expiring at the third Annual Meeting next following the date of their designation as Class III directors. Each such Elected Director shall
hold office until the Annual Meeting at which that director’s term expires and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall serve until his
successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. To the extent practicable, the
determination of which directors shall initially serve in which class shall be made by the Board of Directors prior to the Transocean
Classification Election Date and such determination shall be made promptly upon the Transocean Member’s notice to the Board of
Directors that it intends to deliver a notice of election causing a Transocean Classification Election Date; however, if no such
determination has been made by such date, the determination will be made by the Board of Directors as soon as practicable after the
Transocean Classification Election Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board of Directors is authorized to assign
Elected Directors already in office to Class I, Class II and Class III.
(c) Any vacancy on the Board of Directors shall be filled in accordance with Section 7.6.
(d) The successors of the initial members of the Board of Directors shall be appointed or elected, as the case may be, as follows:
(i) the Appointed Directors shall be appointed by the Transocean Member; and
(ii) the Elected Directors shall be elected at an Annual Meeting, beginning with the 2015 Annual Meeting, by a plurality of the votes of
the Outstanding Common Units present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. From and after the effective date of
a request to the Company made by Non-Transocean Members owning 50% or more of the Outstanding Common Units (a
“Cumulative Voting Request”) that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of Elected Directors as described in this Section
7.2(d)(ii), all the holders of Common Units that are entitled to vote for Elected Directors shall be entitled at all elections of Elected
Directors to as many votes as shall equal the number of votes which (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) such holder would
be entitled to cast for the election of Elected Directors with respect to such holder’s Common Units multiplied by the number of
Elected Directors to be elected, and such holder may cast all of such votes for a single candidate for Elected Director or may distribute
them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them as such holder may see fit. The effective date of a Cumulative
Voting Request shall be the date of its receipt by the Company unless otherwise specified in such Cumulative Voting Request to be a
different date within 180 days following the date of receipt of such Cumulative Voting Request. At any election of Elected Directors
prior to the effective date of a Cumulative Voting Request, holders of Common Units receive one vote for each Common Unit.
(e) Each member of the Board of Directors appointed or elected, as the case may be, at an Annual Meeting shall hold office until the
next succeeding Annual Meeting (or after the Transocean Classification Election Date
Table of Contents
A-29
and following the division of the Elected Directors into classes pursuant to Section 7.2(b), until the third succeeding Annual Meeting)
and until his successor is duly elected or appointed, as the case may be, and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or
removal.
(f) Each member of the Board of Directors shall have one vote. The vote of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A majority of the members of the Board of
Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, but if less
than a quorum is present at a meeting, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors present at such meeting may adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
Section 7.3 Nominations of Elected Directors.
(a) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7.3 shall be eligible for election as,
and to serve as, Elected Directors.
(i) Nominations of persons for election as Elected Directors may be made only at a meeting of the Members at which Elected
Directors are to be elected (A) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (B) (if but only if the Board of Directors has determined
that Elected Directors shall be elected at such meeting) by any Non-Transocean Member or Group of Non-Transocean Members that
beneficially owns 10% or more of the Outstanding Common Units at the time of the giving of such Member’s or Group’s notice
provided for in this Section 7.3 and on the record date for the determination of Common Unitholders entitled to vote at such meeting,

whatsoever to any Group Member, any Member, or any other Persons who have acquired an interest in a Membership Interest or are

(including the Transocean Member) shall not be liable to the Company or other Group Member, to another Member or any other
Persons who have acquired an interest in a Membership Interest or are otherwise bound by this Agreement for breach of any fiduciary
or other duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise by reason of the fact that such Unrestricted Person (including the Transocean
Member) pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not communicate such
opportunity or information to the Company; provided, that such Unrestricted Person does not engage in such business or activity as a
result of using confidential or proprietary information provided by or on behalf of the Company to such Unrestricted Person which
confidential or proprietary information was designated in writing as confidential or proprietary and solely for the use of the Company
Group.

amounts as the Transocean Member and the Board of Directors may determine; provided, however, that in any such case the lending
party may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged the borrowing party or impose
terms less favorable to the borrowing party than would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party by unrelated lenders on
comparable loans made on an arm’s-length basis (without reference to the lending party’s financial abilities or guarantees), all as
determined by the Transocean Member and the Board of Directors. The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any

to constitute a breach of any duty, expressed or implied, of the Transocean Member or its Affiliates or the Board of Directors to the
Company or the Non-Transocean Members by reason of the fact that the purpose or effect of such borrowing is directly or indirectly to
(i) enable distributions to the Transocean Member or its Affiliates (including in their capacities as Non-Transocean Members) to
exceed the Transocean Member’s Percentage Interest of the total amount distributed to all members or (ii) hasten the expiration of the
Subordination Period or the conversion of any Subordinated Units into Common Units.

completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal
or informal and including appeals in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise,
by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there
has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter
for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.15, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in
fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful;
provided, further, that no indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.15 shall be available to the Transocean Member or its Affiliates
(other than a Group Member) with respect to its or their obligations incurred pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Omnibus
Agreement or the Contribution Agreement. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.15 shall be made only out of the assets of
the Company, it being agreed that the Transocean Member shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Company to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by the Marshall Islands Act, expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an
Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section 7.15(a) in appearing at, participating in or defending any claim, demand, action,
suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Company prior to a final and non-appealable determination that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Company of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this
Section 7.15.
(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.15 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled
under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Non-Transocean Member Interests, as a matter of law or
otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee’s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity (including any
capacity under the Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee.
(d) The Company may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the Transocean Member or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on
behalf of the Board of Directors and the Transocean Member, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the Board of Directors shall
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the
Company’s activities or such Person’s activities on behalf of the Company, regardless of whether the Company would have the
power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement or law.
(e) For purposes of this Section 7.15, the Company shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an
employee benefit plan whenever the performance by the Indemnitee of its duties to the Company also imposes duties on, or
otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute “fines” within the meaning of Section 7.15(a); and
action taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose
reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose
that is in the best interests of the Company.
(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Non-Transocean Members to personal liability by reason of the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Agreement.
(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 7.15 because the Indemnitee had an
interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of
this Agreement.

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.15 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and
administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.
(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.15 or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair
the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company, nor the obligations of the Company to indemnify
any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.15 as in effect immediately prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.
Section 7.16 Liability of Indemnitees.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, under the Marshall Islands
Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity, to the fullest extent allowed by law, no Indemnitee or any of its employees or
Persons acting on its behalf shall be liable for monetary damages to the Company, the Members or any other Persons who have
acquired an interest in a Membership Interest or are otherwise bound by this Agreement, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred, of
any kind or character, as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee or any of its employees or Persons acting on its behalf
unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of
the matter in question, the Indemnitee or any of its employees or Persons acting on its behalf acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or
willful misconduct and, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that conduct was unlawful.
(b) Subject to their obligations and duties as members of the Board of Directors set forth in Section 7.1(a), members of the Board of
Directors may exercise any of the powers granted to them and perform any of the duties imposed upon them hereunder either directly
or by or through its agents, and the members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on
the part of any such agent appointed by the Board of Directors if such appointment was not made in bad faith.
(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee or any of its employees or Persons acting on its behalf has duties (including
fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Company, to the Members, or to any other Persons who have acquired an
interest in a Membership Interest or are otherwise bound by this Agreement, the Transocean Member and any other Indemnitee or
any of its employees or Persons acting on its behalf acting in connection with the Company’s business or affairs shall not be liable to
the Company, to any Member or to any other Persons who have acquired an interest in a Membership Interest or are otherwise bound
by this Agreement for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.
(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.16 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any
way affect the limitations on the liability of an Indemnitee or any of its employees or Persons acting on its behalf under this Section
7.16 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters
occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be
asserted.
Section 7.17 Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and Modification of Duties.
(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest
exists or arises between the Transocean Member or any of its Affiliates or Associates, or any Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the
Company, any Group Member or any Member, on the other, any resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest
shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Members, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member
Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the
Table of Contents
A-39
resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii) approved by the vote of a
majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units owned by the Transocean Member and its Affiliates),
(iii) determined by the Board of Directors to be on terms no less favorable to the Company than those generally being provided to or
available from unrelated third parties or (iv) determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and reasonable to the Company, taking
into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly
favorable or advantageous to the Company). The Board of Directors may but shall not be required in connection with the resolution of
such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval or Unitholder approval of such resolution, and the Board of Directors may also adopt
a resolution or course of action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder approval. Whenever the Board of Directors
makes a determination to refer or not to refer any potential conflict of interest to the Conflicts Committee for Special Approval or to
seek or not to seek Unitholder approval, then the Board of Directors shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to make
such determination free of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) or obligation whatsoever to the Company or any Member, and the
Board of Directors shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard or
duty imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under Marshall
Islands law or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity, and the Board of Directors in making such determination shall be
permitted to do so in its sole and absolute discretion. If Special Approval is sought or obtained, then, it shall be presumed that, in
making its decision, the Conflicts Committee acted in good faith, and if neither Special Approval nor Unitholder approval is sought or
obtained and the Board of Directors determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict of interest
satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above or that a director satisfies the eligibility requirements to be a
member of the Conflicts Committee, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board of Directors, acted in good faith.
In any proceeding brought by any Member or by or on behalf of such Member or any other Member or the Company challenging any
action by the Conflicts Committee with respect to any matter referred to the Conflicts Committee for Special Approval by the Board of
Directors, any action by the Board of Directors in determining whether the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict
of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding
shall have the burden of overcoming such presumption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty
otherwise existing at law or equity, the existence of the conflicts of interest described in the IPO Registration Statement and any
actions of the Transocean Member or any of its Affiliates or Associates or any other Indemnitee taken in connection therewith are
hereby approved by all Members and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or of any duty.
(b) Whenever the Board of Directors or any committee thereof (including the Conflicts Committee) or any of the Company’s Officers
makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any Affiliate or Associate of the Company or any other
Indemnitee causes the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, or any Officer to do so, whether under this Agreement, any Group
Member Agreement or any other agreement, then, unless another express standard is provided for in this Agreement, the Board of
Directors, such committee or such Officer, or such Affiliate, Associate or Indemnitee causing the Board of Directors, such committee or
such Officer to do so, shall make such determination or take or decline to take such other action in good faith and shall not be subject
to any other or different duties or standards (including fiduciary duties or standards) imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under Marshall Islands law or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity.
A determination or other action or inaction will conclusively be deemed to be in “good faith” for all purposes of this Agreement if the
Person or Persons making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action subjectively believe that the
determination or other action or inaction is in, or not adverse to, the best interests of the Company Group; provided, however, that if
the Board of Directors is making a determination or taking or declining to take an action pursuant to clause (iii) or clause (iv) of the first
sentence of Section 7.17(a), then in lieu thereof, such determination or other action or inaction will conclusively be deemed to be in
“good faith” for all purposes of this Agreement if the members of the Board of Directors making such determination or taking or
declining to take such other action subjectively believe that the determination or other action or inaction meets the standard set forth in
clause (iii) or clause (iv) of the first sentence of Section 7.17(a), as applicable. Further, the Company’s Officers and Directors shall be
Table of Contents
A-40
deemed to be acting in good faith if they decline to cause the Company to undertake a transaction that the Company’s Officers and
Directors believe is a transaction that would likely have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Transocean Member or its
Affiliates to comply with the terms of the debt of the Transocean Member or its Affiliates.
(c) Whenever the Transocean Member makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action in its capacity as a
Member, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the Transocean Member, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled to make
such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) or obligation existing at
law, in equity or otherwise whatsoever to the Company or any Member, any Record Holder, any Person who acquires an interest in a
Membership Interest or any Person otherwise bound by this Agreement, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Transocean
Member, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not be required to act in good faith or in the best interests of the Company or any
Member, any Record Holder, any Person who acquires an interest in a Membership Interest or any other Person or pursuant to any
other standard or duty imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or
under the Marshall Islands Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Transocean Member and its Affiliates shall have no duty or
obligation, express or implied, to (i) approve the sale or other disposition of any asset of the Company Group (if such approval is
required pursuant to Section 7.11) or (ii) permit any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the Transocean Member and its
Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination
by the Transocean Member or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall, in each case, be at its option.
(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or expressly required by Marshall Islands law, neither the Board of Directors nor
any other Indemnitee shall have any duties (including fiduciary duties), obligations or liabilities existing at law, in equity or otherwise
whatsoever to the Company, any Member, any Person who acquires an interest in a Membership Interest or any other Person who
becomes bound by this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or otherwise modify the duties
and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, of the Board of Directors or any other Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are
agreed by the Members to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Board of Directors or such other Indemnitee.
(f) The Unitholders hereby authorize the Board of Directors, on behalf of the Company as a partner or member of a Group Member, to
approve of actions by the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar to those actions permitted to be taken
by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 7.17.
Section 7.18 Other Matters Concerning the Board of Directors.
(a) The Board of Directors may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
(b) The Board of Directors may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers
and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the advice or opinion
(including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the Board of Directors reasonably believes to be within such
Person’s professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in
accordance with such advice or opinion.

A-41
(c) The Transocean Member shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly
authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers of the Company.
Section 7.19 Purchase or Sale of Membership Interests. The Board of Directors may cause the Company to purchase or otherwise
acquire Membership Interests or Derivative Membership Interests; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may not cause any
Group Member to purchase Subordinated Units during the Subordination Period. As long as Membership Interests are held by any
Group Member, such Membership Interests shall not be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided
herein. The Transocean Member or any Affiliate of the Transocean Member may purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise
dispose of Membership Interests for its own account, subject to the provisions of Articles IV and X.
Section 7.20 Registration Rights of the Transocean Member and its Affiliates.
(a) Demand Registration. Upon receipt of a Notice from any Holder or Holders that hold at least 25% of the then Outstanding
Registrable Securities at any time after the 180th day after the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the Commission as promptly
as reasonably practicable a registration statement under the Securities Act (each, a “Registration Statement”) providing for the resale
of the Registrable Securities identified in such Notice, which may, at the option of the Holder giving such Notice, be a Registration
Statement that provides for the resale of the Registrable Securities from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.
The Company shall notify all Holders of such Notice at least 15 days prior to the filing date. The Company shall not be required
pursuant to this Section 7.20(a) to file more than one Registration Statement in any 12-month period nor to file more than six
Registration Statements in the aggregate. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration
Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the initial filing of the Registration Statement and to remain
effective and available for the resale of the Registrable Securities by the Selling Holders named therein until the earlier of (i) six
months following such Registration Statement’s effective date and (ii) the date on which all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold. In the event one or more Holders request in a Notice to dispose of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Registration Statement in an Underwritten Offering and such Holder or Holders reasonably anticipate gross proceeds
from such Underwritten Offering of at least $30.0 million in the aggregate, the Company shall retain underwriters that are reasonably
acceptable to such Selling Holders in order to permit such Selling Holders to effect such disposition through an Underwritten Offering;
provided the Company shall have the exclusive right to select the bookrunning managers. The Company and such Selling Holders
shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form that is reasonably acceptable to the Company and take all reasonable
actions as are requested by the managing underwriters to facilitate the Underwritten Offering and sale of Registrable Securities
therein, including indemnification of the underwriters and representations and covenants, in each case upon customary terms. No
Holder may participate in the Underwritten Offering unless it agrees to sell its Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement on the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement and completes and delivers all necessary documents and
information reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. In the event that the managing underwriter of such
Underwritten Offering advises the Company and the Holder in writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all or some Registrable
Securities would adversely and materially affect the timing or success of the Underwritten Offering, the amount of Registrable
Securities that each Selling Holder requested be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced on a Pro Rata basis to the
aggregate amount that the managing underwriter deems will not have such material and adverse effect. Any Holder may withdraw
from such Underwritten Offering by notice to the Company and the managing underwriter; provided such notice is delivered prior to
the launch of such Underwritten Offering.
(b) Piggyback Registration. At any time after the 180th day after the Closing Date, if the Company shall propose to file a Registration
Statement (other than pursuant to a demand made pursuant to Section 7.20(a)) for an offering of Membership Interests for cash (other
than an offering relating solely to an employee benefit plan, an offering relating to a transaction on Form S-4 or an offering on any
registration statement that does not permit
Table of Contents
A-42
secondary sales), the Company shall notify all Holders of such proposal at least five Business Days before the proposed filing date.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to include such number of Registrable Securities held by any Holder in such
Registration Statement as each Holder shall request in a Notice received by the Company within two Business Days of such Holder’s
receipt of the notice from the Company. If the Registration Statement about which the Company gives notice under this Section
7.20(b) is for an Underwritten Offering, then any Holder’s ability to include its desired amount of Registrable Securities in such
Registration Statement shall be conditioned on such Holder’s inclusion of all such Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering;
provided, however, that, in the event that the managing underwriter of such Underwritten Offering advises the Company and the
Holder in writing that in its opinion the inclusion of all or some Registrable Securities would adversely and materially affect the timing
or success of the Underwritten Offering, the amount of Registrable Securities that each Selling Holder requested be included in such
Underwritten Offering shall be reduced on a Pro Rata basis to the aggregate amount that the managing underwriter deems will not
have such material and adverse effect. In connection with any such Underwritten Offering, the Company and the Selling Holders
involved shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form that is reasonably acceptable to the Company and take all
reasonable actions as are requested by the managing underwriters to facilitate the Underwritten Offering and sale of Membership
Interests therein, including indemnification of the underwriters and representations and covenants, in each case upon customary
terms. No Holder may participate in the Underwritten Offering unless it agrees to sell its Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement on the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement and completes and delivers all necessary
documents and information reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. Any Holder may withdraw from
such Underwritten Offering by notice to the Company and the managing underwriter; provided such notice is delivered prior to the
launch of such Underwritten Offering. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any Registration Statement or
Underwritten Offering initiated by it under this Section 7.20(b) prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement or the pricing
date of the Underwritten Offering, as applicable.
(c) Sale Procedures. In connection with its obligations under this Section 7.20, the Company shall:
(i) furnish to each Selling Holder (A) as far in advance as reasonably practicable before filing a Registration Statement or any
supplement or amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents proposed to be filed
(including exhibits and each document incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and regulations of
the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder
and its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the corrections reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with
respect to such information prior to filing a Registration Statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (B) such number of
copies of such Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such
Persons may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company will not have any obligation to provide any document pursuant to
clause (B) hereof that is available on the Commission’s website;
(ii) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering,
the managing underwriter, shall reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company will not be required to qualify generally to
transact business in any jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would subject it to general
service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;
(iii) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (A) the filing of a Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement to be used in connection
therewith, or any amendment or supplement thereto, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto, when the
Table of Contents
A-43
same has become effective; and (B) any written comments from the Commission with respect to any Registration Statement or any
document incorporated by reference therein and any written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to a
Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;
(iv) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (A) the occurrence of any event or existence of any fact (but not a description of such event or fact) as a result of
which the prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (in the case of the prospectus contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made);
(B) the issuance or threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement,
or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; or (C) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any
jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, subject to Section 7.20(f), the Company agrees to, as promptly as practicable,
amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus
supplement does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and to take such other
reasonable action as is necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto; and
(v) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the
underwriters, if any, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities or is otherwise customary in
connection with the registration, underwriting or sale of securities, including the provision of comfort letters, legal opinions, lock-up
agreements by the Company and its officers and directors and assistance in road shows, marketing and due diligence sessions, as
are customary in such securities offerings.
(d) Suspension. Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 7.20(c)(iv), shall forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus
supplement until such Selling Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by such
subsection or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of
any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by reference in the prospectus.
(e) Expenses. Except as set forth in an underwriting agreement for the applicable Underwritten Offering or as otherwise agreed
between a Selling Holder and the Company, all costs and expenses of a Registration Statement filed or an Underwritten Offering that
includes Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 7.20 (other than underwriting discounts and commissions on Registrable
Securities and fees and expenses of counsel and advisors to Selling Holders) shall be paid by the Company.
(f) Delay Right. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Board of Directors determines that the Company’s compliance
with its obligations in this Section 7.20 would be detrimental to the Company because such registration would (x) materially interfere
with a significant acquisition, merger, disposition, reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Company, (y) require
premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or
(z) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then the Company shall have the right
to postpone compliance with such obligations for a period of not more than six months; provided, however, that such right may not be
exercised more than twice in any 24-month period.
(g) Indemnification.
(i) In addition to and not in limitation of the Company’s obligation under Section 7.15, the Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law but subject to the limitations expressly provided in this
A-44
Table of Contents
Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder, its officers, directors and each Person who controls the Selling Holder
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) and any agent thereof (collectively, “Indemnified Persons”) from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties,
interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, under the Securities Act or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this Section 7.20(g) as a “Claim” and in the plural as
“Claims”) based upon, arising out of or resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained
in any Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus under which any Registrable
Securities were registered or sold by such Selling Holder under the Securities Act, or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person to the extent that any such Claim
arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Selling Holder specifically for use in the
preparation thereof.
(ii) Each Selling Holder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Transocean
Member, the Officers and Directors and each Person who controls the Company or the Transocean Member (within the meaning of
the Securities Act) and any agent thereof to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Selling Holders, but
only with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for
inclusion in such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or free writing prospectus.
(iii) The provisions of this Section 7.20(g) shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnified Person may be entitled under
law, equity, contract or otherwise.
(h) Specific Performance. Damages in the event of breach of Section 7.20 by the Company or any Holder may be difficult, if not
impossible, to ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that the Company and each Holder, in addition to and without limiting any other
remedy or right it may have, will have the right to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction,
enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and the Company and each Holder hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of
the court to grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this right will not preclude any such Person from
pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or in equity that such Person may have.
Section 7.21 Reliance by Third Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the
Company shall be entitled to assume that the Board of Directors and any Officer authorized by the Board of Directors to act on behalf
of and in the name of the Company has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets
of the Company and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the Company, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with
the Board of Directors or any such Officer as if it were the Company’s sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each
Member, each other Person who acquires an interest in a Membership Interest and each other Person who becomes bound by this
Agreement hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or
disaffirm any action of the Board of Directors or any such Officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person
dealing with the Board of Directors or any such Officer or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement
have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act or action of the Board of Directors or any such
Officer or its representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the Company by the
Board of Directors, the Officers or representatives of the Company authorized by the Board of Directors shall be conclusive evidence
in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at
Table of Contents
A-45
the time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (b) the
Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on
behalf of the Company and (c) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Company.
ARTICLE VIII
BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS

Person has executed and delivered such other documents or instruments as may be required to effect such admission.

The Members hereby agree that only the Events of
Table of Contents
A-48
Withdrawal described in this Section 11.1 shall result in the withdrawal of the Transocean Member from the Company. When used in
this Agreement, “withdrawal” has the same meaning as “resignation” as established in the Marshall Islands Act.
(b) Withdrawal of the Transocean Member from the Company upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement under the following circumstances:
(i) at any time during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight, prevailing Eastern Time, on June 30,
2024, the Transocean Member voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days’ advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Non-
Transocean Members, such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in the notice; provided, however, that prior to the effective
date of such withdrawal, the withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units
(excluding Common Units held by the Transocean Member and its Affiliates);
(ii) at any time after 12:00 midnight, prevailing Eastern Time, on June 30, 2024, the Transocean Member voluntarily withdraws by
giving at least 90 days’ advance notice to the Unitholders, such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in such notice;

90 days’ advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Non- Transocean Members, such withdrawal to take effect on the date
specified in the notice, if at the time such notice is given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the Transocean Member and its
Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the Outstanding Units. If the Transocean Member gives a notice of
withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), the holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, elect a
successor Transocean Member. If, prior to the effective date of the Transocean Member’s withdrawal, a successor is not selected by
the Unitholders as provided herein, the Company shall be dissolved in accordance with Section 12.1 unless the business of the
Company is continued pursuant to Section 12.2. Any successor Transocean Member elected in accordance with the terms of this
Section 11.1 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.3.
Section 11.2 Removal of the Transocean Member. The Transocean Member may be removed as the Transocean Member if such
removal is approved by the Unitholders holding at least 66 2⁄3% of the Outstanding Units (including Units held by the Transocean
Member and its Affiliates), voting as a single class. Any such action by such holders or the Board of Directors for removal of the
Transocean Member must also provide for the election of a successor Transocean Member by a Unit Majority. Such removal shall be
effective immediately following the admission of a successor Transocean Member pursuant to Section 10.3. Any successor
Transocean Member elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.3.
Section 11.3 Interest of Departing Transocean Member and Successor Transocean Member.
(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the Transocean Member under circumstances where such withdrawal does not violate this
Agreement or (ii) removal of the Transocean Member by the holders of Outstanding Units under circumstances where Cause does not
exist, if the successor Transocean Member is elected in accordance with the terms of Sections 11.1 or 11.2, (A) the Departing
Transocean Member shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the departure of such Departing Transocean
Member, to require its successor to purchase its Transocean Member Interest and its Incentive Distribution Rights (collectively, the
“Combined Interest”) in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such amount to be
determined and payable as of the effective date of its departure and (B) the other holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, if any,
shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the departure of such Departing Transocean Member, to require such
successor to purchase such holders’ Incentive
Table of Contents
A-49
Distribution Rights in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such Incentive Distribution Rights, such
amount to be determined and payable as of the effective date of the Departing Transocean Member’s departure. If the Transocean
Member is removed by the Unitholders under circumstances where Cause exists or if the Transocean Member withdraws under
circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a successor Transocean Member is elected in accordance with
the terms of Sections 11.1 or 11.2 (or if the business of the Company is continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the successor
Transocean Member is not the former Transocean Member), such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective
date of the departure of such Departing Transocean Member (or, in the event the business of the Company is continued, prior to the
date the business of the Company is continued), to purchase the Combined Interest in exchange for an amount in cash equal to such
fair market value of such Combined Interest of the Departing Transocean Member. In either event, the Departing Transocean Member
shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due such Departing Transocean Member pursuant to Section 7.12, including any
employee-related liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the termination of any employees employed
by the Departing Transocean Member or its Affiliates (other than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Company or the other
Group Members.
For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of the Departing Transocean Member’s Combined Interest and the value of
the Incentive Distribution Rights held by holders other than the Departing Transocean Member shall be determined by agreement
between the Departing Transocean Member and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the effective date of such
Departing Transocean Member’s departure, by an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the
Departing Transocean Member and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on other experts, and the determination of which shall be
conclusive as to such matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or other independent expert
within 45 days after the effective date of such departure, then the Departing Transocean Member shall designate an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert, the Departing Transocean Member’s successor shall designate an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment
banking firm or independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert shall determine the
fair market value of the Combined Interest of the Departing Transocean Member and the value of the Incentive Distribution Rights
held by holders other than the Departing Transocean Member. In making its determination, such third independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert may consider the then current trading price of Units on any National Securities Exchange on
which Units are then listed or admitted to trading, the value of the Company’s assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing
Transocean Member and other factors it may deem relevant.
(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in Section 11.3(a), the Departing Transocean Member (or its
transferee) shall become a Non-Transocean Member and its Combined Interest shall be converted into Common Units pursuant to a
valuation made by an investment banking firm or other independent expert selected pursuant to Section 11.3(a), without reduction in
such Membership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of the admission of its successor). For purposes of this
Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest of the Departing Transocean Member to Common Units will be characterized as if
the Departing Transocean Member (or its transferee) contributed its Combined Interest to the Company in exchange for the newly
issued Common Units.
Section 11.4 Termination of Subordination Period, Conversion of Subordinated Units and Extinguishment of Cumulative Common
Unit Arrearages. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, if the Transocean Member is removed as a member of the
Company under circumstances where Cause does not exist and no Units held by the Transocean Member and its Affiliates are voted
in favor of such removal, (i) the Subordination Period will end and all Subordinated Units will immediately and automatically convert
into Common Units on a one-for-one basis, (ii) all Cumulative Common Unit Arrearages on the Common Units will be extinguished,
(iii) the Transocean Member will have the right to convert its Transocean Member Interest and its Incentive Distribution Rights into
Common Units or to receive cash in exchange therefor, as provided in Section 11.3 and
Table of Contents
A-50
(iv) the other holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, if any, will have the right to convert their Incentive Distribution Rights into
Common Units or to receive cash in exchange therefor, as provided in Section 11.3.
Section 11.5 Withdrawal of Non-Transocean Members. No Non-Transocean Member shall have any right to withdraw from the
Company; provided, however, that when a transferee of a Member’s Non-Transocean Member Interest becomes a Record Holder of
the Non-Transocean Member Interest so transferred, such transferring Non-Transocean Member shall cease to be a Member with
respect to the Non-Transocean Member Interest so transferred.
ARTICLE XII

Section 12.1 Dissolution. The Company shall not be dissolved by the admission of additional Non-Transocean Members or by the
admission of a successor or additional Transocean Member in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the removal or
withdrawal of the Transocean Member, if a successor Transocean Member is elected pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2, the Company
shall not be dissolved and the Board of Directors shall continue the business of the Company. Subject to Section 12.2, the Company
shall dissolve and its affairs shall be wound up, upon:

provided in Section 11.2 and such successor is admitted to the Company pursuant to Section 10.3.
Section 12.2 Continuation of the Business of the Company After Dissolution. Upon (a) dissolution of the Company following an Event
of Withdrawal caused by the withdrawal or removal of the Transocean Member as provided in Sections 11.1(a)(i) or 11.1(a)(iii) and
the failure of the Members to select a successor to such Departing Transocean Member pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2, then within
90 days thereafter, or (b) dissolution of the Company upon an event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in
Sections 11.1(a)(iv), 11.1(a)(v) or 11.1(a)(vi), then, to the maximum extent permitted by the Marshall Islands Act, within 180 days
thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect in writing to continue the business of the Company on the same terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement by appointing, effective as of the date of the Event of Withdrawal, as a successor Transocean
Member a Person approved by the holders of a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable time period as set
forth above, the Company shall dissolve and conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made,
then:
(i) the Company shall continue without dissolution unless earlier dissolved in accordance with this Article XII;
(ii) if the successor Transocean Member is not the former Transocean Member, then the interest of the former Transocean Member
shall be treated in the manner provided in Section 11.3; and
(iii) the successor Transocean Member shall be admitted to the Company as Transocean Member, effective as of the Event of
Withdrawal, by agreeing in writing to be bound by this Agreement.

Section 12.3 Liquidator. Upon dissolution of the Company, unless the business of the Company is continued pursuant to Section
12.2, the Board of Directors shall select one or more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the Transocean
Member) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units, voting as a single class. The Liquidator (if other than the Transocean Member)
shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days’ prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of
removal approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units, voting as a single
class. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed
to all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by the holders of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units, voting as a single class. The right to approve a successor or
substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator
approved in the manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this Article XII, the Liquidator approved in the manner
provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers
conferred upon the Board of Directors and the Transocean Member under the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the
applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in
Section 7.11) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the period of
time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the Company as provided for herein.
Section 12.4 Liquidation. The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Company, discharge its liabilities, and
otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the Liquidator, subject to the Marshall Islands Act
and the following:
(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Members on such terms as the
Liquidator and such Member or Members may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the Member receiving the property shall be
deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c) to have received cash equal to its fair market value, and contemporaneously therewith,
appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Members. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the
Company’s assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Company’s assets
would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Members. The Liquidator may distribute the Company’s assets, in whole or in
part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Members.
(b) The Liquidator shall first satisfy the liabilities of the Company. Liabilities of the Company include amounts owed to the Liquidator
as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of Section 12.3) and amounts to Members otherwise than in
respect of their distribution rights under Article VI. With respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is
otherwise not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it deems appropriate or establish a
reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as
additional liquidation proceeds.
(c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in this Section 12.4 shall be distributed as
follows:
(i) If the Current Market Price of the Common Units as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed
liquidation exceeds the Unrecovered Capital for a Common Unit plus the Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage:
(A) First, to all the Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, until there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then
Outstanding an amount equal to such Current Market Price of a Common Unit;
Table of Contents
A-52
(B) Second, to all Unitholders holding Subordinated Units, Pro Rata, until there has been distributed in respect of each Subordinated
Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to such Current Market Price of a Common Unit; and
(C) Thereafter, (x) 50% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata; and (y) 50% to all Unitholders, Pro Rata;
(ii) If the Current Market Price of the Common Units as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed
liquidation is equal to or less than the Unrecovered Capital for a Common Unit plus the Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage:
(A) First, to all the Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, until there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then
Outstanding an amount equal to the Unrecovered Capital for a Common Unit;
(B) Second, to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, until there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then
Outstanding an amount equal to the Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage;
(C) Third, to all Unitholders holding Subordinated Units, Pro Rata, until there has been distributed in respect of each Subordinated
Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the Unrecovered Capital for a Common Unit (as calculated prior to the distribution specified
in clause (ii)(A) above); and
(D) Thereafter, (x) 50% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata; and (y) 50% to all Unitholders, Pro Rata.
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the application of the formula in Sections 12.4(c)(i) or 12.4(c)(ii) would result in the holders of
Common Units receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation, then the application of the
proceeds of liquidation to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall be reduced, Pro Rata, to the extent necessary to cause
the aggregate distribution to the holders of Common Units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of liquidation proceeds.
Section 12.5 Cancellation of Certificate of Formation. Upon the completion of the distribution of Company cash and property as
provided in Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the Company, the Certificate of Formation and all qualifications of the
Company as a foreign limited liability company in jurisdictions other than the Marshall Islands shall be canceled and such other
actions as may be necessary to terminate the Company shall be taken.
Section 12.6 Return of Contributions. The Transocean Member shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to
contribute or loan any monies or property to the Company to enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the Non-
Transocean Members or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely
from Company assets.
Section 12.7 Waiver of Partition. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Member hereby waives any right to partition of the
Company property.

Section 13.2 Amendment Procedures. Except as provided in Sections 13.1 and 13.3, all amendments to this Agreement shall be
made in accordance with the following requirements. Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed only by, or with the written
consent of, the Board of Directors; provided, however, without limiting the generality of Section 2.4, that the Board of Directors shall
have no duty or obligation to propose any amendment to this Agreement and may decline to do so free of any fiduciary duty or
obligation whatsoever to the Company or any Member, any Record Holder or any other Person and, in declining to propose an
amendment, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law shall not be required to act in good faith or in the best interests of the
Company or any Member, any Record Holder or any other Person or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement
(including pursuant to Section 7.17(b)), any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the
Marshall Islands Act or any other law, rule or regulation. A proposed amendment shall be effective upon its approval by the Board of
Directors, the Transocean Member and the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a greater or different percentage is required under this
Agreement or by the Marshall Islands Act. Each proposed amendment that requires the approval of the holders of a specified
percentage of Outstanding Units shall be set forth in a writing that contains the text of the proposed amendment. If such an
amendment is proposed, the Board of Directors shall seek the written approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or call
a meeting of the Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment. The Board of Directors shall notify all Record
Holders upon final adoption of any such proposed amendments. The Board of Directors shall be deemed to have notified all Record
Holders as required hereby if it has either (i) filed such amendment with the Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis

publicly available website maintained by the Company.
Section 13.3 Amendment Requirements.
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 (other than Section 13.1(d)(iv)) and Section 13.2, no provision of this Agreement
that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units (including Units deemed owned by the Transocean Member and its Affiliates)
required to take any action shall be amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would have the effect of
(i) in the case of any provision of this Agreement other than Section 11.2 or Section 13.4, reducing such percentage or (ii) in the case
of Section 11.2 or Section 13.4, increasing such percentage, unless such amendment is approved by the written consent or the
affirmative vote of holders of Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not less than the voting requirement
sought to be reduced or increased, as applicable.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any
Non-Transocean Member without its consent, unless such enlargement shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of an
amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c) or (ii) enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or
reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to, the Transocean Member or any of its Affiliates
without its consent, which consent may be given or withheld at its option.
(c) Except as provided in Section 13.1 or Section 14.3, any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or
preferences of any type or class of Membership Interests in relation to other classes of Membership Interests must be approved by the
holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding Membership Interests of the type or class affected. If the Board of Directors
determines an amendment does not satisfy the requirements of Section 13.1(d)(i) because it adversely affects one or more classes of
Membership Interests, as compared to other classes of Membership Interests, in any material respect, such amendment shall only be
required to be approved by the adversely affected class or classes.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except as otherwise
provided by Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the

not affect the limited liability of any Non-Transocean Member under applicable law.

business.

Section 13.6 Record Date. For purposes of determining the Non-Transocean Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
the Non-Transocean Members or to give approvals without a meeting as provided in Section 13.11, the Board of Directors may set a

conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or
admitted to trading or U.S. federal securities laws, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National
Securities Exchange or U.S. federal securities laws shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the
date by which Non-Transocean Members are requested in writing by the Board of Directors to give such approvals. If the Board of
Directors does not set a Record Date, then (a) the Record Date for determining the Non-Transocean Members entitled to notice of or
to vote at a meeting of the Non-Transocean Members shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, and (b) the Record Date for determining the Non-Transocean Members entitled to give approvals without a meeting
shall be the date the first written approval is deposited with the Company in care of the Board of Directors in accordance with Section
13.11.
Section 13.7 Postponement and Adjournment. Prior to the date upon which any meeting of Members is to be held, the Board of
Directors may postpone such meeting one or more times for any reason by giving notice to each Member entitled to vote at the
meeting so postponed of the place, date and hour at which such meeting would be held. Such notice shall be given not fewer than
two days before the date of such meeting and otherwise in accordance with this Article XIII. When a meeting is postponed, a new
Record Date need not be fixed unless the aggregate amount of such postponement shall be for more than 45 days after the original
meeting date. Any meeting of Members may be adjourned by the Board of Directors one or more times for any reason, including the
failure of a quorum to be present at the meeting with respect to any proposal or the failure of any proposal to receive sufficient votes
for approval. No vote of the Members shall be required for any adjournment. A meeting of Members may be adjourned by the Board of
Directors as to one or more proposals regardless of whether action has been taken on other matters. When a meeting is adjourned to
another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time and
place thereof are
Table of Contents
A-57
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
adjourned meeting, the Company may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the
adjournment is for more than 45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given in accordance with this Article XIII.
Section 13.8 Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes. The transactions of any meeting of Non-Transocean
Members, however called and noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a meeting duly held after regular
call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy. Attendance of a Non-Transocean Member at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Non-Transocean Member attends the meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened;
and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of matters required to be included
in the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting.
Section 13.9 Quorum and Voting.
(a) The holders of 33 1/3% of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including
Outstanding Units deemed owned by the Transocean Member) represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of Non-Transocean Members of such class or classes unless any such action by the Non-Transocean Members requires
approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any
meeting of the Non-Transocean Members duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the
act of Non-Transocean Members holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the Outstanding Units
entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of the Non-Transocean
Members, unless a greater or different percentage is required with respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, or
the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable
to the Company or its securities, in which case the act of the Non-Transocean Members holding Outstanding Units that in the
aggregate represent at least such greater or different percentage shall be required. Broker non-votes shall not be considered as
Outstanding Units present and entitled to vote as to matters with respect to which no authority has been granted. The Non-
Transocean Members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Non-Transocean Members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken
(other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage of Outstanding Units specified in this Agreement (including
Outstanding Units deemed owned by the Transocean Member).
(b) At an Annual Meeting, only such business shall be conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon, as shall have been
properly brought before such Annual Meeting. At a special meeting of Members of the Company, only such business shall be
conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon, as shall have been properly brought before such special meeting.
(i) To be properly brought before an Annual Meeting, business or proposals (other than any nomination of Elected Directors, which is
governed by Section 7.3) must (A) be specified in the notice relating to the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 13.5, (B) otherwise be properly brought before the Annual Meeting by or
at the direction of the Board of Directors or (C) be properly brought before the meeting by a Non-Transocean Member notice provided
for in this Section 13.9(b) who (1) is a Record Holder at the time of the giving of such notice and on the record date for the
determination of Members entitled to vote at such Annual Meeting, (2) shall be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and (3) complies
with the requirements of this Section 13.9(b), and otherwise be proper subjects for Member action and be properly introduced at the
Annual Meeting. Clause (C) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be the exclusive means for a Non-Transocean Member to
submit business or proposals (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and included in the
notice relating to the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors in accordance with
Section 13.5) before an Annual Meeting.

the Exchange Act and included in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 13.9(b), a Non-Transocean Member shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13.9(b); provided, however,
that any references in this Agreement to the Exchange Act or the rules and
Table of Contents
A-60
regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to proposals as to any other
business to be considered pursuant to this Section 13.9(b). Nothing in this Section 13.9(b) shall be deemed to affect any rights of
Members to request inclusion of proposals in the Company’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
Section 13.10 Conduct of a Meeting. The Board of Directors shall have full power and authority concerning the manner of conducting
any meeting of the Non-Transocean Members or solicitation of approvals in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to
vote, the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of Sections 7.4, 13.4 and 13.9, the conduct of voting, the validity
and effect of any proxies and the determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection with or during the
meeting or voting. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief
Executive Officer, shall serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All
minutes shall be kept with the records of the Company maintained by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may make such
other regulations consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting
of the Non-Transocean Members or solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies,
the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of
the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 7.3, Section 13.9(b) or
this Section 13.10, unless otherwise required by law, if the Non-Transocean Member (or a qualified representative of the Non-
Transocean Member) does not appear at the Annual Meeting or special meeting to present a nomination or proposed business, such
nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such
vote may have been received by the Company. For purposes of Section 7.3, Section 13.9(b) or this Section 13.10, to be considered a
qualified representative of the Non-Transocean Member, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such Non-
Transocean Member or must be authorized by a writing executed by such Non-Transocean Member or an electronic transmission
delivered by such Non-Transocean Member to act for such Non-Transocean Member as proxy at the meeting of Non-Transocean
Members and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic
transmission, at the meeting of Members.
Section 13.11 Action Without a Meeting. If authorized by the Board of Directors or requested by the Transocean Member, any action
that may be taken at a meeting of the Non-Transocean Members may be taken without a meeting, without a vote and without prior
notice, if an approval in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Non-Transocean Members owning not less than the
minimum percentage, by Percentage Interest, of Membership Interests of the class or classes (including Membership Interests
deemed owned by the Transocean Member) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all the
Non-Transocean Members entitled to vote at such meeting were present and voted (unless such provision conflicts with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, in which
case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of
action without a meeting shall be given to the Non-Transocean Members who have not approved the action in writing. The Board of
Directors may specify that any written ballot submitted to Non-Transocean Members for the purpose of taking any action without a
meeting shall be returned to the Company within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the Board of
Directors. If a ballot returned to the Company does not vote all of the Units held by the Non-Transocean Members, the Company shall
be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the Non-
Transocean Members is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the Board of Directors, the written approvals shall have
no force and effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Company in care of the Board of Directors, (b) approvals sufficient
to take the action proposed are dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals are deposited with the
Company and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the Board of Directors to the effect that the exercise of such right and the
action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not cause the Non-Transocean Members to be deemed to be
taking part in the management and control of the business and
Table of Contents
A-61
affairs of the Company so as to jeopardize the Non-Transocean Members’ limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise permissible under the
applicable statutes then governing the rights, duties and liabilities of the Company and the Members. Nothing contained in this
Section 13.11 shall be deemed to require the Board of Directors to solicit all Non-Transocean Members in connection with a matter
approved by the holders of the requisite percentage of Units acting by written consent without a meeting.
Section 13.12 Right to Vote and Related Matters.
(a) Only those Record Holders of the Units on the Record Date set pursuant to Section 13.6 shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote
at, a meeting of Non-Transocean Members or to act with respect to matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Units have the
right to vote or to act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding Units shall be
deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units.
(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Person’s account by another Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or
clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units are registered, such other Person shall, in
exercising the voting rights in respect of such Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides
otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Company shall be
entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this
Agreement) are subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2(d)(ii), each Outstanding Common Unit is entitled to one vote on matters subject to a
vote of Unitholders holding Common Units.
Section 13.13 Voting of Incentive Distribution Rights.
(a) For so long as a majority of the Incentive Distribution Rights are held by the Transocean Member and its Affiliates, the holders of
the Incentive Distribution Rights shall not be entitled to vote such Incentive Distribution Rights on any Company matter except as may
otherwise be required by law and the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, in their capacity as such, shall be deemed to have
approved any matter approved by the Transocean Member.
(b) If less than a majority of the Incentive Distribution Rights are held by the Transocean Member and its Affiliates, the Incentive
Distribution Rights will be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Unitholders, other than (i) the election of Elected
Directors and (ii) amendments and other matters that the Board of Directors determines do not adversely affect the holders of the
Incentive Distribution Rights as a whole in any material respect. On any matter in which the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights
are entitled to vote, such holders will vote together with the Subordinated Units, prior to the end of the Subordination Period, or
together with the Common Units, thereafter, in either case as a single class except as otherwise required by Section 13.3(c), and such
Incentive Distribution Rights shall be treated in all respects as Subordinated Units or Common Units, as applicable, when sending
notices of a meeting of Non-Transocean Members to vote on any matter (unless otherwise required by law), calculating required
votes, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes under this Agreement. The relative voting power of the
Incentive Distribution Rights and the Subordinated Units or Common Units, as applicable, will be set in the same proportion as
cumulative cash distributions, if any, in respect of the Incentive Distribution Rights for the four consecutive Quarters prior to the record
date for the vote bears to the cumulative cash distributions in respect of such class of Units for such four Quarters. If the holders of the
Incentive Distribution Rights received no cash distributions in the previous four Quarters, then such holders shall have no right to vote
on the particular matter.
(c) In connection with any equity financing, or anticipated equity financing, by the Company of an Expansion Capital Expenditure, the
Transocean Member may, without the approval of the holders of the
Table of Contents
A-62
Incentive Distribution Rights, temporarily or permanently reduce the amount of Incentive Distributions that would otherwise be
distributed to such holders, provided that in the judgment of the Transocean Member, such reduction will be in the long-term best
interest of such holders.

(ii) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in such Person becoming an Interested Unitholder, the Interested Unitholder

Owned (x) by Persons who are members of the Board of Directors and also officers of the Company and (y) by employee share plans
in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether Units held subject to the plan will be
tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions contained in Section 14.7(a) shall not apply if a Person becomes an Interested
Unitholder inadvertently and (i) as soon as practicable divests itself of Ownership of
Table of Contents
A-66
sufficient Units so that such Person ceases to be an Interested Unitholder and (ii) would not, at any time within the three-year period
immediately prior to a Business Combination between the Company and such Person, have been an Interested Unitholder but for the

association or other entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity, in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the
evidence to the contrary, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, a presumption of control shall not apply where such Person holds
Voting Units, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this Section 14.7, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian
or trustee for one or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such entity.
(ii) “Business Combination” when used in reference to the Company and any Interested Unitholder, means:

Section 14.7 are not applicable to the surviving entity;
(B) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions), except
proportionately as a Unitholder, to or with the Interested Unitholder, whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of assets of the
Company or of any direct or indirect majority-Owned Subsidiary of the Company which assets have an aggregate market value equal
to 10% or more of either the aggregate market value of all the assets of the Company determined on a consolidated basis or the
aggregate market value of all the Units then Outstanding;
(C) any transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the Company or by any direct or indirect majority-Owned Subsidiary of
the Company of any Units or securities of such Subsidiary to the Interested Unitholder, except (1) pursuant to the exercise, exchange

Owned Subsidiary of the Company which securities were in issue prior to the time that the Interested Unitholder became such;
(2) pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made, or the exercise, exchange or conversion of securities exercisable for,
exchangeable for or convertible into Units or the shares or other equity interests of a direct or indirect majority-Owned Subsidiary of

(3) pursuant to an exchange offer by the Company to purchase Units made on the same terms to all holders of said Units; or (4) any
issuance or transfer of Units by the Company; provided, however, that in no case under clauses (2) through (4) above shall there be
an increase in the Interested Unitholder’s proportionate interest in the Membership Interests of any class or of the Voting Units of the
Company (except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share or unit ownership);
(D) any transaction involving the Company or any direct or indirect majority-Owned Subsidiary of the Company which has the effect,
directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate interest in the Membership Interests of any class, or securities convertible into the
Membership Interests of any class, or in the shares or other equity interests of any such Subsidiary which is Owned by the Interested
Unitholder, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share or unit adjustments or as a

result of any purchase or redemption of any Membership not caused, directly or indirectly, by the Interested Unitholder; or
(E) any receipt by the Interested Unitholder of the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a Unitholder), of any loans,
advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits (other than those expressly permitted in clauses (A) through (D) of this
definition) provided by or through the Company or any direct or indirect majority-Owned Subsidiary of the Company.
(iii) “Interested Unitholder” means any Person (other than the Company or any direct or indirect majority-Owned Subsidiary of the
Company) (i) that is the Owner of 15% or more of the Outstanding Voting Units of the Company or (ii) that is an Affiliate or Associate of
the Company and was the Owner of 15% or more of the Outstanding Voting Units at any time within the three-year period immediately
prior to the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such Person is an Interested Unitholder, and also the Affiliates and
Associates of such Person; provided, however, that the term Interested Unitholder shall not include (a) the Transocean Member, any
Transocean Direct Transferee, any Transocean Indirect Transferee or any of their respective Affiliates or successors or any “group”

directly or indirectly, by such Person or (y) the exercise of the limited preemptive right in Section 5.6; or (c) any Person to the extent its
ownership is attributable to that Person’s participation as a bona fide underwriter in an offering of Units. For the purpose of
determining whether a Person is an Interested Unitholder, the Voting Units deemed to be in issue shall include Voting Units deemed
to be Owned by the Person (through the application of the definition of “Owner”) but shall not include any other unissued Voting Units
which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or
options, or otherwise.
(iv) “Owner,” including the terms “Own,” “Owned” and “Ownership” when used with respect to any Units means a Person that
individually or with or through any of its Affiliates or Associates: (a) beneficially Owns such Units, directly or indirectly; (b) has (i) the
right to acquire such Units (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or
otherwise; provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Owner of Units tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer
made by such Person or any of such Person’s Affiliates or Associates until such tendered Units are accepted for purchase or
exchange; or (ii) the right to vote such Units pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding; provided, however, that a
Person shall not be deemed the Owner of any Units because of such Person’s right to vote such Units if the agreement, arrangement
or understanding to vote such Units arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in response to a proxy or consent
solicitation made to 10 or more Persons; or (c) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or consent as described in clause (b)(ii)), or disposing of such Units with
any other Person that beneficially Owns, or whose Affiliates or Associates beneficially Own, directly or indirectly, such Units. For

or successor or any “group” as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act or any member of any such group, of which such
Persons are a party under Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act, assigns its rights (with respect to the Units transferred in the transaction)
to not be deemed to be an Interested Unitholder) directly from either the Transocean Member or any of its Affiliates or successors or
any “group” (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act), or any member of any such group, of which such Persons are a
party under Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then Outstanding Voting Units.

RIGHT TO ACQUIRE NON-TRANSOCEAN MEMBER INTERESTS
Section 15.1 Right to Acquire Non-Transocean Member Interests.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time from and after the Closing Date the Transocean Member and
its Affiliates hold more than 80% of the total Membership Interests of any class then Outstanding, the Transocean Member shall then
have the right, which right it may assign and transfer in whole or in part to the Company or any Affiliate of the Transocean Member,
exercisable at its option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the remaining Membership Interests of such class then Outstanding
held by Persons other than the Transocean Member and its Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market Price as of the date three
Business Days prior to the date that the notice described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed and (y) the highest price paid by the Transocean
Member or any of its Affiliates for any such Membership Interest of such class purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date
that the notice described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed.
(b) If the Transocean Member, any Affiliate of the Transocean Member or the Company elects to exercise the right to purchase
Membership Interests granted pursuant to Section 15.1(a), the Transocean Member shall deliver to the applicable Transfer Agent
notice of such election to purchase (the “Notice of Election to Purchase”) and shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such
Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Membership Interests of such class or classes (as of a Record Date selected
by the Transocean Member) at least 10, but not more than 60, days prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase
shall also be filed and distributed as may be required by the Commission or any National Securities Exchange on which such
Membership Interests are listed. The Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price (determined in
accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at which Membership Interests will be purchased and state that the Transocean Member, its Affiliate
or the Company, as the case may be, elects to purchase such Membership Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such
Membership Interests, in the case of Membership Interests evidenced by Certificates, in exchange for payment, at such office or
offices of the Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent may specify, or as may be required by any National Securities Exchange on which
such Membership Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of
Membership Interests at his address as reflected in the Register shall be conclusively presumed to have been given regardless of
whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the Transocean Member, its Affiliate or the Company, as
the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of such
Membership Interests to be purchased in accordance with this Section 15.1. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been duly
given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the Purchase Date the deposit described in the
preceding sentence has been made for the benefit of the holders of Membership Interests subject to purchase as provided herein,
then from and after the Purchase Date, notwithstanding that any
Table of Contents
A-69
Certificate shall not have been surrendered for purchase, all rights of the holders of such Membership Interests (including any rights
pursuant to Articles IV, V, VI and XII) shall thereupon cease, except the right to receive the applicable purchase price (determined in
accordance with Section 15.1(a)) for Membership Interests therefor, without interest, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the
Certificates representing such Membership Interests, in the case of Membership Interests evidenced by Certificates, and such
Membership Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the Transocean Member, its Affiliate or the Company, as the
case may be, in the Register, and the Company, and the Transocean Member or any Affiliate of the Transocean Member, or the
Company, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Membership Interests from and after the Purchase Date
and shall have all rights as the owner of such Membership Interests (including all rights as owner of such Membership Interests
pursuant to Articles IV, V, VI and XII).
(c) In the case of Membership Interests evidenced by Certificates, at any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an
Outstanding Membership Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1 may surrender his Certificate evidencing such
Membership Interest to the Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described in Section 15.1(a), without interest
thereon.
(d) The Transocean Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the Outstanding Common Units to be
repurchased pursuant to this Section 15.1. Holders of such Outstanding Common Units subject to purchase as provide in this
Section 15.1 will not have dissenters’ rights of appraisal.

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement
certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each
purchaser.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of
expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be
governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to
any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this
registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or
sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser
and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to this offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule
424;
(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to this offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by
the undersigned registrant;
(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to this offering containing material information about the undersigned
registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in this offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:
(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part
of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule
424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was
declared effective.
(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of
prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such
securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
The undersigned registrant undertakes to send to each common unitholder, at least on an annual basis, a detailed statement of any
transactions with Transocean, the Transocean Member partner, or any of their affiliates, and of fees, commissions, compensation and
other benefits paid, or accrued to Transocean, the Transocean Member, or any of their affiliates for the fiscal year completed, showing
the amount paid or accrued to each recipient and the services performed.
The registrant undertakes to provide to the common unitholders the financial statements required by Form 10-K for the first full fiscal
year of operations of the registrant.
