<p><b>Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/30, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to report on the obstacles and challenges to the 
implementation of that resolution by the Council and to make concrete recommendations for 
action to address the obstacles and challenges encountered. 
</p>
<p>2.  Member States and non-governmental organizations provided important input in response to 
the note verbale sent by OHCHR in view of the preparation of the report for the eleventh session.  
Following discussions with the main cosponsor of resolution 6/30, however, it was agreed that 
the report would be submitted to the Council at its twelfth session, which would allow recent 
events to be included in the report, such as the plenary panel debate on women&#8217;s rights to be held 
during the eleventh session, and would also coincide with the tabling and discussion of the 
resolution on the integration of human rights of women by the Council at its twelfth session.
