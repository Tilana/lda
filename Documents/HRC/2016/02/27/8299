</i></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 16/17, 
in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to report to the Council at its 
nineteenth session on the implementation of that resolution. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 16/17, the Human Rights Council called upon Israel to comply with 
the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human 
Rights Council, in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Security 
Council decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and without international 
legal effect, and demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision. The Human Rights 
Council also requested the Secretary-General to bring resolution 16/17 to the attention of all 
Governments, competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, international and 
regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, to 
disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on the matter to the Council at its 
nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 16/17 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 1 November 2011, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note verbale to 
the Government of Israel referring to Human Rights Council resolution 16/17, requesting 
information on any steps taken or envisaged to be taken concerning the implementation of 
the relevant provisions of that resolution. No reply was received to that request.  
</p>
<p>3. Also on 1 November 2011, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed 
a note verbale to all permanent missions to draw their attention to Human Rights Council 
resolution 16/17 and to request the Governments of Member States to provide information 
on any steps that they had taken or envisaged taking concerning the implementation of the 
relevant provisions of the resolution. The Permanent Missions of the Syrian Arab Republic 
and of Algeria replied to the note verbale. 
</p>
<p>4. On 14 November 2011, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic regretted to 
note that, despite the repeated requests from the international community for the complete 
withdrawal of Israel from the Syrian Golan, Israel continued to occupy the Golan, pursued 
daily repressive practices against the population of the Golan and persisted in its flagrant 
violations of international law and norms with impunity. The Syrian Arab Republic stated 
that General Assembly resolution 65/18 confirmed the failure of Israel to withdraw from 
the Syrian Golan and its disregard for the resolutions of the Security Council and the 
General Assembly. In resolution 65/18, the General Assembly declared that the annexation 
by Israel of the Syrian Golan in 1981 and its subsequent imposition of Israeli laws, 
nationality and administration on Syrian Golan were null and void, without legal effect and 
had to be revoked. The Syrian Arab Republic noted that, after 44 years of Israeli occupation 
and despite international resolutions and demands from the international community, Israel 
continues to ignore those demands and resolutions. The Syrian Arab Republic affirmed its 
desire to continue to work and cooperate with the United Nations with a view to ending that 
occupation. On the basis of that understanding, the Syrian Arab Republic stated that United 
Nations resolutions continue to be the reference for a just and comprehensive resolution of 
the problems in the Middle East. According to the note verbale, President Bashar Al Assad 
had declared on more than one occasion that the Syrian Arab Republic was willing to 
resume peace negotiations on the same basis on which the Madrid peace process was 
started in 1991. It also noted that the Syrian Arab Republic had declared in all international 
forums its full commitment to relevant international resolutions and called for their 
implementation, in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 497 </p>


<p>(1981), and for implementation of the principle of land for peace, in order to ensure the full 
withdrawal by Israel from all of the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967. 
</p>
<p>5. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic strongly 
condemned the killing by Israel of peaceful demonstrators who had sought to remind the 
international community of their right to return to their homeland after four decades of 
occupation. The Syrian Arab Republic noted the incident of 5 June 2011, when peaceful 
Syrian and Palestinian demonstrators commemorating Naksa were shot by Israeli troops on 
the Syrian side of the ceasefire line, resulting in 23 dead and 350 wounded. The Syrian 
Arab Republic also pointed out that similar crimes were committed on 15 May 2011 during 
the commemoration of Nakba, near the ceasefire line with the occupied Golan. It stated that 
Israeli forces had used live ammunition to disperse peaceful protestors, resulting in 15 dead 
and dozens of wounded. 
</p>
<p>6. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic condemned the 
construction by Israel of a barrier near the ceasefire line, in front of the occupied village of 
Majdal Shams, as well as campaigns that promote settlement building in the occupied 
Golan, the latest of which was in December 2010 under the title of &#8220;Come to Golan&#8221; with 
the aim of attracting more Israeli settler families to Golan. It deplored the establishment of 
a new tourist settlement near the settlement of It&#8217;am in cooperation with the extremist 
</p>
<p>settlement of Yobatan. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic condemned the arrival 
of more settlers to the Golan in the name of &#8220;tourist cities&#8221; in the al-Batiha region located in 
the south of the occupied Golan, particularly in the area of Tal Sayadin on the eastern shore 
of Lake Tiberias. It condemned the organization of tourist trips by international Jewish 
organizations to the Golan and the promotion of settlements, and the development of 
infrastructure to service those settlements. It stated that these actions clearly demonstrate 
the disregard by Israel for peace and for the decisions of the Security Council and the 
General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>7. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic condemned the distribution by the 
Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations in New York of products from the 
occupied Syrian Golan, and stressed that such behaviour constituted a flagrant violation of 
Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and General Assembly resolution 65/179 entitled 
&#8220;Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over 
their natural resources&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>8. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic deplored the fact 
that, in December 2010, Israel had confiscated water sources from the occupied Golan in 
order to allocate water exclusively to Israeli settlers, resulting in a financial loss of more 
than $20 million for the Syrian nationals of the Golan, whose livelihoods depend on 
farming and fishing. The Government believes that this was a deliberate violation of human 
rights of the Syrian residents of the Golan and constituted a violation of paragraph 7 of 
Security Council resolution 465 (1980), in which the Council called for the protection of 
the natural resources of the territories under occupation, including water, and of paragraph 
5 of the said resolution, in which the Council determined that all measures taken by Israel 
to change the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure or status 
of the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, or 
any part thereof, had no legal validity and that Israel's policy and practices of settling parts 
of its population and new immigrants in those territories constituted a flagrant violation of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 
and also constituted a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting 
peace in the Middle East. 
</p>
<p>9. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic rejected the 
decision made on 22 October 2010 by the Israeli Knesset to mandate a referendum on any </p>


<p>agreement leading to the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Syrian Golan and East 
Jerusalem, and to require the support of more than 80 per cent of Israelis for such a 
withdrawal. It pointed out that the motion represented a violation of &#8211; and showed contempt 
&#8211; for international law, which stipulates that territory may not be acquired by force, and was 
also incompatible with Security Council resolution 497 (1981).  
</p>
<p>10. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirmed its 
request made to the Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly, the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the President of the Human Rights Council 
and the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross to put pressure on Israel 
to ensure that the Syrian prisoners detained in its jails are kept in more humane health 
conditions. It also rejected the trials by the Israeli occupation authorities of the Syrian 
nationals Majed Shaer, sentenced to five and a half years in prison; his son Fidaa, sentenced 
to three years in prison; and Yusuf Shams, sentenced to five years in prison. The 
Government also underlined its request to the above-mentioned international figures to put 
pressure on Israel to rescind its decision barring visits by citizens from the occupied Syrian 
Golan to their homeland, the Syrian Arab Republic, through the Qunaitra crossing, 
including the refusal to allow the Syrian student, Raeq Sha&#8217;lan, to return to the occupied 
</p>
<p>Golan on 5 July 2011, as well as its refusal to allow the family of the young Syrian student 
Faras Abu Saleh, who was sick and in hospital, to visit him for three days in January 2010. 
According to the Government, in addition to the psychological and physical suffering of 
Syrian citizens, this also violates international humanitarian law. The Syrian Arab Republic 
stressed that Israeli practices in the occupied Syrian Golan exceed legal and moral 
boundaries. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic called on the international 
community to take all necessary measures and put pressure on Israel so that it complies 
with its obligations under international law.  
</p>
<p>11. On 18 November 2011, the Permanent Mission of Algeria, in a note verbale, 
emphasized that its position on the question of the occupied Golan and its two interrelated 
manifestations, the restoration of Syrian sovereignty over the occupied Golan and the 
human rights situation, remained in accordance with the principles of international law and 
relevant international standards. In its note verbale, Algeria stated that all legislative and 
administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel to change the physical 
character and the legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan were null and void, constituted a 
flagrant violation of international law and the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 
relative to the Protection of Civilians in Time of War, and had no legal effect. The 
Government of Algeria recalled that it had expressed in many forums and international 
meetings its condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the Arab Syrian Golan. It demanded 
the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Golan and called for the restoration of Syrian 
sovereignty over the territory. It considered that the resolution of the issue of the occupation 
of the Golan constituted a necessary condition to reach a just and comprehensive solution to 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Government of Algeria would not accept anything less than 
the restoration of all occupied Arab territories in Palestine, the Syrian Arab Republic and 
Lebanon. With regard to the human rights situation in the occupied Syrian Golan, Algeria 
strongly condemned the repressive Israeli practices against Syrian citizens resisting the 
occupation and trying to preserve their right to their land and their Arab identity. Algeria 
recalled that it had supported many resolutions of the League of Arab States that 
condemned practices by Israel and its flagrant violations of human rights, and demanded 
that the United Nations, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council guarantee the 
respect by Israel of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, including the right to family visits for Syrians.
