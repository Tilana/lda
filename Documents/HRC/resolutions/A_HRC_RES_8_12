</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 8/12.</b> <b>Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>especially women and children, in particular General Assembly resolutions 61/144 
</p>
<p>and 61/180, and also decision 2004/110 of 19 April 2004 of the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights establishing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
</p>
<p>2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of 18 
</p>
<p>June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in 
</p>
<p>accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and 
</p>
<p>declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the 
</p>
<p>Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular </p>

<p>the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
</p>
<p>and Children, supplementing the Convention, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the resolve of the heads of State and Government expressed 
</p>
<p>in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to intensify efforts to fight 
</p>
<p>transnational organized crime in all its dimensions, including trafficking in 
</p>
<p>human beings, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the Vienna Forum against Trafficking in Persons in the 
</p>
<p>framework of the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, held 
</p>
<p>from 13 to 15 February 2008, and of the thematic debate on the issue of trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons in the framework of the General Assembly on 3 June 2008, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are 
</p>
<p>often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds 
</p>
<p>of their gender, age, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as their origins, and that these 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>Recognizing also that trafficking in persons violates human rights and impairs the  
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and 
</p>
<p>requires a concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral 
</p>
<p>cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination in order to be eradicated, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The high number of persons, especially women and children, in 
</p>
<p>particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, 
</p>
<p>who are being trafficked to developed countries, as well as within and between 
</p>
<p>regions and States; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime and 
</p>
<p>others that profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without 
</p>
<p>regard for dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic </p>

<p>laws and international standards; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of exploitation of the prostitution of others and for child pornography, 
</p>
<p>paedophilia and any other form of sexual exploitation of children, as well as for 
</p>
<p>trafficking in women as brides and for sex tourism; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices 
</p>
<p>and the denial of rights and justice to victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Urges </i>Governments: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To take appropriate measures to address the root factors, including external 
</p>
<p>factors, that encourage trafficking in persons for prostitution and other forms of 
</p>
<p>commercialized sex, forced marriages and forced labour, slavery or practices similar to 
</p>
<p>slavery, servitude or the removal of organs, including by strengthening existing 
</p>
<p>legislation or by considering the enactment of anti-trafficking legislation and the 
</p>
<p>adoption of national plans of action with a view to providing better protection for 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking and to punishing perpetrators through criminal and civil 
</p>
<p>measures; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms and to condemn and 
</p>
<p>penalize traffickers, facilitators and intermediaries, including, where applicable, by 
</p>
<p>imposing sanctions against legal entities involved in the process of trafficking, without 
</p>
<p>making accusations by, or the participation of, the victims of trafficking a precondition 
</p>
<p>for the prosecution of trafficking; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To ensure protection and assistance to the victims of trafficking with full 
</p>
<p>respect for their human rights; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To actively promote the rehabilitation of victims of trafficking by 
</p>
<p>providing them with access to adequate physical and psychological care and services, 
</p>
<p>including those related to HIV/AIDS, as well as shelter, legal assistance and help lines; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To take all appropriate measures to ensure that victims of trafficking are </p>

<p>not penalized for being trafficked and that they do not suffer from revictimization as 
</p>
<p>a result of actions taken by Government authorities, bearing in mind that they are 
</p>
<p>victims of exploitation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures to discourage the 
</p>
<p>demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons and leads to trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) To establish mechanisms, where appropriate, in cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>international community, to combat the use of the Internet to facilitate trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons and crimes related to sexual or other forms of exploitation and to strengthen 
</p>
<p>international cooperation to investigate and prosecute trafficking facilitated by the 
</p>
<p>use of the Internet; 
</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) To provide or strengthen training for law enforcement, immigration, 
</p>
<p>criminal justice and other relevant officials, including personnel participating in 
</p>
<p>peacekeeping operations, in preventing and responding effectively to trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, including the identification of victims with full respect for their human rights; 
</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) To conduct information campaigns for the general public, including 
</p>
<p>children, aimed at promoting awareness of the dangers associated with all forms of 
</p>
<p>trafficking and encouraging the public, including the victims of trafficking themselves, 
</p>
<p>to report on instances of trafficking; 
</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) To cooperate with each other and with relevant intergovernmental and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations to ensure the effective countering of trafficking in persons; 
</p>
<p>(<i>k</i>) To enhance information-sharing and data-collection capacities as a way of 
</p>
<p>promoting cooperation to combat trafficking in persons, including through the systematic 
</p>
<p>collection of sex- and age-disaggregated data; 
</p>
<p>(<i>l</i>) To consider strengthening existing regional mechanisms aimed at 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in persons or to establish such mechanisms where they 
</p>
<p>do not exist; </p>

<p>(<i>m</i>) To consider signing and ratifying and States parties to implement relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations legal instruments, such as the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to 
</p>
<p>Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
</p>
<p>supplementing the Convention;
