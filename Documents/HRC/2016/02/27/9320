<p><b>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY-BUILDING 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the independent expert on technical cooperation 
and advisory services in Liberia, Charlotte Abaka </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report contains the findings of a mission that the independent expert undertook 
to Liberia from 20 to 29 September 2007. Over the course of the 10-day mission, the 
independent expert met high-level representatives of the executive, legislative and the judiciary, 
government officials, civil society, United Nations agencies and funds, some traditional rulers 
and the diplomatic community. Information received served as valuable inputs for the 
independent expert&#8217;s assessment of progress, as well as concerns, challenges and gaps with 
regard to the promotion and protection of human rights in Liberia. 
</p>
<p> Considerable progress has been made since the last report in improving security and 
implementing some aspects of civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights. The lifting of 
sanctions by the Security Council on diamond and timber has opened avenues of income for both 
the public and private sectors. Progress has been made in the work of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission. The secretariat has been established and an executive secretary 
recruited. County and district Truth and Reconciliation Commission committees have been set 
up. However, the Commission continues to face many challenges, which have resulted in delays 
in statement taking and holding of public hearings. These challenges include structural and 
budget shortfalls. 
</p>
<p> Serious concerns remain with regard to the rule of law and the judicial system. The 
discriminatory provisions of the hinterland regulations have not been repealed and some 
Liberians are still classified as civilized or uncivilized. The weak implementation of the Rape 
Law is a major concern, as is the persistence of harmful and discriminatory traditional practices, 
such as trial by ordeal. Female genital mutilation continues to be practised and has not been 
prohibited by law. 
</p>
<p> The challenges facing the Government and Liberian society as a whole are therefore 
enormous. While the Government has demonstrated the political will to transform society and 
has strongly supported poverty reduction schemes for vulnerable groups of the population, 
support must be forthcoming from the international community in a timely and effective manner 
to address capacity gaps within government structures. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert concludes the report with a set of recommendations for the 
Government of Liberia, the international community and the United Nations. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  OVERVIEW OF THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p>1. According to basic indicators including life expectancy at birth, combined gross enrolment 
ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary schools, under-five mortality rates and population 
undernourishment, Liberia is currently one of the least developed countries in the world. 
</p>
<p>2. The country&#8217;s total population is 3.2 million (2005).<b>1</b> It is largely composed of 18 major 
indigenous ethnic groups living alongside a small number of Americo-Liberians and Congo 
people. The history of Liberia has been marked by a concentration of political power, economic 
resources and social advantages in the hands of Americo-Liberians, who represent 3 per cent of 
the population. 
</p>
<p>3. The great majority of Liberians live in poverty: 76.2 per cent of the population live below 
the international poverty line of $1 a day, and approximately half of the population is living in 
extreme poverty (less than $0.50 a day). 
</p>
<p>4. At the national level, life expectancy at birth is 42.5 years, as measured during the 
period 2000-2005. The under-five mortality rate was 235 per 1,000 live births in 2004. For 
reasons such as the lack of education and awareness of family planning, the total fertility rate in 
rural areas (6.2 births) is considerably higher than the rate in urban areas (3.8 births). The 
population of the country is mainly concentrated in rural areas, which account for 68 per cent of 
the population. 
</p>
<p>5. The illiteracy rate is a staggering 63 per cent; 73 per cent of women are illiterate, compared 
to 50 per cent of men. There is also rural-urban disparity: only approximately 25 per cent of the 
rural population can read and write. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Security and political situation 
</b></p>
<p>6. Considerable progress has been made in improving security and fulfilling some aspects of 
civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights. The lifting of sanctions by the Security 
Council on diamond and timber has reopened sources of income to the private sector and 
increased the tax base available to the Government. This should enhance its ability to 
progressively implement economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>7. Divisions still exist among communities over issues concerning land, property and 
religion. The cleavages within Liberian society are considerable; they derive from perceptions of 
the lack of legitimacy of certain identities and religious faiths as authentically Liberian. The 
perception of Liberia as a Christian State persists, as does resistance to the acceptance of the 
Mandingo identity as legitimately Liberian. Ethnic-based discrimination has become more 
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>complex as a result of ethnic politicization during the war. The problem of land and property 
disputes, most acute in Nimba County, particular in Ganty City and Lofa County, give rise to 
confrontations between different ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>8. Since the last report of the independent expert on technical cooperation and advisory 
services in Liberia (A/HRC/4/6), some progress has been made in the implementation of the Act 
to Establish the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia. An important step was the 
establishment of a secretariat and the recruitment of an executive secretary for the Commission. 
County and district truth and reconciliation committees have also been set up. The Commission 
has adopted revised rules and procedures for its operation. 
</p>
<p>9. Activities undertaken by the Commission include the launching of a public awareness 
campaign in July and a workshop for traditional councils and religious leaders. The workshop 
had the objective of encouraging the involvement of traditional councils and religious leaders in 
the truth and reconciliation process. The independent expert took part in that workshop. 
</p>
<p>10. The work of the Commission is hampered by many factors, including structural issues, 
normally, a lack of clarity in its mission and weaknesses in the organization of its work. At the 
instigation of the International Contact Group for Liberia, a working group, co-chaired by the 
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, was 
established in March as a result of serious concerns relating to the Commission&#8217;s lack of 
preparation. The aim of the working group is to assist the Commission in addressing 
management and personnel issues as well as in the elaboration of a workplan. While full 
participation by all elements of Liberian society is needed if the work of the Commission is to be 
fully effective, awareness of it is still lacking in rural and isolated areas. Furthermore, the great 
need for psychosocial counsellors cannot be met, as it has proven difficult to find suitable 
numbers of qualified counsellors able to offer full-time services. Another major challenge faced 
by the Commission is budget shortfalls. Of the projected budget for the period from June 2006 to 
September 2008 of $14 million, only $2.2 million had been received as at September 2007. 
</p>
<p>11. A further delay in the nomination of members to the Independent Technical Advisory 
Committee, following the resignation of the former members in January 2007, could negatively 
influence the work of the Commission. The development of terms of reference and a service 
contract for such members must be a priority for the Commission. 
</p>
<p>12. It is very likely that the Commission will be unable to complete its mission by the end of 
its mandate in August 2008. Therefore, even at this stage, stakeholders may wish to consider an 
extension of its mandate, as provided for by the Act to Establish the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Independent National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>13. The establishment of the Independent National Human Rights Commission as mandated by 
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of August 2003 has been delayed. To date, the 
Commissioners have not yet been appointed. Various interlocutors have expressed concern about </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the extensive and unchecked power of the Commission. To resolve that issue, interlocutors 
suggested that the Commission sign an agreement with the judiciary branch. Under such an 
agreement, cases of human rights violation could be referred to a judge for review. 
</p><p>14. The Independent National Human Rights Commission is of particular significance 
ensuring the sustainable protection of human rights in Liberia because of the permanent nature of 
its mandate, as compared to that of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Consequently, the 
problems faced in its creation need to be carefully and urgently addressed, as an effective Human 
Rights Commission could play a crucial role in the reconciliation, transformation and 
reconstruction efforts being undertaken in Liberia, with a human rights perspective, using 
internationally accepted human rights instruments as a tool. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Legislature 
</b></p>
<p>15. In May, the Legislature passed the Financial Autonomy Act, which was to grant it financial 
autonomy from the Executive Branch. The President however vetoed the Act. The Speaker of the 
House of Representatives himself stated that the Liberian Legislature was currently neither 
strong enough in terms of structure nor responsible enough to administer its own finances. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL REFORM AND RULE OF LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Review of national legislation 
</b></p>
<p>16. Although law reform is one of the President&#8217;s priority areas, as documented in her 150-day 
plan of action, a law reform commission has not yet been established. The Speaker of the House 
of Representatives confirmed that the draft act on the establishment of the law reform 
commission had not yet been received by the Legislature. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Liberian justice system 
</b>17. Only 18 of the 52 judges serving in Liberia hold law degrees; 5 of these are on the 
Supreme Court. All other judges have only been trained &#8220;on the job&#8221;, while none of the 
135 magistrates is a law graduate. None of the 11 public prosecutors currently serving has a law 
degree. Furthermore, judges and lawyers have a common aversion to accepting postings outside 
Monrovia owing to the poor working and living conditions in other counties. The information 
received by the independent expert indicates that the Law School at the University of Liberia 
lacks the necessary resources to allow adequate numbers of qualified lawyers to graduate in the 
coming few years. The lack of qualified personnel results in many trials being conducted in 
violation of fair trial standards, including the right to legal counsel, the right to an interpreter, the 
right to have time to prepare one&#8217;s defence, and many more. 
</p>
<p>18. While the law requires the creation of a juvenile court in the headquarters of each county 
superintendent, there is only one such court at the moment, based in Monrovia. No juvenile 
rehabilitation institutions or judicial personnel trained in their responsibilities towards juvenile 
suspects exist. Although prescribed by law, rehabilitation homes for juvenile delinquents are also 
not operational. Children are frequently remanded to pretrial detention in a manner that is 
inconsistent with prevailing juvenile law. The UNMIL Human Rights and Protection Section has </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>documented cases of children below the age of criminal responsibility (16) being detained in 
cells with adults. It has also monitored cases where complaints of rape, including cases involving 
children, are not investigated or prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>19. The situation in the judiciary system has not changed much since the previous report of the 
independent expert of February 2007. Throughout Liberia, 16 circuit courts were officially 
opened in February 2006. However, at least six circuit courts were not fully functional owing to 
the absence of key judicial personnel and lack of facilities. In some cases, the absence of judicial 
personnel appeared to be a result of poor communication between Monrovia and the counties, or 
of administrative difficulties. In May, in Sinoe and Grand Cape Mount Counties, trials could not 
be held owing to the absence of defence lawyers. In September, the circuit court in Grand Gedeh 
County started hearing its first trial for the August term. 
</p>
<p>20. The state of physical facilities of all courts in the country is poor. No court has or uses a 
computer, photocopier, camera, video equipment or mimeographing machine. Apart from the 
court in Montserrado, no other court in the country has electricity and communication resources. 
The key resources shared among all courts appear to be a manual typewriter, some stationery and 
supplies. This critical lack of basic resources has led to a situation in which no report has been 
sent to the Chief Justice on rape cases prosecuted by the courts. 
</p>
<p>21. Owing to the weakness or complete absence of the statutory legal system in poor and/or 
rural communities, Liberians have come to rely on customary justice. Widespread illiteracy, 
including legal illiteracy, in these communities has further deepened their reliance on customary 
law. 
</p>
<p>22. Discrimination and inequality in customary law are widespread. Decisions of town, clan 
and paramount chiefs working under the Ministry of Internal Affairs are often made by prejudice 
and result in excessive sanctions. These sanctions are not generally subject to independent 
review by the statutory courts. Illegal detention and forced labour practices result partly from the 
chiefs&#8217; ignorance of their proper judicial role. However, some chiefs abuse the dysfunctional 
statutory system to exploit people who lack an adequate awareness of their legal rights. In May, 
a five-year-old was allegedly killed in Bong Mines, Bong County, as retribution after his 
grandmother was denounced as a witch by a &#8220;medicine man&#8221;. In July, a 65-year-old woman and 
her 70-year-old husband were beaten by a mob that accused the woman of using witchcraft, 
thereby allegedly causing the death of a 12-year-old child in River Cess County. 
</p>
<p>23. Notwithstanding the human rights violations caused by some aspects of the customary 
traditional system, it is very difficult to abolish formal recognition when Liberians have no 
access to the statutory courts for many reasons, including geographic and financial ones. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Ending impunity 
</b></p>
<p>24. Some progress has been made in restructuring and strengthening the capacity of the 
Liberian National Police. As at September 2007, there were 203 female police officers in a force 
totalling 3,461. The Liberian National Police deployed 1,200 police officers in rural areas. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Currently the police payroll system is not incorporated into the national payroll system; police 
officers are therefore required to travel to police headquarters in Monrovia to obtain their pay 
cheque. 
</p>
<p>25. Though improving detention conditions in prisons is a security priority for the Ministry of 
Justice, conditions remain very poor, with complaints of lack of food and potable water being 
widespread in Saniquellie central prison. Detainees&#8217; relatives were forced to bribe guards to 
allow them to bring food to detainees. 
</p>
<p>26. Prison officers receive payment equal to that of members of the Liberian National Police. 
In many rural areas, separate cells have been established for female prisoners. There are 
139 trained prison officers throughout the country; there is therefore a great need for additional 
corrections officers, especially female ones. 
</p>
<p>27. The UNMIL Human Rights and Protection Section has received frequent reports of 
misconduct by police officers in the execution of their duties. Such allegations range from 
mistreatment in detention to corrupt practices. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights on rubber plantations 
</b></p>
<p>28. On the Guthrie rubber plantation in Bomi County, there are two categories of salary: fixed 
salary for teachers, nurses, management and security staff, and production salary for rubber 
tappers, based on quantity of latex/cup lumps produced per month. A tapper gets $160 per month 
if he or she produces a ton of rubber. No basic salary is offered; non-producing workers therefore 
receive no salary. 
</p>
<p>29. Labour unions for rubber plantation workers remain weak: on the Guthrie rubber 
plantation, since there is no workers union, workers channel their grievances and problems 
through their own grievance council. 
</p>
<p>30. The provision of medical services on the Guthrie rubber plantation is extremely poor: there 
is only one clinic, with 54 staff and one doctor catering for over 17,000 inhabitants. Sanitary 
conditions are also very poor. There are 28 hand pumps constructed throughout the plantation; 
latrines are present only in a few of the camps. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to housing, only nursing and teaching staff are provided with reasonable 
housing units, while the rest of the employees, especially rubber tappers, live in dilapidated 
units. On the Cavalla rubber plantation, clean and safe drinking water is only available to 
about 10 per cent of the population; existing wells are not safe for drinking. Furthermore, 
environmental protection and occupational health and safety do not appear to be a part of the 
plantation&#8217;s current management scheme. 
</p>
<p>32. At present, concession agreements do not systematically include the provision of minimum 
standards of basic services for workers. A pilot project to this effect is currently under way at the 
Firestone rubber plantation, the largest in Liberia. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights of women and implementation of the Rape Law 
</b></p>
<p>33. Many Liberian women and girls, regardless of age, marital status and ethnic affiliation, 
suffer various forms of violence and exploitation, including gang rape, sexual slavery, forced sex 
in exchange for food or survival, and forced or early marriage. According to a study conducted 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the situation of gender-based violence in Liberia, 
in 10 of Liberia&#8217;s most populous counties, 90.8 per cent of the sample had been subjected to one 
or multiple acts of abuses and/or sexual violence; 75 per cent were raped - most of them gang 
raped. Sexual violence, domestic violence, sexual exploitation, incest, early and forced marriage, 
wife inheritance and female genital mutilation are the most prevalent forms of gender-based 
violence in the country. Furthermore, the level of poverty among women and children and the 
absence of social safety networks make women and children extremely vulnerable to sexual 
exploitation and abuse. 
</p>
<p>34. The prevalence of gender-based violence has serious repercussions, including exposure to 
HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and unplanned or unwanted pregnancies. 
Needs assessments carried out in health facilities show that, despite their willingness to receive 
the victims of gender-based violence, health facilities are not sufficiently equipped and lack 
adequate drugs, medical supplies and health professionals trained in the clinical and 
psychological management of victims of gender-based violence. In addition, most health 
facilities are inaccessible to victims who seek comprehensive emergency care. 
</p>
<p>35. Though the amended Rape Law entered into force in January 2006, rape is still the most 
prevalent crime in the country, particularly in Lofa County. The weak judiciary system and the 
lack of awareness and understanding among the population of the legal system remains the main 
reason for the weak implementation of the Rape Law. There are no official data on prosecuted 
rape cases owing to the lack of record keeping by the courts. 
</p>
<p>36. In rape cases, police and prosecutors rely heavily on medical evidence, excluding other 
forms of both incriminating and exculpatory evidence that should be investigated. Owing to the 
culture of impunity that allows perpetrators of gender-based violence to go unpunished, victims 
of this type of violence are usually hesitant to seek assistance or to report the crimes. The 
stigmatization associated with victims of gender-based violence makes coming forward for 
assistance difficult and, at times, dangerous. These difficulties are compounded by economic 
challenges and gaps in legal, protection, health and psychosocial services that fail to ensure 
confidentiality and supportive services that victims need. This situation discourages victims of 
rape from reporting cases to the police. 
</p>
<p>37. Out-of-court settlement is still very widespread in cases of rape. In May, an alleged victim 
of rape in Grand Cape Mount County appeared to receive discriminatory treatment by the 
Liberian National Police and judiciary personnel because she was mentally disabled. The police 
charged the suspect only with the lesser offence of involuntary sodomy. The Robertsport 
Magistrate and City Solicitor ultimately convened a &#8220;conference&#8221; for the case, at which the 
suspect agreed to pay a financial settlement. In another case, in August, during the preliminary 
examination of a case in which a 13-year-old girl was allegedly raped, the Magistrate at 
Voinjama Magistrates Court, Lofa County, postponed the transfer of the case to the circuit court, 
stating that he wanted to give the defendant a chance to convince the victim&#8217;s parents to settle 
the case outside court. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. Despite the extraordinary prevalence of gender-based violence in Liberia, courts are 
ill-equipped to deal with the prosecution of this particular type of crime. In Monrovia, Court II, 
which has special jurisdiction over cases of armed robbery, will also be serving for the 
prosecution of rape cases. Under a project funded by the Government of Denmark, the Court will 
be provided with a camera and darkened glass to protect the victims when they give testimony. 
However, Court II, like many other courts in the country, is hamstrung by poor working 
conditions and insufficient capacities. In particular, courts in Liberia suffer from a lack of 
sufficient defence and prosecuting lawyers; adequately qualified internal and external support 
personnel; adequate logistics; and adequate resources for sentencing and imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>39. A task force has been established to implement the national gender-based violence plan of 
action, a joint Government-United Nations programme launched on 30 November 2006, and to 
coordinate activities to address the issue of gender-based violence in order to reduce the 
duplication of efforts and waste of resources and to increase impact on targeted groups. The 
budget allocated for the implementation of the plan of action is $15,225,000 over a period of 
five years. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Human rights of children 
</b></p>
<p>40. There has been a slight decrease in the infant mortality rate. 
</p>
<p>41. Despite the recommendations of the Child Protection Network Task Force on Orphanages 
to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare that 63 of 111 orphanages be closed down, efforts 
to close illegal orphanages were undermined by the Government&#8217;s decision to pay subsidies to 
all orphanages, including illegal ones. 
</p>
<p>42. Many unaccredited orphanages remain open, putting the children who live there - many of 
whom still have at least one living parent - at risk of neglect and exploitation. According to the 
Minister for Health and Social Welfare, the necessity to hear all parties involved in the process 
of closing orphanages has delayed the work of the task force. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Harmful traditional practices 
</b></p>
<p>43. The traditional system endorses harmful and life-threatening practices, such as trial by 
ordeal, a process whereby the guilt or innocence of an accused is determined by whether they 
complete a difficult or painful task. These practices are in violation of the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, ratified by Liberia, as 
well as of the Constitution of Liberia itself. Nonetheless, due to the weakness of the statutory law 
system, the practice is increasing in many parts of the country, including Monrovia. In July, in 
Maryland County, four people were identified by a &#8220;witch finder&#8221; as being responsible for 
causing a man&#8217;s leg to become swollen. The four, including the man&#8217;s elderly father and a 
female returned refugee, reportedly confessed to witchcraft after being beaten with hands and 
sticks by community members. 
</p>
<p>44. The practice of trial by ordeal is, in fact, allowed by the rules and regulations of the 
hinterland, which provide for the use of trial by ordeal as a means of resolving complaints 
between &#8220;uncivilized persons&#8221;. Being based on ethnic discrimination against Liberians living 
outside major cities, the rules and regulations contravene the Constitution of Liberia as well as </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the international human rights treaties ratified by the country. Despite the statement of the 
Solicitor General that trial by ordeal was illegal, the Ministry of Internal Affairs does not 
acknowledge its illegality or the illegality of the revised rules and regulations governing the 
hinterland of Liberia. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Linkage between poverty and human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>45. Poverty should be seen as multidimensional. It is often the cause and consequence of many 
human rights violations in Liberia. The poorest people have the fewest economic resources but 
also the lowest degree of social achievement and the least political power. The erosion of 
institutions resulting from 14 years of civil war has left the majority of people vulnerable to 
violation of the whole range of human rights - from the right to life to the right to food, the right 
to education and the right to fair trial. 
</p>
<p>46. The low level of economic development in the region has had a great impact on the 
capacities and livelihoods of citizens. Such inequalities have entrenched disaffection and 
grievances among various groups in the society. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>47. The agricultural system in Liberia is characterized by a quite developed sector of produce 
for export, such as rubber, cocoa and palm oil, and very low levels of primary agriculture, such 
as rice and vegetables. Though Liberia is one of the greenest countries in the world, the levels of 
small-holder productivity are extremely low; the country imports cabbages, carrots and other 
primary foodstuffs from other countries at high prices. Given that 76.2 per cent of Liberians live 
in poverty and 50 per cent of the population lives in extreme poverty, it is easy to understand the 
direct impact that this situation has on the daily life of people in the country. Stunting affects 
39 per cent of children under 5 years of age, 11 per cent of survey household are considered food 
insecure and 40 per cent highly vulnerable to food insecurity.<b>2</b> Seen from a human rights 
perspective, a large proportion of the population is unable to enjoy its right to food. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Right to work, fair remuneration and regular payment of wages 
</b></p>
<p>48. The unemployment rate in Liberia remains very high, approaching 80 per cent for the 
country as a whole, affecting rural areas in particular. Children are the main victims of the lax 
enforcement of even minimum human rights standards, since child labour is indirectly 
encouraged by exploitative work practices and lack of access to education.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>49. Section 1508 (3) of the Labour Law of Liberia has been a root cause of many labour 
disputes. Workers believed that employers used this law over recent years to violate their rights, 
which requires only very short notice for dismissal. Under pressure from different circles of 
society, the House of Representatives passed a bill to amend this section of the law in April. This 
amendment is a significant step in guaranteeing the rights of workers. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Right to physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p>50. Health services in Liberia have been severely disrupted by years of conflict. While 
revitalization of the health-care services has begun, it is still far from satisfactory and completed. 
</p>
<p>51. The infant mortality rate in Liberia is considerably higher than the average in the 
sub-Saharan region. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare estimates access to health 
services to be 41 per cent. The health-care system is fragmented, uneven in its provision of 
services between regions and heavily dependent on donor-funded vertical programmes and 
international non-governmental organizations. In most cases, these organizations have replaced 
the Government in managing health services. This causes serious problems for the country in the 
recovery phase, since support service delivery focuses mainly on the most war-affected areas. 
Local non-governmental organizations, which were very active before the war, have witnessed 
their operations shrink considerably. In 2006, of 521 existing health facilities, 300 were 
assisted by international non-governmental organizations in a humanitarian context, 132 were 
non-functional and 89 facilities operated without any assistance from international 
non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>52. Of the functioning facilities, 46 per cent have no water supply and 88 per cent have no 
vehicle for emergency evacuation. There are approximately 4,000 full-time and 1,000 part-time 
staff members. Among them, only 121 are medical doctors. However, many of these 
professionals lack the skills and experience necessary to manage the facilities and deliver 
services efficiently. In general, morale is very low among medical staff owing to poor pay and 
inadequate conditions to perform their duties efficiently. As international non-governmental 
organizations are switching from emergency relief to development, there is a real risk that 
service delivery in the health-care system will weaken in these areas as the Government is not 
ready to take over from humanitarian non-governmental organizations. In other words, the 
right to health care of many Liberians is in danger while the country is in transition from the 
post-conflict phase to the recovery, reconstruction and development phase. 
</p>
<p>53. With regard to antenatal care, 79 per cent of women reported having seen a health 
professional (a doctor, nurse or physician assistant) at least once for antenatal care for the 
most recent birth. Coverage for antenatal care is much higher in urban areas (94.4 per cent) than 
in rural areas (71.6 per cent). The proportion of mothers reporting that they had received 
antenatal care from a health professional is markedly lower in the north central region 
(63 per cent) than in the south central region (93 per cent) or Monrovia (96 per cent). Mothers 
who have a higher educational level visit health professionals for antenatal care more than 
mothers who have a lower educational level. Antenatal care coverage rises from 74.1 per cent 
among women with no education to 93.1 per cent among those with at least some secondary </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>education. While 32.2 per cent of births in the rural areas are delivered by a health professional 
and only 25.5 per cent in a health facility, in urban areas these rates are 78.8 per cent and 
63.5 per cent respectively. Consequently, maternal mortality and morbidity have increased, 
including obstetric fistula. 
</p>
<p>54. The child mortality rate is a basic indicator of a country&#8217;s social economic level and 
quality of life. In Liberia, the situation of vaccination of children is alarming; 12 per cent of 
children have received no vaccination at all. As a result, Liberia has one of the highest under-5 
mortality rates in the world (235 children per 1,000 live births). 
</p>
<p>55. HIV/AIDS is a serious public health threat in Liberia, with a prevalence of 5.2 per cent. 
According to a survey by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, women are slightly more 
likely to be HIV positive than men (1.8 versus 1.2 per cent). HIV prevalence is about three times 
higher in urban areas than in rural areas (2.5 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively). Women 
with elementary education have the highest prevalence, at 6.6 per cent. 
</p>
<p>56. In spite of the dire need for adequate mental health facilities, particularly in the light of the 
traumas of the civil war, the entire country has only one mental health clinic. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>57. The civil war has completely destroyed 20 per cent of schools, while many of those 
remaining are in urgent need of repair. Only 24 per cent of children enrolled in public primary 
schools have access to desks and chairs, and many classrooms do not have blackboards, desks or 
chairs for teachers. The quality of education is in a critical state, with the current pupil to 
textbook ratio in public primary and secondary schools at 27:1 and 9:1, respectively. 
</p>
<p>58. Thanks to the promotion of a free and compulsory primary school policy since 2006, the 
country has seen a great increase in enrolment, especially among girls. In public primary 
schools, the enrolment of girls increased by 24 per cent between 2006 and 2007 compared with 
18 per cent for boys during the same period. The large increases in student enrolment have 
created, however, new strain on a critically under-resourced public primary school system. 
Compounding the serious problems in the sector, poorly paid teachers are now faced with large 
classes representing a broad range of ages. 
</p>
<p>59. Primary school enrolment of boys is 458,012 against 436,394 of girls (school year 2005-6). 
However, the geographic distribution of primary education enrolment is very uneven throughout 
the country. Two counties, Montserrado and Nimba, account for over half of enrolments. These 
two counties also have the greatest share of the population, but their share of enrolments is 
proportionally greater. 
</p>
<p>60. There is a significant disparity in access to secondary school: few female students attain 
the minimum qualification to gain access to higher levels of education, particularly in the 
Grand Kru, Lofa and River Cess Counties. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>61. The number of pregnant school-age girls has been increasing in Liberia, partly due to rape 
and/or unwanted pregnancies. These girls often face difficulties in continuing their education. To 
address the issue, the Minister for Education has agreed to consider the possibility of opening 
schools for pregnant girls to ensure that they are given equal access to education. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Distribution of resources and services 
</b></p>
<p>62. The economy is characterized by its dualism; the export-oriented plantation and minerals 
sectors (rubber, palm oil, timber and diamonds) attract private and public investments, 
generating growth and wealth, while traditional agriculture has received little investment and 
remains stagnant. Economic and social infrastructure, such as roads, schools and hospitals, are 
geographically concentrated in urban and coastal zones, while rural areas are poorly served. The 
concentration of economic power and resources overlaps with the concentration of political 
power, which is in the hands of the Americo-Liberian elite.<b> </b>Since there is no middle class in 
post-conflict Liberia, there is a huge gap separating the upper class (Americo-Liberians) from the 
rest of Liberian society that constitutes the lower class. Because of the limited economic 
resources, there is competition among people for the distribution of national wealth and the 
geographical spread of national infrastructure; the most economically and politically powerful 
have access to and control of economic resources. 
</p>
<p>63. Indicators on access to health-care services, schools and infrastructures demonstrate a wide 
disparity between the rural and urban areas (see section V above). 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  WORKSHOP TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>64. A workshop was conducted by UNMIL and the Committee on the Independent National 
Commission on Human Rights on 27 September 2007. Discussion at the workshop focused on 
ways to promote and protect human rights in the context of persisting harmful traditional 
practices. 
</p>
<p>65. Though article 5 (b) of the Liberian Constitution states that &#8220;the Republic shall preserve, 
protect and promote positive Liberian culture, ensuring that traditional values which are 
compatible with public policy and national progress are adopted and developed as an integral 
part of the growing needs of the Liberian society&#8221;, many harmful traditional practices are still 
widespread in the country, such as trial by ordeal, early marriage of girls, female genital 
mutilation and compulsory dowries. 
</p>
<p>66. Workshop participants agreed that the Government&#8217;s decision to abolish harmful 
traditional practices should be coordinated with different stakeholders. In the meantime, it is 
necessary to organize campaigns to raise the awareness of the population on the impact of 
harmful practices on the implementation of human rights. Participants also concurred that the 
rules and regulations governing the hinterland of Liberia should be either abolished or revised to 
bring them into line with the international human rights treaties that the Government has ratified. 
To do that, the main responsibility will be in the hands of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The 
establishment of the Independent National Human Rights Commission is vital to the monitoring </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of human rights violations in the country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the responsibility 
for effectively distributing all copies of relevant ratified instruments to the judiciary and all 
Liberians. Non-governmental organizations should challenge injustices, even those in the courts; 
they should start to see themselves as pressure groups challenging the status quo.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  GAPS AND CONCERNS 
</b></p>
<p>67. Funds from donors seem to be disbursed unequally between different counties, mainly 
because of the lack of infrastructure. Counties in the south-east received less funds and 
interventions than other parts of the country. Furthermore, belated funding, such as in the case of 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, create serious problems for the implementation of 
planned activities. 
</p>
<p>68. The lack of coordination in addressing cross-cutting issues such as human rights is a 
serious concern. The collaboration between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of 
Justice seems to be very poor when harmonizing Liberian domestic laws with the international 
treaties ratified by the Government as well as in distributing copies of international human rights 
treaties to judiciary staff. 
</p><p>69. Lack of capacity was widely recognized as one of the most serious problems of 
government officers and civil society organizations. In Governments, ministers are often highly 
qualified. However, the lack of capacity and professionalism of ministry staff impedes the 
implementation of government economic and social development policies. Civil society is 
generally committed to the implementation of human rights standards in Liberia but frequently 
lacks the technical knowledge of how that should be achieved. A major weakness of civil society 
groups in Liberia is that they are mostly based in Monrovia and have little or no presence in the 
hinterland. The media need to do more to draw attention to serious human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>70. From an economic standpoint, the devastation caused by the war has created great reliance 
on foreign direct assistance that must be replaced by enhanced local capacities, creativity and 
initiative. The lack of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and electricity, has also impeded the 
rebuilding of Liberian economic and social life. It has also hampered the efforts of many donors 
and non-governmental organizations to reach remote areas of the country, especially in the 
south-eastern part. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>71. Though Liberia faces serious challenges in rebuilding its economy and society, the 
Government has made noteworthy progress in improving the human rights situation of its 
citizens. Initiatives launched by the Government, including the promotion of law reform and 
support for poverty reduction schemes targeting vulnerable groups in the population, 
demonstrate a commitment to ensure that all Liberians have access to justice and are able to 
enjoy their basic human rights, including the right to life, the right to health and the right to 
education. 
</p>
<p>72. For this potential to be realized, however, a number of issues will have to be addressed. 
Gaps in capacities and resources threaten the ability of the health and education systems to 
provide essential services to the population as a whole and to certain vulnerable groups in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>particular. As a result, social problems such as high rates of illiteracy, infant mortality and 
HIV/AIDS cannot be adequately addressed. Lack of capacity and poor organization have 
undermined the ability of the justice system to combat gender-based violence and other human 
rights violations. Delays in establishing the Independent Human Rights Commission and a law 
reform commission jeopardize the credibility of the Government in human rights protection and 
law reform as well as the progress it has made in these critical areas. 
</p>
<p>73. Owing to the close relationship between poverty in all its forms, human rights violations 
and conflict, the stakes in resolving the above-mentioned problems are high. The recent past of 
Liberia has clearly shown the tragic consequences that can result from neglecting political, civil, 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS

<p>77.<b> The independent expert invites donor countries: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>To respect their commitment to the Paris Declaration by aligning the provision of

among each other; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>To provide firmer commitments on the amount and timing of aid.</b> 
</p>
<p>78.<b> Furthermore, the independent expert calls on the United Nations Mission in Liberia: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>To assist in developing the capacity of civil society in Liberia to provide 
constructive inputs into policymaking processes at the national and subnational 
levels; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>To assist the Government in evaluating the results of the pilot project to 
incorporate stronger human rights commitments into concession agreements with 
rubber plantations and extractive industries and to support the Government in 
developing model agreements based on that project.</b> 
</p>
<p>79.<b> The independent expert invites the United Nations country team to collaborate to 
create shelters for victims of gender-based violence. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The independent expert calls on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>To provide more training materials on human rights to the Human Rights Unit of 
the Ministry of Justice; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Alongside the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, 
the European Union, United Nations agencies and UNMIL, to collaborate with the 
Government and all stakeholders to provide training and possibilities for
