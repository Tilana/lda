<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, pursuant to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 24/5. The document provides observations on the communications addressed by 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur to States, and on the replies received. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present addendum, the Special Rapporteur provides observations, on 
</p>
<p>communications sent to States between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015. This report 
</p>
<p>further contains observations on responses to the aforementioned communications received 
</p>
<p>from States until 30 April 2015. The addendum also includes press releases issued between 
</p>
<p>1 March 2014 and 30 April 2015. Communications sent, responses received and press 
</p>
<p>releases during the reporting period are accessible electronically through hyperlinks. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is aware of responses received after the reporting deadline that could 
</p>
<p>not be reflected in the present report. He takes this opportunity to highlight the importance 
</p>
<p>of timely replies. 
</p>
<p>3. For ease of reference, cases have been grouped by region, with countries within each 
</p>
<p>region listed alphabetically according to their names in English. Each communication is 
</p>
<p>referenced as an urgent appeal (UA) or other letter (OL), followed by the date the 
</p>
<p>communication was issued, the case number and the date of the State reply. Press releases 
</p>
<p>(PR) published during the reporting period are referenced below the communications in 
</p>
<p>chronological order. 
</p>
<p>4. The communications and the relevant replies can also be accessed via the 
</p>
<p>incorporated links or in the communications reports of Special Procedures A/HRC/27/72 
</p>
<p>(communications sent from 1 March 2014 to 31 May 2014 and replies received from 1 May 
</p>
<p>2014  to 31 July 2014), A/HRC/28/85 (communications sent from 1 June 2014 to 30 
</p>
<p>November 2014 and replies received from 1 August 2014 to 31 January 2015), and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/29/50 (communications sent from 1 December 2014 and 28 February 2015 and 
</p>
<p>replies received between 1 February and 30 April 2015). 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all States that have transmitted responses to 
</p>
<p>communications sent. He considers response to his communications an important part of 
</p>
<p>cooperation by States with his mandate. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls 
</p>
<p>paragraph 6 of the Human Rights Council resolution 24/5 that calls upon States &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>continue to cooperate fully with and assist him in the performance of his mandate [and] to 
</p>
<p>respond promptly to his urgent appeals and other communications&#8230;&#8221; Therefore, he urges 
</p>
<p>all States which have not yet replied to his communications to do so without further delay.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary 
</b></p>
<p>6. Between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015, the Special Rapporteur sent 186 
</p>
<p>communications to 68 States. Of these communications, 101 were urgent appeals and 85 
</p>
<p>were other letters. A total of 68 cases consisted of follow-ups of cases that were previously 
</p>
<p>the subject of communications, including 29 press releases. 
</p>
<p>7.  Examined by region, the figures show that 21 communications were addressed to 
</p>
<p>countries in the Africa region (11 per cent), 36 to countries in the Americas region (19 per 
</p>
<p>cent), 63 in the Asia-Pacific region (34 per cent), 28 in the Europe and Central Asia region 
</p>
<p>(15 per cent), and 38 in the Middle East and North Africa region (20 per cent).  
</p>
<p>8. During the reporting period, there was an average response-rate of 53 per cent to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications. While certain replies were merely </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>acknowledgements or receipt, the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank countries who have 
</p>
<p>fully engaged and cooperated with the Special Procedures mechanisms and provided 
</p>
<p>detailed information in response to the allegations addressed therein. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur sent 44 communications on alleged violations of the right to 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and 106 on the right to freely associate, while 36 communications refer 
</p>
<p>to both rights. Moreover, 127 of his communications concern alleged failure of States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>positive obligations to establish and maintain an enabling environment for civil society and 
</p>
<p>to actively protect peaceful assemblies, 36 communications concern alleged violations of 
</p>
<p>States of their negative obligations to not unduly obstruct the exercise of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association and to not unduly interfere with the right to peaceful assembly, and 
</p>
<p>23 communications concern alleged violations of both obligations. Out of the 186 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period, 35 concern laws and draft laws and 68 are 
</p>
<p>follow-ups to cases previously addressed by the Special Procedures. 
</p>
<p>10. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur sent 17 communications concerning alleged acts 
</p>
<p>of intimidation and reprisals against civil society activists for their cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights. During the 
</p>
<p>reporting period, he sent communications about alleged acts of reprisals to the following 
</p>
<p>countries: China, Cyprus, Honduras, Iran, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. In this context, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
</p>
<p>reiterate that the Human Rights Council, in resolution 22/6, strongly called upon all States 
</p>
<p>to &#8220;refrain from, and ensure adequate protection from, any act of intimidation or reprisals 
</p>
<p>against those who cooperate, have cooperated or seek to cooperate with international 
</p>
<p>institutions, including their family members and associates&#8221;. Furthermore, he recalls that in 
</p>
<p>resolution 24/24, the Human Rights Council urges all States to prevent and refrain from all 
</p>
<p>acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who seek to cooperate of have cooperated with 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, or who 
</p>
<p>have provided testimony or information to them. The resolution also urges States to ensure 
</p>
<p>accountability for any acts of such intimidation or reprisal. The United Nations Secretary-
</p>
<p>General, in his 2014 report to the Human Rights Council on cooperation with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, reminds that it is 
</p>
<p>primarily the obligation of States to protect those who cooperate with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>and to ensure that they may do so safely and without hindrance. He urged to &#8220;collectively 
</p>
<p>denounce reprisals, defend the rights to cooperate freely with the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>protect those targeted&#8221; (A/HRC/27/28). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Africa region 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the present reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 21 communications 
</p>
<p>to countries in the Africa region. He takes note of the response rate of 29 per cent for the 
</p>
<p>region. He strongly urges States who have not responded to communications to do so 
</p>
<p>without further delay, as part of their continuous dialogue and cooperation with the Special 
</p>
<p>Procedures of the Human Rights Council and in line with resolution 24/5 (2013).  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur is disappointed to note that some Governments fail to see 
</p>
<p>associations, and in particular human rights associations, as crucial partners for both good 
</p>
<p>governance and the strengthening of functioning democracies. He continues to witness 
</p>
<p>States aiming to obstruct the free operations of associations by passing complex laws that 
</p>
<p>create confusion and fear among civil society and threaten to create self-censorship among 
</p>
<p>associations. With this in mind, he expresses concern about Governments&#8217; increasing resort 
</p>
<p>to restrictive laws that curb the right to freedom of association and argues for the need for 
</p>
<p>further regulations for a variety of reasons, including for &#8216;greater transparency&#8217;. In addition, 
</p>
<p>he recalls that such laws violate States&#8217; international commitments and that most </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>importantly, fundamental freedoms are needed more than ever in situations where people 
</p>
<p>disagree with the prevailing views and opinions. 
</p>
<p>13. In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses that States should always promote 
</p>
<p>and protect the right to associate and strive to restrict this right only in very limited 
</p>
<p>circumstances in accordance with their international obligations. He reminds that under 
</p>
<p>those specific circumstances, ambiguous restrictions are not allowed. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>restrictions must be both necessary and proportionate, not convenient and haphazard, lest 
</p>
<p>those rare exceptions become the rule. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to reemphasize the two basic 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of States to not unduly interfere when it is not required (i.e. its negative 
</p>
<p>obligation) and to promote and protect (its positive obligation). These, he reminds, are 
</p>
<p>concurrent obligations. Therefore, if an assembly remains peaceful, it has to be protected. 
</p>
<p>The dispersal of assemblies should be a last resort and done only when circumstances 
</p>
<p>necessitate this exception. 
</p>
<p>15. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur recalls that he stands ready to provide technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to ensure that States&#8217; normative frameworks and practices comply with 
</p>
<p>international human rights norms and standards governing freedoms of association and 
</p>
<p>assembly. He notes that country visits allow for him to analyse situations on the ground and 
</p>
<p>to engage with local actors. He encourages countries to respond favourably to his requests 
</p>
<p>for country visits.

</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Ethiopia for its reply to one 
</p>
<p>communication sent during this reporting period. However, he expresses his regret that the 
</p>
<p>Government has not provided responses to the questions raised in the three other 
</p>
<p>communications directed to its attention. He considers responses to his communications to 
</p>
<p>be an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate and urges the 
</p>
<p>authorities to comply with Human Rights Council resolutions on the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association. These resolutions, including resolution 24/5 (2013), 
</p>
<p>call on States to cooperate fully with and assist him in the performance of his mandate and 
</p>
<p>to respond promptly to his communications. In the absence of information to the contrary, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur concludes that there is validity in the allegations presented in his 
</p>
<p>communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercise 
</i></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur restates his utmost concern for six members of the so-called 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Zone Nine Bloggers&#8221; and three freelance journalists charged with terrorism under the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code and the 2009 Anti-Terrorism Proclamation for allegedly working with 
</p>
<p>foreign human rights organizations and inciting violence through social media to create 
</p>
<p>instability in the country (ETH 2/2015, ETH 3/2014 and PR 24/04/2015). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reminds that their detention and trial under the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, 
</p>
<p>and the charges brought against them, do not appear to comply with international, regional, 
</p>
<p>and domestic human rights law and standards. He further takes the opportunity to urge the 
</p>
<p>Government of Ethiopia to stop misusing anti-terrorism legislation to restrict the freedoms 
</p>
<p>of expression and association in the country (PR 18/09/2014), and to implement relevant 
</p>
<p>the recommendations accepted in this regard during its second cycle of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Periodic Review without further delay (A/HRC/WG.6/19/L.12). 
</p>
<p>38. He stresses that it is the obligation of States to respect and fully protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online as well as offline 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/RES/24/5, operational paragraph 2). Moreover, he reaffirms that the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are necessary elements for the possible 
</p>
<p>emergence and sustainability of effective democratic systems. In this regard, States should 
</p>
<p>therefore make every effort to facilitate those rights.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned regarding the alleged arbitrary detention 
</p>
<p>of Mr. Olbana Lelisa and Mr. Bekele Gerba, both long-standing opposition politicians who 
</p>
<p>campaigned in the 2010 national elections, and their alleged denial of necessary medical 
</p>
<p>treatment in detention (ETH 7/2014). He thanks the Government for its detailed response, 
</p>
<p>but reaffirms his concerns that actions against them were motivated by their peaceful 
</p>
<p>exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association and remains especially 
</p>
<p>worried about the use of unlawful reasons to curtail these rights.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned by the reported repression of peaceful 
</p>
<p>protests by security forces and military special forces, including in high schools and 
</p>
<p>universities in the central, eastern and western parts of the Oromia regional state. He 
</p>
<p>reiterates his dismay at the alleged use of live ammunition and hand grenades against 
</p>
<p>peaceful protestors and bystanders, their beatings and subsequent mass arrests after door-to-
</p>
<p>door searches. He expresses his grave concern at the deaths of at least 35 peaceful 
</p>
<p>protestors, including children, in various cities of the Oromia state, and at the injuring of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>numerous others (ETH 5/2014). The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to inform him 
</p>
<p>at the earliest of the results of the investigations of the circumstances leading to the killings, 
</p>
<p>as well as of the status of investigations and interim measures put in place concerning the 
</p>
<p>allegations of unlawful arrests and torture. He emphasizes that the right to life should be 
</p>
<p>guaranteed by States to all individuals under all circumstances and at all times, including in 
</p>
<p>the context of the exercise of the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, 
</p>
<p>as prescribed by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In addition, and 
</p>
<p>while expressing his serious concern at the reported instances of torture and ill-treatment, 
</p>
<p>he recalls the importance of ensuring a free and unhampered enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>assembly and protest to build peaceful and democratic societies. To this end, he urges the 
</p>
<p>Government of Ethiopia to respect, protect and fulfil the right to peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>41. He reminds the authorities of the Government of Ethiopia that protestors seek to 
</p>
<p>convey opinions and, very often, challenge norms, and insists that while the State do not 
</p>
<p>have to agree with the opinions and criticisms expressed by people who embrace different 
</p>
<p>convictions or beliefs, it has a positive obligation to ensure the existence of an environment 
</p>
<p>in which everyone can enjoy the right of peaceful assembly freely and without fear 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63). The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
</p>
<p>establish a presumption in favour of peaceful assemblies in law in a clear and explicit 
</p>
<p>manner. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Ethiopia of his country visit 
</p>
<p>requests sent in 2011 and 2013, to which a response is yet to be received. He believes such 
</p>
<p>a country visit may be an opportunity to discuss any technical assistance that the

<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government&#8217;s acknowledgment of one of 
</p>
<p>his communications. However, he regrets that the Government of Kenya failed to provide 
</p>
<p>substantial responses to the questions raised in his communications since the establishment 
</p>
<p>of the mandate in 2011. He considers responses to his communications as an important part 
</p>
<p>of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate and urges again the authorities to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>comply with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 
</p>
<p>(2010) that call upon States to cooperate fully with him and assist him in the performance 
</p>
<p>of his mandate and to respond promptly to his communications. In the absence of 
</p>
<p>information to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in the 
</p>
<p>allegations presented in his communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  The Security Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2014 
</i></p>
<p>48. As indicated in the communication sent on 18 December 2014 (KEN 7/2014), the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur recalls that the Government of Kenya committed to protect and promote 
</p>
<p>rights set forth in international human rights law and standards, and in that regard, looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving a detailed reply to the concerns raised in his letter, including 
</p>
<p>information the outcome of the debates related to the case, as soon as possible. He remains 
</p>
<p>seriously concerned about certain provisions of the Security Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2014 
</p>
<p>that may negatively interfere with the ability of associations to freely perform their 
</p>
<p>activities and of individuals to publicly expresstheir views. Similarly, he remains concerned 
</p>
<p>by the vague wording of some of the provisions and cautions the authorities against 
</p>
<p>ambiguous legal provisions governing the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association that increase the risk of abuses and violations of these rights and infuse fear of 
</p>
<p>breaking the law among society activists, which in turn can lead to self-censorship. 
</p>
<p>49. In addition, the Special Rapporteur warns against the practice of resorting to security 
</p>
<p>considerations to adopt stricter measures that annul fundamental rights and freedoms. He 
</p>
<p>articulates that there should be a presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies and 
</p>
<p>associating freely. In his view, excessive restrictions, mass surveillance and shows of force 
</p>
<p>attest that authorities in some Member States often presume the opposite, which has a 
</p>
<p>chilling effect on civil society activism. He stresses that security considerations should not 
</p>
<p>be used as a justification for unduly strict rules or interpretations that void the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur reminds the State of its obligation to ensure a conducive 
</p>
<p>environment for the free exercise of the rights of peaceful assembly and association, rights 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, acceded by the State 
</p>
<p>on 1 May 1972. It also restates that, according to this same Covenant, only a very limited 
</p>
<p>number of restrictions to these rights may apply, which should be prescribed by law and 
</p>
<p>necessary in a democratic society for responding to a pressing social need for the 
</p>
<p>interference. 
</p>
<p>51. In relation to the clauses aiming at countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recalls that even during a state of emergency, the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and of association shall not be derogated. He advocates that when absolutely necessary, the  
</p>
<p>measures provided by the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are adequate 
</p>
<p>to combat terrorism or handle other security considerations. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur encourages the State to overturn any legislation that curtails 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the cases brought to his attention 
</p>
<p>during the period under review. Namely, he reiterates his preoccupation at prima facie 
</p>
<p>violations of the State&#8217;s positive obligation to actively protect peaceful assemblies and to 
</p>
<p>make sure members of association can operate freely and without fear. 
</p>
<p>54. He urges the Government of Kenya to put in place an enabling environment for 
</p>
<p>associations to operate safely and for protests to take place free from undue restrictions. He 
</p>
<p>remains concerned about the reported intimidation and threats against organizers of a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>February 2014 (KEN 3/2014) and December 2014 (KEN 1/2015). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its invitation to carry out a visit 
</p>
<p>to the country during the second half of March 2016. He hopes to revert back to the 
</p>
<p>authorities in the briefest delays with a proposal for dates for this visit, within the 
</p>
<p>framework of his other mandated activities for 2016, and reiterates his appreciation to the 
</p>
<p>Government for its collaboration with the mandate.

<p>violations may be occurring as a direct result of their legitimate human rights work and 
</p>
<p>their exercise of the right to peaceful assembly and to freedom of opinion and expression, 
</p>
<p>especially in the context of the 12 January 2015 assemblies. Furthermore, he is particular 
</p>
<p>worried about the smear campaign directed against Mr. Sembereka and both 
</p>
<p>MANERELA+ and CEDEP. 
</p>
<p>59. In relation to the alleged threat to deregister non-governmental organizations&#8217; 
</p>
<p>participating in the protests, he reminds the Government of the Malawi that the action to 
</p>
<p>suspend or dissolve an association is one of the severest types of restrictions on freedom of 
</p>
<p>association. Therefore, any such decision to suspend or dissolve an association should 
</p>
<p>comply with international human rights law and standards, namely it should be guided by 
</p>
<p>the principles of proportionality and necessity (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 75). 
</p>
<p>60. He reiterates his recommendation to the Government to put in place an enabling and 
</p>
<p>safe environment that is conducive to the free expression of civil society and political 
</p>
<p>activists allowing individuals to exercise their legitimate freedom of association without </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>undue hindrances. He calls upon the authorities of Malawi to investigate any allegations of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, including acts of intimidations or harassments, committed against 
</p>
<p>those exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit

<p>61. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for accepting his request to carry out 
</p>
<p>a visit to Malawi, as per its letter of 16 January 2014. He sincerely hopes to revert back to 
</p>
<p>the authorities in the briefest delays with a proposal for dates for this visit, within the 
</p>
<p>framework of his other mandated activities, and reiterates his appreciation to the

</p>

<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, to date, no reply has been received to his 
</p>
<p>communication in relation to a proposed Bill to &#8220;Regulate the Acceptance and Utilization 
</p>
<p>of Financial/Material Contribution of Donor agencies to Voluntary Organizations and for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Matters Connected Therewith&#8221;. He recalls that responses to his communications are an 
</p>
<p>important part of the cooperation of the Government of Nigeria with his mandate, and urges 
</p>
<p>the authorities to comply with Human Rights Council resolutions on the rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly and of association. These resolutions, including resolution 24/5 
</p>
<p>(2013), call on States to cooperate fully with and assist him in the performance of his 
</p>
<p>mandate and to respond promptly to his communications.  
</p>
<p><i>  Proposed Bill to regulate voluntary organizations  
</i></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his preoccupation that the prohibition of voluntary 
</p>
<p>organizations to receive foreign funds without registration, under sections 2 and 3 of the 
</p>
<p>proposed Bill, is not in compliance with the right to freedom of association, which denotes 
</p>
<p>restrictions to the right only under very specific circumstances. He also expresses dismay at 
</p>
<p>the inability of voluntary associations to appeal restrictive decisions that prevent them from 
</p>
<p>receiving funds from international donors. In relation to provisions on the access to funds 
</p>
<p>and requirements for such access, he notes that the Government of Nigeria should ensure 
</p>
<p>that all associations &#8220;can seek, receive and use funding and other resources from natural 
</p>
<p>and legal persons, whether domestic, foreign or international, without prior authorization or 
</p>
<p>other undue impediments, including from individuals; associations, foundations or other 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations; foreign Governments and aid agencies; the private sector; the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and other entities&#8221; (A/HRC/23/39, para. 82(b)).   
</p>
<p>68. Concerning the clause stipulating that all voluntary organizations can receive foreign 
</p>
<p>funds only if they agree to receive such contribution through State channels, he is of the 
</p>
<p>opinion that this may result in discretionary and arbitrary enforcement. This, along with the 
</p>
<p>requirement to report on all funds received from foreign sources and how these are 
</p>
<p>allocated or used, as well the requirement to obtain authorization from the authorities to 
</p>
<p>receive or use funds, constitute human rights violations (A/HRC/23/39, paragraph 36). He 
</p>
<p>further clarifies, particularly in reference to the inspection requirements, that the right of 
</p>
<p>independent bodies to examine the associations&#8217; records with the goal of ensuring 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability should be in accordance with the principle of non-
</p>
<p>discrimination and the right to privacy. The right should not be exercised arbitrarily since it 
</p>
<p>would otherwise place the independence of associations and the safety of their members at 
</p>
<p>risk  (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 65). 
</p>
<p>69. While noting that the aforementioned proposed Bill provides for criminal sanctions 
</p>
<p>against individuals contravening its provisions, including section 11, he cautions against 
</p>
<p>measures that aim to deter people from exercising their fundamental right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association. He specifies that the possibility of disproportionate sentences can have  a 
</p>
<p>dissuasive effect on people wishing to exercise this right (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 62). 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is also preoccupied by the vague and imprecise definition of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Voluntary Organizations&#8221; in section 14 of the proposed Bill, which makes it difficult to 
</p>
<p>foresee all the types of organizations which the Bill may cover. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur further requests full details of the proposed Bill, including 
</p>
<p>the legal status, and an explanation of how its provisions are in accordance with Nigeria&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights law and standards, particularly with regard to 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of association. He stands ready to provide technical assistance to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the State&#8217;s normative framework complies with international human rights 
</p>
<p>norms and standards governing freedoms of association and assembly, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the mandate attributed to him by the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to Nigeria, as indicated by his October 2013 letter to the Government. He </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3

<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>trusts that such a visit would allow him to examine issues relating to his mandate, identify 
</p>
<p>good practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to relevant stakeholders. He looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving a positive reply at the earliest possible opportunity and reiterates that

</p>
<p>the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LIPRODHOR).  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur notes that he has not received a response to the allegations 
</p>
<p>contained in his communication indicating that the ousted members of the LIPRODHOR 
</p>
<p>had been arrested for their legitimate exercise of the right to associate (RWA 2/2014). He 
</p>
<p>considers responses to the questions raised in his communications as an important part of 
</p>
<p>the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, in accordance with Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). In the absence of 
</p>
<p>information to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in the 
</p>
<p>allegations presented in his communication. 
</p>
<p><i>  Negative obligation of the State to not unduly interfere with these rights 
</i></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his grave concern about the reported arrests and 
</p>
<p>temporary detentions of ousted members of LIPRODHOR and the prohibition to let them 
</p>
<p>hold a general assembly meeting in November 2014. Furthermore, he restates that through 
</p>
<p>the reported formal recognition of the of LIPRODHOR&#8217;s disputed new leadership in 2013, 
</p>
<p>the Rwanda Governance Board appears to have unlawfully interfered with the right of 
</p>
<p>associations to freely determine their own boards, status and activities.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur warns against States&#8217; interferences that may seriously 
</p>
<p>impair the enjoyment of the rights under his mandate (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 20). He 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the negative obligation of Rwandan authorities not to unduly obstruct the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right to freedom of association. Members of associations should be free to 
</p>
<p>determine their statutes, structure and activities and make decisions without State 
</p>
<p>interference and associations pursuing objectives and employing means in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international human rights law should benefit from international legal protection 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 64).  
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to reiterate his thanks to the 
</p>
<p>Government for the visit he undertook from 20 to 27 January 2014. He recalls the 
</p>
<p>exemplary cooperation of the Government during the mission and remains grateful for its 
</p>
<p>willingness to continue its efforts  to engage in open and constructive dialogue. </p>

</p>
<p>obligation to respect and protect fundamental human rights, including the right of all

<p>individuals to freely associate. He underlines that this right involves the positive obligation 
</p>
<p>to establish an enabling environment for members of associations to perform their activities 
</p>
<p>without fear from threats or acts of intimidation and harassment of any sort. He also echoes 
</p>
<p>the concerns of the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination Against Women and the Human Rights Committee which reviewed Sierra 
</p>
<p>Leone in the past year, and that mention, among others, continuous reports of violence

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur regrets not to have received a response to his 
</p>
<p>communication in relation to the alleged imminent adoption of the Non-Governmental 
</p>
<p>Organization Bill, 2013 whose provisions seem to contradict South Sudan&#8217;s international 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations (SSD 1/2014). He reminds the Government that he considers 
</p>
<p>responses to his communications as an integral part of States&#8217; cooperation with his 
</p>
<p>mandate, according to Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 
</p>
<p>15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Non-Governmental Organization Bill, 2013 
</i></p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that narrowly defining the 
</p>
<p>permissible work and objectives of associations represents an unnecessary limitation to the 
</p>
<p>right of association. Additionally, he recalls that Governments are responsible for not </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>unduly interfering through excessive regulations with the right of associations to freely 
</p>
<p>determine their statutes, members and activities. Moreover, he emphasizes that the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association equally protects associations that are not registered and that the 
</p>
<p>activities of associations should not be subject to prior authorization, which could be used 
</p>
<p>to quell criticism. In this regard, he reiterates his concern that registration procedures as 
</p>
<p>introduced by the Non-Government Organization Bill, 2013 are burdensome and subject to 
</p>
<p>administrative discretion. He also reiterates his belief that newly adopted laws should not 
</p>
<p>request previously registered associations to re-register as this would protected existing 
</p>
<p>associations against arbitrary rejection of their applications or time gaps in the conduct of 
</p>
<p>their activities. 
</p>
<p>83. While noting that the aforementioned Bill provides for severe criminal sanctions 
</p>
<p>against individuals contravening its provisions, he caution against measures that aim to 
</p>
<p>deter people from exercising their fundamental right to freedom of association. Such 
</p>
<p>measures seem to attest a presumption against associations&#8217; right to exist and operate and 
</p>
<p>have a deterring effect on people wishing to exercise this right (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 
</p>
<p>62). 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur understands that the National Legislative Assembly passed 
</p>
<p>the Non-Governmental Organization Bill, 2013, which is currently awaiting the President&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>assent to become law. He asks the authorities to provide him with a copy of the Bill and to 
</p>
<p>inform him about the legal procedure for its entry into force , at the earliest opportunity. 
</p>
<p>85.  In the meantime, the Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of South Sudan 
</p>
<p>to repeal restrictive laws regulating associations and to ensure that the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association, as recognized under article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is 
</p>
<p>enjoyed free of arbitrary restrictions. He stands ready to provide technical assistance to 
</p>
<p>ensure that State&#8217;s normative framework complies with international human rights norms 
</p>
<p>and standards governing freedoms of association and assembly. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to echo the concerns expressed by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in a recent report that conveys 
</p>
<p>concern about a climate of fear and repression against civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/53, paragraph 24). In this regard, he urges the Government of South Sudan to 
</p>
<p>ratify all the core international human rights instruments including the International

<p><i>  Responses to communications

<p>90. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Sudan for its response to the 
</p>
<p>allegations referring to the arbitrary closure of the Salmmah Women&#8217;s Resource Centre in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19

<p>June 2014 (SND 4/2014) and the arrest and incommunicado detention of student activist 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mohamed Salah Mohamed Abdelrhman (SDN 3/2014). However, he regrets that the 
</p>
<p>communication sent on 7 May 2014 about the alleged threats against human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders remains unanswered (SDN 1/2014). In this connection, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>urges the authorities to comply with Human Rights Council resolutions on the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association that call on States to respond promptly to 
</p>
<p>his communications, namely resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Negative obligation of the State to not to unduly interfere with these rights 
</i></p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur takes note that the authorities found no records of the 
</p>
<p>existence of a non-profitable association under the name of Salmmah Women&#8217;s Resource 
</p>
<p>Centre. Given the severity of the allegations and the fact that the reported arbitrary closure 
</p>
<p>of associations was the subject to a prior communication on 17 January 2013 (SDN 1/2013 
</p>
<p>and response 15/03/2013), the Special Rapporteur wishes to take this opportunity to remind 
</p>
<p>the Government of the Sudan that the action to suspend or dissolve an association is one of 
</p>
<p>the severest types of restrictions on freedom of association. Therefore, a decision to 
</p>
<p>suspend or dissolve an association should be used only when less restrictive measures 
</p>
<p>would be insufficient and should comply with international human rights law and standards, 
</p>
<p>namely be guided by the principles of proportionality and necessity (A/HRC/20/27, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 75). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned by the allegations of harassment and 
</p>
<p>threats against a member of the Human Rights Network for Democracy and his family and 
</p>
<p>trusts the Government will soon respond to the series of questions raised in his 
</p>
<p>communication (SDN 1/2014). Similarly, he expresses concern at the reported arrest and 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment in detention of a student activist who had voiced criticism against the handling 
</p>
<p>of the protests and alleged killing of a protestor in Khartoum in March 2014 (SDN 3/2014). 
</p>
<p>If verified, such actions could have a detrimental effect on other individuals exercising or 
</p>
<p>wishing to exercise this right. The Special Rapporteur recalls the concerns of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee at allegations indicating that State officials have subjected opponents and 
</p>
<p>perceived opponents of the Government, human rights defenders and other activists to 
</p>
<p>harassment, intimidation, arbitrary arrest and detention, and torture and ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/SDN/CO/4, paragraph 22). He reminds the Government of the Sudan of its 
</p>
<p>responsibility to guarantee an enabling environment for civil society activists to operate 
</p>

<p>Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  The Non-Governmental Organization Act No. 16 of 2009  
</i></p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur duly takes note of the steps undertaken by the authorities to 
</p>
<p>implement the said Act without causing disruptions in the activities of pre-existing 
</p>
<p>associations, including the aforementioned two non-governmental organizations. However, 
</p>
<p>he reiterates the concerns raised in a prior communication (ZMB 2/2013) where he 
</p>
<p>analysed the draft provisions of the Act following the reported decision to fully 
</p>
<p>operationalise it.  
</p>
<p>96. As previously expressed, he considers that the Non-Governmental Organizations 
</p>
<p>Act No. 16 of 2009 gives broad power and unfettered discretion to the Government to 
</p>
<p>interfere with the free operations of associations. Since it requires all non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations formed after its passing to register with a Board that is extensively influenced 
</p>
<p>by the Executive, and asks those in existence prior its enactment to apply for a certificate of 
</p>
<p>registration, the Act gives broad discretion to the Government of Zambia to deny 
</p>
<p>registration to associations. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is disappointed by the 
</p>
<p>decision of the authorities to enforce a law that violates international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>standards and urge them to reconsider their decision and to repeal the Non-Governmental 
</p>
<p>Organization Act No. 16 of 2009. He reminds the Government of Zambia that the action to 
</p>
<p>suspend or dissolve an association is one of the severest types of restrictions on freedom of 
</p>
<p>association. Therefore, a decision to suspend or dissolve an association should be used only 
</p>
<p>when other, less restrictive, measures would be insufficient and should comply with 
</p>
<p>international human rights law and standards, namely be guided by the principles of 
</p>
<p>proportionality and necessity (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 75). In addition, he underlines that 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of association equally protects associations that are not registered and 
</p>
<p>that the activities of associations should not be subject to prior authorization, which could 
</p>
<p>be used to quell criticism. 
</p>
<p>97. In connection with the above information, the Special Rapporteur warns against 
</p>
<p>restrictions used in a manner that impairs the right to assembly and refers to the General 
</p>
<p>Comment No. 31 of the Human Rights Committee on the nature of the general legal 
</p>
<p>obligation imposed on States parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, which states that &#8220;where such restrictions are made, States must demonstrate their 
</p>
<p>necessity and only take such measures as are proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate 
</p>
<p>aims in order to ensure continuous and effective protection of Covenant rights&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, paragraph 6). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to Zambia, as indicated by his  letter on 30 October 2013. He trusts that such a 
</p>
<p>visit would allow him to examine first-hand issues relating to his mandate, identify good 
</p>
<p>practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to relevant stakeholders. He looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving a positive reply at the earliest possible opportunity. He reiterates that 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, which established his mandate, and 24/5, which 
</p>
<p>renewed it for an additional period of three years, both urge the States to consider 
</p>
<p>favourably his requests for visits. </p>

<p><b> IV. Americas region 
</b></p>
<p>99. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 36 communications to 
</p>
<p>countries in the Americas region. A total of 14 communications were follow-ups to cases 
</p>
<p>previously sent to the attention of the State concerned. He takes note that the response rate 
</p>
<p>is 58 per cent for the Americas region. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about 
</p>
<p>worrying reports from the region regarding peaceful protestors and members of 
</p>
<p>associations, including non-governmental organizations, political parties and trade unions, 
</p>
<p>who were criminalized, stigmatized, intimidated, physically assaulted, arbitrarily arrested or 
</p>
<p>detained, as well as killed, because they went to the streets to voice their discontent or they 
</p>
<p>carried out legitimate activities that contradicted certain political or economic interests. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Special Rappoteur  is dismayed about the adoption of laws that unduly 
</p>
<p>restrict the rights to peaceful assembly and association as well as the justififcation of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;security considerations&#8221; for the surveillance and the infiltration of local social movements. 
</p>
<p>100. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur reminds States that the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council stressed that peaceful protests should not be viewed as a threat and encouraged the 
</p>
<p>States to engage in an open, inclusive and meaningful dialogue when dealing with peaceful 
</p>
<p>protests and their causes (A/HRC/RES/22/10). He reiterates that human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms are indivisible and belong to every individual, hence they are not 
</p>
<p>rights enjoyed by States, but rather by individuals who may espouse minority or dissenting 
</p>
<p>views or beliefs. He stresses that it is the obligation of States to respect and fully protect the 
</p>
<p>rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online as well as offline 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/RES/24/5, operational paragraph 2). Moreover, he reaffirms that the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are crucial cornerstones for the possible 
</p>
<p>emergence and sustainability of effective democratic systems. In this regard, States should 
</p>
<p>therefore make every effort to facilitate and protect peaceful protests.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>110. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Brazil for the detailed reply to the 
</p>
<p>communication sent on 4 April 2014, indicating that reports of excessive use of force by 
</p>
<p>law enforcement officials during public gatherings were met with numerous measures 
</p>
<p>aimed at investigating and punishing perpetrators as well as strengthening capacity-building 
</p>
<p>and oversight mechanisms (BRA 3/2014). However, he regrets that the Government of 
</p>
<p>Brazil has not replied to the communication on 25 August 2014 and urges it to provide a 
</p>
<p>detailed response to the questions raised in his letter (BRA 7/2014), in conformity with 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Management of peaceful protests 
</i></p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the training received by the police forces and 
</p>
<p>the initiatives to improve the work of law enforcement officials including a course on the 
</p>
<p>proportionate use of force. While he recognizes the steps taken by the Government to 
</p>
<p>investigate the death of a media worker killed during a protest as well as to ensure the 
</p>
<p>release of two other individuals (when the criteria for determining legality of their arrest 
</p>
<p>was not met), he expresses concern at the reported prosecution of a large number of 
</p>
<p>individuals involved ? in peaceful protests (BRA 3/2014). The Special Rapporteur reminds 
</p>
<p>the Government of its obligation to facilitate peaceful protests and is of the opinion that the 
</p>
<p>presumption in favour of the right to peaceful assembly does not cease as a result of 
</p>
<p>sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by certain individuals in the course of 
</p>
<p>a demonstration (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 25). 
</p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur remains disturbed by allegations of excessive use of force 
</p>
<p>by the police against peaceful protestors in a series of assemblies and at the allegations of 
</p>
<p>mass arrests of individuals aimed at intimidating critics and discouraging participation in 
</p>
<p>public demonstrations ((BRA 7/2014). He remains troubled by the arrests of individuals 
</p>
<p>known for monitoring unlawful arrests during peaceful protests and the confiscation and 
</p>
<p>damage to media equipment of journalists. He recalls the important monitoring role played 
</p>
<p>by observers and media and notes that attacks against such individuals should be promptly 
</p>
<p>and thoroughly investigated.  
</p>
<p><i>  Laws regulating peaceful protest and association  
</i></p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns regarding law 6528/13 that provides 
</p>
<p>for the detention of demonstrators wearing masks as well as draft law 5.964/13 that 
</p>
<p>prohibits any means that prevent the identification of protestors, which may result in 
</p>
<p>additional limitations to the right to peaceful assembly. Such measures could be used to 
</p>
<p>target particular groups using such items or masks for legitimate reasons, including to 
</p>
<p>identify fellow demonstrators, to make a political statement or out of fear of retribution. He 
</p>
<p>recalls that security considerations should not be used as a justification for the adoption of 
</p>
<p>stricter rules that annul the right to freedom of peaceful assembly (A/HRC/26/29 paragraph 
</p>
<p>33).  
</p>
<p>114. Regarding the possibility of investigations under law No. 12.850, on Criminal 
</p>
<p>Organizations, which would allow the Prosecutor General to access information on 
</p>
<p>individuals under investigation or infiltrate into the alleged criminal organization to obtain 
</p>
<p>evidence, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the aim of the legislation is to regulate 
</p>
<p>the activities of criminal organizations. However, he remains concerned about its potential 
</p>
<p>to unduly interfere with, or curb, the rights to association or assembly. He requests the 
</p>
<p>Government to keep him informed on the progress made into the investigations of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3

<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Canada for its detailed response 
</p>
<p>to his communication. In this connection, he is grateful for the cooperation extended to the 
</p>
<p>mandate, in compliance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) 
</p>
<p>and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Security considerations in the context of projects relating to natural resource exploitation 
</i></p>
<p>117. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government&#8217;s reply indicating that, in 
</p>
<p>order, to prepare for possible public assemblies and ensure the safety of the public and the 
</p>
<p>hearings into the Northern Gateway Project, National Energy Board officials studied 
</p>
<p>pertinent, publicly available, information and consulted with law enforcement officials and 
</p>
<p>their intelligence partners, in accordance with applicable legal standards (CAN 1/2014). He 
</p>
<p>acknowledges the domestic legal review mechanisms and forums available for investigating 
</p>
<p>complaints of surveillance and monitoring and the compliance of law enforcement 
</p>
<p>authorities as well as intelligence officials. He recalls that the State committed to protect 
</p>
<p>and promote rights set forth in international law and standards, and in that regard, looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving further information on the outcome of the proceedings and 
</p>
<p>investigations related to the case.  
</p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur is pleased that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
</p>
<p>(CSIS) Act &#8220;&#8230; prohibits CSIS from investigating acts of lawful advocacy, protest, or 
</p>
<p>dissent [and that] CSIS may only investigate these types of acts if they are linked to threats 
</p>
<p>to Canada&#8217;s national security.&#8221; However, he articulates that there should be a presumption 
</p>
<p>in favour of holding peaceful assemblies and associating freely and that security 
</p>
<p>considerations should not be used as a justification for unduly strict rules or interpretations 
</p>
<p>that void the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur contends that no restrictions may be placed on the exercise of those rights other 
</p>
<p>than those that are strictly necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the 
</p>
<p>interest to be protected.  
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>119. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Canada of his willingness to 
</p>
<p>undertake a country visit to Canada, as indicated in his letters from 2013, 2014 and 2015 
</p>
<p>and during his meetings with Government representatives. He takes note of the reply dated 
</p>
<p>9 April 2015 indicating the request has been forwarded to the appropriate authorities for 
</p>
<p>consideration. He looks forward receiving a positive reply.  </p>

</p>
<p>de los Estados de garantizar un entorno propicio para el libre ejercicio del derecho de 
</p>
<p>asociaci&#243;n; un derecho consagrado en el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y

<p>los Estados deben adoptar para lograr la no discriminaci&#243;n y la igualdad; entre otros, la

</p>
<p>que la Ley para la Circulaci&#243;n por Carreteras Libre de Cualquier Tipo de Obst&#225;culos, 
</p>
<p>Decreto 8-2014 del Congreso, fue aprobado por urgencia nacional el 19 de febrero de 2014

<p>(GTM 1/2014). Sin embargo, lamenta no haber recibido una respuesta su comunicaci&#243;n del

<p>141. El Relator Especial ley&#243; con atenci&#243;n las respuestas a los interrogantes planteados 
</p>
<p>en su comunicaci&#243;n del 10 de marzo de 2014 (GTM 1/2014), as&#237; como el pronunciamiento 
</p>
<p>del Gobierno sobre la mencionada normativa, y se congratula por el compromiso de las 
</p>
<p>autoridades de garantizar el libre goce y ejercicio de los derechos humanos de los 
</p>
<p>habitantes de Guatemala, incluido los derechos de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica y de asociaci&#243;n. No 
</p>
<p>obstante, refuta los argumentos esgrimidos por el Gobierno de que la Ley para la 
</p>
<p>Circulaci&#243;n por Carreteras Libre de Cualquier Tipo de Obst&#225;culos provee una definici&#243;n 
</p>
<p>m&#225;s clara y precisa de los supuestos jur&#237;dicos o de derecho del sujeto activo del delito. 
</p>
<p>Contrariamente, el Relator Especial reitera considerar que la ley mencionada es ambigua 
</p>
<p>respecto a sus alcances y por tanto permite interpretaciones arbitrarias que ponen en riesgo 
</p>
<p>el derecho de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica. El Relator Especial recuerda que los manifestantes buscan 
</p>
<p>transmitir opiniones y, muy a menudo, desafiar normas, y que si bien su derecho puede ser 
</p>
<p>restringido en ciertas limitadas circunstancias, el hecho de entorpecer la circulaci&#243;n no 
</p>
<p>constituye un motivo v&#225;lido. El derecho de reuni&#243;n, al depender del uso fundamental del 
</p>
<p>espacio p&#250;blico, puede, entre otros, causar desaf&#237;os tales como interrupciones en la 
</p>
<p>circulaci&#243;n de veh&#237;culos, sin embargo, en opini&#243;n del Relator Especial, deber&#225; ser siempre 
</p>
<p>promovido y protegido por el Estado qui&#233;n deber&#225; asimismo abstenerse de interferir cuando 
</p>
<p>no sea necesario, de conformidad con sus obligaciones internacionales. En este sentido, el </p>

</p>
<p>gravemente el disfrute de este derecho y recuerda al Gobierno de Guatemala su obligaci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>de proteger activamente las reuniones pac&#237;ficas (A/HRC/20/27, p&#225;rrafo 33) y asegurar que 
</p>
<p>las personas que ejercen el derecho a la libertad de asociaci&#243;n puedan actuar libremente, sin 
</p>
<p>temor a posibles amenazas, actos de intimidaci&#243;n o violencia, como arrestos o detenciones 
</p>
<p>arbitrarios o campa&#241;as difamatorias en los medios de difusi&#243;n (A/HRC/20/27, p&#225;rrafo 63);

</p>
<p>interrogantes planteados en la comunicaci&#243;n del 20 de junio de 2014 (HND 6/2014) acerca 
</p>
<p>de presuntos actos de intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas contra miembros del Comit&#233; de Familiares 
</p>
<p>de Detenidos Desaparecidos en Honduras (COFADEH). Asimismo, pide al Gobierno de 
</p>
<p>Honduras mantenerlo informado del estado de las investigaciones respecto del asesinato del 
</p>
<p>Sr. Juan Carlos Arge&#241;al Medina, las denuncias por supuestas amenazas de la Sra. Dina 
</p>
<p>Meetabel Meza Elvir y del Sr. Julio Ernesto Alvarado, as&#237; como las supuestas presiones por

</p>
<p>157. El Relator Especial reitera su preocupaci&#243;n respecto de los repetidos ataques y actos 
</p>
<p>de hostigamiento contra defensores y defensoras de los derechos humanos en Honduras, 
</p>
<p>incluyendo miembros de asociaciones ind&#237;genas (HND 2/2014) y de organizaciones 
</p>
<p>trabajando para los derechos de las personas LGBTI (HND 8/2014). Se congratula por el 
</p>
<p>compromiso adoptado por el Gobierno de garantizar un entorno favorable para el ejercicio 
</p>
<p>de derechos fundamentales en Honduras, incluida la libre asociaci&#243;n. Sin embargo se 
</p>
<p>muestra muy preocupado por el alto nivel de impunidad que prevalece respecto a las 
</p>
<p>agresiones y violaciones de los derechos de los defensores y defensoras, incluyendo 
</p>
<p>asesinatos y atentados contra la vida. El Relator Especial exhorta a las autoridades a que 
</p>
<p>tomen las medidas necesarias para que estos actos sean investigados de forma pronta y 
</p>
<p>adecuada, que los culpables respondan ante la justicia y que las v&#237;ctimas obtengan 
</p>
<p>reparaci&#243;n adecuada, en particular, en casos en los cuales la polic&#237;a, u otros agentes 
</p>
<p>estatales, resultan involucrados. Recuerda la obligaci&#243;n de los Estados de garantizar un 
</p>

</p>
<p>su orientaci&#243;n sexual e identidad de g&#233;nero (HND 8/2014), el Relator Especial invita al 
</p>
<p>Gobierno de Honduras a referirse a los instrumentos legislativos internacionales que 
</p>
<p>se&#241;alan medidas y principios concretos que los Estados deben adoptar para lograr la no 
</p>
<p>discriminaci&#243;n y la igualdad; entre otros, la Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre los 
</p>
<p>derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas que exhorta a los Estados a combatir los prejuicios, 
</p>
<p>eliminar la discriminaci&#243;n y promover la tolerancia, la comprensi&#243;n y las buenas relaciones 
</p>
<p>entre los pueblos ind&#237;genas y todos los dem&#225;s sectores de la sociedad, y el informe del Alto 
</p>
<p>Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos que solicita a los Estados 
</p>
<p>proteger a las personas frente a la violencia hom&#243;foba y transf&#243;bica, prevenir la tortura y 
</p>
<p>los tratos crueles, inhumanos y degradantes motivados por la orientaci&#243;n sexual y la 
</p>
<p>identidad de g&#233;nero y prohibir tambi&#233;n la discriminaci&#243;n por esos motivos, revocar las

<p>determinar la posible existencia de alg&#250;n delito y las medidas cautelares puestas a favor de

</p>
<p>fuerza, el Relator Especial hace nuevamente hincapi&#233; en el hecho de que la obligaci&#243;n de 
</p>
<p>los Estados es la de proteger activamente y promover la celebraci&#243;n de reuniones pac&#237;ficas

<p>y para ello debe existir una presunci&#243;n favorable del rol indispensable que aqu&#233;llas

</i></p>
<p>180. The Special Rapporteur expresses his thanks to the Government of the United States 
</p>
<p>for its reply to two communications sent during the period under consideration. He regrets 
</p>
<p>that one communication did not receive a reply to date and he recalls that responses to his 
</p>
<p>communications are an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 
</p>
<p>(2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Right to peaceful protest in the context of economic, social and cultural rights 
</i></p>
<p>181. In relation to the reported arrest of peaceful protestors by the Detroit Police 
</p>
<p>Department for allegedly preventing Homrich Wrecking Inc, a contractor of the City of 
</p>
<p>Detroit Water and Sewer Department, from restoring water service to residential 
</p>
<p>consumers, the Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving the report on the final 
</p>
<p>disposition of charges against the protestors, as soon as possible. He notes the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s response indicating that the Detroit Police Department reportedly informed 
</p>
<p>protestors of the procedures for conducting a lawful protest. However, he reaffirms that 
</p>
<p>while assemblies can be subject to certain restrictions, which are prescribed by law and are 
</p>
<p>necessary in a democratic society, as stated in the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights there should continuously be a presumption in favour of holding peaceful 
</p>
<p>assemblies.  
</p>
<p><i>  Draft Resolution to amend the rules of the House of Representatives relating to funding 
</i></p>
<p><i>disclosures  
</i></p>
<p>182. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns regarding the alleged submission of a 
</p>
<p>resolution to the second session of the 113th Congress, on 15 September 2014, to amend a 
</p>
<p>clause in the Rules of the House of Representatives to require witnesses that appear in a 
</p>
<p>non-government capacity to also include a disclosure of the amount and source of any 
</p>
<p>money received from foreign Governments. He recalls that civil society actors have been 
</p>
<p>facing increased scrutiny and undue restrictions in relation to funding they received and that 
</p>
<p>the requirement to reveal foreign funding sources could stigmatize civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and human rights defenders, as well as deter them from seeking resources to 
</p>
<p>undertake their activities. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligation 
</p>
<p>to ensure that civil society, including human rights defenders, in the United States can carry 
</p>
<p>out their legitimate work free from undue restrictions.  
</p>
<p><i>  Mass assemblies in response to high profile events 
</i></p>
<p>183. In the case of the mass demonstrations that occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, calling 
</p>
<p>for an independent and transparent investigation into the killing of Mr. Brown, which were 
</p>
<p>allegedly met with excessive use of force and acts of intimidation against protestors, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur stressed that the State has a positive obligation to actively protect 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies and to ensure, in particular, that all individuals belonging to groups 
</p>
<p>most at risk, including racial and ethnic minorites, have the ability to exercise effectively 
</p>
<p>their right. This obligation includes the protection of participants of peaceful assemblies 
</p>
<p>from individuals or groups of individuals who aim at disrupting or dispersing such 
</p>
<p>assemblies. He also recalls the recommendations of the Human Rights Committee that 
</p>
<p>called upon the United States of America to &#8220;(a) Step up its efforts to prevent the excessive 
</p>
<p>use of force by law enforcement officers by ensuring compliance with the 1990 Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; (b) Ensure that

<p>11). 
</p>
<p>184. He notes with appreciation the creation of a voluntary initiative (a Collaborative 
</p>
<p>Reform Initiative with the St. Louis County Police Department - SLCPD) to undertake a 
</p>
<p>voluntary assessment of the handling of mass demonstrations as well as other inquiries. He 
</p>
<p>further awaits the results of the several different investigations and legal actions mentioned 
</p>
<p>in this case, particularly in view of the decision of St. Louis County grand jury to not bring 
</p>
<p>to trial the case of Michael Brown. The Special Rapporteur repeats his serious concern over 
</p>
<p>the allegations of excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators and various acts of 
</p>
<p>intimidation, including arbitrary arrests, against protestors exercising the rights to 
</p>
<p>expression and assembly and journalists covering the demonstrations. In all contexts, he 
</p>
<p>urges the police to facilitate the right of protestors to demonstrate peacefully and to refrain 
</p>
<p>from the use of excessive force against individuals, including journalists, exercising their 
</p>
<p>rights. The Special Rapporteur recalls Human Rights Council resolution 25/38 which 
</p>
<p>further urges States to avoid using force during peaceful protests and to safeguard that no 
</p>
<p>one is subject to excessive or indiscriminate use of force, where the use of force is 
</p>
<p>absolutely necessary. Moreover, he calls on the State to take all necessary steps to secure 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly as per article 21 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>185. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to the United States, as indicated in his last letter on 2 April 2015. He trusts 
</p>
<p>that such a visit would allow him to examine first-hand issues relating to his mandate, 
</p>
<p>identify good practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>He views that such a visit would be a timely opportunity to engage with the relevant 
</p>
<p>authorities over the management of peaceful assemblies and contribute to the provision of 
</p>
<p>technical assistance or advisory services. He looks forward to receiving a positive reply at 
</p>
<p>the earliest possible opportunity. He reiterates that Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, 
</p>
<p>which established his mandate, and 24/5, which renewed it for an additional period of three 
</p>
<p>years, both urge the States to consider favourably his requests for visits.

<p>las condiciones a las que la Constituci&#243;n del pa&#237;s sujeta el derecho de manifestaci&#243;n, a

</p>
<p>y &#8220;moral administrativa&#8221; que permiten interpretaciones arbitrarias y el recorte de derechos

</p>
<p>Hace referencia a la Observaci&#243;n no. 31 del Comit&#233; de los Derechos Humanos sobre la 
</p>
<p>&#237;ndole de la obligaci&#243;n jur&#237;dica general impuesta a los Estados partes en el Pacto

</p>

</p>
<p>Relator Especial expresa grave preocupaci&#243;n por el recurso a la Ley Org&#225;nica contra la 
</p>
<p>Delincuencia Organizada y Financiamiento al Terrorismo (ley anti-terrorista) para justificar 
</p>
<p>todas las detenciones y la categorizaci&#243;n de los manifestantes como &#8216;terroristas&#8217;, negando 
</p>
<p>su car&#225;cter de estudiantes, opositores pol&#237;ticos o defensores y defensoras de los derechos

</p>
<p>preocupa que se utilicen extensamente consideraciones de seguridad para invalidar los 
</p>

</p>
<p>todas las funciones de seguridad ciudadana a los cuerpos de seguridad de car&#225;cter civil. 
</p>
<p>Bajo el nuevo modelo policial en proceso de configuraci&#243;n, el Gobierno enfatiza que no le 
</p>
<p>corresponden funciones generales de seguridad ciudadana al sector militar, pero s&#237; 
</p>
<p>atribuciones espec&#237;ficas en el mantenimiento del orden interno &#8220;ante la eventualidad de 
</p>
<p>manifestaciones violentas&#8221;, cuyo alcance buscar&#237;a limitar la resoluci&#243;n ministerial 008610 
</p>
<p>sobre &#8220;Normas sobre la Actuaci&#243;n de la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana en Funciones 
</p>
<p>de Control del Orden P&#250;blico, la Paz Social y la Convivencia Ciudadana en Reuniones

</p>
<p>autoridades de desarrollar un nuevo modelo policial conforme a est&#225;ndares internacionales. 
</p>
<p>No obstante, refuta los argumentos esgrimidos por el Gobierno de que efectivos militares, 
</p>
<p>como la Guardia Nacional Bolivariana, sean el medio adecuado para el control de las 
</p>
<p>manifestaciones en situaciones que no constituyen estados de emergencia. Hace 
</p>
<p>nuevamente hincapi&#233; en el hecho de que la obligaci&#243;n de los Estados es la de proteger 
</p>
<p>activamente y promover la celebraci&#243;n de reuniones pac&#237;ficas y para ello debe existir una 
</p>
<p>presunci&#243;n favorable del rol indispensable que aqu&#233;llas desempe&#241;an en las sociedades 
</p>
<p>democr&#225;ticas. Tal como expres&#243; el Comit&#233; contra la Tortura durante su examen de la 
</p>
<p>Rep&#250;blica Bolivariana de Venezuela, el 12 de diciembre de 2014, al Relator Especial le 
</p>
<p>preocupa seriamente el recurso a un organismo que fue objeto de 121 denuncias por 
</p>
<p>excesos en el ejercicio de sus funciones en las manifestaciones ocurridas entre febrero y 
</p>
<p>junio de 2014 y urge a las autoridades asegurar que sean &#243;rganos civiles los encargados del 
</p>
<p>mantenimiento del orden p&#250;blico. Asimismo, no le convencen los argumentos de que la 
</p>
<p>resoluci&#243;n ministerial 008610 provee una definici&#243;n m&#225;s clara y precisa de las normas de 
</p>
<p>actuaci&#243;n de Guardia Nacional, por cuanto referencias tales como: le compete a la Fuerza 
</p>

</p>
<p>riesgos de interpretaciones arbitrarias de la norma. Expresa la misma opini&#243;n en relaci&#243;n a 
</p>
<p>la calificaci&#243;n de &#8220;violencia pac&#237;fica&#8221; que no parece ser otra cosa que la asimilaci&#243;n de la

</p>
<p>Ley Org&#225;nica del Servicio de Polic&#237;a y del Cuerpo de Polic&#237;a Nacional Bolivariana y la 
</p>
<p>Resoluci&#243;n 88 del Ministerio del Poder Popular para Relaciones Interiores, Justicia y Paz 
</p>
<p>de 2010, reflejen conceptos similares no les quita ambig&#252;edad. En este sentido, al Relator 
</p>
<p>Especial le preocupa seriamente que este tipo de normativas imprecisas conlleven a la 
</p>
<p>autocensura, una de las pr&#225;cticas sociales m&#225;s regresivas para el goce de derechos y 
</p>
<p>libertades fundamentales.  
</p>
<p>199. Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior, el Relator Especial reitera sus serias inquietudes con 
</p>
<p>respecto a la supuesta falta de diferenciaci&#243;n entre reuniones pac&#237;ficas y actos violentos que 
</p>
<p>por tanto podr&#237;an justificar el uso gradual y progresivo de la fuerza por parte de la Fuerza 
</p>
<p>Armada Nacional Bolivariana para dispersar reuniones pac&#237;ficas, en flagrante oposici&#243;n con 
</p>
<p>las disposiciones del derecho internacional y las obligaciones que el pa&#237;s se comprometi&#243; a 
</p>
<p>respetar y garantizar. Por lo tanto, urge al Estado realizar las modificaciones necesarias a la 
</p>
<p>luz de las normas y est&#225;ndares internacionales y pone a su disposici&#243;n sur servicios de

<p>asesoramiento y asistencia t&#233;cnica. 
</p>

</p>

<p>asociaciones en general, y los partidos pol&#237;ticos en particular, como medios clave  para el 
</p>
<p>funcionamiento de un r&#233;gimen democr&#225;tico. El Relator Especial insta a la Rep&#250;blica

<p>y de asociaci&#243;n desempe&#241;an un papel primordial en la democracia y asegure que nadie sea

<p>who sought to cooperate or cooperated with the United Nations during the period under 
</p>
<p>review. In particular, he is concerned about indication that environmental human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders were the target of threats and violations, including killings, for their peaceful and 
</p>
<p>legitimate work in the defence of human rights, particularly in the context of natural 
</p>
<p>resource exploitation projects. He recalls that a positive environment that allows and 
</p>
<p>promotes the rights of all people to freely associate and assemble is essential in the context 
</p>
<p>of exploitation of natural resources to ensure a fair, transparent and accountable process 
</p>
<p>that benefits all the parties involved (A/HRC/29/25, paragraph 67). He reiterates that in 
</p>
<p>democratic societies, demonstrations and protests represent a central mechanism for raising 
</p>
<p>awareness about political and social concerns, including on environmental, labour or 
</p>
<p>economic issues, to hold both Governments and corporations accountable. 
</p>
<p>204. The Special Rapporteur calls on States to pay particular attention to the plights of 
</p>
<p>groups at risk. He noted that in this region, groups at high risk of violations, including 
</p>
<p>journalists, trade unionists, environmental activists and indigenous peoples, among others, 
</p>
<p>face considerable opposition, harassment and , stigmatization from State and non-State 
</p>
<p>actors because of their views and human rights activities. He urges the Governments to  
</p>
<p>improve the situations of these often marginalized groups and recalls that the State retains 
</p>
<p>the primary responsibility for ensuring the protection and promotion of their rights. In that 
</p>
<p>this regard, he asked asks that positive measures, including affirmative action initiatives, be 
</p>
<p>taken to ensure that all individuals belonging to groups most at risk have the ability to 
</p>
<p>exercise effectively exercise their rights, including the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>205. With regards to extraordinary circumstances and exceptional situations in the region, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur recalls that even during a state of emergency, the rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly and of association shall not be derogated. He notes that the struggle 
</p>
<p>against terrorism and other security considerations have been used as rationale for the 
</p>
<p>adoption of a state of emergency or other stricter rules to nullify the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association. He advocates that when absolutely necessary, 
</p>
<p>limitation measures, as provided for in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, are adequate to combat terrorism or handle other security considerations. 
</p>
<p>206. In relation to the right to freedom of association, the Special Rapporteur reminds 
</p>
<p>Governments of this region that they must ensure that everyone can peacefully express their 
</p>
<p>views without fear and that Governments have the obligation to not obstruct the exercise of 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of association. This important responsibility includes guaranteeing that 
</p>
<p>both registered and unregistered associations can seek and secure funding and resources 
</p>
<p>without discrimination (A/HRC/20/27, paragraphs 64 and 68). He notes with concern that 
</p>
<p>the ability of associations in the region to access funding directly affects the right to 
</p>
<p>association. In that regard, he remains worried about laws that halt or curb foreign funding.

</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>210. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Australia for its detailed response 
</p>
<p>to his communication. In this connection, he is grateful for the cooperation extended to the 
</p>
<p>mandate, in compliance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) 
</p>
<p>and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Workplaces (Protection from Protestors) Act 2014 (Tasmania) 
</i></p>
<p>211. The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s reply to the communication sent on 
</p>
<p>4 September 2014, indicating that the Workplaces (Protection from Protestors) Bill 2014 
</p>
<p>(Tasmania) had passed both Houses of the Parliament and thus became an Act of 
</p>
<p>Parliament, with extensive amendments addressing concerns raised in the communication 
</p>
<p>(AUS 3/2014). He takes note with appreciation that the concern about the explicit 
</p>
<p>prohibition of acts that promoted &#8220;awareness of or support for an opinion, or belief, in 
</p>
<p>respect of a political, environmental, social, cultural or economic issue&#8221; was removed from 
</p>
<p>the Act and that penalties for invading or hindering businesses were largely reviewed. 
</p>
<p>However, he remains concerned about the other provisions, namely Part 2, clauses 6.1, 6.2 
</p>
<p>and 6.3 on prohibitions to demonstrate, clauses 8 and 9 on police attributions and penalties 
</p>
<p>for not complying or for obstructing a police officer from taking action, and clauses under 
</p>
<p>Part 3 relative to police powers in application of the Act, including arrests without warrants 
</p>
<p>and the use of force. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that in democratic societies, 
</p>
<p>demonstrations and protests represent a central mechanism for raising awareness about </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>political and social concerns, including on environmental, labour or economic issues, 
</p>
<p>holding not only governments, but also corporations accountable. As stated in the 
</p>
<p>communication, he believes that the Act impedes that very function and urges the 
</p>
<p>authorities to take the necessary steps to make its legislation compliant with Australia&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>international obligations, namely the article 21 on freedom of association of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by the State on 13 August 
</p>
<p>1980.  
</p>
<p><i>  Security considerations in the context of projects relating to natural resource exploitation 
</i></p>
<p>212. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the meaning of a business premise for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of the Workplaces (Protection from Protestors) Act 2014 (Tasmania), which 
</p>
<p>includes mining sites, forestry lands and premises used for agriculture, horticulture, 
</p>
<p>viticulture, aquaculture and commercial food, among others. With this definition in mind, 
</p>
<p>he warns against the practice of restricting the right to protest in these specific contexts, 
</p>
<p>which he believes may be costly in the long run and may cause irrevocable damage 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/25, paragraph 11). The Special Rapporteur stresses the view that this right 
</p>
<p>contributes to opening up opportunities for genuine and effective engagement by civil 
</p>
<p>society in decision-making processes across the spectrum of natural resource exploitation 
</p>
<p>activities. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly in natural resources exploitation 
</p>
<p>contexts facilitates constructive dialogue, fosters transparency and accountability and 
</p>
<p>allows excluded groups to voice their grievances, hence requiring specific attention and 
</p>
<p>protection according to international laws and standards. In particular, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People provides inter alia for the right of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to free, prior and informed consent if they are relocated from their lands 
</p>
<p>or territories (A/RES/61/295, article 10). The Special Rapporteur encourages the State to 
</p>
<p>overturn any legislation that curtails the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>he articulates that there should be a presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies 
</p>
<p>and associating freely and that security considerations should not be used as a justification 
</p>
<p>for unduly strict rules or interpretations that void the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and of association. He reminds that in a democratic society, no restrictions may be placed 
</p>
<p>on the exercise of these rights unless strictly necessary and proportionate to the interest to 
</p>
<p>be protected.  
</p>
<p><i>  Move-on laws 
</i></p>
<p>213. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision of the Victoria State&#8217;s government to 
</p>
<p>introduce a bill in the lower House of Parliament in March 2015 to repeal restrictive laws 
</p>
<p>regulating protests. He notes with appreciation that the Victoria State&#8217;s Government 
</p>
<p>repealed in April 2014 the amendments to the controversial &#8220;move-on laws&#8221; which, in his 
</p>
<p>opinion, granted police extensive powers to move protestors obstructing buildings of traffic 
</p>
<p>or &#8220;causing people to have a reasonable fear of violence&#8221;, and looks forward to receiving 
</p>
<p>information on the outcome regarding to the 2014 law reviewing Victoria&#8217;s Summary

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>218. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the responses of the Government of 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh acknowledging receipt of his communications. However, he regrets that the 
</p>
<p>Government failed to provide substantial responses to the questions raised in the 
</p>
<p>communications since the establishment of the mandate in 2011. He considers responses to 
</p>
<p>his communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his 
</p>
<p>mandate and again urges the authorities to comply with Human Rights Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010) on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and association that call upon States to cooperate fully with and assist him in the 
</p>
<p>performance of his mandate and to respond promptly to his communications. In the absence 
</p>
<p>of information to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in 
</p>
<p>the allegations presented in his communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Trade unions 
</i></p>
<p>219. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns regarding the alleged physical attacks 
</p>
<p>and undue arrests of trade union leaders and other human rights defenders participating in a 
</p>
<p>protest at the Hossain Market in Dhaka in July 2014. He reminds the Government of its 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure that trade unions leaders and human rights defenders in Bangladesh can 
</p>
<p>carry out their legitimate work in a safe and enabling environment without fear of threats or 
</p>
<p>acts of intimidation and harassment of any sort, including excessive use of force. He calls 
</p>
<p>on the Government to conduct independent and thorough investigations into allegations of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, to hold perpetrators accountable and to provide the victims with 
</p>
<p>full redress, without further due. Moreover, he urges the State to take all necessary steps to 
</p>
<p>secure the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association as per articles 21 and 22 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights acceded by Bangladesh on 6 
</p>
<p>September 2000.  
</p>
<p><i>  Draft Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act 2014 
</i></p>
<p>220. While the Special Rapporteur awaits a reply from the Government of Bangladesh 
</p>
<p>detailing the current status of this Act, which was reportedly expected to be reviewed by the 
</p>
<p>Parliament in mid-2014, he reiterates his call for the Parliament to ensure its compliance 
</p>
<p>with international human rights norms and standards. He reiterates that States must ensure 
</p>
<p>that associations, irrespective of whether registered or unregistered, can seek, receive and 
</p>
<p>use funding and other resources from natural and legal individuals or groups, whether 
</p>
<p>domestic, foreign or international, without prior authorization or other undue impediments 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/23/39, paragraph 82). Regarding provisions on registration renewals, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur restates that the regular application for renewal infringes the limited restrictions 
</p>
<p>set forth in article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
</p>
<p>recalled in resolution 24/5 of the Human Rights Council. He also calls upon Bangladesh to 
</p>
<p>refrain from interfering with the right of associations to freely determine their activities and 
</p>
<p>thus to overturn laws and provisions that make it mandatory for associations to request the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>approval of a Government ministry to carry out their legitimate activities. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur remains very concerned by vague or ambiguous provisions of the Draft 
</p>
<p>Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act 2014 that allow for arbitrary 
</p>
<p>interpretations and restrictions to the right to associate. He believes that the risk of violating 
</p>
<p>the right to association is even greater if the laws governing it are vague since citizens&#8217; 
</p>
<p>fears of breaking the law itself can lead to self-silencing.  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>221. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his grave concern at the acts of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>harassment and of the secretary of Bangladeshi human rights organization ODHIKAR, Mr. 
</p>
<p>Adilur Rahman Khan. As previously noted, he articulates that there should be a 
</p>
<p>presumption in favour of assembling peacefully and associating freely and that security 
</p>
<p>considerations should not be used as a justification for unduly strict rules or interpretations 
</p>
<p>that void the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. In the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s view, surveillance tactics and disproportionate shows of force attest to 
</p>
<p>authorities&#8217; presumptions against assembling and associating freely, which has a chilling 
</p>
<p>effect on peaceful protestors. He reminds the Government that no restrictions may be 
</p>
<p>placed on the exercise of those rights in a democractic society other than those that are 
</p>
<p>strictly necessary and proportionate to the interest to be protected. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>222. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to Bangladesh, as indicated by letter on 27 January 2014. He trusts that such 
</p>
<p>an in person visit would allow him to examine issues relating to his mandate, identify good 
</p>
<p>practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to relevant stakeholders. He looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving a positive reply at the earliest possible opportunity. He reiterates that 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, which established his mandate, and 24/5, which 
</p>
<p>renewed it for an additional period of three years, both urge the States to consider 
</p>
<p>favourably his requests for visits.

<p><i>  Responses to communications

<p>225. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Cambodia for its response dated 
</p>
<p>28 August 2014, which provided information on the investigation into the reported acts of 
</p>
<p>intimidation and threats against human rights defender Mr. Vann Sophath. He trusts he will 
</p>
<p>soon receive a response to the questions raised in the communication on 22 August 2014, in 
</p>
<p>conformity with the requirement of Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 
</p>
<p>(2012) and 15/21 (2010) to fully cooperate with the mandate. </p>

</b></p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>226. In relation to the contested appropriation of land, the Special Rapporteur remains 
</p>
<p>seriously concerned about the reported recurring resort to violence and intimidation against 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders and residents by the company security agents with the knowledge 
</p>
<p>of the police. He is similarly concerned about the violent dispersal of peaceful assemblies 
</p>
<p>and criminalization of protestors at Or Rung village, Ta Che commune in August 2014. He 
</p>
<p>calls on the authorities to keep him informed on the charges brought against land activists 
</p>
<p>arrested on 12 August 2014 and to indicate how their arrests and any consecutive measures 
</p>
<p>are compatible with international human rights law and standards.  
</p>
<p>227. The Special Rapporteur articulates that there should be a presumption in favour of 
</p>
<p>holding peaceful assemblies and associating freely and that security considerations should 
</p>
<p>not be used as a justification for unduly strict rules or interpretations that void the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. No restrictions may be placed on the 
</p>
<p>exercise of those rights other than those that are strictly necessary in a democratic society 
</p>
<p>and proportionate to the interest to be protected. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes 
</p>
<p>the statement of the Cambodian delegation present in Geneva during the review of the State 
</p>
<p>at the Universal Periodic Review that stressed the important role of associations in the 
</p>
<p>promotion of democracy and human rights (A/HRC/26/6, paragraph 17), he urges the 
</p>
<p>authorities to take the necessary steps to promote and protect the rights set forth in the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, namely the articles 21 and 22 on 
</p>
<p>freedoms of assembly and association, ratified by the State on 26 May 1992. He also takes 
</p>
<p>this opportunity to recall the observations of the Human Rights Committee that call upon 
</p>
<p>the State to, inter alia, &#8220;refrain from prosecuting journalists, human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>other civil society actors as a means of deterring or discouraging them from freely 
</p>
<p>expressing their opinions&#8221; and to &#8220;ensure that the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>is not subject to restrictions other than the ones permissible under the Covenant&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/KHM/CO/2, paragraphs 21b and 22). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>228. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to Cambodia, as indicated by letters on 23 September 2011 and 30 October 
</p>
<p>2013. He trusts that such a visit would allow him to examine in situ issues relating to his 
</p>
<p>mandate, identify good practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to relevant 
</p>

<p>the States to consider favourably his requests for visits.

<p>received replies to the communications sent on 4 March 2014 (CHN 2/2014), 3 April 2014 
</p>
<p>(CHN 4/2014), 5 May 2014 (CHN 6/2014), 23 October 2014 (CHN 9/2014) and 17 
</p>
<p>November 2014 (CHN 12/2014). He urges the Government to provide detailed responses to 
</p>
<p>the questions raised in his letters, given the severity of the allegations contain therein. He 
</p>
<p>reminds the authorities that he considers responses to his communications as an important 
</p>
<p>part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, in accordance with Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Reported reprisals 
</i></p>
<p>241. The Special Rapporteur learned with dismay of the death of human rights defender 
</p>
<p>Ms. Cao on 14 March 2014. Ms. Cao had been the subject of several communications by 
</p>
<p>Special Procedures in previous months following successive undue arrests related to her 
</p>
<p>legitimate human rights activities. Her participation in a sit-in in Beijing during which 
</p>
<p>protestors requested Chinese authorities to allow civil society, an officially recognized actor 
</p>
<p>of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, to input information into the National Report 
</p>
<p>to this body had reportedly motivated her latest arrest in August 2013. A group of United 
</p>
<p>Nations experts, including the Special Rapporteur, had joined their voices to express alarm 
</p>
<p>about the deteriorating health situation of Ms. Cao in a press release on 16 October 2013.  
</p>
<p>242. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his utmost concern that the death of Ms. Cao may 
</p>
<p>be a reprisal for her   continued cooperation with the United Nations, its mechanisms and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>representatives in the field of human rights, namely with the Universal Period Review 
</p>
<p>process. He urges the authorities to inform him of the results of the investigations of the 
</p>
<p>circumstances leading to Ms. Cao&#8217;s death, as soon as possible. He emphasizes that the right 
</p>
<p>to life should be guaranteed by States to all individuals under all circumstances and at all 
</p>
<p>times, including in the context of the exercise of the rights to freedom of association and of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly, as prescribed by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>243. Moreover, he echoes the Human Rights Council resolutions 12/2, 24/24 and 27/38, 
</p>
<p>which condemn all acts of intimidation or reprisal by Governments and non-State actors 
</p>
<p>against individuals and groups who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>244. The Special Rapporteur remains gravely disturbed by allegations of reprisals, 
</p>
<p>repeated arrests, criminalization, harassment of families and disappearance of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders as a result of their legitimate human rights activities. Moreover, he expresses 
</p>
<p>serious concern at the reported instances of torture and ill-treatment and deteriorating health 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders in detention. He recalls the decisive role played by associations 
</p>
<p>to foster development and to meet populations&#8217; needs and aspirations and the importance to 
</p>
<p>ensure a free and unhampered enjoyment of the right to assembly and protest to build 
</p>
<p>peaceful and democratic societies. To this end, he urges the authorities of China to respect, 
</p>
<p>protect and fulfil the rights to free association and peaceful assembly. In this regard, he 
</p>
<p>recalls the recommendation made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women to enable direct registration of associations without sponsorship 
</p>
<p>(CEDAW/C/CHN/CO/7-8, paragraph 33) and reminds the Government that the right to 
</p>
<p>associate protect both registered and unregistered associations. 
</p>
<p><i>  Crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble 
</i></p>
<p>245. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the reply of the Government on 8 December 
</p>
<p>2014 indicating that the Intermediate People&#8217;s Court of Xin Yu City had sustained the 
</p>
<p>ruling of the People&#8217;s Court of Yu Shui District condemning human rights defender Ms. 
</p>
<p>Liu Ping to an imprisonment of 6.5 years for the crime of picking quarrels and provoking 
</p>
<p>trouble (CHN 10/2014). The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Chinese criminal law 
</p>
<p>and other domestic laws and regulations applied by the courts that found Ms. Liu guilty of, 
</p>
<p>among other things, spreading fabricated information on the Internet, stirring trouble and 
</p>
<p>provoking unrest and disturbance of public order. He, however, reminds the State of its 
</p>
<p>commitment to protect and promote rights set forth in international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>standards, which include the rights to peaceful assembly and association. He urges the 
</p>
<p>Government of China to uphold its international human rights commitments and to refrain 
</p>
<p>from passing or implementing laws, as well as validating practices that seriously impede 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of fundamental rights. In relation to the use of the Internet, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur call on the authorities to guarantee an unhampered access to the Internet and 
</p>
<p>echoes Human Rights Council resolution 26/13 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of human rights on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>246. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights lawyer Mr. Chang Boyang, detained on 26 May 2014 and charged with the crime of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;assembling a crowd to disturb order at public places&#8221; (CHN 8/2014). He takes note of the 
</p>
<p>reply of the Chinese Government, and in that regard, looks forward to receiving further 
</p>
<p>information on the outcome of the proceedings and investigations related to the case. </p>

<p>247. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to China, as indicated by letters on 23 September 2011 and on 15 November 
</p>
<p>2013. He trusts that such a visit would allow him to examine in situ issues relating to his

<p>250. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received response to his communications

</p>
<p>Government cooperation with his mandate. He considers responses to his communications 
</p>

</p>
<p>authorities to comply with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) 
</p>
<p>and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Human rights defenders and the right to association  
</i></p>
<p>251. The Special Rapporteur was dismayed to learn that Mr. Mohar Ali Mondal, the 
</p>
<p>District Human Rights Monitor for Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Manch (MASUM), a 
</p>
<p>human rights organization based in West Bengal, who was the subject of nine previous 
</p>
<p>communications, faces alleged surveillance by authorities. He considers threats against 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, including members of associations, a grave source of concern not 
</p>
<p>only to the individuals affected, but more generally for the message it propels to other civil 
</p>
<p>society actors who wish to engage in defence of human rights.  
</p>
<p>252. In connection with the case of Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand, he recalls his concerns 
</p>
<p>over the alleged reprisals against these human rights defenders because of their 
</p>
<p>organizations&#8217; work. He emphasizes that while the State does not have to agree with the 
</p>
<p>opinions and criticism expressed by persons espousing minority or dissenting views or 
</p>
<p>beliefs, it has a positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling environment for 
</p>
<p>civil society, including the enjoyment of the right of association, so that it may exist, 
</p>
<p>operate and express itself freely and without fear (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63). He urges 
</p>
<p>authorities to implement all necessary measures to protect people exercising their right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association and peaceful assembly against threats, violence, intimidation or 
</p>
<p>reprisals. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit

<p>253. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a

</p>
<p>renewed it for an additional period of three years, both urge the States to consider

</i></p>
<p>256. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he did not receive replies to date to his 
</p>
<p>communications and reiterates hat responses to his communications are an important part of 
</p>
<p>the cooperation of Governments. He looks forward to receiving detailed responses to the 
</p>
<p>questions raised in them, in at the earliest possible convenience, in conformity with Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Negative obligation of the State to not unduly interfere with these rights 
</i></p>
<p>257. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Indonesia to take measures to put 
</p>
<p>in place an enabling environment for associations to operate safely and for protests to take 
</p>
<p>place free from undue restrictions. He remains concerned about the reported excessive use 
</p>
<p>of force during peaceful assemblies in Waena and Abepura in April 2014 and about the 
</p>
<p>denial to register an association and to authorize it to organize a rally in Jakarta in May 
</p>
<p>2014 (IDN 1/2014). He recalls that the State committed to protecting and promoting rights 
</p>
<p>set forth in international law and standards, including in the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights acceded by Indonesia on 23 February 2006 that provides for the rights 
</p>
<p>to freely associate and assemble. He reaffirms that while assemblies can be subject to 
</p>
<p>certain restrictions, which are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, 
</p>
<p>there should be a presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies and prohibitions 
</p>
<p>should be measures of last resort. In this context, he believes that a swift notification 
</p>
<p>procedure to hold a peaceful assembly complies better with international standards, 
</p>
<p>whereas other requirements can lead to undue interference. Similarly, he is of the view that 
</p>
<p>authorities should automatically grant associations legal personality as soon as notified 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 28).  
</p>
<p>258. In relation to the reported undue human rights restrictions against the indigenous 
</p>
<p>people of Biafra, the Special Rapporteur echoes the call of the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights to, inter alia, strengthen the legislative protection against 
</p>
<p>discrimination, prohibit discrimination, and punish perpetrators and provide remedies and 
</p>
<p>reparation for victims (E/C.12/IDN/CO/1, paragraph 10). He further stresses that 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities are a category of people that require special attention. He reminds 
</p>
<p>that a resolute positive environment that allows and promotes the rights of all people to 
</p>
<p>freely associate and assemble is essential in order for the State to fully comply with its 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations. </p>

<p>268. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
</p>
<p>its two responses to the communications sent during the present reporting period. However, 
</p>
<p>he regrets to not have received replies to the communications sent on 11 June 2014 (IRN

<p>(IRN 25/2014) and 27 January 2015 (IRN 2/2015). He urges the Government to provide 
</p>
<p>detailed responses to the questions raised in his letters, given the severity of the allegations 
</p>
<p>contained therein. He reminds the authorities that he considers responses to his 
</p>
<p>communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3

</b></p>
<p>in accordance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 
</p>
<p>(2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Reported reprisals 
</i></p>
<p>269. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about allegations of acts of reprisals 
</p>
<p>in the form of intimidation against associations&#8217; members because of their cooperation with 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran (IRN 25/2014 and IRN 9/2014) and the Human Rights Council (IRN 
</p>
<p>12/2014). He duly takes note of the Government's response and the results of investigations 
</p>
<p>that indicate that in the view of the Iranian judicial officers such reprisals did not take place. 
</p>
<p>However, the severity of the allegations and reliability of the sources require the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to insist on requesting the Government to clarify and determine whether a crime 
</p>
<p>occurred and to keep him informed about the status of investigations, prosecution and 
</p>
<p>protection plans put in place.  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>270. The Special Rapporteur remains gravely disturbed by allegations that indicate an 
</p>
<p>escalating trend of arrests and sentencing of individuals exercising their rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly and association. Moreover, he expresses concern at the reported 
</p>
<p>instances of torture and ill-treatment and lack of access to or inadequate health care of civil 
</p>
<p>society activists while in detention facilities. He recalls the decisive role played by 
</p>
<p>associations to foster development and to meet populations&#8217; needs and aspirations and the 
</p>
<p>importance of ensuring a free and unhampered enjoyment of the right to assembly and 
</p>
<p>protest to build peaceful and democratic societies. To this end, he urges the authorities of 
</p>
<p>the Islamic Republic of Iran to respect, protect and fulfil the rights to free association and 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p><i>  Security considerations 
</i></p>
<p>271. While he acknowledges the response of the Government dated 27 April 2015 
</p>
<p>indicating that the secretary general of an opposition party was convicted to eight years 
</p>
<p>imprisonment for, inter alia, &#8220;acting against national security through assembling&#8221;, he 
</p>
<p>warns against the practice of resorting to security considerations to adopt stricter measures 
</p>
<p>that annul fundamental rights and freedoms. He also cautions the authorities against vague 
</p>
<p>legal provisions governing the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association that 
</p>
<p>increase the risk of abuses and violations to these rights and infuse fear of breaking the law 
</p>
<p>among society, which in turn can lead to self-censorship.  
</p>
<p>272.  The Special Rapporteur reminds the State of its obligation to ensure a conducive 
</p>
<p>environment to the free exercise of the rights of peaceful assembly and association; both 
</p>
<p>rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, acceded by the 
</p>
<p>State on 24 June 1975. It also reiterates that, according to this same Covenant, only a very 
</p>
<p>limited number of restrictions to these rights may apply, which should be prescribed by law 
</p>
<p>and necessary in a democratic society. 
</p>
<p><i>  Political parties 
</i></p>
<p>273. In relation to the reported prohibition of the opposition political party Iran 
</p>
<p>Democratic Front, he reminds the State that any decision rejecting the application of an 
</p>
<p>association requires clear motivation and communication in writing to the applicant, who 
</p>
<p>should have the opportunity to challenge the decision in court. Moreover, he reiterates that 
</p>
<p>the right to form and to join an association also protects political parties, whether registered 
</p>
<p>or not (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 61). In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses that 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are a critical means for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>individuals and groups of individuals to participate in public affairs. The exercise of such 
</p>
<p>rights provides avenues through which people can aggregate and voice their concerns and 
</p>
<p>interests and endeavour to fashion governance that responds to their issues. (A/68/299, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 6). The Special Rapporteur urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to recognize that 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association play a central role in a 
</p>
<p>democracy and to ensure that no one is criminalized, threatened or intimidated for 
</p>
<p>exercising these rights.

</p>
<p>Further to his various communications, press releases and reports to the Human Rights

<p>receive adequate compensation. He expresses serious concern about the stagnant 
</p>

</p>

<p>278. The Special Rapporteur remains very concerned by vague or ambiguous provisions 
</p>
<p>of the aforementioned Decree No. 327, which seek to develop principles and procedures to 
</p>
<p>manage information through the Internet. Controverted provisions include the prohibitions 
</p>
<p>to disseminate &#8220;false or misleading information&#8221; or to promote &#8220;untrue information&#8221;, which 
</p>
<p>allow for arbitrary interpretations that could seriously limit the free exercise of fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms on the Internet. The Special Rapporteur believes that the risk of violating the 
</p>
<p>rights under his mandate is even greater if the laws that govern them are vague since the 
</p>
<p>citizens&#8217; fears of breaking the law can lead to self-silencing.  </p>

</p>
<p>refrain from passing or implementing laws, as well as validating practices that seriously 
</p>
<p>impede the enjoyment of fundamental rights. Moreover, he urges the authorities to uphold 
</p>
<p>their international human rights commitments, namely to respect and promote the 
</p>
<p>provisions contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by 
</p>
<p>the State on 25 September 2009, which include the rights to peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>association. In this regard, he stands ready to provide technical assistance to ensure that 
</p>
<p>State&#8217;s normative framework complies with international human rights norms and standards 
</p>
<p>governing the freedoms of association and assembly.  
</p>
<p>280. In relation to the use of the Internet, the Special Rapporteur calls on the authorities 
</p>
<p>to guarantee an unhampered access to the Internet and echoes Human Rights Council

<p><i>  Country visit

<p>281. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, as indicated by his letters on 12 
</p>
<p>December 2011 and 30 October 2013. He trusts that such a visit would allow him to 
</p>
<p>examine first-hand issues related to his mandate, identify good practices and formulate 
</p>
<p>pertinent recommendations to relevant stakeholders. He looks forward to receiving a 
</p>
<p>positive reply at the earliest possible opportunity. He reiterates that Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 15/21, which established his mandate, and 24/5, which renewed it for an 
</p>
<p>additional period of three years, both urge the States to consider favourably his requests for

<p><b>54</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>289. Unlike previous years, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of 
</p>
<p>Malaysia failed to respond to most of his communications. He urges the authorities to 
</p>
<p>comply with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 
</p>
<p>(2010) on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association that call upon 
</p>
<p>States to cooperate fully with and assist him in the performance of his mandate and to 
</p>
<p>respond promptly to his communications. In the absence of information to the contrary, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in the allegations presented in the 
</p>
<p>communications.  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>290. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the environment in which the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are exercised and warns against situations 
</p>
<p>that may seriously impair the enjoyment of these rights (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 20). The 
</p>
<p>cases that have been reported signal judicial harassment of human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>discrimination practices against members of the Shi&#8217;a Muslim community. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reiterates that while the State does not have to agree with the opinions and 
</p>
<p>criticisms expressed by people who embrace different convictions or beliefs, it has a 
</p>
<p>positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling environment for civil society, in 
</p>
<p>terms of enjoyment of the rights of peaceful assembly and association, so that it may exist, 
</p>
<p>operate and express itself freely and without fear (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63). 
</p>
<p><i>  Sedition Act of 1948 
</i></p>
<p>291. The Special Rapporteur thanks the State for its reply dated 14 October 2014 in 
</p>
<p>relation to the Sedition Act of 1948. While he acknowledges the clarification as to the 
</p>
<p>limitations introduced by the Act to the right to freedom of expression, he reiterates the 
</p>
<p>concerns raised in subsequent communications about indications of unlawful arrests and 
</p>
<p>criminalization of individuals under the provisions of the Act. He fears that what appears to 
</p>
<p>be a shrinking space for critical voices may result in the self-silencing of people wishing to 
</p>
<p>exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. In his view, vague 
</p>
<p>considerations such as the fight against threats to the &#8220;harmony of Malaysia&#8221; contribute to 
</p>
<p>exacerbating arbitrary and restrictive interpretations and should be reviewed in accordance 
</p>
<p>with international human rights law and standards. He asks the Government to keep him 
</p>
<p>informed on the outcome of the proceedings and investigations of the individuals 
</p>
<p>mentioned in his communications who were charged under the Act. 
</p>
<p>292. In relation to the use of the Internet, the Special Rapporteur calls on the authorities 
</p>
<p>to guarantee an unhampered access to the Internet and echoes Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 26/13 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the 
</p>
<p>Internet. 
</p>
<p>293. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to call upon Malaysia to refrain from 
</p>
<p>passing or implementing laws, as well as validating practices that seriously impede the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of fundamental rights. Moreover, he urges the authorities to uphold their 
</p>
<p>international human rights commitments, namely to respect and promote the provisions 
</p>
<p>contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which include the rights to 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and association. He reminds the State that according to this Declaration, 
</p>
<p>no restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those that are 
</p>
<p>determined by law and that strictly intend to guarantee the respect for the rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms of others and to meet requirements of morality, public order and the general 
</p>
<p>welfare in a democratic society. He emphasizes that the freedoms are the norm and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>restrictions are the exception. In this context, he articulates that there should be a 
</p>
<p>presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies and associating freely and that 
</p>
<p>security considerations should not be used as a justification for unduly strict rules or 
</p>
<p>interpretations that void the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. In 
</p>
<p>this regard, he stands ready to provide technical assistance to ensure that State&#8217;s normative 
</p>
<p>framework complies with international human rights norms and standards governing 
</p>
<p>freedoms of association and assembly. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>294. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to Malaysia, as indicated by his letters on 23 September 2011 and 30 October 
</p>
<p>2013. He trusts that such a visit would allow him to examine first-hand issues related to his 
</p>
<p>mandate, identify good practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. He looks forward to receiving a positive reply at the earliest possible 
</p>
<p>opportunity. He reiterates that Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, which established 
</p>
<p>his mandate, and 24/5, which renewed it for an additional period of three years, both urge 
</p>
<p>the States to consider his requests for visits favourably.

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>299. The Special Rapporteur expresses his thanks to the Government of Myanmar for its 
</p>
<p>responses, including two replies aimed at clarifying the facts of the cases. In relation to the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s reply from 25 July 2014, which requested that the joint allegation letter of 4 
</p>
<p>November 2014 (MMR 2/2014) on draft legislation not be included in the communication 
</p>
<p>report, he would like to highlight the preventive functions of mandate holders. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes that in his capacity as a Human Rights Council mandated expert, he may 
</p>
<p>reflect and comment on legislation and other national developments with the aim of 
</p>
<p>preventing possible human rights violations.  He is of the view that these actions can help 
</p>
<p>promote a constructive dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders, and in turn 
</p>
<p>cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><i>  Reported reprisals 
</i></p>
<p>300. The Special Rapporteur is greatly concerned about allegations of an act of reprisal, 
</p>
<p>in the form of arrest and detention of Mr. Sein Than. These acts occurred while Mr. Than 
</p>
<p>was reportedly heading to the United Nations office in Myanmar to deliver information 
</p>
<p>intended for the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, whom 
</p>
<p>he met with earlier in July 2014 (MMR 5/2014). He duly takes note of the Government's </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>56</b>  
</p>
<p>response, however, regrets that no comments were made in relation to the measures that 
</p>
<p>Myanmar is taking to guarantee the exercise of the rights to peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>association in the county as well as ensure that human defenders can interact with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and his mechanism without fear of harassment.   
</p>
<p><i>  Peaceful Gathering and Procession Law 
</i></p>
<p>301. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Myanmar for clarifying the 
</p>
<p>details of Mr. Sein Than&#8217;s arrest in relation to the provisions of its law governing peaceful 
</p>
<p>assemblies (the Law on the Right to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession) (MMR 
</p>
<p>5/2014). However, he recalls his concerns that that law contains provisions, including 
</p>
<p>relating to the regime of authorization and on the conduct of protests, which unduly restricts 
</p>
<p>the right to peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p>302. He restates the decisive role played by assemblies and the importance of enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of the right to peaceful assembly to build peaceful and democratic societies. To this end, he 
</p>
<p>urges the authorities of Myanmar to respect, protect and fulfill the rights to peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and association.  
</p>
<p><i>  Draft Law relating to the Registration of Organizations 
</i></p>
<p>303. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns about the draft Law relating to the 
</p>
<p>Registration of Organizations (MMR 2/2014). These concerns  include, the restrictive  
</p>
<p>definitions, the registration process of associations and the area in which they may 
</p>
<p>geographically operate, and the prior authorization process to establish an association. He 
</p>
<p>encourages a broader definitions of &#8216;associations&#8217; in line with international standards to 
</p>
<p>include any groups of individuals or any legal entities brought together to collectively 
</p>
<p>express, promote, pursue and defend common interests&#8221; (as per A/59/401, paragraph 46). 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur echoes his earlier concerns regarding the right to appeal in the 
</p>
<p>draft, which would be done by the same registration committee, and the denial of 
</p>
<p>unregistered associations from undertaking fundraising activities.  He notes that the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association also protects association that are not formally registered as stated in  
</p>
<p>the thematic report of 2012 (A/HRC/20/27). 
</p>
<p>304. The Special Rapporteur recalls the insight of Human Rights Council resolution 24/5, 
</p>
<p>and in particular operative paragraph 2, and reminds the Government of Myanmar of its 
</p>
<p>obligations to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to associate freely and to 
</p>
<p>take all necessary measures to ensure that any restrictions on the free exercise of the rights 
</p>
<p>to freedom of association is in accordance with its obligations according to international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. 
</p>
<p><i>  Rights to peaceful assembly and association in the context of projects relating to natural 
</i></p>
<p><i>resource exploitation 
</i></p>
<p>305. Regarding the information received that points to an increasingly restrictive 
</p>
<p>environment for the exercise of these rights, particularly for human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>working in contexts of natural resource exploitation, the Special Rapporteur reminds that a 
</p>
<p>positive environment that allows and promotes the rights of all people to freely associate 
</p>
<p>and assemble is essential in the context of exploitation of natural resources to ensure a fair, 
</p>
<p>transparent and accountable process that benefits all the parties involved (A/HRC/29/25). In 
</p>
<p>this regard, he remains seriously concerned about allegations of arrest and charges against, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Thaw Zin in relation to several demonstrations he organized in 2013 against the 
</p>
<p>Letpadaung copper mine (MMR 1/2014).  
</p>
<p>306. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that the arrest and detention of Mr. Zin 
</p>
<p>may be linked to the exercise of his rights to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>57 
</b></p>
<p>opinion and expression. He recalls that Mr. Zin was previously arrested and detained under 
</p>
<p>Article 18 of the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Law but was released by way 
</p>
<p>of a presidential amnesty granted on 31 December 2013. He notes the reply of the 
</p>
<p>Government and he articulates that there should be a presumption in favour of holding 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies and associating freely. The Special Rapporteur also believes that the 
</p>
<p>exercise of fundamental freedoms should not be subject to previous authorization by the 
</p>
<p>authorities, but at the most to a prior notification procedure. The rationale behind a prior 
</p>
<p>notification process is to allow State authorities to facilitate the exercise of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and to take measures to protect public safety and order and 
</p>
<p>the rights and freedoms of others.  
</p>
<p><i>  Rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association for groups most at risk. 
</i></p>
<p>307. With regard to the deterioration of the human rights situation in the Rakhine State  
</p>
<p>and further discrimination and persecution against the Rohingya community (PR 
</p>
<p>07/04/2014), the Special Rapporteur endorses the concerns of the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation in Myanmar. He further invites the Government of Myanmar to refer to 
</p>
<p>international legal instruments and principles which state concrete measures that States 
</p>
<p>should adopt to achieve non-discrimination and equality.  
</p>
<p>308. The worries expressed in the press release should be taken together with the views 
</p>
<p>expressed in his report on the threats to the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association for groups most at risk. The Special Rapporteur observed that, often by design, 
</p>
<p>citizenship and residency status frequently affect assembly rights ((A/HRC/26/29). He 
</p>
<p>recalls the concerns expressed in his report that article 354 of the Constitution of Myanmar 
</p>
<p>grants the right of assembly uniquely to citizens (thus denying the right to non- citizens). 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur finds no basis in international law for depriving non-citizens of 
</p>
<p>their assembly rights and notes that those rights of significant importance for non-citizens 
</p>
<p>and migrants, who may not be privy to other mechanisms with which to advance their 
</p>
<p>political, social and economic interests. He expresses concern once more that the 
</p>
<p>assemblies of certain groups, like the Rohingya, have been selectively targeted. The special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur urges the Government to be bold in addressing the human rights challenges that 
</p>
<p>exist, in accordance with international law.  
</p>
<p><i>  Country visits 
</i></p>
<p>309. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Myanmar of his willingness to 
</p>
<p>undertake a country visit in the framework of his mandate, last indicated by letter on 30 
</p>
<p>October 2013. He notes the response of the Government, on 3 December noting such a 
</p>
<p>mission was not possible at the time. In this connection, he would be grateful for the 
</p>
<p>continuing cooperation of the Government with his mandate and he looks forward receiving 
</p>
<p>a positive reply to his request in 2015.

</p>
<p>reported failure of the authorities to respect the right of people to not be deprived arbitrarily 
</p>
<p>of their liberty and, in this regard, stresses the recommendation of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee that calls upon the Government of Nepal to take appropriate measures to ensure 
</p>
<p>that no one is subject to arbitrary arrest or detention and that detained persons enjoy all 
</p>
<p>legal guarantees (CCPR/C/NPL/CO/2, paragraph 11), in compliance with articles 9 and 14 
</p>
<p>of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Nepal acceded on 14 May 1991. 
</p>
<p>313. The Rapporteur reiterates that while the State does not have to agree with the 
</p>

</p>
<p>has a positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling environment for civil 
</p>

<p>respond promptly to his communications. In the absence of information to the contrary, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in the allegations presented in his 
</p>
<p>communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>319. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his grave concern at the killing of a lawyer and 
</p>
<p>member of the Punjab office of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan that appears to 
</p>
<p>be the direct result of his peaceful work promoting and protecting human rights. He 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that the right to life should be guaranteed by States to all individuals under all 
</p>
<p>circumstances and at all times, including in the context of the exercise of the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, as prescribed by article 3 of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights. In light of the threats that followed the attack, he remains 
</p>
<p>similarly concerned about the physical integrity and safety of civil society activists who 
</p>
<p>work on blasphemy cases in Pakistan. He requests the Government to keep him informed 
</p>
<p>about the current status of investigations, prosecution and protection plans put in place in 
</p>
<p>Pakistan to ensure that human rights defenders, and in particular lawyers, are able to carry 
</p>
<p>out their legitimate work in a safe and enabling environment without fear of threats or acts 
</p>
<p>of intimidation and harassment of any sort.  
</p>
<p>320. In addition, the Special Rapporteur appeals to the Government for detailed 
</p>
<p>information on the measures taken in relation to the alleged intimidation of the chairman of 
</p>
<p>the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons in March 2014 and attacks against his family for his 
</p>
<p>legitimate work and participation in a peaceful assembly in October 2013. He also asks the 
</p>
<p>authorities to keep him informed about the actions taken with regard to the threats against 
</p>
<p>the chairman and the vice-chairman of the aforementioned organization for their 
</p>
<p>collaboration with the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances during 
</p>
<p>its visit to the country in September 2012. He remains greatly concerned by these 
</p>
<p>allegations of reprisals and echoes the Human Rights Council resolutions 12/2, 24/24 and 
</p>
<p>27/38, which condemn all acts of intimidation or reprisal by Governments and non-State 
</p>
<p>actors against individuals and groups who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights 
</p>
<p>321. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to remind the positive obligation of 
</p>
<p>State Parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to guarantee the 
</p>
<p>protection of the rights contained under the Covenant against violations by their agents and 
</p>
<p>by private individuals or entities, which includes the obligation to take appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible and repair the 
</p>
<p>damage caused (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, paragraphs 8 and 18). In turn, he warns against 
</p>
<p>situations that may seriously impair the enjoyment of these rights (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 
</p>
<p>20). 
</p>
<p><i>  Negative obligation of the State to not  unduly interfere with these rights  
</i></p>
<p>322. The Special Rapporteur reminds authorities that they must ensure that everyone can 
</p>
<p>peacefully express their views without any fear; they also have a negative obligation not to 
</p>
<p>obstruct the exercise of the right to freedom of association, which includes guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>that both registered and unregistered association can seek and secure funding and resources 
</p>
<p>without discrimination (A/HRC/20/27, paragraphs 64 and 68). He notes with concern that 
</p>
<p>associations&#8217; ability to access funding appears compromised by the Foreign Contributions 
</p>
<p>Bill 2013 and the policy regulating  organizations receiving foreign contributions, which 
</p>
<p>only consider registered associations eligible for foreign funding and resources. Additional 
</p>
<p>provisions regulating associations receiving foreign funding, which introduce intrusive </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b>  
</p>
<p>requirements, allow for the State to unduly interfere with associations&#8217; areas of work and 
</p>
<p>activities, and provide for insufficient safeguards are of grave concern to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur and require revision in accordance with international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>standards. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur warns against the vague definitions contained 
</p>
<p>in the said bill that may lead to arbitrary applications of the law.  
</p>
<p>323. The Special Rapporteur encourages Pakistan to overturn any legislation that curtails 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Moreover, he articulates that States cannot refer 
</p>
<p>to additional grounds to restrict this right other than the limited ones contained in the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and cannot loosely interpret 
</p>
<p>international obligations to restrict the right to freedom of association (A/HRC/23/39, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 30). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>324. In reference to the country visit requests he sent in September 2011 and October 
</p>
<p>2013, the Special Rapporteur would like the Government to take note of his desire to carry 
</p>
<p>out a country visit to Pakistan in the framework of his mandate. He thanks the Government 
</p>
<p>for its acknowledgment of his country request on 28 September 2011 and hopes to receive a 
</p>
<p>positive reply from the Government, in the spirit of Human Rights Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>15/21 and 24/5 which calls upon States to consider favourably his or her requests for visits.

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>327. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Philippines failed to 
</p>
<p>provide substantial responses to the questions raised in the communications since the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the mandate in 2011. He considers responses to his communications as an 
</p>
<p>important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate and urges again the 
</p>
<p>authorities to comply with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) 
</p>
<p>and 15/21 (2010) that call upon States to cooperate fully with and assist him in the 
</p>
<p>performance of his mandate and to respond promptly to his communications. In the absence 
</p>
<p>of information to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in 
</p>
<p>the allegations presented in his communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>328. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the reports of aggressions and 
</p>
<p>violations of the rights of indigenous leaders and other civil society activists, including 
</p>
<p>attacks and killings, for their peaceful and legitimate work in the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure that such 
</p>
<p>acts are promptly investigated, appropriate measures are taken, perpetrators are brought to 
</p>
<p>justice and victims are adequately compensated, particularly in cases in where the police or 
</p>
<p>other state agents, are involved. He emphasizes that the right to life should be guaranteed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>61 
</b></p>
<p>by States to all individuals under all circumstances at all times, including in the context of 
</p>
<p>the exercise of the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, as prescribed 
</p>
<p>by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Moreover, he reminds the 
</p>
<p>obligation of States to ensure a conducive environment to the free exercise of the right of 
</p>
<p>association. a right enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>which was ratified by the Philippines on 23 October 1986. In turn, the expert warns against 
</p>
<p>situations that may seriously impair the enjoyment of these rights (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 
</p>
<p>20). In addition, the Special Rapporteur requests the Government to keep him informed in 
</p>
<p>the briefest delays of the current status of investigations and measures taken to guarantee 
</p>
<p>the rights of civil society activists to carry out their legitimate activities without fear of 
</p>
<p>harassment, stigmatization or violence of any kind. 
</p>
<p> Natural resources exploitation&#8217;s contexts and groups experiencing higher risks  </p>
<p>329. In connection with the allegations indicating  attacks against members of indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities, the Special Rapporteur invites the Government of the Philippines to adopt 
</p>
<p>concrete measures to achieve non-discrimination and equality as referenced in relevant 
</p>
<p>international legal human rights instruments and standards. In particular, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People calls upon States to combat prejudice, 
</p>
<p>eliminate discrimination and promote tolerance, understanding and good relations among 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and all other segments of society. Furthermore, this Declaration 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the rights of indigenous peoples to participate fully in the political, economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural life of the State, and to determine their own identity or membership in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their customs and traditions (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples, articles 5 and 33). The Special Rapporteur also stresses that indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities, as well as environmental, land rights and other activists and groups that 
</p>
<p>advocate for the effective consultation and participation of communities affected by land-
</p>
<p>related decisions affecting them, are categories of people requiring special attention. He 
</p>
<p>reiterates that a resolute positive environment promoting the rights of all people to freely 
</p>
<p>associate and assemble is essential in the context of exploitation of natural resources to 
</p>
<p>ensure a fair, transparent and accountable process that benefits all the parties involved 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/25, paragraph 67). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>330. In reference to the country visit requests he sent in September 2011 and October 
</p>
<p>2013, the Special Rapporteur would like the Government to take note of his desire to carry 
</p>
<p>out a country visit to the Philippines in the framework of his mandate. He looks forward to 
</p>
<p>receiving a positive reply at the earliest possible opportunity. He point out that Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 15/21, which established his mandate, and 24/5, which renewed it 
</p>
<p>for an additional period of three years, both urge the States to consider his requests for 
</p>
<p>visits favourably.

<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>333. The Special Rapporteur expresses his thanks to the Government of the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea for its replies to the communications sent during the period under consideration. In 
</p>
<p>this connection, he is grateful for the cooperation extended to the mandate, in compliance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>334. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the measures taken by the police to secure the 
</p>
<p>area around the construction site of Miryang power transmission tower and settlement made 
</p>
<p>to establish a memorial altar by the same area. He is pleased to learn that the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission of Korea dispatched a human rights monitoring group to the 
</p>
<p>site. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the State committed to protect and promote rights 
</p>
<p>set forth in international law and standards, and in that regard, looks forward to receiving 
</p>
<p>further information on the outcome of the proceedings and investigations related to the 
</p>
<p>cases mentioned in his communication dated 18 august 2014 (KOR 3/2014), which include 
</p>
<p>alleged assault on residents and excessive use of force by the police. He reiterates that a 
</p>
<p>resolute positive environment promoting the rights of all people to freely associate and 
</p>
<p>assemble is essential in the context of exploitation of natural resources to ensure a fair, 
</p>
<p>transparent and accountable process that benefits all the parties involved (A/HRC/29/25, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 67). 
</p>
<p>335. Regarding the reported 391 teachers accused of engaging in protests since the 
</p>
<p>sinking of the Sewol  Ferry in April 2014, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea&#8217;s National Constitution that provides for the political impartiality of 
</p>
<p>education. However, he articulates that there should be a presumption in favour of holding 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies and that States cannot refer to additional grounds to restrict this right 
</p>
<p>other than the limited ones contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, and cannot loosely interpret international obligations to restrict the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of association (A/HRC/23/39, paragraph 30). With this in mind, he encourages the 
</p>
<p>Government to overturn any legislation that unduly curtails the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>336. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its invitation to carry out a visit 
</p>
<p>to the country during the first half of 2016. He hopes to respond to the authorities in the 
</p>
<p>near future with a proposal for dates for this visit, within the framework of his other 
</p>
<p>mandated activities for 2016, and reiterates his appreciation to the Government for its

<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>342. The Special Rapporteur takes notes of two replies received during the period under 
</p>
<p>consideration and regrets that three communications did not receive a reply to date.  He 
</p>
<p>considers responses to his communications an important part of the cooperation of 
</p>
<p>Governments with his mandate and urges the authorities to comply with Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010) which call upon States to 
</p>
<p>cooperate fully with him in the performance of his mandate and to respond promptly to his 
</p>
<p>communications.  
</p>
<p><i>  Reported intimidation and reprisals 
</i></p>
<p>343. The Special Rapporteur is greatly concerned about allegations of an act of reprisal 
</p>
<p>against Mr. Visuvalingam Kirupaharan in relation to threats made against him at a Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council side-event in Palais des Nations, Geneva on 21 March 2014. He is 
</p>
<p>concerned about the smear campaign against Mr. Kirupaharan, including in the media, for 
</p>
<p>his work with the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms (LKA 5/2014). He duly 
</p>
<p>notes the Government's reply and reiterates the views expressed in his follow-up response 
</p>
<p>(LKA 12/2014) that the State remains the primary duty-bearer tasked with protecting 
</p>
<p>defining and promoting human rights. 
</p>
<p>344. Earlier reprisals on 6 March 2014 on State television against 24 civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations for issuing a report to the Human Rights Council are also a cause for concern 
</p>
<p>(LKA 4/2014). In particular, the Special Rapporteur is alarmed about the allegations that 
</p>
<p>State TV undermined the image and the credibility of associations in retaliation for their 
</p>
<p>legitimate human rights work. 
</p>
<p>345. In relation to these cases, the Special Rapporteur would value further information 
</p>
<p>detailing the measures Sri Lanka is taking to ensure the freedoms of association and 
</p>
<p>expression in the country as well as guarantee that human rights defenders can interact with 
</p>
<p>the United Nations and his mechanism without fear of harassment. 
</p>
<p><i>  Positive obligation of the State to actively protect peaceful assemblies 
</i></p>
<p>346. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the dispersal of a peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly of individuals gathered to discuss cases of disappearance in Sri Lanka and 
</p>
<p>possible collusion between the perpetrators of the intimidation and law enforcement 
</p>
<p>authorities (LKA 10/2014). He notes that the State committed to protecting and promoting 
</p>
<p>rights set forth in international laws and standards, including in the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights acceded by Sri Lanka on 11 Jun 1980, which enshrines the 
</p>
<p>rights to peaceful assembly and association. He reaffirms that there should be a positive 
</p>
<p>presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies and that the State has an obligation to 
</p>
<p>actively protect such gatherings. That obligation includes the protection of participants of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies from individuals or groups of individuals who aim to disrupt or 
</p>
<p>disperse such assemblies (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 33). </p>

</p>
<p><i>  Maintenance of an enabling environment for associations 
</i></p>
<p>347.  The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the right to freedom of association requires 
</p>
<p>the Government of Sri Lanka to take positive measures to create and maintain an 
</p>
<p>environment in which individuals exercising this right are able to execute there functions 
</p>
<p>freely, without, among other things,  being subjected to acts of intimidation, violence or 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrest (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63).  He expresses concern about the case 
</p>
<p>involving Ms. Jayakumari (LKA 3/2014) and calls upon the Government to ensure that 
</p>
<p>victims of violations and abuses of the right to freedom of association have to the right to 
</p>
<p>an effective remedy and obtain redress (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 84 (j)). 
</p>
<p>348. Following the recent review of the State of Sri Lanka by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, the Special Rapporteur takes note with concern of the continuous application of 
</p>
<p>emergency regulations to counter terrorism that curb the right to freedom of association 
</p>
<p>beyond the very limited restrictions provided for by international human rights law 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/LKA/CO/5, paragraph 11). He reminds the authorities that the definitions and 
</p>
<p>restrictions existing in international law are sufficient and the only legitimate grounds to 
</p>
<p>regulate the right to associate. Therefore, he warns against regulations and practices 
</p>
<p>designed to silence, intimidate and harass those who wish to carry out their activities in 
</p>
<p>association with others. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visits 
</i></p>
<p>349. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to note his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to Sri Lanka in the framework of his mandate, last indicated by letter on 10 
</p>
<p>April 2015.  He trusts that such a visit would allow him to examine in person the issues 
</p>
<p>related to his mandate, identify good practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to 
</p>
<p>the relevant stakeholders. He reiterates that Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, which 
</p>
<p>established his mandate, and 24/5, which renewed it for an additional period of three years, 
</p>
<p>both urge the States to consider favourably his requests for visits. In this connection, he 
</p>
<p>would be grateful for the continuing cooperation of the Government with his mandate and 
</p>
<p>he looks forward receiving a positive reply so as to enable a visit before the end of his

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>360. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the numerous replies received 
</p>
<p>during the period under consideration and regrets that two communications did not receive 
</p>
<p>a reply to date. He views responses to his communications as an important part of the 
</p>
<p>cooperation of Governments and calls upon the Government to continue engaging with his 
</p>
<p>mandate on these crucial issues, in conformity with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 
</p>
<p>(2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environmental and land rights defenders 
</i></p>
<p>361. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern indications that numerous environmental 
</p>
<p>and land rights defenders were subjected to threats, violence or harassment in the reporting 
</p>
<p>period. He expressed his dismay at the multiple violations detailed in the communication of 
</p>
<p>THA 2/ 2015, including the killings of Mr. Pitan Thongpanang, Mr. Somsuk Kohkrang and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Chai Bunthonglek, the attempted killing of Mr. Suwit Jeh-Soh, the temporary 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention of Mr. Pianrat Boonrit and the threats made against 
</p>
<p>environmental and land rights defenders as well as community members. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur takes note of the reply on 2 April 2015, informing him of the status of the 
</p>
<p>investigations and looks forward to receiving further information on the outcome of the 
</p>
<p>proceedings. Regarding the context provided by the Government related to the long history 
</p>
<p>and the complexity of land disputes, he recalls that precisely in relation to complex 
</p>
<p>situations, the effective exercise of the rights to peaceful assembly and association can be 
</p>
<p>important means tocall for greater respect for human rights. Furthermore, these rights 
</p>
<p>provide for a non-violent alternative for seeking change and also give authorities a chance 
</p>
<p>to gain insight into views and sentiments of its citizens.  
</p>
<p><i>  Rights to peaceful assembly and association in the context of projects relating to natural 
</i></p>
<p><i>resource exploitation 
</i></p>
<p>362. In relation to attacks and threats to environmental activities in the context of a 
</p>
<p>project relating to natural resource exploitation, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his 
</p>
<p>concern about the allegations of attacks against villagers of Nanongbong and members of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>66</b>  
</p>
<p>the Khon Rak Ban Keod Group of environmental activists who have been campaigning 
</p>
<p>against the environmental and health impacts of gold mines in their communities (THA 
</p>
<p>5/2014). He takes note of the response from 9 September 2014 providing further 
</p>
<p>information on the police investigation into the case and detailing other mechanism and 
</p>
<p>initiatives for the protection of human rights defenders. He recalls that the State committed 
</p>
<p>to protecting and promoting rights set forth in international law and standards, and in that 
</p>
<p>regard, awaits further information on the outcome of the proceedings and investigations 
</p>
<p>related to the case. 
</p>
<p>363. The Special Rapporteur also stresses that environmental, land rights and other 
</p>
<p>activists and groups that advocate rights of those at risk are targeted because of their 
</p>
<p>lobbying activities, including for effective consultation and participation of communities 
</p>
<p>affected by land-related decisions. He urges that a positive environment allowing and 
</p>
<p>promoting the rights of all people to freely associate and assemble is essential in the context 
</p>
<p>of exploitation of natural resources to ensure a fair, transparent and accountable process 
</p>
<p>that benefits all the parties involved (A/HRC/29/25, paragraph 67). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>364. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the right to freedom of association obliges the 
</p>
<p>Government to take positive measures to create and maintain an environment in which 
</p>
<p>individuals exercising this right are able to execute their functions freely, without being 
</p>
<p>subjected to acts of intimidation or violence (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63).  Over a decade 
</p>
<p>after the enforced disappearance of Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit, a human rights lawyer and 
</p>
<p>senior member of two lawyers&#8217; associations,, he urges the Government to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators are held criminally responsible (PR 11/03/2014). Impunity for such violations 
</p>
<p>may act as a powerful deterrent for other civil society members to exercise their rights to 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and association. 
</p>
<p>365. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his dismay at the suspension of the Constitution 
</p>
<p>and imposition of martial law on 20 May 2014 (THA 6/2014) and acknowledges the reply 
</p>
<p>of the Government from 13 June 2014. While he welcomes the efforts to decrease the 
</p>
<p>measures taken under the Emergency Laws and notes the indication that these are 
</p>
<p>temporary emergency measures until an interim constitution is put in place, he stresses that 
</p>
<p>democratic processes are essential to the guarantee of human rights. In that regard, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes his concerns regarding the curbing of fundamental rights since the 
</p>
<p>military assumed power in the country (PR 13/06/2014). He is alarmed at allegations that 
</p>
<p>indicate a continuing trend of restrictions on, and arrests of, individuals exercising their 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.   
</p>
<p>366. Regarding the public criticism of authorities and charges, detention or convictions of 
</p>
<p>21 individuals in relation to l&#232;se-majest&#233; offences (THA 13/2014), the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is aware of the Government&#8217;s response, which justified the application of l&#232;se-majest&#233; laws, 
</p>
<p>giving reasons including the protection of the rights or reputation of the King of Thailand 
</p>
<p>and the necessity of  l&#232;se-majest&#233; to uphold national security and public order. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur continues to disagree with this rationale and this interpretation of the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Code and the Computer Crime Act and considers that they do not comply with Thailand&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations, which include the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights. In that regard, he requests further information on the measures taken, 
</p>
<p>in order to repeal or amend the l&#232;se-majest&#233; laws and to bring domestic legislation into 
</p>
<p>conformity with Thailand&#8217;s obligations under international human rights instruments such 
</p>
<p>as the aforementioned Covenant.  
</p>
<p>367. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the situations of members of 
</p>
<p>associations, including the cases of Ms. Nurainee Uma, Ms. Khongkachomkiet and Mr. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>67 
</b></p>
<p>Homla-or and those related to the activities of the associations in monitoring and 
</p>
<p>documenting cases human rights violations (THA 4/2014 and THA 10/2014).  
</p>
<p>368. Moreover, he expresses concern at the reported instance of arbitrary arrest, torture 
</p>
<p>and other ill-treatment in custody of student activist Ms. Kritsuda Khunasen, by members 
</p>
<p>of the military forces, in relation to her affiliation with the United front of Democracy 
</p>
<p>against Dictatorship (THA 9/2014). In this regard, he echoes the serious concerns expressed 
</p>
<p>by the Committee against Torture during its recent review of the State, about bout the 
</p>
<p>continued allegations of widespread torture and ill-treatment of detainees by the military, 
</p>
<p>the police and prison officials (CAT/C/THA/CO/1, paragraph 10). Without a reply from the 
</p>
<p>Government providing clarification of this case, the Special Rapporteur, reiterates his 
</p>
<p>concerns about the lack of investigation into those allegations and the ungrounded arrest 
</p>
<p>warrant issued against Ms. Khunasen. 
</p>
<p>369. He is particularly worried when these allegations take place in a context of 
</p>
<p>restrictions to multiple rights and fundamental guarantees, against human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>and political opponents in Thailand following the military coup and imposition of martial 
</p>
<p>law (THA 9/2014, THA 10/2014). 
</p>
<p>370. The Special Rapporteur stresses that while the State does not have to agree with the 
</p>
<p>opinions and criticisms expressed by people who embrace different convictions or beliefs, it 
</p>
<p>has a positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling environment for civil 
</p>
<p>society, in terms of enjoyment of the rights of peaceful assembly and association, so that it 
</p>
<p>may exist, operate and express itself freely and without fear. 
</p>
<p><i>  Draft Public Assembly Act 
</i></p>
<p>371. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns about the draft Public Assembly Act, 
</p>
<p>which may unduly curtail the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression if adopted in its present form. Among his chief concerns 
</p>
<p>are articles 7 and 11 (related to the regime of authorization for planning protests); article 13 
</p>
<p>(specifying that an authorized body may instruct the organizers to modify a public 
</p>
<p>assembly); article 27 (relevant to the policing of assemblies); article 28 (pertaining to the 
</p>
<p>disciplinary liabilities of a competent official who undertakes actions to contain a public 
</p>
<p>assembly); article 18 (which prohibits assemblers &#8220;from causing inconvenience to the 
</p>
<p>general public&#8221;); and article 30 (providing that the organizer of a public assembly may be 
</p>
<p>subject to imprisonment for minor reasons, including failure to notify the competent 
</p>
<p>authority of the intention to hold an assembly). 
</p>
<p>372. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that, as it stands, the draft Act is inconsistent 
</p>
<p>with the obligations Thailand has committed to under international law. He recalls that the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the freedom to peaceful assembly must not be subjected to previous 
</p>
<p>authorization (A/HRC/20/27). Authorities ought to provide assembly organizers with 
</p>
<p>timely and complete rationale for the imposition of restrictions and law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials must be held personally and fully accountable for violations of the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly (A/HRC/20/27). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visits 
</i></p>
<p>373. In reference to the country visit requests he sent in September 2011 and October 
</p>
<p>2013, the Special Rapporteur would like the Government to takes note of his desire to carry 
</p>
<p>out a country visit to Thailand in the framework of his mandate. He hope to receive a 
</p>
<p>positive reply from the Government, in the spirit of Human Rights Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>15/21 and 24/5 which call upon States to consider his requests for visits favourably. </p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>377. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Viet Nam for its detailed 
</p>
<p>responses to the communications. In this connection, he is grateful for the cooperation 
</p>
<p>extended to the mandate, in compliance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 
</p>
<p>(2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>378. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government reply indicating that Mr. Le 
</p>
<p>Cong Cau, head of the Buddhist Youth Movement and secretary-general of the Executive 
</p>
<p>Institute of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, was interrogated at the Phu Bai 
</p>
<p>Airport of Thua Thien Hue city in January 2014 as a result of the alleged presence of 
</p>
<p>unauthorized items in his luggage. He also takes note of the authorities&#8217; denial that an arrest 
</p>
<p>and interrogation ever took place at Truong An district police station in February 2014 
</p>
<p>(VNM 7/2014). While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the legal steps taken by the 
</p>
<p>country to increase accountability of public officials found guilty of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, he recalls that the State committed to protect and promote rights set forth in 
</p>
<p>international law and standards, and in that regard, looks forward to receiving further 
</p>
<p>information on the outcome of the investigations related to the reported interrogation of Mr. 
</p>
<p>Cong Cau in March 2013. 
</p>
<p>379. Regarding the case of Mr. Pham Chi Dung who was reportedly prevented from 
</p>
<p>traveling abroad to take part  in a side-event at the Human Rights Council in February 2014 
</p>
<p>(VNM 5/2014), the Special Rapporteur disagrees with the arguments that the acts of one 
</p>
<p>person can jeopardize public order since it is difficult to envision that the acts of a single 
</p>
<p>individual may disrupt public order. The Special Rapporteur articulates that there should be 
</p>
<p>a presumption in favour of exercising the right to freedom of association and that security 
</p>
<p>considerations should not be used as a justification for unduly strict rules or interpretations 
</p>
<p>that void this right. The Special Rapporteur contends that no restrictions may be placed on 
</p>
<p>the exercise of this right other than those that are strictly necessary under the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that Viet Nam acceded on 24 September 1982. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, he echoes the Human Rights Council resolutions 12/2, 24/24 and 27/38 which 
</p>
<p>condemn all acts of intimidation or reprisal by Governments and non-State actors against 
</p>
<p>individuals and groups who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>380. The Special Rapporteur also refers to the dispersal of an assembly in My An Hun B 
</p>
<p>village in February 2014 (VNM 4/2014). He reminds the authorities that protestors seek to 
</p>
<p>convey opinions and, very often, challenge norms, and that while their right may be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>69 
</b></p>
<p>restricted in certain limited circumstances, hindering road traffic does not constitute a valid 
</p>
<p>reason to curtail the right to assemble. Since it largely relies on the fundamental use of 
</p>
<p>public space, the right to assemble can, among other things, cause challenges such as 
</p>
<p>disruptions in traffic flows. However, the Special Rapporteur, stresses that the right should 
</p>
<p>always be promoted and protected by the State, in accordance with its international 
</p>
<p>obligations. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur warns against restrictions used in a 
</p>
<p>manner that impairs the right to assembly and refers to the General Comment No. 31 of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee on the nature of the general legal obligation imposed on States 
</p>
<p>parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that &#8220;where 
</p>
<p>such restrictions are made, States must demonstrate a necessity and may only take  
</p>
<p>measures that are proportionate to the legitimate aims in order of ensuring the continuous 
</p>
<p>and effective protection of Covenant rights&#8221; (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, paragraph 6).  
</p>
<p>381. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to remind the authorities about the 15 
</p>
<p>recommendations regarding the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association 
</p>
<p>accepted by the State of Viet Nam during its review by the Universal Periodic Review in 
</p>
<p>January 2014, which, among others, call upon the State to create conditions favourable to 
</p>
<p>the realization of freedom of association and to fully guarantee the freedom of assembly, 
</p>
<p>online as well as offline, to all its citizens (A/HRC/26/15, paragraphs 143.165 and 
</p>
<p>143.171).  
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>382. In reference to the country visit requests he sent in February 2014, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would like the Government to take note of his desire to carry out a country visit 
</p>
<p>to Viet Nam in the framework of his mandate. He trusts that such a visit would allow him to 
</p>
<p>examine on site the issues related to his mandate, identify good practices and formulate 
</p>
<p>pertinent recommendations to relevant stakeholders. He looks forward to receiving a 
</p>
<p>positive reply at the earliest possible opportunity. He reiterates that Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 15/21, which established his mandate, and 24/5, which renewed it for an 
</p>
<p>additional period of three years, both urge the States to consider favourably his requests for 
</p>
<p>visits. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Europe and Central Asia region 
</b></p>
<p>383. During the present reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 28 communications 
</p>
<p>to countries in the Europe and Central Asia region. Almost half of these communications 
</p>
<p>were follow-ups to cases previously brought to the attention of the State concerned and a 
</p>
<p>further 10 others related to draft laws or legislation, which were considered as possible 
</p>
<p>breaches of the rights to freedom of association and assembly. He note of the response rate 
</p>
<p>of 79 per cent for the region. 
</p>
<p>384. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of taking all necessary steps to 
</p>
<p>secure the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association in all the countries in the 
</p>
<p>Europe and Central Asia region. In particular, he notes the challenges faced by civil society 
</p>
<p>and other stakeholders in exercising their right to associate freely.  
</p>
<p>385. On one hand, he recalls the frequency with which members of associations are the 
</p>
<p>targets of threats, acts of intimidation or violence, including enforced disappearances, 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrests, detention, torture, media smear campaigns or travel bans, in retaliation for 
</p>
<p>their undertaking their legitimate work. It is with great conviction that he reminds States of 
</p>
<p>their duty to take positive measures to establish and maintain an enabling environment for 
</p>
<p>individuals to enjoy their rights and operate without fear.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>70</b>  
</p>
<p>386. On the other hand, the Special Rapporteur is discouraged by the increasing 
</p>
<p>legislative barriers to the free exercise of the right to associate. Despite the fact that States 
</p>
<p>have recognized unanimously and on various occasions that resources are necessary for the 
</p>
<p>existence and sustainable operations of associations, he continues to witness a worrying 
</p>
<p>tendency to discriminate against and stigmatize organizations that receive foreign funding. 
</p>
<p>He concludes that these practices, instead of seeking further transparency and increasing 
</p>
<p>accountability as they often claim, aim to add supplementary bureaucratic obstacles and 
</p>
<p>exacerbate negative perceptions of the role of associations, and thus violate the 
</p>
<p>international human right commitments of States that have agreed to them.   
</p>
<p>387. In connection with the right to peaceful assembly, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
</p>
<p>that while States&#8217; do not have to agree with the opinions and criticisms expressed by people 
</p>
<p>who embrace different convictions or beliefs, it has a positive obligation to ensure the 
</p>
<p>existence of an enabling environment for civil society, in terms of enjoyment of this right, 
</p>
<p>so that it may express itself freely and without fear. He is concerned by the various reports 
</p>
<p>from the Europe and Central Asia countries referring to vague legal provisions that allow 
</p>
<p>for arbitrary interpretations and undue restrictions on the freedom of assembly. During the 
</p>
<p>period under review, he witnessed with increasing worry the way in which security 
</p>
<p>considerations were used as a justification to curb the right to assemble by equating 
</p>
<p>peaceful protest movements with threats to public order and granting sweeping powers to 
</p>
<p>security forces to dissolve them and to judicial authorities to criminalize protestors.   
</p>
<p>388. The Special Rapporteur reminds the States that the definitions and restrictions 
</p>
<p>existing in international law are sufficient and the only legitimate grounds to regulate the 
</p>
<p>right to peaceful assembly. Therefore, he warns against regulations and practices designed 
</p>
<p>to silence, intimidate and harass those who wish to collectively express their opinions 
</p>
<p>through public assemblies.

<p>Press Release on 19 August 2014  (PR 19/08/2014). He notes increasing incidents of 
</p>
<p>surveillance, interrogation, arrest, sentencing on the basis of trumped-up charges, assets-
</p>
<p>freezing and ban on travel of the activists in the country and expresses alarm at the upsurge 
</p>
<p>in the politically-motivated repression of activists in reprisal for their legitimate work in 
</p>
<p>documenting and reporting human rights violations. He recalls that authorities have legal 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights law to guarantee that everyone in Azerbaijan 
</p>
<p>can exercise their rights to peaceful assembly and association without undue interference.  
</p>
<p>397. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern about the arrest of Mr. Intigam 
</p>
<p>Aliyev, a human rights lawyer and head of the Legal Education Society, a human rights 
</p>
<p>organization that appears to be the result of his organization&#8217;s peaceful work promoting and 
</p>
<p>protecting human rights (AZE 5/2014). In view of Mr. Aliyev&#8217;s pre-trial detention, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur remains similarly concerned about the physical integrity and safety of 
</p>
<p>civil society activists who work on human rights in Azerbaijan in light of the increased 
</p>
<p>targeting of human rights defenders and the organizations to which they are associated. He 
</p>
<p>requests the Government to keep him informed about the current status of the case and 
</p>
<p>measures put in place in Azerbaijan to ensure that human rights defenders, and in particular 
</p>
<p>lawyers, are able to carry out their legitimate work in a safe and enabling environment 
</p>
<p>without fear of threats or acts of intimidation and harassment of any sort. 
</p>
<p>398. In relation to the case of Ms. Leyla Yunus, director of the Azerbaijani Institute of 
</p>
<p>Peace and Democracy, and Mr. Arif Yunusov, a scholar and head of Conflict Studies in the 
</p>
<p>Institute of Peace and Democracy, as well as Mr. Rasul Jafarov, the coordinator of Art of 
</p>
<p>Democracy, the Special Rapporteur  expresses concern that the violations against them may 
</p>
<p>be linked to their legitimate human rights activities (AZE 4/2014).  An earlier 
</p>
<p>communication detailed reports of questioning, searches and restrictions of movement of 
</p>
<p>Ms. Leyla Yunus and Mr. Arif Yunusov  as well as the confiscation of equipment and 
</p>
<p>material from their organization, the Institute of Peace and Security, and the deportation 
</p>
<p>and detention on charges of treason and espionage of journalist Mr. Rauf Mirkadyrov (AZE 
</p>
<p>3/2014). The Special Rapporteur seeks up-to-date facts concerning the status of these cases 
</p>
<p>and requests information about what actions have been taken to ensure that the legitimate 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of association is respected and that the physical and psychological integrity 
</p>
<p>of those exercising this right is guaranteed in the country. 
</p>
<p>399. While the Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government&#8217;s response on 15 July 
</p>
<p>2014 to his communication sent on 6 May 2014 (AZE 2/2014), he reiterates his concerns 
</p>
<p>over the situations of Mr. Anar Mammadli and Mr. Bashir Suleymanli  of the Azerbaijani 
</p>
<p>Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies Centre, and Mr. Elnur Mammadov of the 
</p>
<p>Volunteers of International Cooperation Public Union. He recalls that their convictions 
</p>
<p>appear to be in retaliation for their legitimate work in documenting alleged widespread 
</p>
<p>irregularities and human rights violations around the presidential elections of 9 October </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>72</b>  
</p>
<p>2013. The Special Rapporteur repeats his calls to the authorities to immediately release Mr.  
</p>
<p>Mammadli, Mr.  Suleymanli and Mr. Mammadov, and reinstate their rights.  
</p>
<p><i>  Negative obligation of the State to not to unduly interfere with these rights  
</i></p>
<p>400. In relation to the freezing of the accounts of at least nine non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations (AZE 5/2014), the Special Rapporteur recalls that the ability for associations 
</p>
<p>to access funding and resources is an essential and vital part of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association (A/HRC/20/27, paragraphs 67). He invokes article 13 of the Declaration on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Defenders which states that &#8220;everyone has the right, individually and in 
</p>
<p>association with others, to solicit, receive and utilize resources for the express purpose of 
</p>
<p>promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through peaceful means, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with article 3 of the present Declaration&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur interprets 
</p>
<p>this to mean that organizations should be able to use their available resources to undertake 
</p>
<p>their activities and views the freezing of accounts as impeding these activities 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/23/39, paragraph 17). He recalls that the State committed to protecting and 
</p>
<p>promoting the rights set forth in international law and standards, and in that regard, looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving further information on the outcome of the proceedings and 
</p>
<p>investigations related to the judicial freeze of the nine non-governmental organizations in 
</p>
<p>this case. 
</p>
<p>401. Concerning the registration of Mr. Jafarov&#8217;s organization, Human Rights Club, and 
</p>
<p>the foreign funding it received, he recalls that a regime of notification to establish an 
</p>
<p>association should be in force and associations should be established following a process 
</p>
<p>that is simple, easily accessible and non-discriminatory (AZE 4/2014). If registration of an 
</p>
<p>association is denied, the corresponding registrations bodies should provide a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive and timely written explanation and the associations should be able to 
</p>
<p>challenge any rejection before an impartial and independent court. He stresses that any 
</p>
<p>associations, including unregistered ones, should be permitted to function freely, with their 
</p>
<p>members operating in an enabling and safe environment (A/HRC/23/39, paragraph 95 and 
</p>
<p>96). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visits 
</i></p>
<p>402. The Special Rapporteur hopes to be able to honour the invitation of the Government 
</p>
<p>of Azerbaijan to conduct an official visit to the country in the near future, within the 
</p>
<p>framework of his pre-existing mandated activities, and reiterates his appreciation to the 
</p>
<p>Government for its collaboration in relation to this request.

<p>receiving funds from the Norway Civil Grants (HUN 1/2014). In this connection, he is

</p>
<p><i>  Negative obligation of the State to not to unduly interfere with the right to freedom of

</p>

<p>discretionary attributions given to the Government Audit Office, which through its actions 
</p>
<p>may obstruct and stigmatize the work of associations operating in the country. In this 
</p>
<p>context, he reminds the authorities of their obligations to promote and protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>associations to carry out their activities free from fear of threats or acts of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>harassment of any sort. 
</p>
<p>409. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the State committed to protect and promote

<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>417. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kyrgyzstan for its reply to the 
</p>
<p>communication sent on 6 May 2014, indicating that the objective of the Bill &#8220;On 
</p>
<p>introducing additions and changes to certain legislative acts in the Kyrgyz Republic&#8221; are to 
</p>
<p>ensure safety and protection of, inter alia, the traditional family (KGZ 1/2014). However, 
</p>
<p>he regrets that the authorities have not replied to the communication on 23 September 2014 
</p>
<p>and urges them to provide a detailed response to the questions raised in his letter (KGZ 
</p>
<p>5/2014), in conformity with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) 
</p>
<p>and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Draft </i>law &#8220;<i>On introducing additions and changes to certain legislative acts in the Kyrgyz 
</i></p>
<p>Republic&#8221;  </p>
<p>418. The Special Rapporteur reiterated his concern that the draft law &#8220;On introducing 
</p>
<p>additions and changes to certain legislative acts in the Kyrgyz Republic&#8221; may arbitrarily 
</p>
<p>restrict the right to freedom of association and obstruct the legitimate work of several 
</p>
<p>organizations that carry out human rights activities and provide essential humanitarian, 
</p>
<p>cultural and social services in the country (KGZ 5/2014). Article 1 of this draft, which aims 
</p>
<p>to amend three existing laws, introduces an additional obligation for non-commercial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>75 
</b></p>
<p>organizations established in Kyrgystan, involved in &#8220;political activities&#8221; and receiving 
</p>
<p>funding from foreign sources, to register as a &#8220;foreign agent&#8221; and is vague in its definition 
</p>
<p>of political activities. That article further grants the Ministry of Justice the power to 
</p>
<p>conduct, inter alia, scheduled and unscheduled inspections of the concerned organizations, 
</p>
<p>request and check any internal documents, and to suspend their activity for up to 6 months 
</p>
<p>without waiting for a court decision, in case an organization fails to file an application for 
</p>
<p>inclusion in the register of non-commercial organizations acting as a &#8220;foreign agent&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>419. The Special Rapporteur recalls that any association &#8220;should have the right to seek 
</p>
<p>and secure funding and resource from domestic, foreign, and international entities&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/20/27 para. 68).  The Special Rapporteur reminds the State that it has an obligation 
</p>
<p>not to obstruct the exercise of the right to freedom of association. This responsibility 
</p>
<p>includes guaranteeing that both registered and unregistered associations can seek and secure 
</p>
<p>funding and resources without discrimination (A/HRC/20/27, paragraphs 64 and 68). 
</p>
<p>Moreover, he notes that the requirement to organizations register a &#8220;foreign agents&#8221; could 
</p>
<p>stigmatize civil society organizations and human rights defenders, as well as deter them 
</p>
<p>from seeking resources to undertake their activities. The Special Rapporteur reminds the 
</p>
<p>Government of its obligation to ensure that civil society, including human rights defenders, 
</p>
<p>in Kyrgyzstan can carry out their legitimate work free from undue restrictions. 
</p>
<p> Draft Bill &#8220;On the formation of a positive attitude toward non<i>-traditional forms of sexual 
</i></p>
<p>relations&#8221; </p>
<p>420. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government&#8217;s reply on 21 April 2015 and 
</p>
<p>expresses his grave concern about the draft Bill &#8220;On the formation of a positive attitude 
</p>
<p>toward non-traditional forms of sexual relations&#8221; and the discriminatory consequences and 
</p>
<p>negative impacts it could have on the peaceful and legitimate work of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders (KGZ 1/2014). This Bill would amend several pieces of legislation, including the 
</p>
<p>Law on Peaceful Assembly, and introduce a range of criminal and administrative sanctions 
</p>
<p>on persons contributing towards the creation of &#8220;a positive attitude toward non-traditional 
</p>
<p>sexual orientation.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern at the detrimental effect 
</p>
<p>of the Bill on the peaceful and legitimate work of human rights defenders in Kyrgyzstan 
</p>
<p>who are working to protect and promote the rights of the LGBTI community. He reminds 
</p>
<p>the States of its obligation to safeguard the human rights of LGBTI people is well 
</p>
<p>established in international human rights law based on Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, which, in article 1, unequivocally reads: &#8220;All human beings are born free and equal 
</p>
<p>in dignity and rights.&#8221; (A/HRC/26/29, paragraph 20). He also recalls the concerns raised by 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Committee regarding reports of violence against LGBTI people by both 
</p>
<p>State and non-State actors, and the failure of the authorities to address such violence in 
</p>
<p>violation of the rights to non-discrimination and equality set forth in the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, acceded by Kyrgyzstan on 4 October 1994 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/KGZ/CO/C, paragraph 9). 
</p>
<p>421. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that general laws governing assemblies may have 
</p>
<p>a disproportionate impact on certain groups and some of the most prominent examples 
</p>
<p>include &#8220;public morality&#8221; laws that have been used against those promoting LGBTI rights 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/29, paragraphs 29, 30 and 31). He denounces regulations and practices 
</p>
<p>designed to silence, intimidate and harass those who promote the human rights of LGBTI 
</p>
<p>people through public assemblies and seeks to know what measures have been taken to 
</p>
<p>ensure that human rights defenders, including civil society and activists and particularly 
</p>
<p>those working on LGBTI issues, can operate in a safe and enabling environment, and can 
</p>
<p>carry out their legitimate activities without fear of harassment, stigmatization or

<p>of the Supreme Court to label the spiritual emblem of these associations, a sauwastika

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>435. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its 
</p>
<p>detailed and timely replies to all the communications he sent during the reporting period. In 
</p>
<p>this connection, he is grateful for the cooperation extended to the mandate, in compliance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010).  
</p>
<p><i>  Law on Non-commercial Organizations which Carry Functions of Foreign Agents  
</i></p>
<p>436. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the replies to the communications sent in 
</p>
<p>June, September and November (RUS 5/2014, RUS 7/2014 and 9/2014) indicating that the 
</p>
<p>Law on Non-commercial Organizations which Carry Functions of Foreign Agents (the 
</p>
<p>Law) appeared to violate fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to freely 
</p>
<p>associate. He takes note that the provisions of the Law are based on a presumption that non-
</p>
<p>profit organizations act fairly and within the law. However, he remains gravely concerned 
</p>
<p>about the use of overly broad definitions to single out associations that allegedly carry out 
</p>
<p>political activities and receive foreign funding and is worried about the targeting of human 
</p>
<p>rights organizations that engage with United Nations Human Rights mechanisms. In this 
</p>
<p>context, he shares the observation of the Human Rights Committee that considers the 
</p>
<p>definition of &#8220;political activity&#8221; in the Law as very broadly construed, allowing authorities </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>78</b>  
</p>
<p>to register a wide range of non-governmental organizations as &#8220;foreign agents&#8221;, without 
</p>
<p>their consent or a court decision (CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, paragraph 22). 
</p>
<p>437. In addition, the Special Rapporteur warns against justifications for excessive 
</p>
<p>intrusive methods based on the need for greater transparency within the civil society sector. 
</p>
<p>In this regard, the obligation for associations to report on all funds received from foreign 
</p>
<p>sources is disproportionate as it exceeds the interest pursued (A/HRC/23/39, paragraphs 35 
</p>
<p>and 36). The Special Rapporteur reminds the State that it has a negative obligation not to 
</p>
<p>obstruct the exercise of the right to freedom of association. This important responsibility 
</p>
<p>includes guaranteeing that both registered and unregistered associations can seek and secure 
</p>
<p>funding and resources without discrimination (A/HRC/20/27, paragraphs 64 and 68). 
</p>
<p>Moreover, in his opinion, the requirement to reveal foreign funding sources could 
</p>
<p>stigmatize civil society organizations and human rights defenders, as well as deter them 
</p>
<p>from seeking resources to undertake their activities; the closure of the Anti-Discrimination 
</p>
<p>Centre Memorial is a stark example of this interference. The Special Rapporteur reminds 
</p>
<p>the Government of its obligation to ensure that civil society, including human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, in the Russian Federation can carry out their legitimate work free from undue 
</p>
<p>restrictions.  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which the right to freedom of association is exercised 
</i></p>
<p>438. The Special Rapporteur reiterate his concern at the physical attack and intimidation 
</p>
<p>of, as well as stigmatization and smear media campaigns against human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>(RUS 6/2014 and RUS 4/2014). He takes note of the reply dated 6 October 2014 indicating 
</p>
<p>that a range of investigative measures had been taken to identify the perpetrators of the 
</p>
<p>physical assault against Mr. Andrey Yurov, honorary president of the International Youth 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Movement that has its offices in the Human Rights House Voronezh. He 
</p>
<p>requests the Government to keep him informed on the progress made into these 
</p>
<p>investigations at the earliest possible time. In relation to the review conducted by the 
</p>
<p>Central Internal Security Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation into the alleged torture in detention of Mr. Ruslan Kutayev, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reminds the State of its responsibility to conduct thorough and impartial 
</p>
<p>investigations by independent bodies into allegations of torture and to take note, in this 
</p>
<p>respect, of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the updated set of 
</p>
<p>principles for the protection of human rights through action to combat impunity 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/RES/16/23, paragraph 7b). With regard to the case of the environmental human 
</p>
<p>rights defender, Mr. Evgeny Vitishko (RUS 3/2014), the Special Rapporteur thanks the 
</p>
<p>Government for clarifying his whereabouts and stresses that it is responsible for providing 
</p>
<p>accurate information to the families on the detention of people and their place of detention, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance (article 10). He remains concerned about the Mr. Vitishko&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>probationary conditions, namely the district travel ban, that seem to aim to curtail his work 
</p>
<p>promoting and protecting environmental human rights and calls upon the authorities to 
</p>
<p>ensure a conducive environment to the free exercise of the right of association, a right 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by the 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation on 16 October 1973.  
</p>
<p>439. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur seizes the opportunity of this report to stress the 
</p>
<p>concerns expressed in his last year Observations&#8217; report (A/HRC/26/29/add.1) and 
</p>
<p>reiterated by the Human Rights Committee in March 2015 (CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, paragraph 
</p>
<p>10) about, inter alia, reports of discrimination, hate speech and violence against LGBTI 
</p>
<p>people and activists in violation of their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, and laws 
</p>
<p>banning &#8220;promotion of non-traditional sexual relations to minors&#8221;, which obstruct, </p>

<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>440. In reference to the country visit requests he sent in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would like to Government to take note of his desire to carry out a country visit 
</p>
<p>in the framework of his mandate. He hopes to receive a positive reply from the 
</p>
<p>Government, in the spirit of the aforementioned resolutions, which call upon States to 
</p>
<p>consider favourably his requests for visits.

<p>the non-governmental organization the Women in Black for their active role in

<p>grateful for the cooperation extended to the mandate, in compliance with Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>443. While he takes note of the ongoing judicial and misdemeanours proceedings against 
</p>
<p>the former spokesperson of the Anti-Terrorist Unit of the Ministry of Interior for the 
</p>
<p>alleged threats made against Ms. Sta&#353;a Zajovic, the co-founder of Women in Black, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur requests up-to-date facts and actions taken to ensure that the legitimate 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly are respected and that the physical 
</p>
<p>and psychological integrity of those exercising this right is guaranteed in the country. In 
</p>
<p>this connection, he also requests the country to endeavour to guarantee that investigations 
</p>
<p>are conducted promptly to ensure the accountability of any person responsible for  the 
</p>
<p>alleged violations, avoid repetition, provide full redress to the victims and send a positive 
</p>
<p>message to civil society, as soon as possible. Moreover, he urges the Government to take all 
</p>
<p>necessary steps to secure the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association as 
</p>
<p>per articles 21 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights acceded to 
</p>
<p>by Serbia on 12 March 2001. 
</p>
<p>444. With regard to the attacks against the participants of a peaceful gathering organized 
</p>
<p>by the Women in Black at Valjevo&#8217;s town square on 8 July 2014, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>stresses again that States have a positive obligation to actively protect these assemblies, 
</p>
<p>including from individuals or groups who aim to disrupt them (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph

<p>las comunicaciones enviadas durante el per&#237;odo del presente informe. Considera que las 
</p>
<p>respuestas a sus comunicaciones constituyen una parte esencial de la cooperaci&#243;n de los 
</p>

</p>
<p>y 15/21 (2010) del Consejo de Derechos Humanos. En este sentido, se congratula del

</i></p>
<p>451. Con respecto a las comunicaciones en las cuales el Relator Especial expresaba 
</p>
<p>preocupaci&#243;n por la inminente consideraci&#243;n del Proyecto de Ley Org&#225;nica de Protecci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>de la Seguridad Ciudadana, as&#237; como el proyecto de reforma del C&#243;digo Penal en sus 
</p>
<p>secciones relativas a delitos de terrorismo y de orden p&#250;blico (ESP 1/2015, ESP 3/2015), 
</p>
<p>lamenta que a pesar de sus acciones conjuntas con otros expertos independientes de las 
</p>
<p>Naciones Unidas exhortando a Espa&#241;a rechazar aquellos proyectos de reformas, el pa&#237;s los 
</p>
<p>haya adoptado considerando unas enmiendas muy limitadas. El Relator Especial disiente 
</p>
<p>con los argumentos esgrimidos por el Estado en sus respuestas y reitera las mismas 
</p>
<p>preocupaciones expresadas con anterioridad. En su opini&#243;n, la actual Ley Org&#225;nica 4/2015 
</p>
<p>de Protecci&#243;n de la Seguridad Ciudadana, ya sea por sus definiciones ambiguas de ofensas 
</p>
<p>o bien penalidades excesivas por delitos o aun transfiriendo ofensas del plano criminal al 
</p>
<p>administrativo exceptu&#225;ndolas de ciertas garant&#237;as legales como la presunci&#243;n de inocencia, 
</p>
<p>incrementa los riesgos de interpretaciones arbitrarias de la norma y criminalizaci&#243;n de la 
</p>
<p>protesta social, respectivamente. Asimismo, al Relator Especial le preocupa seriamente que 
</p>
<p>definiciones amplias y con alcances imprecisos conlleven a la autocensura, una de las 
</p>
<p>pr&#225;cticas sociales m&#225;s regresivas para el goce de derechos y libertades fundamentales.  
</p>
<p>452. De similar forma, considera que la Ley Org&#225;nica 1/2015 en la secci&#243;n relativa a los 
</p>
<p>delitos de des&#243;rdenes p&#250;blicos y la Ley Org&#225;nica 2/2015 en materia de delitos de 
</p>
<p>terrorismo, tales como fueron adoptadas, permiten m&#225;rgenes de interpretaci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>excesivamente amplio que podr&#237;an resultar en abusos y violaciones potenciales de los 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos. Al Relator Especial le preocupa particularmente que se vulnere la 
</p>
<p>propia esencia del derecho de manifestaci&#243;n al agravar penas en supuestos de 
</p>
<p>manifestaciones pac&#237;ficas y castigar a quienes difundan p&#250;blicamente mensajes que inciten </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>81 
</b></p>
<p>a la comisi&#243;n de delitos de alteraci&#243;n del orden p&#250;blico. A su vez, le preocupa que se 
</p>
<p>utilicen consideraciones de seguridad para invalidar el derecho de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica. 
</p>
<p>Recuerda que los Estados no deber&#237;an recurrir a pr&#225;cticas derogativas en el &#225;mbito de este 
</p>
<p>derecho para luchar eficazmente contra el terrorismo (A/HRC/20/27, p&#225;rrafo 21). 
</p>
<p>453. En este contexto, hace nuevamente hincapi&#233; en el hecho de que la obligaci&#243;n de los 
</p>
<p>Estados es la de proteger activamente y promover la celebraci&#243;n de reuniones pac&#237;ficas y 
</p>
<p>para ello debe existir una presunci&#243;n favorable del rol indispensable que aqu&#233;llas 
</p>
<p>desempe&#241;an en las sociedades democr&#225;ticas. Por lo tanto, urge al Estado realizar las 
</p>

</i></p>
<p>456. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Tajikistan for its reply to the

<p>communications sent during the reporting period. In this connection, he is grateful for the 
</p>
<p>cooperation extended to the mandate, in compliance with Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Law on Public Associations  
</i></p>
<p>457. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the response provided by the 
</p>
<p>Government in relation to The draft amendments to the Law on Public Associations of 12 
</p>
<p>May 2007, which allow for new inspection procedures for public associations and new 
</p>
<p>registration and authorization mechanisms for associations receiving foreign funding (TJK 
</p>
<p>6/2014). He recalls his concern that these amendments place additional burdens on public 
</p>
<p>associations and seem to contradict the State&#8217;s obligation to establish and maintain a 
</p>
<p>conducive environment for the free operations of associations and could undermine 
</p>
<p>legitimate human rights activities in Tajikistan. Moreover, he recalls the observation of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that advises the Government of 
</p>
<p>Tajikistan to consider civil society&#8217;s and other stakeholders&#8217; comments and 
</p>
<p>recommendations in the review of the draft amendments to this law in order to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the role of civil society in fostering economic, social and cultural rights (E/C.12/TJK/CO/2-
</p>
<p>3, paragraph 10). 
</p>
<p>458. He notes with concern that legislation and legal frameworks governing the ability of 
</p>
<p>associations to seek, receive and use resources may have a substantial impact on the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right to freedom of association. Any restrictions must be in line with 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, which provides that any limitations must be necessary and 
</p>
<p>proportionate to a pressing social need. In his view, the legal requirement to account 
</p>
<p>systematically for funding from foreign sources and to apply to a new registry to receive 
</p>
<p>and use foreign funding would not meet this test of necessity and proportionality. 
</p>
<p>459. The Special Rapporteur recalls that any association &#8220;should have the right to seek 
</p>
<p>and secure funding and resource from domestic, foreign, and international entities&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/20/27 para. 68).  The Special Rapporteur reminds the State that it has an obligation </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>82</b>  
</p>
<p>not to obstruct the exercise of the right to freedom of association. This responsibility 
</p>
<p>includes guaranteeing that both registered and unregistered associations can seek and secure 
</p>
<p>funding and resources without discrimination (A/HRC/20/27, paragraphs 64 and 68). The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligation to ensure that civil society, 
</p>
<p>including human rights defenders, in Tajikistan can carry out their legitimate work free 
</p>
<p>from undue restrictions. 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>460. In relation to the case of Mr. Alexander Sodiqov, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
</p>
<p>concerns about his alleged arbitrary arrest, incommunicado, detention and enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance (TJK 4/2014). He expresses concern that the acts perpetrated against him 
</p>
<p>may be due to his human rights work and his legitimate and peaceful exercise of his right to 
</p>
<p>the freedom of association in the context of his research on conflict resolutions and other 
</p>
<p>topics in Tajikistan.  He is also concerned about the chilling effect that his arrest may have 
</p>
<p>on other students, scientists and researchers, which may adversely affect the future exercise 
</p>
<p>of the right to the freedom of association in Tajikistan. He notes with appreciation the 
</p>
<p>decision of the authorities to release Mr. Sodiqov on bail, however, expresses concerns that 
</p>
<p>the investigation into the case against him remains ongoing. He stresses that it is the 
</p>
<p>obligation of States to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble 
</p>
<p>peacefully and associate freely, online as well as offline (A/HRC/RES/24/5, operational 
</p>
<p>paragraph 2). Moreover, he reaffirms that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association are crucial cornerstones for the possible emergence and sustainability of 
</p>
<p>effective democratic systems. 
</p>
<p>461. The Special Rapporteur would be grateful for more information concerning the legal 
</p>
<p>grounds for the arrest and detention of Mr. Sodiqov and information on any investigation or 
</p>
<p>inquiries related to his case.

</p>
<p>response to the communication sent on 27 March 2014 in relation to alleged restrictions on

</i></p>
<p>465. In relation to the Law on Regulations on the Internet and Combatting Crimes 
</p>
<p>Committed by Means of Publication through Internet, No. 5651, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes with appreciation that the Constitutional Court annulled the decision to block access 
</p>
<p>to the Twitter website on 2 April 2014 after a series of court rulings objecting the measure 
</p>
<p>as unconstitutional and in violation of international human rights laws and standards (TUR 
</p>
<p>3/2014). He calls on the Turkish Government to take all the necessary steps to guarantee 
</p>
<p>full compliance of its legislation with the State&#8217;s international human rights obligations and 
</p>
<p>warns it against possible vague or ambiguous provisions that allow for arbitrary 
</p>
<p>interpretations and restrictions to the right to associate online. 
</p>
<p>466. The Special Rapporteur calls on the authorities to guarantee an unhampered access 
</p>
<p>to the Internet and echoes Human Rights Council resolution 26/13 on the promotion, 
</p>
<p>protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet. Moreover, he reminds the 
</p>
<p>Government of its obligation to promote and protect a vibrant civil society, and to ensure a 
</p>
<p>conducive environment to the free exercise of the right of association; a right enshrined in 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Turkey on 23 
</p>
<p>September 2003.  
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>467. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its invitation to carry out a visit 
</p>
<p>to the country during the second half of 2016. He hopes to respond to the authorities in the 
</p>
<p>briefest delays with a proposal for dates for this visit, within the framework of his other

<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>469. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United Kingdom for its reply 
</p>
<p>to the communication sent during the reporting period, in accordance with Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010) that call upon the State to 
</p>
<p>respond promptly to his communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Non-refoulement in the context of the right to peaceful assembly 
</i></p>
<p>470. In relation to the case of Mr. X, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern that 
</p>
<p>this individual faces serious risk of torture or ill-treatment in detention over his alleged 
</p>
<p>involvement in anti-Government Protests should he be returned to Bahrain. Mr. X has been 
</p>
<p>detained and tortured three times in Bahrain and sentenced in absentia on charges of  
</p>
<p>&#8220;illegal gathering with the intention of inciting violence,&#8221; akin to the  charge brought 
</p>
<p>against hundreds of protestors in Bahrain since 2011.  
</p>
<p>471.  The Special Rapporteur takes note of the information provided by the Government 
</p>
<p>that Mr. X remains in the United Kingdom and has not been deported, as of the date of the 
</p>
<p>reply, however, he regrets that no other information is provided with regards to the queries 
</p>
<p>in the communication. In particular, he would seek to know the results of any investigations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>84</b>  
</p>
<p>relevant to the case of forcible refoulement of Bahraini national to Bahrain. He would also 
</p>
<p>request that the Government provide detailed information about what kind of monitoring is 
</p>
<p>conducted to ensure that Bahraini asylum seekers who have not been granted asylum in the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom and have returned to Bahrain, were not subject to arbitrary detention, 
</p>
<p>torture or other ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>472. The Special Rapporteur refers to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the United Kingdom is a party. 
</p>
<p>Article 3 provides that &#8220;[n]o State Party shall expel, return (&quot;refouler&quot;) or extradite a person 
</p>
<p>to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in 
</p>
<p>danger of being subjected to torture,&#8221; which, in the case of Mr. X, would be reportedly due 
</p>
<p>to his involvement in peaceful protests in Bahrain. It further provides that &#8220;&#8220;[f]or the 
</p>
<p>purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take 
</p>
<p>into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the 
</p>
<p>State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights.&#8221; Moreover, he calls on all States, including the United Kingdom to take all 
</p>
<p>necessary steps to secure the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association as per 
</p>
<p>article 21 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>473. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to reiterate his thanks to the 
</p>
<p>Government for the visit he undertook from 14 to 23 January 2013. He recalls the 
</p>
<p>exemplary cooperation of the Government during the mission and remains grateful for its 
</p>
<p>continuous support to his mandate since its inception, and more generally for its efforts at 
</p>
<p>promoting the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association at the international

<p>476. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the cooperation extended to the mandate, in 
</p>
<p>compliance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 
</p>
<p>(2010). He thanks the Government Uzbekistan for its replies to the communications sent 
</p>
<p>during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>477. In relation to the case of Mr. Ganikhon Mamatkhonov, regional representative of the 
</p>
<p>International Society for Protection of Human Rights in the Fergana province of 
</p>
<p>Uzbekistan, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern that Mr. Mamatkhonov&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>detention, sentencing and appeal, and in particular his reported placement in a punishment 
</p>
<p>cell, may be linked to his legitimate human rights activities (UZB 2/2014). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recalls article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>which guarantees the right to freedom of association and Human Rights Council resolution </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>85 
</b></p>
<p>24/5, and in particular operative paragraph 2 that reminds States of their obligation to 
</p>
<p>respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to associate freely. 
</p>
<p>478. The Special Rapporteur would be grateful for more information concerning the legal 
</p>
<p>grounds for the detention Mr. Mamatkhonov and how these measures are compatible with 
</p>
<p>international norms and standards, including those related to the freedom of association 
</p>
<p>stated, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. He would also appreciate information regarding any 
</p>
<p>investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mamatkhonov&#8217;s trial. 
</p>
<p>479. The Special Rapporteur notes the detailed reply on 5 September 2014, regarding the 
</p>
<p>case of Mr. Fakhriddin Tillaev, a member of the Maslum Human Rights Centre and a 
</p>
<p>founding member of the Union of Independent Trade Unions (UZB 1/2014). However, he 
</p>
<p>maintains his concerns about the lack of due process in his trial and the severity of the 
</p>
<p>case&#8217;s sentencing. He would like greater information about the measures that have been 
</p>
<p>taken to ensure that  everyone in Uzbekistan can exercise the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association, in particular trade unionists, and can carry out their peaceful and legitimate 
</p>
<p>activities without fear restrictions or criminalization of any sort. 
</p>
<p>480. In light of the recent review of Uzbekistan by the Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights in June 2014, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern information 
</p>
<p>suggesting that, under the Non-governmental Organizations Act, associations are subject to 
</p>
<p>mandatory registration and supervision by the Ministry of Justice (E/C.12/UZB/CO/2, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 16). He reminds the State that the right to association equally protects registered 
</p>
<p>and unregistered organizations and request it to repeal limiting laws regulating this right to 
</p>
<p>ensure that it is exercised free from arbitrary restrictions, as recognized under article 22 of 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p><i>  Country visits 
</i></p>
<p>481. In reference to the country visit requests he sent in September 2011 and October 
</p>
<p>2013, the Special Rapporteur would like the Government to takes note of his desire to carry 
</p>
<p>out a country visit to Uzbekistan in the framework of his mandate. He hope to receive a 
</p>
<p>positive reply from the Government, in the spirit of Human Rights Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>15/21 and 24/5 which call upon States to consider his requests for visits favourably. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Middle East and North Africa region 
</b></p>
<p>482. The Special Rapporteur sent 38 communications to 12 countries in the Middle East 
</p>
<p>and North Africa region. About half of his communications address allegations of 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to peaceful assembly. The remaining communications concern prima 
</p>
<p>facie violations of either solely the right to association or to both the right to association 
</p>
<p>and peaceful assembly. He also acknowledges that the response rate was 58 per cent for the 
</p>
<p>region.  
</p>
<p>483. He expresses concerns at the lack of enabling environments for the exercise of the 
</p>
<p>rights to freely associate and to peacefully assemble in Middle East and North Africa 
</p>
<p>Region. He is pleased to see that countries in this region share a common desire to maintain 
</p>
<p>stability whilst promoting universal human rights values and standards. However, while 
</p>
<p>most of the States of this region stress in their responses that human rights are an inherent 
</p>
<p>part of their domestic legislations, he is concerned about the frequent resort to cultural, 
</p>
<p>traditional or security considerations in order to categorically reject allegations. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur therefore expresses his dismay at these types of rebuttals, particularly as the 
</p>
<p>allegations are dismissed on these grounds without the consideration of conducting </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>86</b>  
</p>
<p>necessary impartial and thorough investigations, in accordance with their obligations under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, to address and combat such incidents. 
</p>
<p>484. The Special Rapporteur recalls that although freedoms of peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>association are not absolute, any restrictions must be in line with international human rights 
</p>
<p>law, which provides that any limitations must be proportionate, and a necessary response to 
</p>
<p>a pressing social need. These rights are enshrined, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Arab 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Charter. The Special Rapporteur calls on the States from the region to shift 
</p>
<p>from discussions of human rights to swift implementation on the ground.  
</p>
<p>485. The Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of civil society&#8217;s ability to express 
</p>
<p>minority or dissenting beliefs and notes that being personally offended by actions or 
</p>
<p>behaviours of an individual or group, does not count as incitement to violence. He 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that there is a fine line between law and perceived morality. Therefore, 
</p>
<p>intercultural and interregional dialogue is of crucial importance in understanding where 
</p>
<p>cultural differences and sensitivities. However, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
</p>
<p>Governments of the region of the universality of international human rights law and urges 
</p>
<p>that its application not be subjected to limitations not permissible under international law 
</p>
<p>and standards.  
</p>
<p>486. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to refer to the resolution 16/18 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Human Rights Council in 2011, which recognizes that the free exchange of 
</p>
<p>ideas can play a positive role in promoting an environment of peace and respect and that 
</p>
<p>calls for fostering a global dialogue for the promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at 
</p>
<p>all levels, based on respect for human rights and diversity of religions and beliefs. 
</p>
<p>487. As the exercise of the rights to associate and peacefully assemble occurs 
</p>
<p>increasingly over the Internet, the Special Rapporteur warns of regulations and practices in 
</p>
<p>the region that seek to curb the enjoyment of these rights online. Moreover, he calls on the 
</p>
<p>authorities to guarantee an unhampered access to the Internet and echoes Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 26/13 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on 
</p>
<p>the Internet. He also recalls Human Rights Council resolution 24/5 and the fundamental 
</p>
<p>role of States in promoting and facilitating access to the Internet and the important role of 
</p>
<p>new information and communications technologies in enabling and facilitating the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.

<p>503. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its numerous replies 
</p>
<p>this reporting period and requests replies to the two communications for which no 
</p>
<p>responses have been received. He recalls that he considers responses to his communications 
</p>
<p>to be an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>504. Regarding the case of Mr. Sheikh Ahmed Ali Al-Salman, Secretary General of Al-
</p>
<p>Wefaq National Islamic Society, the main opposition movement in Bahrain, and a religious 
</p>
<p>key figure in the country, who interrogated at least four times since the events of February 
</p>
<p>2011 in Bahrain, the Special Rapporteur notes the response of the Government. However, 
</p>
<p>he expresses continued concern that the charges against this individual may be a result of 
</p>
<p>his dissenting views and his exercise of the freedoms of association and of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression, and request further information in relation to the judicial investigations. 
</p>
<p>505.  He recalls that the term &#8220;association&#8221;  denotes &#8220;any groups of individuals or any 
</p>
<p>legal entities brought together in order to collectively act, express, promote, pursue or 
</p>
<p>defend a field of common interests&#8221; and that the term refers to, among others, &#8220;civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, clubs, cooperatives, NGOs, religious associations, political parties, trade 
</p>
<p>unions, foundations or even online associations&#8221;  (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 51 and 52). He 
</p>
<p>urges the Government to recognize that the rights to both freedom of peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>association play a significant role in the development and survival of meaningful 
</p>
<p>democratic systems since they allow for an environment where minority or dissenting 
</p>
<p>views or beliefs are respected and enable dialogue, pluralism,tolerance and

<p>broadmindedness. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his grave concern about the sentencing 
</p>
<p>of Ms. Maryam Al-Khawaja, Ms. Zainab Al-Khawaja, and Ms. Ghada Jamsheer (BHR 
</p>
<p>15/2014).  Ms. Maryam Al-Khawaja is a human rights defender and the co-director of the 
</p>
<p>Gulf Centre for Human Rights, whose arrest was the subject of another communication in 
</p>
<p>this reporting period (BHR 12/2014). Ms. Maryam Al-Khawaja and her sister, a human 
</p>
<p>rights defender and social media activist in Bahrain, are the daughters of the co-founder of 
</p>
<p>the Bahrain centre for Human Rights defender, Mr. Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, who has been 
</p>
<p>detained since 2011. He also voices his dismay at the continued arbitrary detention of Ms. 
</p>
<p>Jamsheer, the head of the Women&#8217;s Petition Committee. 
</p>
<p>506. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur wishes to echo the observations of the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which is concerned that under the 
</p>
<p>current Law of Associations 21/1989, women&#8217;s  associations are prohibited from engaging 
</p>
<p>in political activities and their freedom of association is &#8220;hindered by lengthy registration 
</p>
<p>procedures and excessive supervision, in addition to the need to channel international 
</p>
<p>funding requests to the Ministry of the Interior&#8221; (CEDAW/C/BHR/CO/3, paragraph 31). 
</p>
<p>507. In relation to the case of alleged arbitrary arrest, detention, and torture of nine 
</p>
<p>Bahraini nationals, including  two minors (BHR 11/2014), the Special Rapporteur takes </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>89 
</b></p>
<p>notes of the reply of the Government, however, he articulates his continued preoccupation 
</p>
<p>that several of the cases mention violations of the right of peaceful assembly. He further 
</p>
<p>stresses that it is the obligation of States to respect and fully protect the rights of all 
</p>
<p>individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely (A/HRC/RES/24/5, operational 
</p>
<p>paragraph 2). 
</p>
<p>508. The Special Rapporteur restates his concerns about alleged destruction of the &#8220;Pearl 
</p>
<p>Roundabout&#8221; monument and related imagery, and continued prohibition of public access 
</p>
<p>prohibition to the site. He voices alarm at the policy of removing from both public space 
</p>
<p>and public memory the symbol of the pro-democratic movement of Bahrain and remains 
</p>
<p>troubled about continued restrictions imposed on the rights of everyone to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and peaceful assembly, as reported by civil society groups in the past few years. 
</p>
<p>He stresses that laws governing freedom of assembly should avoid blanket time and 
</p>
<p>location prohibitions, and provide for the prospect of other less intrusive restrictions, in 
</p>
<p>compliance with international human rights standards and laws. 
</p>
<p><i>  Human rights defenders and the right to association  
</i></p>
<p>509. In relation to the allegations of harassment and intimidation of members of the 
</p>
<p>Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR), he recalls his concerns about 
</p>
<p>retaliation against the human rights defenders because of their organizations&#8217; work (BHR 
</p>
<p>10/2014). He emphasizes that while the State do not have to agree with the opinions and 
</p>
<p>criticism expressed by persons espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, it has a 
</p>
<p>positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling environment for civil society, 
</p>
<p>including the enjoyment of the right of association, so that it may exist, operate and express 
</p>
<p>itself freely and without fear (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63). He urges the authorities to 
</p>
<p>implement all necessary measures to protect people exercising their right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association and peaceful assembly against threats, violence, intimidation or reprisals. 
</p>
<p>510. He considers threats against human rights defenders, including members of 
</p>
<p>associations, a grave source of concern not only to the individuals affected, but more 
</p>
<p>generally for the message it sends to other civil society actors who wish to engage in 
</p>
<p>defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p><i>  Reported reprisals 
</i></p>
<p>511. In connection with the case of alleged reprisal against Ms. Maryam Al-Khawaja 
</p>
<p>(BHR 15/2014), the Special Rapporteur expressed dismay at the case of reprisal due to her 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>512. The case of Mr. Nabeel Rajab, President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and member of other human rights organizations, who has advocated for peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstrations to defend human rights in Bahrain, is also of serious concern to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur (BHR 13/2014). He fears that this arrest and detention may be an act of reprisal 
</p>
<p>for his several week trip to Europe, where he had advocated for the recognition of human 
</p>
<p>rights in Bahrain and met with international and regional human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR). 
</p>
<p>513. In relation to these cases, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of 
</p>
<p>Bahrain to take preventive steps against similar acts in the future and to ensure full 
</p>
<p>investigations and accountability once they have occurred, in accordance with Human 
</p>
<p>rights Council resolutions 12/2, 24/24 and 27/38. </p>

</p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>526. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Egypt for its replies and urges it 
</p>
<p>to respond to the grave allegations sustained in the letters sent on 30 January 2015 (EGY 
</p>
<p>2/2015) and 3 October 2014 (EGY 13/2014), in the briefest possible delays. He recalls that 
</p>
<p>he considers responses to his communications as an important part of the cooperation of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>91 
</b></p>
<p>Governments with his mandate, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 
</p>
<p>(2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>527. He reminds the Government of its obligation to ensure that protestors can exercise 
</p>
<p>their right to assemble peacefully and that members of associations, including human rights 
</p>
<p>associations, can carry out their legitimate work in a safe and enabling environment without 
</p>
<p>fear of threats or acts of intimidation and harassment of any sort, including excessive use of 
</p>
<p>force. To comply with international human rights standards, he underlines that security 
</p>
<p>considerations should not be used as a justification for the adoption of stricter rules that 
</p>
<p>annul the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association (A/HRC/26/29 
</p>
<p>paragraph 33). He calls on the Government to conduct independent and thorough 
</p>
<p>investigations into allegations of human rights violations, to hold perpetrators accountable 
</p>
<p>and to provide the victims with full redress, without further delays. Moreover, he urges the 
</p>
<p>State to take all necessary steps to secure the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association as per articles 21 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights ratified by Egypt on 14 January 1982. 
</p>
<p>528. The Special Rapporteur restates his utmost concern at the massive waves of arrests 
</p>
<p>and mass imposition of death sentences for charges of unlawful gathering and other 
</p>
<p>offenses not involving intentional killings against supporters of deposed President Morsi 
</p>
<p>registered in Egypt in recent years (EGY 14/2014, and press releases listed above). In 
</p>
<p>particular, he expresses grave concern about the chilling effect that these disproportionate 
</p>
<p>shows of force may have on civil society, including peaceful protestors, and warns against 
</p>
<p>environments that instil fear among society, which in turn can lead to self-censorship, one 
</p>
<p>of the most regressive social practices for the enjoyment of fundamental rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms, in his opinion. 
</p>
<p><i>  Managing of peaceful assemblies 
</i></p>
<p>529. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at what appears to be a growing 
</p>
<p>criminalization of civil society activists for their role in peaceful protests and a tendency to 
</p>
<p>repress, including through excessive use of force, the attempts of civil society to 
</p>
<p>collectively voice its grievances. He reminds the Government of Egypt that protestors seek 
</p>
<p>to convey opinions and, very often, challenge norms, and insists that while the State do not 
</p>
<p>have to agree with the opinions and criticisms expressed by people who embrace different 
</p>
<p>convictions or beliefs, it has a positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment in terms of enjoyment of the right of peaceful assembly, so that people may 
</p>
<p>express themselves peacefully and without fear (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63). An enabling 
</p>
<p>environment also requires guaranteeing the  protection of peaceful protestors against the 
</p>
<p>violent conduct of others (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 33). The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recommends that the Government establishes a presumption in favour of holding peaceful 
</p>
<p>assemblies in law in a clear and explicit manner. 
</p>
<p>530. In connection with the alleged deaths of protestors in Cairo in January 2015 (EGY 
</p>
<p>2/2015) and the alleged arrests and torture in detention of children and young adults in the 
</p>
<p>said city between September 2013 and May 2014 (EGY 13/2014), the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>urges the authorities to inform him at the earliest possible time of the results of the 
</p>
<p>investigations of the circumstances leading to the reported killings, as well as of the status 
</p>
<p>of investigations and interim measures put in place concerning the allegations of unlawful 
</p>
<p>arrests and torture. He emphasizes that the right to life should be guaranteed by States to all 
</p>
<p>individuals under all circumstances and at all times, including in the context of the exercise 
</p>
<p>of the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, as prescribed by article 3 
</p>
<p>of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In addition, while expressing his serious </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>92</b>  
</p>
<p>concern at the reported instances of torture and ill-treatment, he recalls the importance of 
</p>
<p>ensuring a free and unhampered enjoyment of the right to assembly and protest to build 
</p>
<p>peaceful and democratic societies. To this end, he urges the Government of Egypt to 
</p>
<p>respect, protect and fulfil the right to peaceful assembly. He also takes this opportunity to 
</p>
<p>remind the State of its responsibility to conduct thorough and impartial investigations by 
</p>
<p>independent bodies into allegations of torture and to take note, in this respect, of the 
</p>
<p>Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the updated set of principles for the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights through action to combat impunity (A/HRC/RES/16/23, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 7b). 
</p>
<p><i>  Promoting and protecting the right to freely associate 
</i></p>
<p>531. With regard to the Law on Associations No. 84/2002, the Special Rapporteur thanks 
</p>
<p>the Government for its reply to the communication sent on 29 August 2014 (EGY 11/2014), 
</p>
<p>in addition to part of the concerns raised in a previous letter dated 17 November 2011 
</p>
<p>(EGY 12/2011, reference A/HRC/19/44).  While he notes that the aforementioned law aims 
</p>
<p>to tackle security challenges through increasing regulation of the work of the associations, 
</p>
<p>he reiterates that, in order to protect registered associations against arbitrary rejection of 
</p>
<p>their applications or time gaps in the conduct of their activities, newly adopted laws should 
</p>
<p>not request all previously registered associations to re-register (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 
</p>
<p>62). Moreover, he recalls that the process to establish an association should be simple, 
</p>
<p>easily accessible and non-discriminatory (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 95) and that the State 
</p>
<p>should permit any associations, including unregistered ones, to function freely, with their 
</p>
<p>members operating in an enabling and safe environment (A/HRC/23/39, paragraph 95 and 
</p>
<p>96). In this context, he is concerned that the Law on Associations No. 84/2002 places 
</p>
<p>additional burdens on associations that risk undermining legitimate human rights activities 
</p>
<p>in Egypt, in contradiction with the State&#8217;s obligation to establish and maintain a conducive 
</p>
<p>environment for the free operations of associations.  
</p>
<p>532. In relation to the alleged ban of activities of the April 6 Youth Movement (EGY 
</p>
<p>5/2014), the Special Rapporteur stresses that States should always promote and protect the 
</p>
<p>right to associate, and consider restricting this right only in very limited circumstances, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their international obligations. In this sense, the Special Rapporteur refers 
</p>
<p>to the General Comment No. 31 (2004) of the Human Rights Committee on the nature of 
</p>
<p>the general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, which  states that &quot;when such restrictions are made, States must 
</p>
<p>demonstrate their necessity and only adopt measures that are proportionate to the 
</p>
<p>achievement of the legitimate objectives to ensure the continuous and effective protection 
</p>
<p>of the rights under the Covenant&quot; (paragraph 6).

<p>537. The Special Rapporteur expresses his thanks to the Government of Israel for its 
</p>
<p>reply to two communications sent during the period under consideration. He regrets that 
</p>
<p>two other communications did not receive a reply to date and recalls that responses to his 
</p>
<p>communications are an important part of the cooperation of Governments. He urges the 
</p>
<p>authorities to comply with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) 
</p>
<p>and 15/21 (2010), which call upon States to cooperate fully with him in the undertaking of 
</p>
<p>his mandate and to respond promptly to his communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Context in which the rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>538. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response dated 10 March 
</p>
<p>2015, in relation to the alleged arbitrary arrest of Mr. Abdallah Abu Rahma during a 
</p>
<p>peaceful protest on 13 May 2012 and the risk of his arbitrary detention following his 
</p>
<p>conviction on 21 October 2014 (ISR 11/2014). He thanks the Government for providing 
</p>
<p>information about the judicial system and the facts of the case. 
</p>
<p>539. The Special Rapporteur notes that protestors seek to express their opinions and 
</p>
<p>frequently challenge norms in the context of their societies. While their right may be 
</p>
<p>restricted, in certain limited circumstances and in accordance with international human 
</p>
<p>rights law, he recalls that there  should be a presumption in favour of the right to peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and stipulates that since the exercise of the right largely relies on the fundamental 
</p>
<p>use of public space, the right to assemble can, among others, cause challenges such as 
</p>
<p>disruptions in traffic flows. The Special Rapporteur stresses the obligation of the State to 
</p>
<p>facilitate peaceful protests.  
</p>
<p>540. In relation to the alleged killing of Mr. Hashem Khader Abu Maria, during a 
</p>
<p>peaceful demonstration, and killings of Mr. Abdelhamid Ahmad Abdelhamid Breighith and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Sultan Yousef Mohammad during clashes that erupted afterwards, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur thanks the Government for his response dated 12 November 2014 (ISR 8/2014). 
</p>
<p>He takes note of the criminal inquiries opened into the deaths that occurred in the context of 
</p>
<p>the clashes between security forces and demonstrators and requests the authorities to keep 
</p>
<p>him informed about the results of investigations. 
</p>
<p>541. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that international human rights law only protects 
</p>
<p>assemblies that are peaceful and where participants have peaceful intentions, which he 
</p>
<p>indicates, should be presumed. He is of the view that the enjoyment of the right to peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly does not cease as a result of sporadic violence committed by others during the 
</p>
<p>demonstration, if the individual in question remains peaceful in their own intentions or 
</p>
<p>behaviour (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 25). 
</p>
<p>542.  He restates his concern at the alleged excessive use of force used against these 
</p>
<p>protestors by Israeli security forces and articulates that wherever possible, law enforcement 
</p>
<p>authorities should not resort to force during peaceful assemblies. He calls on authorities to 
</p>
<p>ensure that no one is subject to excessive or indiscriminate use of force, in the event that 
</p>
<p>such force is absolutely necessary. The Special Rapporteur also stressed the duty of the 
</p>
<p>State to ensure that law enforcement authorities who violate the right to peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>are held fully accountable for such violations by an independent oversight body and by the 
</p>
<p>courts of law (A/HRC/20/27). 
</p>
<p>543. The Special Rapporteur expresses continued worry at the threats, intimidation and 
</p>
<p>targeting of members of the association Youth against Settlement (YAS), including Mr. 
</p>
<p>Issa Amro (ISR 3/2014). He fears that the intimidation against them relates to the legitimate 
</p>
<p>activities of the association, including documenting human rights violations. While the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>94</b>  
</p>
<p>State does not have to agree with the opinions and criticism expressed by persons espousing

</p>
<p>(A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63).  
</p>
<p>544. In relation to instances of interference by the Israel authorities with the right to 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly between 31 January and 7 February 2014 and the alleged excessive use 
</p>
<p>of force by law enforcement authorities in the eviction and dismantlement of a peaceful 
</p>
<p>protest camp at Ein Hijleh on 7 February 2014, in the absence of a reply, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur  reiterates his concerns related to both the undue interference and use of force 
</p>
<p>(ISR 2/2014). He urges the police to facilitate the right of protestors to demonstrate 
</p>
<p>peacefully and to refrain from the use of excessive force against individuals exercising their 
</p>
<p>rights. He stresses that it is the obligation of States to respect and fully protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely. (A/HRC/RES/24/5, operational

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>547. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kuwait for responding to both the 
</p>
<p>communications that were sent during this reporting period. He notes with appreciation the 
</p>
<p>engagement of the country with the mandate, in compliance with Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>548. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the detailed reply, dated 9 April 2015, to his 
</p>
<p>communication of 25 February 2015 (KWT 1/2015). In light of the charges against Mr. 
</p>
<p>Mohammed al-Ajmi and the sentencing of Mr. Abdulhakim al-Fadhli (known in his identity 
</p>
<p>documents as Mr. Abdulhakim Abdurrazzaq Abdulhadi Shabath) in Kuwait, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur restates his preoccupation that their peaceful and legitimate work advocating for 
</p>
<p>the rights of Bedoon people was the rationale behind the alleged undue restriction to the 
</p>
<p>exercise of their rights to freedoms of peaceful assembly, opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>549. In relation to the Government&#8217;s response regarding the alleged defamation caused by 
</p>
<p>the individuals concerned, the Special Rapporteur reminds that while the State do not have 
</p>
<p>to agree with the opinions expressed by persons espousing minority or dissenting views or 
</p>
<p>beliefs, it has a positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling environment for 
</p>
<p>civil society, including the enjoyment of the right of association and freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>and opinion, so that it can thrive without fear (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63). The rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is of the view that there should be a presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies 
</p>
<p>and associating freely. Security considerations should not be used as a justification for 
</p>
<p>unduly strict rules or interpretations that void the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and of association. The Special Rapporteur also contends that no restrictions may be placed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>95 
</b></p>
<p>on the exercise of those rights other than those that are strictly necessary in a democratic 
</p>
<p>society and proportionate to the interest to be protected.Regarding the communication of 31 
</p>
<p>July 2014, in relation to the case of alleged use of force during peaceful demonstrations 
</p>
<p>from 2 to 7 July 2014, the arbitrary detention of a few dozens of peaceful protestors, 
</p>
<p>including Mr. Abdulhakim al-Fadhli and the inflection of serious injuries against at least 
</p>
<p>five peaceful protestors, the Special Rapporteur recalls his earlier concerns and awaits 
</p>
<p>further information from the Government (KWT 2/2014). He takes note of the reply of 19 
</p>
<p>September 2014, stipulating the legal framework in force in Kuwait. In relation to the 
</p>
<p>response of 8 October 2014 to the same communication, he notes that the pertinent 
</p>
<p>information obtained on the case is included in the communication and requests that the 
</p>
<p>Government provide responses to the concerns and questions in his communication, to the 
</p>
<p>greatest extent possible. 
</p>
<p>550. The Special Rapporteur notes the claim that certain individuals mentioned in the 
</p>
<p>communication are not citizens of Kuwait. However, with regards to non-citizens or 
</p>
<p>migrants, the Special Rapporteur recalls that international law does permit some 
</p>
<p>&#8220;citizenship-related limitations on certain political rights, such as voting rights and the 
</p>
<p>ability to hold political office&#8221; and notes that it is &#8220;precisely for that reason that States 
</p>
<p>should ensure that migrants are not stripped of other fundamental rights, particularly 
</p>
<p>assembly rights. An individual&#8217;s lack of citizenship or legal status does not mean that she or 
</p>
<p>he should have no voice whatsoever in the political, economic or social affairs of her or his 
</p>
<p>country of residence. In a sense, groups that are disenfranchised from mainstream political 
</p>
<p>activities, such as voting and holding office, have an even greater need for alternative 
</p>
<p>means to participate in the public sphere. Peaceful assemblies are an important tool for 
</p>
<p>allowing the voices of otherwise excluded groups to be heard&#8221; (A/HRC/26/29, paragraph 
</p>
<p>25).The Special Rapporteur recalls the insight of Human Rights Council resolution 24/5, 
</p>
<p>and in particular operative paragraph 2, and reminds the Government of Kuwait of its 
</p>
<p>obligations to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to associate freely, 
</p>
<p>including migrants and persons espousing minority or dissenting views, and to take all 
</p>
<p>necessary measures to ensure that any restrictions are in accordance with their obligations 
</p>
<p>under international human rights law.

</p>
<p>human rights defender by unknown assailants in Benghazi, Libya. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>555. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he has not  received a response to his 
</p>
<p>communication and reminds the Government of Libya that he considers responses to his 
</p>
<p>communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate. 
</p>
<p>He calls upon States to cooperate fully with and assist him in the performance of his 
</p>
<p>mandate, in compliance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) 
</p>
<p>and 15/21 (2010). In the absence of information to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>concludes that there is substance in the allegations presented in his communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>556. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his grave concerns based on information 
</p>
<p>suggesting that a woman human rights defender and co-founder of the Libyan Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Platform for Peace, Ms. Salwa Bugaighis, was killed by unknown assailants and that her 
</p>
<p>husband, member of the Benghazi municipal council, may have been abducted in the 
</p>
<p>context of parliamentary elections. While he notes that Benghazi has been the scene of 
</p>
<p>increasing attacks targeting  political figures, in particular, he reminds the State that the 
</p>
<p>right to associate freely is an essential component to democracy, in particular during 
</p>
<p>election periods and between elections (A/68/299, paragraph 5). He expresses similar 
</p>
<p>concern at the chilling effect that the killing of a human rights defender and reported 
</p>
<p>disappearance of a political figure may have on others who wish to exercise their right to 
</p>
<p>associate freely.. The Special Rapporteur calls on the authorities to put in place a safe and 
</p>
<p>enabling environment that is conducive to the free expression of civil society and the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right to freedom of association without undue hindrance. 
</p>
<p>557. He urges the authorities to inform him of the results of the investigations of the 
</p>
<p>circumstances leading to Ms. Bugaighis&#8217; death, as well as of the whereabouts of her 
</p>
<p>husband as soon as possible. He emphasizes that the right to life should be guaranteed by 
</p>
<p>States to all individuals under all circumstances and at all times, including in the context of 
</p>
<p>the exercise of the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, as prescribed 
</p>
<p>by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 6 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights acceded by Libya on 15 May 1970. In addition, he 
</p>
<p>refers to the General Comment No. 31 of the Human Rights Committee that recalls the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of State parties to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate and 
</p>
<p>bring perpetrators to justice or redress the harm caused by non-state actors 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, paragraphs 8 and 18). Moreover, he calls upon the Government 
</p>
<p>of Libya to respect its obligation to conduct thorough, prompt and impartial investigations 
</p>
<p>of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, in accordance with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3

<p>576. PR 13/09/2015. &#8220;Statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights 
</p>
<p>to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association at the conclusion of his visit to the 
</p>
<p>Sultanate of Oman&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>577. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Oman for its responses, but 
</p>
<p>regrets it did not respond to the letters sent on 11 November 2014 (OMN 3/2014) and 29 
</p>
<p>January 2015 (OMN 1/2015). He recalls that he considers responses to his communications 
</p>
<p>as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010) that 
</p>
<p>call upon States to cooperate fully with and assist him in the performance of his mandate 
</p>
<p>and to respond promptly to his communications. In the absence of information to the 
</p>
<p>contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in the allegations 
</p>
<p>presented in his communications. 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>578. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for inviting him to undertake an 
</p>
<p>official country visit in the country from 8 to 13 September 2014. He commends Oman for 
</p>
<p>being the first Arab country to agree on an official country visit of his mandate. He recalls 
</p>
<p>the constructive talks during the mission with members of the executive, legislative and 
</p>
<p>judicial branches and reiterates that he stands ready to provide any support the authorities 
</p>
<p>may require to implement the recommendations he put forward in his country visit report 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/25/Add.1). </p>

</p>
<p><i>  Reported reprisals 
</i></p>
<p>579. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed by the preoccupying alleged reprisals in the 
</p>
<p>country following his aforementioned official visit in September 2014. He regrets that the 
</p>
<p>Government only replied to one of the communications concerning the case of Mr. Said Ali 
</p>
<p>Said Jadad (OMN 5/2014) and, given the severity of the allegations contain therein, urges it 
</p>
<p>to provide detailed responses to the questions raised in his other letters (OMN 3/2014 and 
</p>
<p>OMN 1/2015).  
</p>
<p>580. In connection with the cases of Mr. Tariq Al Sabbahi (OMN 2/2014), who was 
</p>
<p>interrogated by internal security officers about the content of his discussions with the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, and of Mr. Jadad, detained on 21 January 2015 and charged with 
</p>
<p>various offenses during trials in Muscat and Salalah, the expert reiterates his serious 
</p>
<p>concern at what appear to be blatant cases of reprisal and calls on the State to take 
</p>
<p>preventive steps against similar acts in the future and ensure full investigations and 
</p>
<p>accountability once they have occurred, in accordance with Human rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 12/2, 24/24 and 27/38.  
</p>
<p>581. The severity of the aforementioned allegations and reliability of the sources require 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur to insist in requesting the Government to clarify and determine 
</p>
<p>whether reprisals occurred and to keep him informed about the status of investigations, 
</p>
<p>prosecution and protection plans put in place. 
</p>
<p><b>  Qatar 
</b></p>
<p>582. JAL 02/10/2014. Case no: QAT 2/2014. State reply: 18/12/2014. Alleged temporary 
</p>
<p>disappearance followed by arbitrary detention of members of an association documenting 
</p>
<p>the working and leaving conditions of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>583. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Qatar for responding to the 
</p>
<p>communication sent during this reporting period. He notes with appreciation the 
</p>
<p>engagement of the country with the mandate, in compliance with Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 (2012) and 15/21 (2010). 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>584. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the detailed response indicating that the two 
</p>
<p>members of the Global Network for Rights and Development were indeed arrested for their 
</p>
<p>role in documenting the working and living conditions of migrant workers in Qatar in 
</p>
<p>August 2014 (QAT 2/2014). He notes that Mr. Krishna Upadhyaya&#8217;s and Mr. Ghimire 
</p>
<p>Gundev&#8217;s criminal charges, which included secretly collecting information for a foreign 
</p>
<p>country without authorization in order to undermine the image of the country, were 
</p>
<p>dropped, but their footage and recording equipment was withheld, when they were 
</p>
<p>permitted to exit the country. In this context, he remains concerned at criminalization of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders and the undue interference with their activities. He emphasizes that 
</p>
<p>everyone is entitled to freedom of association under the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, which includes non-citizens, and State have the responsibility to facilitate and 
</p>
<p>protect this right. Furthermore, he reminds the authorities that the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association equally protects associations that are not registered and that the activities of 
</p>
<p>associations should not be subject to prior authorization, which could be used to quell 
</p>
<p>criticism.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>101 
</b></p>
<p>585. In addition, the Special Rapporteur believes that ahead of Qatar FIFA world cup in 
</p>
<p>2022, the country must seize the opportunity to build a pro-civil society organization 
</p>
<p>culture. He reminds that the States are required to facilitate and promote the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association of those engaging with multilateral institutions and that a strong 
</p>
<p>civil society sector is often the best source of information from the ground (A/69/365, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 43). 
</p>
<p>586. The Special Rapporteur restates that while the State do not have to agree with the 
</p>
<p>opinions and criticism expressed by persons espousing dissenting views or beliefs, it has a 
</p>
<p>positive obligation to ensure the existence of an enabling environment for civil society, 
</p>
<p>including the enjoyment of the right of association, so that it may exist, operate and express 
</p>
<p>itself freely and without fear (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63). He urges the authorities to 
</p>
<p>implement all necessary measures to protect people exercising their right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association and peaceful assembly against, inter alia, intimidation or criminalization. He 
</p>
<p>further reminds the authorities that during its most recent Universal Periodic Review the 
</p>
<p>State committed, inter alia, to strengthen the judicial framework related to the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association and expression and to reform its labour laws in order to improve 
</p>
<p>working conditions for foreign workers and to address the March 2014 ruling of the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization Governing Body on the right of migrant workers to join 
</p>
<p>a trade union and collectively bargain in Qatar (A/HRC/27/15, paragraphs 124.45 and 
</p>
<p>124.62).

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Responses to communications 
</i></p>
<p>592. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he only received replies to two out of five 
</p>
<p>communications sent during the reporting period. He recalls that responses to his 
</p>
<p>communications are an important part of the cooperation of Governments. He looks 
</p>
<p>forward to receiving detailed responses to the questions raised in his communication in the 
</p>
<p>briefest delays, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolutions 24/5 (2013), 21/16 
</p>
<p>(2012) and 15/21 (2010). In the absence of information to the contrary, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur concludes that there is substance in the allegations presented in the 
</p>
<p>communications.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>102</b>  
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which these rights are exercised 
</i></p>
<p>593. The Special Rapporteur thanks the State for transmitting information concerning the 
</p>
<p>cases of Mr Waleed Abu Al Khair and Mr. Fadhel Maki al-Manasif (SAU 14/2014). 
</p>
<p>According to information provided by the Government, both individuals were, among 
</p>
<p>others, found guilty of offenses of dishonesty and establishing and participating in the 
</p>
<p>establishment of unlicensed associations, and provoking civil strife, misleading public 
</p>
<p>opinion and tarnishing the country&#8217;s reputation, respectively. The Government emphasizes 
</p>
<p>that the measures taken against the accused were compatible with international norms and 
</p>
<p>standards. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment of the authorities to respect 
</p>
<p>its international human rights commitments. However, he refutes the argument put forward 
</p>
<p>by the Government that the limitations to fundamental freedoms set forth in the Repression 
</p>
<p>Cybercrime Act are in line with the aforementioned commitments. He reminds the State 
</p>
<p>that according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights no restrictions may be placed 
</p>
<p>on the exercise of these rights other than those that are determined by law and that strictly 
</p>
<p>intend to guarantee the respect for the rights and freedoms of others and to meet just 
</p>
<p>requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. He 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that the freedoms are the norm and the restrictions the exception. He insists that 
</p>
<p>while the State do not have to agree with the opinions and criticisms expressed by people 
</p>
<p>who embrace different convictions or beliefs, it has a positive obligation to ensure the 
</p>
<p>existence of an enabling environment for civil society, in terms of enjoyment of the rights 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly and association, so that it may exist, operate and express itself freely 
</p>
<p>and without fear (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 63).  
</p>
<p>594. In relation to the use of the Internet, the Special Rapporteur calls on the authorities 
</p>
<p>to guarantee an unhampered access to the Internet and echoes Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 26/13 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the 
</p>
<p>Internet. He also recalls Human Rights Council resolution 24/5 and the fundamental role of 
</p>
<p>States in promoting and facilitating access to the Internet and the important role of new 
</p>
<p>information and communications technologies in enabling and facilitating the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. 
</p>
<p>595. In his view, references such as the offenses to &#8220;transmitting information prejudicial 
</p>
<p>to public order&#8221;, committing &#8220;dishonesty&#8221; and &#8220;making false, unfounded and 
</p>
<p>unsubstantiated accusations&#8221; exceed legitimate international limitations and increase the 
</p>
<p>risks of arbitrary interpretations and violations of international standards. He expresses a 
</p>
<p>similar opinion regarding the other offenses pressed against Mr. Waleed Abu Al Khair and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Fadhel Maki al-Manasif. In relation to the crime of &#8220;establishing and participating in 
</p>
<p>the establishment of unlicensed associations&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur underlines that the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of association equally protects associations that are not registered and that 
</p>
<p>individuals involved in or with unregistered associations should be free to carry out their 
</p>
<p>activities and should not be subject to criminal sanctions (A/HRC/20/27, paragraph 56). 
</p>
<p>596. In this context, he articulates that there should be a presumption in favour of holding 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies and associating freely, which recognizes the  indispensable role of 
</p>
<p>assemblies in democratic societies, and that security considerations should not be used as a 
</p>
<p>justification for unduly strict rules or interpretations that void or curb the rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly and of association. In this regard, he stands ready to provide technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to ensure that State&#8217;s normative complies with international human rights norms 
</p>
<p>and standards governing these rights. 
</p>
<p>597. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Saudi Arabia to recognize that the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association play a central role in democracy and 
</p>
<p>to ensure that no one is criminalized, threatened or intimidated for exercising these rights. 
</p>
<p>He takes this opportunity to call upon the authorities to refrain from passing or 
</p>
<p>implementing laws, as well as validating practices that seriously impede the enjoyment of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>fundamental rights. He looks forward to receiving an update on the case of Mr. Fadhel 
</p>
<p>Maki al-Manasif that was still under review at the time of the Government&#8217;s response, and 
</p>
<p>on the situation of Mr. Miklif bin Daham al-Shammari, not yet addressed by the State. 
</p>
<p>598. With regard to the allegations of ill treatment of Mr. Fadhel Maki al-Manasif in 
</p>
<p>detention, the Special Rapporteur is troubled by the response of the State indicating that the 
</p>
<p>investigation conducted consisted of a mere visit and questioning by a representative of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission. He is pleased to read that the country recently opened 98 
</p>
<p>offices of the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution, under the Department of the 
</p>
<p>Attorney General, to monitor and investigate reported cases of torture. He asks the 
</p>
<p>Government to provide him with a list of investigations and results obtained by the Bureau 
</p>
<p>at the earliest opportunity. He also reminds the State of its responsibility to conduct 
</p>
<p>thorough and impartial investigations by independent bodies into allegations of torture and 
</p>
<p>to take note, in this respect, of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and 
</p>
<p>Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment and the updated set of principles for the protection of human rights through 
</p>
<p>action to combat impunity (A/HRC/RES/16/23, paragraph 7b). 
</p>
<p><i>  Country visit 
</i></p>
<p>599. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of his willingness to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit to Saudi Arabia, as indicated by his last letter on 30 October 2013. He trusts 
</p>
<p>that such a visit would allow him to examine first-hand issues relating to his mandate, 
</p>
<p>identify good practices and formulate pertinent recommendations to relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>He looks forward to receiving a positive reply at the earliest possible opportunity. He 
</p>
<p>reiterates that Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, which established his mandate, and 
</p>
<p>24/5, which renewed it for an additional period of three years, both urge the States to 
</p>
<p>consider favourably his requests for visits. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. How to submit petitions to the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>600. In October 2010, the Human Rights resolution 15/21 established the mandate of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. The 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council renewed its commitment to promote and protect the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, by adopting resolution 21/16 in October 
</p>
<p>2012 and resolution 24/5 in October 2013.1 
</p>
<p>601. Special Rapporteurs are independent experts appointed by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council to examine and report on a country situation or a specific human rights theme. This 
</p>
<p>position is honorary and the expert is not United Nations staff nor paid for his/her work. As 
</p>
<p>independent experts, they exercise their independent and professional judgement in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of all aspects of their mandates. The Special Rapporteurs are part of the 
</p>
<p>Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>602. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association includes a broad range of responsibilities. As part of his 
</p>
<p>mandate, the Special Rapporteur undertakes country visits and presents annual reports to 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is mandated to seek, receive and respond to information in order to promote and protect the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. This task includes taking up 
</p>
<p>cases of alleged violations of these rights with the State and non-State actors concerned. He 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>104</b>  
</p>
<p>can therefore intervene directly with Governments on allegations of violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights that come within his mandate by means of communications. 
</p>
<p><b>  What are peaceful assemblies and associations? 
</b></p>
<p>603. An &#8220;assembly&#8221; is an intentional and temporary gathering in a private or public space 
</p>
<p>for a specific purpose. It therefore includes demonstrations, inside meetings, strikes, 
</p>
<p>processions, rallies or even sits-in. International human rights law only protects assemblies 
</p>
<p>that are peaceful, i.e. those that are not violent, and participants with peaceful intentions or 
</p>
<p>behaviours. For more information, please see the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, A/HRC/20/27, paragraphs 24-
</p>
<p>25. 
</p>
<p>604. An &#8220;association&#8221; refers to any grous of individuals or any legal entity brought 
</p>
<p>together to collectively act, express, promote, pursue or defend a field of common interests. 
</p>
<p>For more information, see the report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>on human rights defenders, A/59/401, paragraph 46. 
</p>
<p><b>  Who can submit information? 
</b></p>
<p>605. Any party who has knowledge of a violation to the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and/or of association. This includes Governments, nongovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, individuals, including alleged victims, legal representatives, family members 
</p>
<p>and other UN and intergovernmental bodies.  
</p>
<p><b>  What happens when the information reaches the Special Rapporteur? 
</b></p>
<p>606. As information arrives, the Special Rapporteur first seeks to determine if it falls 
</p>
<p>within the mandate. 
</p>
<p>607.  Secondly, every effort is made to verify the information and seek additional details 
</p>
<p>if necessary. 
</p>
<p>608. Thirdly, the Special Rapporteur reaches out to the Government of the State where 
</p>
<p>the alleged violation is thought to have occurred or to the non-State actor concerned. This is 
</p>
<p>usually done through communications, such as &#8216;urgent appeals&#8217; or &#8216;other letters&#8217; including 
</p>
<p>&#8216;allegation letters&#8217;, addressed to the State&#8217;s diplomatic mission with the United Nations in 
</p>
<p>Geneva for transmission to capitals or to the non-State actor concerned. The letters provide 
</p>
<p>details of the victim(s), the alleged events and the human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>What is the objective of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s intervention?<b> 
</b></p>
<p>609. The primary objective of these letters is to contribute to promoting and protecting 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association by ensuring that State 
</p>
<p>authorities are informed of allegations as early as possible and that they have an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to investigate them and to end or prevent any human rights violation. With both 
</p>
<p>urgent appeal and other letters, the Special Rapporteur asks the Government to take all 
</p>
<p>appropriate measures to investigate and address the alleged events and to communicate 
</p>
<p>back the results.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>105 
</b></p>
<p><b>  What happens next? 
</b></p>
<p>610. Ideally, the Government or non-State actors investigate the alleged facts and take 
</p>
<p>action to prevent or end any violation. They are urged to respond as soon as possible to 
</p>
<p>urgent appeals and respond to other letters within a period of 60 days.  
</p>
<p>611. If the Special Rapporteur received new allegations, he may send a follow-up 
</p>
<p>communication to the State or non-State actor concerned. However, resource limitations 
</p>
<p>make it impossible for the Special Rapporteur to follow-up on every case. 
</p>
<p>612. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur and the replies received are 
</p>
<p>published in full in a report presented to the Human Rights Council. Since September 2011 
</p>
<p>onwards, this report has been issued three times per year and presented at the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council sessions in March, June and September. The reports are available at the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR website. 
</p>
<p><b>  Confidentiality 
</b></p>
<p>613. In cases where individuals are the alleged victims of violations, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur seeks either their direct consent or the agreement of their families or lawyers if 
</p>
<p>access is restricted. The identity of individuals and organizations that send information to 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur is always kept confidential and is never referred to in the letters to 
</p>
<p>Governments or non-State actors or in public reports. 
</p>
<p><b>  How to ask for action to the Special Rapporteur? 
</b></p>
<p>614. Please write an email to urgent-action@ohchr.org and freeassembly@ohchr.org, 
</p>
<p>indicating the relevant country and violation(s), along with your name and contact details. 
</p>
<p>Note that there is no need for a formal letter; what is most important is that you summarize 
</p>
<p>in a one-page document the following information: 
</p>
<p>a) Where? The place(s) where the alleged violation(s) took place, including the 
country and city 
</p>
<p>b) When? Day and hour when the alleged violation took place 
</p>
<p>c) Who is/are the alleged victim(s), indicating gender, first and last name, type of 
activity the victim(s) is/are undertaking, and whether they explicitly agree to 
</p>
<p>having their identities disclosed to the relevant authorities and in the public 
</p>
<p>report (see confidentiality policy above) 
</p>
<p>d) Who is/are the perpetrator(s), if known? For example, two men (in uniform?); 
rank, unit or other identification or title 
</p>
<p>e) What happened? Brief but detailed description of events that led you to write to 
the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>f) What is the current situation? For example, in cases of detention, is the alleged

</p>
<p>lawyer, a doctor, her/his family; has she/ he seen a judge; have charges been 
</p>
<p>brought against her/him; what are the charges; when is the trial; can she/he 
</p>
<p>appeal the court decision, etc. Time indications of all events are important, if 
</p>
<p>available.
