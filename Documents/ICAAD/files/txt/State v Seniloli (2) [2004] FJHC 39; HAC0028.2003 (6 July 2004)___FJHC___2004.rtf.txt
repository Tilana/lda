RULING

The evidence that which the Prosecution wish to lead on the manner in which the witness approached his possible return to Parliament, is highly relevant to the issues in this case and there is no dispute about it. However, the prosecution must first of all lead the evidence of the basis on which the events occurred before his return to Parliament. When he reaches the stage where it becomes a logical question to ask as to whether or not a gun was pointed him, he may ask that question directly. It does not suggest the answer.
