<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United 
Nations, the International Covenants on Human Rights, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other relevant international 
documents,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the commitment reached in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action concerning the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council decision 2/106 of 27 November 2006 and 
Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/40 of 20 April 2000, 2001/43 of 23 April 
2001, 2002/39 of 23 April 2002, 2003/41 of 23 April 2003, 2004/38 of 19 April 2004 and 
2005/36 of 19 April 2005, on the incompatibility between democracy and racism, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in its 
paragraphs 81 and 85, and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, in its 
paragraphs 10 and 11, recognize the incompatibility between democracy and racism, 
</p>
<p><i> Remaining alarmed</i> by the rise of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, in its second, third and fifth preambular paragraphs, recognizes, inter alia, that the 
diversity and richness of civilizations and cultures constitute the common heritage of 
humankind,  
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Recognizing </i>that individuals belonging to vulnerable groups, such as migrants, 
refugees, asylum-seekers and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities, continue to be the main victims of violence and attacks perpetrated or 
incited by extremist political parties, movements and groups,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that acts of racial violence and discrimination do not constitute 
legitimate expressions of opinion, but rather unlawful acts or offences,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the importance of freedom of speech and expression and the 
fundamental role of education and other active policies in the promotion of tolerance and 
respect for others and in the construction of pluralistic and inclusive societies,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance condoned by governmental policies violate human rights, as established in the 
relevant international and regional human rights instruments, and may endanger friendly 
relations and cooperation among nations, international peace and security and the harmony 
of persons living side by side within one and the same State;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> that any form of impunity condoned by public authorities for 
crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of 
law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such acts;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Emphasizes</i> that<b> </b>democracy, transparent, responsible, accountable and 
participatory governance responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, and respect 
for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are essential for the effective 
prevention and elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also emphasizes </i>that the elimination of all forms of discrimination as well as 
diverse forms of intolerance, the promotion and protection of human rights of indigenous 
peoples and the respect for ethnic, cultural and religious diversity contribute to 
strengthening and promoting democracy and political participation;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Condemns</i> political platforms and organizations based on racism, xenophobia 
or doctrines of racial superiority and related discrimination, as well as legislation and 
practices based on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as 
incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> States to reinforce their commitment to promote tolerance and human 
rights and to fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
as a way to strengthen democracy, the rule of law and transparent and accountable 
governance;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also urges</i> States to ensure that their political and legal systems reflect the 
multicultural diversity within their societies through promoting diversity, to improving 
democratic institutions, making them more fully participatory and inclusive and avoiding 
marginalization and exclusion of, and discrimination against, specific sectors of society;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> the key role that political leaders and political parties can and 
ought to play in strengthening democracy by combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and encourages political parties to take concrete steps 
to promote solidarity, tolerance and respect by, inter alia, developing voluntary codes of 
conduct that include internal disciplinary measures for violations thereof, so their members 
refrain from public statements and actions that encourage or incite racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Emphasizes </i>the obligations of States under international law to exercise due 
diligence to prevent crimes against migrants perpetrated with racist or xenophobic 
motivations, to investigate such crimes and to punish the perpetrators and that not doing so </p>


<p>violates, and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of, the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of victims, and urges States to reinforce measures in this regard;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also emphasizes</i> that human rights education and training is a key tool in 
countering the rise of extremist political parties, movements and groups, and that 
educational measures are crucial in promoting human rights and democratic values at an 
early age;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses </i>the need to increase appropriate preventive measures to eliminate all 
forms of racial discrimination, and emphasizes the important role that Governments, 
international and regional organizations, national human rights institutions, the media, non-
governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Encourages</i> States to consider developing public information, awareness-
raising and education campaigns with a transdisciplinary approach with a view to 
combating discrimination and intolerance;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Encourages</i> political leaders, civil society and the media to remain vigilant 
against the penetration of racist and xenophobic ideas in the political platforms of 
democratic parties;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Stresses </i>the need to implement fully the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal convention in the fight 
against racism; <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 15. <i>Invites</i> the relevant mechanisms of the Human Rights Council and United 
Nations treaty bodies to continue to pay particular attention to violations of human rights 
stemming from the rise of racism and xenophobia in political circles and society at large, 
especially with regard to their incompatibility with democracy;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the implementation of 
General Assembly resolution 65/1991 and its pertinent recommendations; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Invites</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to 
the Human Rights Council at its twenty-first session on the implementation of the present 
resolution.
