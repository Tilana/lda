We supplement our financial information reporting determined under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with certain
non-IFRS financial measures, including cash operating costs, We believe that these measures provide meaningful information to assist
management, investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.

Production Cost Standard (1999 revision),
Refer most recent quarterly report available at www‘stbarbaracomau for example
All-In Sustaining Cost > All-In Sustaining Cost is based on Cash Operating Costs, and adds items relevant to sustaining
production‘ It includes some, but not all, of the components identified in World Gold Council’s
Guidance Note on Non-GAAP Metrics - All-In Sustaining Costs and All-In Costs (June 2013),
Refer most recent quarterly report available at www.5tbarbara.com.au for example
Cash contribution > Cash flow from operations before finance costs, refer reconciliation of cash movement in the
