</p>
<p><i>Summary</i> 
 The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief on his mission to the Republic of Moldova, 
from 1 to 8 September 2011.  
</p>
<p> In the report, the Special Rapporteur gives an overview of the international human 
rights standards, the domestic legal framework on freedom of religion or belief and the 
religious demography in the Republic of Moldova. Subsequently, he addresses issues of 
concern for his mandate relating to the general situation of freedom of religion or belief in 
the country, including the privileged status of the Moldovan Orthodox Church; 
manifestations of intolerance; freedom of religion or belief in public school education and 
conscientious objection to military service. 
</p>
<p> In his conclusions and recommendations, the Special Rapporteur expresses his 
appreciation for the fact that the Moldovan society has been, and continues to be, in a 
process of rapid transformation, which includes, inter alia, the development of a sustainable 
human rights culture in the country. The implementation of human rights standards ranks 
high on the Government&#8217;s agenda, and significant progress has been made. This includes 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief, a human right by and large respected in the Republic of 
Moldova. Members of different orientations, including small minorities, can in general 
practice their religion or belief freely without undue interference from the State. At the

<p>same time, there are still important challenges ahead to ensure the full enjoyment of 
freedom of religion or belief for all on the basis of non-discrimination and equality. 
Remaining obstacles mainly derive from the predominant position of the Orthodox Church, 
which enjoys a privileged status at variance with the constitutional provision of a secular 
State. With a view to further improve the conditions for a non-discriminatory enjoyment of 
freedom of religion or belief, what seems to be needed, above all, is a public culture of 
appreciating diversity.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take leadership, for 
instance by issuing a robust anti-discrimination law, facilitating interreligious 
communication, elaborating education provisions to better meet diversity needs and 
speaking out clearly against incitement to religious hatred. He also recommends that the 
Government ensure the voluntary nature of religious instruction and that its registration 
procedure is in line with international human rights standards. The Special Rapporteur 
highlights the responsibilities of religious communities and their leaders in encouraging 
religious tolerance, embracing diversity and diffusing tensions.

human rights for all on the basis of non-discrimination and equality. The Special 
Rapporteur trusts that this task can be tackled successfully given the many encouraging 
manifestations of human rights commitment by the Government and civil society observed 
during his mission.

<p> IV. Religious demography.............................................................................................  20&#8211;<footnote name="2">3. Interlocutors from various backgrounds agreed that the situation of freedom of 
religion or belief has clearly improved in recent years. While still remembering the harsh 
repression and persecution during the Soviet era, members of religious and belief 
communities appreciated the fact that, today, they can generally practice their religion or 
belief freely and without fear of undue Government interference. This assessment was by 
and large shared in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, although the 
registration of religious communities there includes additional restrictive features (see 
paragraph 59 below).

</p>
<p> V. Issues of concern to the mandate .............................................................................  23&#8211;<footnote name="6">. The delegation also visited the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova and 
met with the &#8220;Minister for Justice&#8221; and various representatives of religious or belief 
communities. In 1991, the Transnistrian region unilaterally declared independence from the 
Republic of Moldova; this region has not, however, been recognized as an independent 
State by the United Nations. The Special Rapporteur nonetheless notes that the region is 
outside the de facto control of the Republic of Moldova. Since the Special Rapporteur spent 
only 24 hours in the region, his assessment of the situation therefore is less complete. 
References to the findings concerning the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova 
have been included in relevant sections of the present report. Nothing in the present report 
should in any way imply the expression of any opinion concerning the legal status of any 
territory, city or area, or of its authorities. </footnote>3 8

population of a number of towns. Today, the Jewish community in the country is much

organizations specialized in human rights, media representatives and members of various 
religious or belief communities. The Special Rapporteur met with members of the 
Moldovan Orthodox Church, the Bessarabian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic 
Church, various Protestant denominations (including Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, 
Pentecostals and Adventists), several Jewish communities, several Muslim communities, 
Baha&#8217;is, Falun Dafa, Unification Church and others. The discussions were held in Chisinau, 
Balti, Orhei and Tiraspol, as well as elsewhere in the Transnistrian region of the Republic 
of Moldova. He also met with the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes present 
in the country.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief undertook a visit to the 
Republic of Moldova, including the Transnistrian region thereof, from 1 to 8 September 
2011. The purpose of the visit was to identify good practices and existing or emerging 
obstacles to the full enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief in the country, pursuant to 
Human Rights Council resolutions 6/37 and 14/11. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his gratitude to the Government of the 
Republic of Moldova for having invited him, as part of its standing invitation extended to 
all thematic special procedures of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met with several representatives of the Government, 
including the Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration, the Minister for Defence, the 
Minister for Education, the Minister for Internal Affairs, the Deputy Minister for Foreign 
Affairs and European Integration, the Deputy Minister for Justice and the Deputy Minister 
for Labour, Social Protection and Family, as well as with officials from the ministries of 
Culture, Foreign Affairs and Justice. He also held talks with representatives of Parliament 
and the judiciary, including the President of the Superior Council of Magistracy, the 
President of the Constitutional Court and representatives of the General Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office, the Parliamentary Advocates/Centre for Human Rights, the chairperson of the 
Audiovisual Coordination Council and local authorities in Chisinau. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>7. A preliminary version of the present report was shared with the Government of the 
Republic of Moldova on 9 December 2011. The Government provided comments on 12 
January 2011 (see A/HRC/19/60/Add.<footnote name="3">8. The best documented case of public manifestation of religious intolerance against a 
religious minority was the removal and the demolition of the Jewish Chanukah Menorah 
displayed in a public place in Chisinau, in December 2009.10 A mob of around 100 people 
led by an Orthodox priest removed the Menorah and subsequently dumped it upside-down 
on a nearby monument to Stefan cel Mare, a medieval Moldovan prince and saint in the 
Moldovan Orthodox tradition. While political authorities and the media expressed outrage 
at this public manifestation of religious intolerance, no condemnation, let alone apology, 
was publicly made by the Moldovan Orthodox Church to the Jewish community. This was 
a missed opportunity to emphasize that central public places belong to everyone on a non-
discriminatory basis. The priest was eventually sentenced to paying a small fine. 
</footnote>). 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p>8. The right to freedom of religion or belief is enshrined in various international human 
rights instruments.1 These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(arts. 2, 18 &#8211; 20, and 26 and 27); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (art. 13); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women (art. 2); the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination (art. 5); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 2, 14 and 
30); and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 12). With the exception of the latter, the 
Republic of Moldova has ratified all the above-mentioned instruments. 
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is guided in his mandate by other relevant 
declarations, resolutions and guidelines of various United Nations bodies, including those 
issued by the Human Rights Committee, the General Assembly, the Commission on Human 
Rights and the Human Rights Council. Of these instruments, of particular relevance are 
articles 2, 18 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or 
Belief. The Special Rapporteur also takes into account human rights instruments adopted at 
the regional level containing provisions relating to freedom of religion or belief, such as the 
European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, in 
particular article 9 thereto.  
</p>
<p>10. The situation of human rights has been examined by United Nations treaty bodies in 
recent years, in particular by the Human Rights Committee2 and the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child,<footnote name="3">7. Reportedly, even the burial of deceased members of religious minorities in rural 
areas is occasionally met with the resistance of certain Orthodox groups who want the local 
cemetery (owned by the municipality) to remain free of graves of other denominations, 
such as Baptists, Methodists or Pentecostals. As a result of such aggressive opposition, in 
some cases, funerals had to be postponed and the bereaved faced difficulties in burying 
their loved ones in a dignified way, which is obviously an appalling situation. In addition, 
according to information received from different interlocutors, incidents of vandalism 
against Protestant houses of worship have occasionally occurred, such as the breaking of 
windows or the tearing down of walls during construction. The Special Rapporteur could 
not find any examples of the Orthodox Church clearly condemning such acts of violence or 
hostility sometimes perpetrated in the name of Orthodox Christianity. 
</footnote> in 2009, and the Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial 
Discrimination,4 in 2011. 
</p>
<p>11. The Republic of Moldova has been a member of the Human Rights Council since 
2010. In its voluntary pledges, the Republic of Moldova has committed to prevent human 
rights abuses, to reinforce national efforts and uphold the highest standards in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, to ensure the effective protection of the persons 
belonging to national minorities and to protect against and prevent discrimination in all its 
forms, both in law and in practice. 
</p>
<p>12. The Republic of Moldova was reviewed in the context of the universal periodic 
review in October 2011. Although the outcome of the review will only be adopted by the 
Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session , the Republic of Moldova has already 
accepted several recommendations relating to freedom of religion or belief and anti-
discrimination, including the recommendations that it adopt further measures to foster inter-
religious communication and a public culture of promoting socio-cultural and religious 
diversity; redouble efforts to protect the rights of members of minority religious groups; 
provide for religious community property restitution; and ensure that public events planned

</p>
<p>by religious and other rights groups are permitted and adequately policed, according to the 
obligations of the Republic of Moldova under international human rights law. The Republic 
of Moldova also supported the recommendations that it adopt the anti-discrimination law as 
soon as possible and strengthen  measures further to prevent and combat discrimination and 
investigate allegations of hate crimes, indicating that it was in the process of 
implementation. Regarding the recommendation that it consider solving the problem of 
ownership of land belonging to the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the Republic 
of Moldova has indicated that it would examine the recommendation and provide responses 
in due time, but no later than the nineteenth session of the Council.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>13. In general terms, the national legal framework of the Republic of Moldova provides 
for a broad protection of freedom of religion or belief. The Constitution of 1994 guarantees 
freedom of religion or belief (art. 31) as well as other human rights, such as equality before 
the law. In the same article, the Republic of Moldova is defined as a secular State in which 
religious communities and State institutions are separated. The Constitution also provides 
that the law should forbid and prosecute incitement to religious hatred and discrimination. 
Respect for human rights is further corroborated by the State&#8217;s ratification of international 
and regional human rights instruments. In situations of conflict or in cases of inconsistency 
between national and international provisions of human rights, the Constitution explicitly 
gives priority to international law. 
</p>
<p>14. The Law on Religious Denominations and their Constituent Parts of 2007 reiterates 
the State&#8217;s commitment to freedom of religion or belief and details legal requirements in 
certain areas. In this context, the Law clarifies that freedom of religion or belief includes, 
inter alia, the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief and to profess and manifest one&#8217;s 
religious convictions in private and in public, alone and in community with others, as well 
as the right not to profess a religion or a belief. Like the Constitution, the Law gives priority 
to international human rights norms in the event of any conflict or inconsistency. 
</p>
<p>15. The 2007 Law on Religious Denominations regulates the creation and registration of 
religious denominations and their constituent  parts. It also stipulates that religious 
intolerance manifested through acts that obstruct the free practice of religious worship and 
advocacy of religious hatred constitute offences and should be punished in conformity with 
existing legislation. 
</p>
<p>16. As a study conducted by the Ministry of Justice found, however, the above-
mentioned legal framework can be further improved. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
reform process to revise the 2007 law, to set out a more explicit legal framework in order to 
ensure the free exercise of all aspects of freedom or religion or belief.5 The Special 
Rapporteur also welcomes the efforts of the Government to adopt a comprehensive anti-
discrimination law and looks forward to the swift adoption of such a law, in full conformity 
with the relevant international legal framework. 
</p>
<p>  
 5  On 12 January 2012, the Special Rapporteur was informed by the Government of the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Moldova that a draft law regarding the modification and completion of law no. 125-XVI of 11 May 
2007 on Religious Denominations  and their Constituent  Parts had been adopted by Parliament in 
final reading on 21 December 2011. The said law has not yet been promulgated. As the final text of 
the law and a translation in English were not available, the Special Rapporteur was not in a position to 
refer to it in detail. References to the new law included in the present report are based on information 
provided by the Government (see A/HRC/19/60/Add.<footnote name="3">6. While members of religious minorities do not face problems when practicing their 
religions within the confines of their houses of worship or in other private settings, they 
may encounter difficulties when attempting to hold religious ceremonies, such as 
processions or gatherings, in the public sphere. The Special Rapporteur heard credible 
allegations that, in parts of the country, it happened that local Orthodox priests could 
exercise a de facto veto over public gatherings of religious minorities. In the Transnistrian 
region of the Republic of Moldova, the village authorities typically do not give permission 
for public religious activities without first consulting with the local Orthodox priest, who, 
in turn, is most likely to veto the presence of a competing denomination in public settings. 
From the perspective of human rights, such a practice is unacceptable, as the freedom of 
religion or belief includes the possibility to profess and manifest one's convictions in both 
private and public spheres.  
</footnote>). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Criminal Code contains several provisions relating to freedom of religion or 
belief, in particular article 346, on deliberate actions aimed at inciting national, racial or 
religious hostility or discord, and article 222, on the profanation of graves. According to 
article 77 of the Criminal Code, the commission of a crime based on religious hatred should 
be regarded as aggravating circumstances when determining punishment. Several other 
articles relating to specific crimes foresee more severe penalties for crimes committed with 
a motivation of religious hatred. This legal framework is complemented by article 54 of the 
Code on Administrative Offences dedicated to the infringement of the legislation on 
religious denominations. 
</p>
<p>18. The Republic of Moldova has adopted a national human rights plan of action for the 
period 2010-2014. While the plan contains a general commitment to promote and protect 
human rights, it does not contain any specific reference to freedom of religion or belief. 
Insofar as the plan includes provisions for its amendment following the universal periodic 
review, the Special Rapporteur expects that the missing elements of freedom of religion or 
belief can now be included and recommends that explicit measures in this regard be taken 
up in the revised plan. 
</p>
<p>19. Regarding the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, the &#8220;authorities&#8221; 
have proclaimed their adherence to the main international human rights treaties. The legal 
framework in this region also includes a new series of rules relating to religious issues that 
were adopted in 2009 which set out, inter alia, additional requirements for the registration 
of religious organizations, including re-registration. In particular, these new rules establish 
a probation period of 10 years for religious communities, from the date of initial 
registration during which the communities are barred from various forms of public 
communication, including the distribution of religious documents or appearances in the 
media. The apparent intent of these rules is to ensure that the religious community is &#8220;loyal 
to society&#8221; and &#8220;to prevent extremism&#8221; (according to an &#8220;official&#8221;). These new rules strike 
at the heart of the right to freedom of religion or belief, and have a fundamentally chilling 
effect on the exercise of other rights, such as freedom of opinion and expression. 
Furthermore, according to the new rules, the &#8220;Ministry of Justice&#8221; is responsible for 
registration issues, and may conduct a religious assessment of religious communities, which 
can further delay the registration process.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Religious demography 
</b></p>
<p>20. According to the most recent report on the Republic of Moldova submitted under the 
Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the 
2004 census showed that 93.<footnote name="3">5. Relations among the followers of different religions and beliefs, including those who 
identify themselves as non-believers, generally seem to be peaceful in the country. When 
observing the interaction between members of different religious groups, however, the 
Special Rapporteur had the impression that a culture of interreligious communication still 
needed to be developed. Furthermore, he received credible reports about manifestations of 
intolerance against members of minorities and even some incidents of intimidation or 
vandalism, especially in rural areas. Such incidences have also been reported in the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. 
</footnote> per cent of Moldovans declared themselves to be Orthodox 
Christians, one per cent were Baptists, 0.4 per cent were Seventh-Day Adventists, 0.<footnote name="3">4. The predominant place and attitude of the Orthodox Church are also very present in 
the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. For example, the Special Rapporteur 
heard plausible allegations that local authorities defer to the views of Orthodox clergy in 
banning Protestant religious gatherings in the region. 
</footnote> per 
cent were Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, 0.15 per cent were Russian Orthodox Old Rite Believers 
and 0.15 per cent were Evangelists. The report also found that 1.1 per cent of the population 
belonged to other religious communities, including 4,645 Catholics, 700 Muslims and 
1,667 Jews.6 Some interlocutors encountered during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission were 
sceptical that Orthodoxy in fact accounted for such a large percentage of the general public. 
Civil society organizations reported that, in general, people declaring no religious affiliation 
may be registered as Orthodox for official purposes unless they explicitly request 
otherwise. 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Third report submitted by Moldova pursuant to article 25, paragraph 2 of the Framework Convention 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of National Minorities (ACFC/SR/III(2009)001), 24 February 2009, p. 25. </p>

</p>
<p>21. According to the same Government report, as at February 2009, the following 
religious entities (&#8220;Denominations and religious organizations&#8221;) enjoyed official status: 
1,224 parishes of the Moldovan Orthodox Church, 199 parishes of the Bessarabian 
Orthodox Church, 15 dioceses of the Russian Orthodox Old Rite Church, 27 entities of the 
Chisinau Roman Catholic Bishopric, 241 churches of the Union of the Evangelical 
Christian Baptist Church, one church of Seventh-Day Adventists, 29 entities of the Church 
Union of the Christians of the Evangelical Faith (Pentecostals), 129 Jehovah&#8217;s Witness 
</p>
<p>communities, eight entities affiliated with the Jewish communities, two Apostolic 
Armenian Churches, three Societies of Krishna Conscientiousness of the Republic of 
Moldova, two Union of Christian Spiritual Communities Molocani, one Baha&#8217;i religion, 
one Religious Presbyterian Community &#8220;Peace Church&#8221;, 11 New Apostolic Churches, 18 
Union of Free Christian Churches (Charismatics), three Churches of the Last Testament, 
three Bible Churches, one Union of Messianic Jews and seven Evangelical-Lutheran 
Churches. 7 
</p>
<p>22. According to a Ministry of Justice document dated 30 April 2010, in the second half 
of 2009 and first four months of 2010, the Ministry registered one religious community: the 
Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the Patriarchate of Moldova Kiev and All Russia-Ukraine. It 
also registered three more entities belonging to the Moldovan Orthodox Church, two 
entities belonging to the Union Gospel Baptist Christian Churches in Moldova, and one 
parish of the Orthodox Diocese of Eastern Moldova Kiev Patriarchate and all Russia-
Ukraine. Despite repeated efforts by a number of Muslim organizations, the authorities 
refused to register any Muslim community until March 2011, when the Islamic League of 
the Republic of Moldova was registered. The Special Rapporteur met a number of 
representatives of various religious organizations that still have not been officially 
registered, despite their efforts. He also met groups that had succeeded in registering as 
civil society organizations, having been unsuccessful in registering as religious 
organizations.

<p>belief. The Special Rapporteur was invited to participate in a round table on the revision of 
the 2007 law, organized by the Ministry of Justice and the United Nations country team, on 
6 September 2011, to which religious communities and civil society organizations had been 
invited. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to have had the opportunity to attend this 
consultation by which the Government set a positive example of transparency and dialogue 
with civil society. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur was also impressed by the commitment, knowledge and 
professionalism of civil society organizations working on human rights and anti-
discrimination issues. 
</p>
<p>27. At the same time, the various discussions held by the Special Rapporteur also 
revealed a number of problems existing in the Republic of Moldova. Members of religious 
minorities repeatedly reported manifestations of intolerance and even some incidents of 
assault, intimidation or vandalism allegedly perpetrated by some followers of the 
predominant Orthodox Church. This affects in particular Jews, Muslims and members of 
different Evangelical groups, including Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. Although a few cases of 
</p>
<p>conflict were reportedly settled successfully, the Special Rapporteur noticed existing 
scepticism concerning the efficiency of the judiciary and other formal remedies provided by 
the State. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Privileged status of the Moldovan Orthodox Church 
</b></p>
<p>28. According to the Constitution, the Republic of Moldova is a secular State in which 
freedom of religion or belief for everyone is guaranteed. The Constitution also provides for 
equal rights for all citizens. At the same time, however, the 2007 Law on Religious 
Denominations explicitly acknowledges &#8220;the special importance and leading role of the 
Orthodox Christian religion and, respectively, of the Moldovan Orthodox Church in the 
life, history and culture of the Republic of Moldova&#8221; (art. 15.5). The importance of 
Orthodox Christianity in the past and present of the country is a well-established historical 
fact. From the perspective of human rights, however, the problem is that the formal 
appreciation of Orthodoxy in a legal document can easily be seen as justifying privileged 
treatment of one religious tradition at the expense of the principles of equality and non-
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur heard many testimonies confirming that this is, to a large 
extent, effectively the case. From the various Orthodox denominations existing in the 
country, the Metropolis of Chisinau and all Moldova (Moldovan Orthodox Church), 
subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate, enjoys privileged treatment in many fields, 
including the restitution of property confiscated during the Soviet era, chaplains serving in 
the military, the presence of priests in public schools and involvement in the management 
of municipal cemeteries.  
</p>
<p>30. Conflicts have also arisen between the various churches representing the Orthodox 
tradition in the country. The Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia, subordinate to the 
Patriarchy of Bucharest, had to go to court in order to receive registration status as a 
religious community, despite the fierce opposition of the Moldovan Orthodox Church and 
parts of previous Governments. After years of national litigation, the case was finally 
settled in December 2001 by a judgement of the European Court of Human Rights, which 
decided in favour of the Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia.8 However, even though the 
Moldovan Orthodox Church does not monopolize the Orthodox tradition in the country, 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>given the presence of the Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and a number of other 
Orthodox denominations, it continues to claim a special status, de facto and de jure. For 
instance, legal proceedings continue concerning the legitimacy of administration by the 
Moldovan Orthodox Church of property claimed by the Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia 
(see paragraph 63 below). Also, according to information received by the Ministry of 
Defence, all chaplains currently offering their service within the military belong to the 
Moldovan Orthodox Church. The Moldovan Metropolitan also enjoys diplomatic status. 
</p>
<p>31. Besides such examples of a formally privileged position of the Orthodox Church, in 
particular its Moldovan Metropolitan branch, there seems to be a tendency in certain parts 
of society to simply equate national identity with the Orthodox tradition. Again, while the 
Special Rapporteur does not see a problem in appreciating the significance of Orthodox 
Christianity as a major factor of the history and culture of the country, the invocation of 
Orthodoxy in the interest of collective identity politics may have serious consequences for 
the non-discriminatory implementation of freedom of religion or belief for everyone. It can 
furthermore hinder the development of a public culture of respecting diversity. Indeed, as 
pointed out by civil society representatives, the existing and emerging diversity in the 
country has not yet been sufficiently embraced by society. For this reason, the Special 
Rapporteur looks forward to further clarification of this issue as envisaged in the new law 
adopted by Parliament on 21 December 2011.9 
</p>
<p>32. In discussions with civil society organizations, the Special Rapporteur heard 
allegations that, even for purposes of national statistics, individuals who do not explicitly 
identify themselves as followers of a different religious denomination or as atheists would 
de facto be counted as members of the Moldovan Orthodox Church. Moreover, the Church 
apparently wields enormous political influence. Members of Parliament expressed the view 
that politicians would require a great deal of courage to publicly resist political demands 
coming from the Orthodox Church, for instance concerning the current project of anti-
discrimination legislation, which has encountered considerable opposition, much of it 
apparently based on misinformation about the purposes of the law. 
</p>
<p>33. When discussing with members of political movements who see themselves as 
supporters of Orthodoxy, the Special Rapporteur was concerned by statements that human 
rights and anti-discrimination provisions allegedly would be completely alien to Orthodox 
Christianity and thus amount to the imposition of &#8220;foreign norms&#8221;, with destructive 
</p>
<p>consequences for the country&#8217;s national and religious identity. A high-ranking Orthodox 
priest from the Moldovan Orthodox Church even spoke of the Government&#8217;s willingness to 
adapt to international and European human rights norms as an act of &#8220;political prostitution&#8221;. 
The Special Rapporteur sincerely hopes that the vast majority of followers of the Orthodox 
Churches in Moldova do not subscribe to such positions, which would actually imply a 
devastating antagonism between the Orthodox tradition and international human rights, to 
the detriment of the prospects of both. Indeed, a number of interlocutors informed him that 
most members of the Orthodox churches in the country hold more moderate views. It 
seems, however, that such moderate Orthodox views are rarely expressed in the open, and 
that statements such as the one mentioned above in the name of the Orthodox Church go 
largely undisputed.

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>smaller, first as a result of the persecution of the Antonescu regime allied with Nazi 
Germany, and subsequently owing to a mass exodus, especially after Moldovan 
independence in 1991. Like other minorities, members of the Jewish community generally 
appreciated the current situation as comparatively liberal, to the extent that they can live 
without fear of Government harassment or restrictions. Nonetheless, they complained about 
a lack of political interest in their poor situation. Of the dozens of synagogues existing in 
the pre-war era, two currently operate in Chisinau, having been reopened after the 
dissolution of the Soviet Union. Jewish cemeteries are often in a derelict condition. Often, 
acts of desecration of Jewish tombs seem to go unpunished, thus creating a situation of de 
facto impunity concerning such incidents. In addition, members of the Jewish community 
stated that the events of the Holocaust as they transpired on the territory today occupied by 
the Republic of Moldova have not yet been sufficiently recognized. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the fact that, in its voluntary pledges as Member of the Human Rights Council, 
the Government indicated that the issue of the Holocaust would be introduced into school 
curricula.11 The Jewish Communities faces a similar situation in the Transnistrian region of 
the Republic of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>40. Muslims seem to be exposed to severe stereotypes and prejudice from certain sectors 
of society. In a discussion held during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, a high-ranking cleric 
from the Moldovan Orthodox Church equated Islam with terrorism and expressed feelings 
of being threatened by the mere presence of Muslims in the country, even though the 
Islamic communities in the country today represent only a very small minority. During the 
round table organized by the Ministry of Justice on 6 September 2011, some Orthodox 
participants expressed their fear of Islam, which one person said was waging a &#8220;holy war&#8221; 
against Christians. In March 2011, one of the Muslim organizations, the Islamic League of 
the Republic of Moldova, finally succeeded in receiving registration status as a religious 
community under the 2007 Law on Religious Denominations. The Metropolitan of the 
Moldovan Orthodox Church criticized the decision, while putting constant pressure on the 
Government to deregister the Muslim organization. Moreover, during the summer of 2011, 
a small group of demonstrators gathered in an intimidating way in front of the private house 
of the former Minister for Justice who had authorized the registration of the Muslim group. 
Several other Muslim organizations have still not been registered as religious communities. 
According to information received, there is no Muslim community registered in the 
Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>41. In a debate with the Special Rapporteur, representatives of some Orthodox student 
groups and priests expressed their resentment of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, whose missionary 
activities they called &#8220;annoying&#8221;. They demanded that a regulation forbidding &#8220;abusive 
</p>
<p>proselytism&#8221; already existing within the 2007 Law on Religious Denominations be backed 
by a related criminal law provision, thus making acts of proselytism a criminal offence. The 
Special Rapporteur also received testimonies about cases of assault on Jehovah&#8217;s Witness 
missionaries, in particular in rural areas. He reiterates in this respect that missionary 
activities clearly fall within the sphere of freedom of religion or belief and are guaranteed 
by international human rights law. The situation of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses is reportedly even 
more difficult in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, in particular in 
relation to the absence of a legal provision on alternative civil service. As at September 
2011, according to the community, one member of the community was serving a custodial 
</p>
<p>  
 11  On 12 January 2012, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the public school 
</p>
<p>curricula, in particular for the secondary level (grades 1 to 9) included the optional topic on 
&#8220;Tolerance education &#8211; lessons of the Holocaust&#8221;. In the high school system (grades  10 to 12), the 
course is suggested for grade 11 only. </p>

<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>sentence in a penitentiary as a result of repeated refusals to undertake military service on 
the grounds of conscience objection (see paragraphs 51 to 54 below). 
</p>
<p>42. With regard to the situation of atheists and non-believers, the Special Rapporteur 
received contradictory information. While some interlocutors stated that atheists in today&#8217;s 
Moldovan society are seen as somewhat &#8220;strange&#8221;, others expressed the view that, not least 
</p>
<p>as a result of the Soviet era, atheistic convictions continue to exist on a large scale, maybe 
even among individuals who formally belong to a church. He did not hear any reports about 
harassment or discrimination against atheists and non-believers. 
</p>
<p>43. In general, it seems that appreciation of diversity, including in questions of religion 
or belief, still encounters obstacles in society. Although such diversity clearly constitutes a 
feature in the country&#8217;s past and present, there continues to be reluctance towards 
embracing diversity positively as a societal and cultural asset. For important sectors of 
society, religious pluralism, rather than enriching the country, mainly appears to trigger 
fears and perceptions of a threatened loss of national cohesion. 
</p>
<p>44. Moreover, a culture of interreligious communication still needs to develop in the 
Republic of Moldova. During the round table organized by the Ministry of Justice, a 
representative of one religious community maintained that there was little dialogue even 
among the various Orthodox churches. When observing the interaction between the 
different denominations sitting across the table, the Special Rapporteur noticed clear signs 
of mutual distrust. Participants rarely took up a statement made by a member of another 
group in a positive manner. While trying to reserve as much speaking time as possible for 
their own interests, there seemed to be little willingness to listen to others or to identify 
common goals. On a positive note, a Roman Catholic priest mentioned cases of successful 
cooperation with the Orthodox Church in common charity projects.  
</p>
<p>45. One major reason for the apparently unsatisfactory communication among 
denominations may lie in the past, namely, in the traumas of the country&#8217;s history, which 
include dictatorship, religious persecution, wars and other manifestations of massive 
violence. Establishing clear facts and precise analyses on the recent history and presenting 
the findings to the general public with the purpose of dispelling myths and conspiracy 
projections constitutes an enormous intellectual and educational challenge. Taking up this 
challenge will certainly have, however, a beneficial effect in the long run on the 
development of a culture of appreciation of religious and belief diversity in the Republic of 
Moldova.  
</p>
<p>46. A general climate of scepticism was noticeable also with regard to State institutions, 
with the result that acts of positive civic engagement apparently remain rare. Moreover, a 
broad and stable consensus that the public sphere &#8211;in terms of both physical public places 
and a culture of public discourse &#8211; should be open for everybody in a non-discriminatory 
manner may still be lacking. This has detrimental consequences for minorities, which 
continue to face difficulties when trying to meet or present their views in the public sphere. 
For instance, recently, a group of Seventh-Day Adventists, and members of Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual and Transgender groups, were denied the use of central public spaces in Chisinau, 
reportedly as a result of opposition voiced by some sectors from within the Orthodox 
Church or affiliated groups.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Freedom of religion or belief in public school education 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>religion or belief.12 Civic education, which constitutes a mandatory part of the national 
curriculum in the Republic of Moldova, can play an important role in this regard, as can the 
history curriculum and, potentially, other curriculum areas as well. The Special Rapporteur 
was informed that civic education programmes include information about religious and 
belief diversity, as well as human rights in general. He would like to highlight the 
importance for these programmes to reflect the diversity of Moldovan society in the past 
and present. 
</p>
<p>48. The public school system in the Republic of Moldova is secular and does not 
provide for mandatory religious instruction. However, following Government decision 596 
of 2 July 2010 on teaching religion in educational institutions, religious instruction entitled 
&#8220;religion&#8221; has been included in the curriculum for primary and secondary schools, to be 
taught optionally and upon the request of the parents or legal guardians of the child. These 
new optional curriculum elements apparently supplement a previously existing curriculum 
with religious content. According to information provided by the Ministry of Education, all 
registered religious denominations had been invited to participate in consultations about the 
new curricula. Those responding to the invitation eventually established two groups, each 
of which elaborated their own separate curriculum: one group composed of the various 
Orthodox denominations and also joined by the Roman Catholic Church, the other of a 
coalition of Protestant denominations. This may also count as an important step towards the 
advancement of cross-denominational communication in the country. 
</p>
<p>49. Although the optional nature of religious instruction has been emphasized by the 
Ministry of Education, doubts remain with regard to its effective and human rights-based 
implementation in practice. The Special Rapporteur repeatedly heard allegations about 
Orthodox priests or principals using their authority in schools to urge pupils to bring 
signatures from their parents for enrolment in religious instruction. This would amount to a 
violation of existing regulations providing for the strictly voluntary nature of religious 
instruction. Perhaps more importantly, there appears to be no mechanism to ensure that 
children or parents declining to receive religious instruction are not subject to negative 
repercussions from school authorities, parents or other children. The Special Rapporteur is 
of the view that such safeguards must be developed and implemented if everyone&#8217;s freedom 
of religion or belief, including the right not to profess any religion, is to be safeguarded 
effectively. Given the highly sensitive nature of this issue, the Government should reach out 
proactively to the population to clarify the status of religious instruction. Providing 
effective protection for non-attending children against pressure from school authorities, 
church officials, other children, or any other party should be a priority. 
</p>
<p>50. Religious instruction is also optional in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of 
Moldova. While this option seems to be open to various religions or beliefs, Orthodox 
Christianity appears to enjoy a de facto privileged treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Conscientious objection to military service 
</b></p>
<p>51. According to article 10 of the 2007 Law on Religious Denominations, the State is 
required to establish by law alternative service for the citizens who cannot perform military 
service due to confessional reasons. A provision for alternative service was first enshrined 
in Law No. 633/XII of 9 July 1991on alternative service adopted, as amended by Law No. 
534 of 22 July 1999. Law No.156-XVI, adopted on 6 July 2007, further revised the 
organization of civilian (alternative) service. The new law addressed several concerns 
</p>
<p>  
 12 See the report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and school education 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/16/53). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>raised by the earlier one: it reduced the length of alternative civilian service from 24 to 12 
months, equal to that of the military service; alternative civilian service could now be 
requested on the basis of religious, pacifist, ethical, moral or humanitarian convictions or 
other similar cases; and the necessity for applications to be accompanied by &#8220;proof of 
membership of the religious or pacifist organization&#8221; was abolished. The Ministry of 
Defence stated that anyone refusing to serve in the military had the option of performing an 
alternative service. This option was reportedly not connected with any enquiry with regard 
to the reasons for not wanting to join the military. 
</p>
<p>52. The 2007 law also established a right for exemption of any form of service for 
various categories of persons, including clergy, monks and students in theology (art. 4). In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur was informed of allegations that, in certain 
circumstances, authorities have been unwilling to recognize that the heads of Jehovah's 
Witness communities were &#8220;clergy&#8221; in the sense of the law because, in addition to their 
roles in the religious community, they hold other jobs. Although there is an increasing 
tendency to recognize that Jehovah&#8217;s Witness heads are &#8220;clergy&#8221; for the purposes of the 
law, a non-discrimination approach would imply having this formally recognized at the 
national level. 
</p>
<p>53. The situation is markedly more troubling in the Transnistrian region of the Republic 
of Moldova, where regular military exercises are conducted and there is a general 
requirement to take part in them. If individuals do not show up for such exercises when 
summoned, they are punished. There is no provision for exemption from service or 
alternative service in the Transnistrian region. All young men who refuse military service 
are subject to criminal sanction. There are two possible penalties for refusing to serve: a 
fine, or deprivation of liberty. The Jehovah&#8217;s Witness community raised several recent 
cases concerning persons refusing to serve in the military in the Transnistrian region on the 
grounds of conscientious objection. It also reported that men from the Transnistrian region 
who undertook alternative service in the other parts of the Republic of Moldova were 
forcibly conscripted into the military in the Transnistrian region or were otherwise 
arbitrarily detained. 
</p>
<p>54. The Transnistrian &#8220;authorities&#8221; told the Special Rapporteur that a compromise 
offered to conscientious objectors was to serve in the army without direct involvement in 
the use of weapons. The Special Rapporteur would like, however, to reiterate that everyone 
has the right to have conscientious objections to military service as a legitimate exercise of 
the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that conscientious objectors 
should be provided with the option of an alternative service that is compatible with the 
reasons for conscientious objection, of a non-combatant or civilian character, in the public 
interest and not of a punitive nature.13 When the right to conscientious objection is 
recognized by law or in practice, there should neither be differentiation among 
conscientious objectors on the basis of the nature of their particular beliefs nor 
discrimination against conscientious objectors because they have failed to perform military 
service.14 
</p>
<p><b> F.  Other challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2

<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>managed to achieve registration status, repeatedly complained about the procedure being 
cumbersome, time-consuming, overly bureaucratic and rigid. Reportedly, they often did not 
understand the reasons for the refusal of their applications. Non-registered religious 
communities lack legal personality, and therefore cannot take collective legal action. The 
Ministry of Justice clarified that they can nonetheless practice their religion freely, and that 
activities of such groups are not deemed illegal. Representatives of the Muslim community, 
however, stated that persons attending worship had been subjected to identity checks by the 
authorities. This practice reportedly stopped in March 2011 after one Muslim organization 
was officially recognized. 
</p>
<p>56. In the past, cases of administrative sanctions applied to individuals belonging to 
unregistered religious organisations or to non-citizens carrying out religious activities in 
public places for not providing advance notification to municipalities, under article 54(4) of 
the Contravention Code had been reported and relayed by international human rights 
mechanisms.15 The Special Rapporteur was told, however, that there had been 
improvements in this area. In this context, he supports the call of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination to the Government of the Republic of Moldova to 
respect the right of members of registered and non-registered religions to freely exercise 
their freedom of religion, review existing registration regulations and practices in order to 
ensure the right of all persons to manifest their religion or belief, alone or in community 
with others and in public or in private, regardless of registration status.16 
</p>
<p>57. In addition, the Special Rapporteur notes the existence in both article 54(4) of the 
Contravention Code and in the 2007 Law on Religious Denominations of provisions that 
are explicitly discriminatory against non-citizens. For example, the current law requires 100 
signatures by citizens of the Republic of Moldova to establish a religious organization.17 
</p>
<p>58. The Ministry of Justice declared its readiness to revise the law and initiated a 
consultation process with religious and belief communities and civil society, by which the 
Government sets a good example of transparency and participation.18 In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that registration procedures for religious or belief 
communities should be quick, transparent and non-discriminatory, and not impose an undue 
burden on groups who wish to achieve registration status. It is important to make clear in 
the law that freedom of religion or belief, following from its nature as a universal human 
right, covers a broad range of religions and beliefs. Indeed, it includes theistic, non-theistic 
and atheistic convictions, as well as the possibility of not professing any religion or belief.19 
The Special Rapporteur also reiterates his view that no religious community should be 
allowed to exercise a &#8220;veto&#8221; or otherwise influence the decision to register or not to register 
</p>
<p>another religious or belief group. All registration decisions must be based on formal 
elements of law and in full conformity with international law. Consequently, any formal or 
informal approach that allows only one registered community of a particular faith should be 
removed. 
</p>
<p>59. In the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, new rules issued in 2009 
oblige all religious communities to re-register in order to retain or obtain legal status. For a 
period of 10 years after registration, which a high-ranking representative of the

 17 See Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, general recommendation No. 30. 
 18  See footnote 5. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that, to facilitate the registration procedure, 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice has elaborated a set of sample documents, available on the website 
www.justice.gov.md. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Transnistrian &#8220;authorities&#8221; referred to as a &#8220;probationary period&#8221;, religious communities are 
subject to certain restrictions, for instance concerning the dissemination of literature and 
public manifestations of their convictions on television, radio or other media. The Special 
Rapporteur is very troubled by these restrictions, which appear to prevent any public 
communication of religious communities and thereby infringe the freedom to manifest their 
religion or belief. It was not entirely clear what the legal and de facto situation of non-
registered religious groups is in this region. According to an &#8220;official&#8221; of the Transnistrian 
region of the Republic of Moldova, 133 religious organizations and six branches are 
registered. 
</p>
<p>60. In order to clarify that missionary activities fall within the protection of freedom of 
religion or belief, vague or overly broad formulations about prohibited proselytism, as 
currently included in the 2007 Law, should be deleted or amended. The Special Rapporteur 
was informed that the new law, adopted by Parliament on 21 December 2011, now defines 
&#8220;abusive proselytism&#8221; as an action to change a person&#8217;s or a group&#8217;s religious beliefs by 
resorting to constraints. In his view, this wording is still problematic, and he would like to 
recall that article 18.2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights only 
refers to &#8220;coercion&#8221;, stating that no one should be subject to coercion, which would impair 
his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur received information that religious personnel without 
Moldovan citizenship, such as Catholic Priests from Poland or Romania or United States 
missionaries, might receive only short-term residence permits, which apparently must be 
renewed on an annual basis. He would like to emphasize in this context that the enjoyment 
of freedom of religion or belief, because of its status as a universal and inalienable human 
right, cannot be made dependent on citizenship or nationality. 
</p>
<p>62. The laws of the Republic of Moldova contain a number of provisions, in both the 
Criminal Code and the Code of Administrative Offences (see paragraph 17 above), that 
prohibit incitement to hatred against members of religious groups. The Special Rapporteur 
was unable to find out to what degree and in which manner these laws are carried out in 
practice, but heard testimonies indicating that these provisions are rarely, if ever, 
implemented in practice. 
</p>
<p>63. Despite the fact of an extensive removal of community property &#8211; as well as 
destruction of property &#8211; from various religious communities during the twentieth century, 
there is apparently no law on the restitution of religious property, and religious property 
administration is a matter of dispute.20 Religious communities seem to be treated differently 
in this regard. For example, the Moldovan Orthodox Church has apparently received title 
over properties (including properties also claimed by the Bessarabian Orthodox Church), 
the Catholic community is involved in litigation to recover title to community property, 
while the Jewish community has reportedly been forced to purchase back community 
properties. As at October 2011, the Bessarabian Orthodox Church was also reportedly 
involved in litigation seeking the annulment of a contract between the Ministry of Culture 
and the Moldovan Orthodox Church to transfer hundreds of religious monuments to the 
administration of the latter. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that this area should be 
better regulated by law with a view to ensuring non-discrimination in communal property 
restitution matters. In any case, the Government should ensure that there is no 
discrimination in practice in religious community property regulation. 
</p>
<p>  
 20 The administration of religious buildings considered architectural monuments is reportedly regulated 
</p>
<p>by Government Decision nr. 740 of 2002. This reportedly includes some 650 monuments transfered 
to the possession of the Metropolitan Church of Moldova, among them churches allegedly belonging 
to the Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia. </p>

<p>64. <b>Moldovan society has been, and continues to be, in a process of rapid 
transformation which includes, inter alia, the development of a sustainable human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights culture in the country. Implementation of human rights standards ranks high

<p>on the Government&#8217;s agenda, and significant prog<b>ress has been made, including in the

<p><b>the Republic of Moldova. Members of various communities, including small

<p>65. <b>Remaining obstacles mainly derive from the predominant position of the

<p><b>often in an aggressive manner, that followers of other denominations </b>&#8211;<b> such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protestants, Jews and especially Muslims </b>&#8211;<b> be marginalized. Although these extremist 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups seem to account only for a small minority, they apparently are not met with 
</b></p>
<p><b>much criticism from within the Church, thus leading to the perception that they 
</b></p>
<p><b>somehow speak on behalf of the country's Orthodox believers in general. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>With a view to improving further the conditions for a non-discriminatory 
enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief by everyone, what seems to be needed is, 
</b></p>
<p><b>above all, a public culture of appreciating diversity. The Special Rapporteur would 
</b></p>
<p><b>like to encourage the Government to take leadership in this regard, for instance by 
</b></p>
<p><b>issuing a robust anti-discrimination law, facilitating interreligious communication, 
</b></p>
<p><b>investing in civic education and speaking out clearly against incitement to religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>hatred. There are positive obligations under international human rights law to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote diversity. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The revision of the 2007 Law on Religious Denominations and their constituent 
parts offers a unique opportunity in this respect. The consultation process was an 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunity for interreligious communication which, according to the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur, still needs to be developed in the Republic of Moldova. He very much 
</b></p>
<p><b>appreciates the transparency of the consultation process and the fact that civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations specialized in human rights and anti-discrimination issues have also 
</b></p>
<p><b>been invited to contribute their views and experiences. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>For freedom of religion or belief and other human rights to take root within 
society, education plays a paramount role. The school curriculum should include 
</b></p>
<p><b>information about various religions and beliefs </b>&#8211;<b> their history, content, requirements 
</b></p>
<p><b>and structures </b>&#8211;<b> with the purpose of dispelling stereotypes and prejudices that still 
</b></p>
<p><b>seem to exist to a large degree in society. Many interlocutors expressed their support 
</b></p>
<p><b>for such an educational project. The subject could be taught, for instance, as part of 
</b></p>
<p><b>civic education, but possibly also within the framework of voluntary religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruction. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirement that the optional status of religious instruction in any case must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensured not only de jure but also de facto, and that effective protection mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>for children or parents choosing to opt out of religious instruction have yet to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur comes to similar conclusions regarding the situation of 
freedom of religion or belief in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with several noteworthy aspects of additional concern. He is particularly concerned at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the practice of detaining people who object to military service on the grounds of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion or conscience. He is also very concerned at new rules barring religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities from communicating with the public for a period of 10 years after 
</b></p>
<p><b>official registration. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>In the light of the above conclusions, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
recommendations below. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations for the authorities of the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> With a view to create an inclusive society, the Government should take 
</b>leadership in the process of developing a culture of appreciating the country&#8217;s existing 
</p>
<p><b>and emerging diversity, including in questions of religion or belief. In this context, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the Government to implement the related 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations addressed to it during its universal periodic review.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Government should ensure that the principles of equality and non-
discrimination, including in relation to the status and recognition of various religions 
</b></p>
<p><b>or beliefs present in the Republic of Moldova, are fully respected in law and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Government should make clear that human rights standards, including 
freedom of religion or belief and the principles of equality and non-discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>have precedence over any invocation of national identity.  
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Government should adopt a robust and comprehensive anti-discrimination 
legislation in accordance with international standards, with the purpose of providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>active protection against discrimination in all areas of society.  
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> As a related matter, provisions explicitly discriminating against non-citizens 
with regard to religious matters should be removed from State law. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> Any discriminatory religious community property restitution practices should 
be reversed. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to consider better 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulation of religious community property restitution with a view to achieve non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination in practice in this area. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The Government should encourage a culture of interreligious communication, 
for instance by inviting representatives of different denominations and non-believers 
</b></p>
<p><b>to joint consultations. The round-table discussions organized by the Ministry of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice may serve as a good example in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Civic education in, inter alia, school curricula should acknowledge the value of 
diversity and provide fair information about different religious or belief traditions. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends the study of the Toledo Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles on Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in Public Schools, prepared by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Advisory Council of Experts on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Office for Democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Europe (OSCE). The history curriculum should also be reviewed to ensure that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>children in the Republic of Moldova are provided with fair and precise information 
</b></p>
<p><b>about the diverse religious traditions in the country, past and present. This should 
</b></p>
<p><b>also include Holocaust education, as already pledged by the Government. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>79.<b>  The optional nature of religious instruction in public schools must be ensured 
not only de jure but also de facto. Providing effective protection for non-attending 
</b></p>
<p><b>children against possible pressure from school authorities, church officials, other 
</b></p>
<p><b>children or any other party should be a priority. In this regard, effective mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure that neither children nor parents suffer from negative consequences for 
</b></p>
<p><b>declining to take part in religious instruction are sine qua non conditions. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Government should speak out clearly against any manifestations of 
religious hatred and related intolerance. In accordance with article 20, paragraph 2, 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, any advocacy of national, 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence should be prohibited. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> As stated by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 16/13, the Government 
should exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish acts of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against persons belonging to religious minorities, regardless of the perpetrator. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, the Government should proactively investigate acts of intimidation or 
</b></p>
<p><b>hostility targeting religious or belief minorities, including in rural areas. The relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions of the legislative framework should be fully implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Registration of religious or belief communities by the State should be enacted in 
a spirit and manner of servicing the human right to freedom of religion or belief. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore, the registration process should be quick, transparent and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory. It should not depend on extensive formal requirements in terms of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>number or the time a particular religious group has existed, nor should it put an 
</b></p>
<p><b>undue burden on communities applying for registration status. No religious or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b>group should be allowed to decide about the registration of another religious or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b>group. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> </b>Registration should not be a precondition for practising one&#8217;s religion or belief. 
<b>The Government should respect the right of members of registered and unregistered 
</b></p>
<p><b>religions to exercise their freedom of religion, and review existing registration 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulations and practices in order to ensure the right of all persons to manifest their 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion or belief, alone or in community with others and in public or in private, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regardless of registration status. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b>  The Government should continue to recognize the right to conscientious 
objection in law and in practice, and ensure that the relevant legislation is 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Government should open up the military for the service of chaplains of 
different religions or beliefs. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Government should be flexible in giving residence and work permits to 
non-citizens operating as religious personnel. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The </b>&#8220;<b>authorities</b>&#8221;<b> of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova are 
additionally urged: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To similarly review practices giving a privileged place to the Orthodox 
</b></p>
<p><b>Church and related practices leading to de facto discrimination against adherents to 
</b></p>
<p><b>other religions or beliefs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  As a related matter, to give serious consideration to strengthening rules 
</b></p>
<p><b>and procedures for implementing the principle of equal treatment on all grounds 
</b></p>
<p><b>secured under international law; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)</b>  <b>To cease without delay practices of detaining persons objecting on 
grounds of religion or conscience to military service, as well as to develop rules for 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternative service for such conscientious objectors; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d)</b> <b>To rescind without delay rules barring religious communities from 
public communication for 10 years after their formal registration; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) </b> <b>To end without delay the practices of stopping missionaries from 
working at the local level.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations for religious communities and their leaders 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Taking into account the impact of religious leaders on their communities, the 
Special Rapporteur encourages all such leaders to take a public position that 
</b></p>
<p><b>embraces diversity, favours interreligious respect and defuses existing or emerging 
</b></p>
<p><b>tensions between different groups. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Members of religious or belief communities have a role to play in supporting 
and encouraging religious tolerance and ensuring that all people in the Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moldova can effectively enjoy their freedom of religion or belief. In this context, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur encourages in particular people holding moderate views to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in the national debate on freedom of religion or belief and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Interreligious and intra-religious dialogue is vital for creating an atmosphere of 
appreciation of diversity in society. It should not only include religious leaders but 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also involve initiatives taken at the grass-roots level. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations for the international community 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the United Nations in the Republic of 
Moldova to continue to support the efforts of the Government to ensure the respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>for freedom of religion or belief and, in this context, to support the implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the recommendations made in the present report. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Special Rapporteur also encourages other international agencies operating 
in the Republic of Moldova, such as the Council of Europe, the European Union and 
</b></p>
<p><b>OSCE, to support the implementation of the recommendations made in the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>report.
