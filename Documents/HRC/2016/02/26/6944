<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly urges</i> the international community to take stock of the slow progress 
with regard to the Millennium Development Goals, with a view to taking all necessary and 
appropriate measures, including enhanced official development assistance, the search for a 
durable solution to the external debt problem, market access, capacity-building, and 
dissemination of knowledge and technology, in order to achieve successful integration of 
developing countries in the global economy; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Emphasizes</i> that development should be at the centre of the international 
economic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies, on the one hand, 
and international obligations and commitments, on the other, will contribute to the creation of an 
enabling environment for development; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the need to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing 
countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting with a view to ensuring 
equitable distribution of growth and development gains in a globalizing world economy;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue again at its future session.
