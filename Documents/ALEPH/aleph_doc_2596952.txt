Directors’ Report
Annual Report 30 June 2015
The Directors present their report on the consolidated group (referred to hereafter as the Group) for the year 
ended 30 June 2015 and the auditor’s report thereon.
1.  PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP 
 
ZYL Limited (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (ZYL or the Company) is currently in administration, 
subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) signed on 19 February 2015. The DOCA is intended to 
satisfy creditors’ debts through the disposal of interests in the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project and other 
assets, while retaining the interest in the Kangwane South Anthracite Project. Before entering into the DOCA, 
ZYL was actively attempting to progress its Anthracite projects in South Africa. 
 
2.  RESULTS AND REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
 
Incomplete Financial Information
Due to turnover of previous staff and officers, and the parent entity being subject to external administration, 
complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 June 2013 and since, 
this  has  led  to  insufficient  information  being  available  to  support  several  material  contracts  as  well  as 
transactions and balances of foreign subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the audited Remuneration disclosures, 
financial statements and notes are in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, due to 
the lack of records and certainty in connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 30 June 
2013 and since then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy the 
creditors’ and administrator’s debts, along with the continued existence of the Kangwane South Anthracite 
Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, the absence of 
these records is not expected to significantly detract from the Company’s ability to maintain proper books and 
records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities, when current directors were appointed. 
Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff and officers, unavailable documents of 
foreign  subsidiaries,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external  administration,  primarily  affects  the 
historical  records  of  the  economic  entity  rather  than  its  ability  to  continue  its  retained  business  and 
operations.
Summary of Results
The Group’s net loss for the year attributable to members of the Company for the financial year ended 30 June 
2015 was $609,129 (2014: $1,246,523). The loss was largely due to interest expensed on borrowings.
At 30 June 2015, the Group had a net asset deficit of $1,921,571 (2014: $1,441,158) and the Company had 
612,747,560 (2014: 612,747,560) shares on issue.

Directors’ Report
Kangwane Central project
Annual Report 30 June 2015
On 4 February 2013, ZYL entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with its partners in the 
Kangwane  Central  Anthracite  Project.  The  MOU  sought  to  restructure  the  original  transaction  that  was 
executed and announced on 13 December 2010 between Siyanda Resources (Pty) Ltd (“Siyanda”), Double Ring 
Resources (Pty) Ltd (“Double Ring”) and Opes Capital (Pty) Ltd (collectively the “Partners”).
The finalisation of the MOU was subject to the fulfilment of a number of conditions precedent by the 30 April 
2013. The conditions precedent were not fulfilled and the MOU consequently lapsed and as such the original 
transaction remained binding.
Kangwane South Project
The Kangwane South Project is located in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa, approximately 150km 
from the coast to the Matola Terminal at Maputo Port in Mozambique and approximately 25 kilometres to 
the south of the Company’s Kangwane Central Project. 
 
Secured borrowings past due terms
On 8 April 2014, ZYL announced that it had executed a third deed of extension and forbearance with Prestige 
Glory whereby Prestige Glory (PGL) agreed to extend the termination date of the bridging facility to 30 June 
2014 and advance ZYL a further $300,000. Before this date, PGL had provided $2,000,000, to ZYL under the 
bridging facility, with this deed agreeing provision of a further $150,000 immediately and $150,000 on 31 May 
2014. The bridging facility is secured by a first ranking general security deed under which ZYL granted a security 
interest over all personal property of the Company and a fixed charge over all non-personal property. The 
bridging facility remains unpaid at the date of this report. 
 
Appointment of voluntary administrator
On 8 January 2015, ZYL’s then board comprised of Mr Yuzheng Xie and Mr Stephen Woods resolved to appoint 
Jack James of Palisade Business Consulting as voluntary administrator to the Company. 
 
Resolution to enter Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA)
On 13 February 2015 at the second meeting of creditors, ZYL’s creditors resolved that the Company execute a 
Deed of Company Arrangement and that Jack James be appointed Administrator of the DOCA. The Company 
executed the DOCA with Konkera Corporate on 19 February 2015. The end date of the DOCA was extended to 
19 February 2016 on 15 July 2015, then to 19 August 2016 on 25 January 2016.

12.  AUDIT COMMITTEE 
 
The Company does not have a formally constituted audit committee of the directors and secretary as the 
Board considers that the Company’s current position in respect of the composition of the Board, the size of 
the Company and the minimal complexities involved in its financial activities, the Company is not in a position 
to justify the establishment of an audit committee.  The full Board performs the duties of this committee.

REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)
Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration 
Remuneration committee and board charter 
Details of remuneration
13. 
 
The remuneration report is set out under the following main headings: 
 
1. 
2. 
3. 
 
14. 
 
The  objective  of  the  Company’s  executive  reward  framework  is  to  ensure  reward  for  performance  is 
competitive  and  appropriate  for  the  results  delivered.  The  framework  aligns  executive  reward  with 
achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value for shareholders, and conforms to market best 
practice for delivery of reward. The Board ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for 
good reward governance practices:
PRINCIPLES USED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF REMUNERATION
i.  competitiveness and reasonableness; 
ii.  acceptability to shareholders; 
iii. performance linkage / alignment of executive compensation; 
iv. transparency; and 
v.  capital management.
The  Company  has  structured  an  executive  remuneration  framework  that  is  market  competitive  and 
complimentary to the reward strategy of the organisation. 
 
Alignment to shareholders’ interests:
i.  focuses on sustained growth in shareholder wealth; and 
ii.  attracts and retains high calibre executives.
Alignment to program participants’ interests:
rewards capability and experience; and
i. 
ii.  provides a clear structure for earning rewards.
The  relationship  between  the  remuneration  policy  for  key  management  personnel  and  the  Company’s 
performance cannot be determined due to the Company being under administration and entering a Deed of 
Company Arrangement with Konkera Corporate.  Accordingly, the Company is unable to determine the specific 
relationship  between  the  remuneration  policy,  the  Company’s  earnings  and  the  consequences  of  the 
Company’s performance on shareholders wealth. 
 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
 
Fees  and  payments  to  directors  reflect  the  demands  which  are  made  on,  and  the  responsibilities  of,  the 
directors. Directors’  fees  and  payments  are  reviewed  annually  by  the  Board. The  Board also  ensures that 
directors’ fees and payments are appropriate and in line with the market. The Chairman’s fees are determined 
together with those of the directors.

Retirement allowances and benefits for directors 
 
There are no retirement allowances or other benefits paid to directors. 
 
14.1.  REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AND BOARD CHARTER 
 
The Charter of the Remuneration Committee extends the duties to that of a Nominations Committee.  The 
Board  considers  that  the  Group  is  not  yet  of  sufficient  size  to  warrant  the  establishment  of  a  separate 
Nominations Committee. 
 
The Remuneration Committee, consisting of at least two directors, is responsible for making recommendations 
on remuneration policies and packages applicable to Board members and for approval of remuneration for 
executive  officers  of  the  Company  taking  into  account  the  financial  position  of  the  Company.  The  broad 
remuneration  policy  per  the  formal  Charter  is  to  ensure  the  remuneration  package  properly  reflects  the 
person’s  duties  and  responsibilities,  and  that  remuneration  is  competitive  in  attracting,  retaining  and 
motivating people of the highest quality. 
 
Given the present size of the Company, each of the directors on the Board of the Company is also a member 
of the Remuneration Committee. 
 
It  is  the  Remuneration  Committee’s  policy  to  remunerate  non-executive  directors  at  market  rates  for 
comparable companies for time, commitment and responsibilities though taking into account the financial 
position of the Company and the Company’s shareholder approved limits. The Constitution of the Company 
specifies that the aggregate remuneration of Directors, other than salaries paid to executive directors, shall 
be determined from time to time by a general meeting. An amount not exceeding the amount determined is 
divided between those directors as they agree. The latest determination was at the Annual General Meeting 
held on the 20 April 2007 when shareholders approved an aggregate remuneration of $250,000 per year. 
 
The Board as a whole determines the amount of the fees paid to each non-executive director. 
All Directors may be allocated options to acquire shares in the Company under the Director and Employee 
Share  Option Plan  approved  by  shareholders  from time  to  time.   The  last such  scheme  was  approved  by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders held on the 18 April 2011.  
 
The  Board  approves  remuneration  packages  for  Executive officers  based on  performance criteria and  the 
Group’s financial performance. Other employee remuneration packages are determined and approved by the 
Board or Chief Executive Officer based on salary market rate indicators, press advertisements, performance 
criteria and against the Group’s financial state of affairs.

Annual Report 30 June 2015
Corporate Governance Statement
ZYL LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES 
 
Due to turnover of previous staff and officers, the parent entity being subject to external administration, and 
complete records not able to be located, the current Directors of ZYL Limited ("Company") are of the opinion 
that it is not possible to confirm compliance during previous periods in relation to the adoption of the ASX 
Corporate  Governance  Council’s  Principles  of  Good  Corporate  Governance  and  Best  Practice 
Recommendations ("ASX Guidelines" or “the Recommendations”).  
 
As part of the process of re-listing the Company on the ASX, the present Board intends to structure a Corporate 
Governance Statement with reference to the ASX Guidelines in order to achieve the highest standards of 
corporate governance. In the future the Company intends to follow each Recommendation where the Board 
has considered the Recommendation to be an appropriate benchmark for corporate governance practices, 
taking into account factors such as the size of the Company, the Board, resources available and activities of 
the Company. Where, after due consideration, the Company's corporate governance practices depart from 
the Recommendations, the Board will offer disclosure of the nature of, and reason for, the adoption of its own 
practice.

Notes to the financial statements

(a)
(b)
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and notes of ZYL Limited and 
controlled entities (the ‘Group’). 
 
The significant policies which have been adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are: 
Basis of preparation
The  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in 
accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards, Australian Accounting Interpretations, other 
authoritative  pronouncements  of  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board  (AASB)  and  the 
Corporations Act 2001 (where possible – see note 1(b)). 
 
Australian Accounting Standards set out accounting policies that the AASB has concluded would result 
in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about transactions, events and 
conditions to which they apply. Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the 
financial  statements  of  the  Group  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS). 
Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are presented 
below. They have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and are based on historical costs, 
modified, where applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial 
assets  and  financial  liabilities  based  on  directors’  estimates  of  Net  Realisable  Value.  The  financial 
statements are presented in Australian dollars. 
 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 26th August 2016. 
 
ZYL Limited is a company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia, whose shares are 
publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. 
 
Incomplete Financial Information
Due  to  turnover  of  previous  staff  and  officers,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external 
administration, complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 
June 2013 and since, this has led to insufficient information being available to support several material 
contracts as well as transactions and balances of foreign subsidiaries.
The  Directors  are  of  the  opinion  that  it  is  not  possible  to  state  that  the  audited  Remuneration 
disclosures,  financial  statements  and  notes  are  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the 
Corporations  Act  2001,  due  to  the  lack  of  records  and  certainty  in  connection  with  material 
transactions, for both the year ended 30 June 2013 and since then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy 
the creditors’ and administrator’s debts, along with the continued existence of the Kangwane South 
Anthracite  Project,  means  that  while  historical  records  are  affected  by  incomplete  financial 
information, the absence of these records is not expected to significantly detract from the Company’s 
ability to maintain proper books and records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian 
entities,  when current directors were appointed. Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover
ZYL Limited page 21
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Annual Report 30 June 2015
1
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
of previous staff and officers, unavailable documents of foreign subsidiaries, and the parent entity 
being subject to external administration, primarily affects the historical records of the economic entity 
rather than its ability to continue its retained business and operations.
(c)
Going Concern
The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of 
normal business activities and the realisation of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
The Group has incurred a net loss for the year of $609,129 (2014: $1,246,523) and net cash outflows 
from operating activities of $52,493 (2014: $887,974). The losses are mainly due to interest expenses 
and administrative costs. In the 2013 financial report, projects were impaired down to values expected 
to be received following the administration of the Company. 
 
The Group had cash assets of $37,050 at 30 June 2015 (2014: $27,119). These conditions indicate a 
material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. 
 
The directors believe that it is appropriate preparing the financial information on a going concern 
basis for the following reasons: 
 
-
The Directors expect the Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) will result in the extinguishment 
of all secured and unsecured liabilities. Under the DOCA, it is proposed that: 
•
the Kangwane Central Project will be disposed of to satisfy the secured creditor and, with 
other available funds, satisfy identifiable unsecured creditors; 
the 70% interest in the Kangwane South project will be retained by the Company;
• 
•  all prior employment and service contracts will be terminated; and 
•
the issued capital will be consolidated on the basis of 1 share for every 100 shares held;
-
-
•
The Group expects to variously realise or continue developing its assets following completion of 
the DOCA; and 
 
The Group expects to recapitalise following completion the DOCA with sufficient funds to continue 
as a going concern. The DOCA requires a capital raising of at least $1,250,000 before completion, 
however, to satisfy ASX’s conditions for reinstatement, the capital raising will be for an amount of 
$2,000,000.  Following the capital raising, the DOCA requires: 
•  payment  of  fees  to  the  Trustee,  Administrator  and  the  Proponent  totalling  approximately
$200,000; 
the Company to reimburse the proponent for all costs in relation to the ASX relisting and 
capital raising; and
•  post consolidation shares representing 27.6% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the 
completion of the issues will be issued to the Proponent and a compliance manager appointed 
by the Proponent.
It is for these reasons that the Directors consider the Group to be a going concern. Notwithstanding 
the  material  uncertainties  of  future  events  inherent  in  the  above,  the  Directors  consider  it  is 
appropriate to prepare the financial information on a going concern basis and hence no adjustments 
have been made to the financial information relating to the recoverability and classification of the
ZYL Limited page 22
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Annual Report 30 June 2015
1
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the 
entity does not continue as a going concern. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
(d)
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each separate area of interest are recognised 
as an exploration and evaluation asset in the year in which they are incurred where the following 
conditions are satisfied: 
 
(i)   the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and 
(ii)   at least one of the following conditions is also met:
(a)
the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful 
development and exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or
(b)   exploration  and  evaluation  activities  in  the  area  of  interest  have  not,  at  the  end  of  the 
reporting period, reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence 
or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in, 
or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
(e)
Exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured at cost and include acquisition of rights to 
explore,  studies,  exploratory  drilling,  trenching  and  sampling  and  associated  activities  and  an 
allocation of depreciation and amortisation of assets used in exploration and evaluation activities.  
 
General and administrative costs are only included in the measurement of exploration and evaluation 
costs where they are related directly to operational activities in a particular area of interest. 
 
Accumulated costs in relation to an area of interest that has been abandoned are written off in full 
against the profit or loss in the year in which the decision to abandon the area is made. 
 
When production commences the accumulated costs for the relevant area are amortised over the life 
of the area according to the rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserves. 
 
Basis of consolidation 
 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of ZYL Limited and entities 
(including special purpose entities) controlled by ZYL Limited (its subsidiaries). 
  
Control is achieved when the Company:  
•  has power over the investee;  
• 
•  has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that 
there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.  
 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent 
company, using consistent accounting policies. Adjustments are made to bring into line any dissimilar 
accounting policies that may exist. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised 
profits  arising  from  intra-group  transactions,  have  been  eliminated  in  full.  Unrealised  losses  are 
eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
ZYL Limited page 23

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to 
be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Total comprehensive 
income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.  
 
Specifically income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control 
until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. 
 
When  the  Group  loses  control  of  a  subsidiary,  a  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  and  is 
calculated as the difference between: 
•  The aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained
interest; and
•  The previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary
and any non-controlling interests.
All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are 
accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary 
(i.e. reclassified to profit and loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted 
by the applicable AASBs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the 
date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting 
under AASB 139, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a 
joint venture.
Business Combinations 
 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of 
whether  equity  instruments  or  other  assets  are  acquired.  The  consideration  transferred  for  the 
acquisition of the subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred 
and the equity instruments issued by the Group. The consideration transferred also includes the fair 
value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and the fair value 
of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.  
 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are,  with  limited  exceptions,  measured  initially  at  their  fair  values  at  the  acquisition  date.  On  an 
acquisition-by-acquisition  basis,  the  Group  recognises  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree 
either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest’s  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree’s  net 
identifiable assets. 
 
The excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
and the acquisition-date fair value of any previously equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 
of  the  Company’s  share  of  the  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  is  recorded  as  goodwill.  If  those 
amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the 
measurement of all amounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in the profit and 
loss as a bargain purchase.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a 
financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in 
profit or loss.   
 
Trade and other receivables
Trade debtors to be settled within 60 days are carried at amounts due. The collectability of debts is 
assessed at the end of the reporting period based on the length of time a debt has been outstanding, 
the past default experience of the debtor and an analysis of the debtor’s current financial position, 
and a specific provision is made for any doubtful accounts.
Impairment of assets
(g)
(h)
(i)
At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying values of its tangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use, is compared to the asset’s carrying value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value 
over its recoverable amount is expensed to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income.  
 
Where  it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  individual  asset,  the  Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
Plant and equipment 
 
Items of plant and equipment are recorded at cost on acquisition less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. 
 
The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by directors to ensure it is not in 
excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis 
of the expected net cash flows that will be received from the asset’s employment and subsequent 
disposal.  
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income during the financial period 
in which they are incurred.
Depreciation 
The depreciable amount of all fixed assets is depreciated on a diminishing value basis over the asset’s 
useful  life  to  the  Group  commencing  from  the  time  the  asset  is  held  ready  for  use.  Leasehold 
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the 
estimated useful lives of the improvements. 
 
The depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable assets are:
Office furniture and equipment     10 - 67% 
Leasehold Improvements                      20%
ZYL Limited page 25

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
(j)
(k)
(l)
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period. 
An  asset’s  carrying  amount  is  written  down  immediately  to  its  recoverable  amount  if  the  asset’s 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.  
 
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These 
gains and losses are included in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
When revalued assets are sold, amounts included in the revaluation reserve relating to that asset are 
transferred to retained earnings. 
 
Leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged against profits in 
equal instalments over the accounting periods covered by the lease term, except where an alternative 
basis is more representative of the pattern of benefits to be derived from the leased property. 
 
Foreign currency transactions 
Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  of  the  Group  which  is 
Australian Dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Non-monetary 
items  measured  at  historical  cost  continue  to  be  carried  at  the  exchange  rate  at  the  date  of  the 
transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value are reported at the exchange rate at the date 
when fair values were determined. 
 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Exchange differences arising on the translation of non-
monetary  items  are  recognised  directly  in  equity  to  the  extent  that  the  gain  or  loss  is  directly 
recognised in equity, otherwise the exchange difference is recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income. 
 
Income tax 
 
The income tax expense (revenue) for the year comprises current income tax expense (income) and 
deferred tax expense (income). 
 
Current income tax expense charged to the profit and loss is the tax payable on the taxable income 
using  applicable  income tax  rates enacted or  substantially enacted  as  at the end  of the reporting 
period. Current tax liabilities (assets) are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to 
(recovered from) the relevant taxation authority. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if 
it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and 
losses. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
assets also result where amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available. 
No deferred income tax will be recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding 
a business combination, where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.
ZYL Limited page 26
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Annual Report 30 June 2015
1
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Where temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries and associates, deferred 
tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  not  recognised  where  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future. 
Research and development expenditure tax offsets receivable under Section 73Q of the Income Tax 
Assessment Act are recognised upon lodgement of the income tax return, when the Company has 
made the required election.
(m)  Employee benefits
(n)
(o)
(p)
(q)
Provision is made for the Group’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by 
employees to the end of the reporting period. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled 
within one year have been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled. 
Employee  benefits  payable  later  than  one  year  have  been  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the 
estimated future cash outflows to be made for those benefits. Those cash flows are discounted using 
market yields on high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that match the expected timing 
of cash flows. 
 
Share based payment transactions 
 
The Group recognises the fair value of options granted to directors, employees and consultants as 
remuneration as an expense on a pro-rata basis over the vesting period in the statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group provides benefits to employees (including directors) of the Group in the form of share 
based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares (“equity-settled transactions”).  The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees 
(including directors) is measured by reference to fair value at the date they are granted. The fair value 
is determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. 
 
Provisions and contingencies 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of a past 
event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can 
be reliably measured. 
 
Trade and other payables
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether 
or not billed to the Group.  Trade payables are normally settled within 30 days.
Financial Instruments 
Recognition and Initial Measurement 
Financial instruments, incorporating financial assets and financial liabilities, are recognised when the 
entity  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the  instrument.  Trade  date  accounting  is 
adopted  for  financial  assets  that  are  delivered  within  timeframes  established  by  marketplace 
convention. 
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus transactions costs where the instrument 
is not classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Transaction costs related to instruments classified
ZYL Limited page 27
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Annual Report 30 June 2015
1
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
as at fair value through profit or loss are expensed to profit or loss immediately. Financial instruments 
are classified and subsequently measured as set out below.  
Derecognition 
Financial assets are derecognised where the contractual rights to receipt of cash flows expires or the 
asset  is  transferred  to  another  party  whereby  the  entity  no  longer  has  any  significant  continuing 
involvement in the risks and benefits associated with the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised 
where the related obligations are either discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the 
carrying value of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value 
of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in 
profit or loss.  
Classification and Subsequent Measurement  
 Loans and receivables  
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are  not  quoted  in  an  active  market  and  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the 
effective interest rate method. 
Financial liabilities 
Non-derivative  financial  liabilities  (excluding  financial  guarantees)  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss 
through the amortisation process and when the financial liability is derecognised.
Fair value
The Group has no assets or liabilities measured at fair value because, while assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed in business combinations have been measured at their acquisition date fair 
values, in accordance with paragraph 18 of AASB 3, these initial measurements have formed the 
costs of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the purpose of other accounting standards. 
 
Impairment
At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a 
financial asset has been impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be 
impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events (a 
“loss event”) having occurred, which has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial 
asset(s).
In the case of financial assets carried at amortised cost, loss events may include: indications that the 
debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in 
interest  or  principal  payments;  indications  that  they  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  other  financial 
reorganisation; and changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost (including loans and receivables), a separate allowance 
account  is  used  to  reduce  the  carrying  amount of  financial  assets  impaired  by  credit  losses.  After 
having taken all possible measures of recovery, if management establishes that the carrying amount 
cannot be recovered by any means, at that point the written-off amounts are charged to the allowance
ZYL Limited page 28
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Annual Report 30 June 2015
1
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
account  or  the  carrying  amount  of  impaired  financial  assets  is  reduced  directly  if  no  impairment 
amount was previously recognised in the allowance account.
When the terms of financial assets that would otherwise have been past due or impaired have been 
renegotiated, the Group recognises the impairment for such financial assets by taking into account 
the original terms as if the terms have not been renegotiated so that the loss events that have occurred 
are duly considered.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash includes cash on hand and at bank, short term 
deposits with financial institutions maturing within less than three months and net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts. 
 
Research and development costs 
 
All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Revenue and income recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable after taking into 
account any trade discounts and volume rebates allowed. Any consideration deferred is treated as the 
provision of finance and is discounted at a rate of interest that is generally accepted in the market for 
similar  arrangements.  The  difference  between  the  amount  initially  recognised  and  the  amount 
ultimately received is interest revenue.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point of delivery as this corresponds to the transfer 
of significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and the cessation of all involvement in those 
goods. 
 
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
Goods and Services Tax 
 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount 
of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Tax Office. In these circumstances the GST is 
recognised  as  part  of  the  cost  of  acquisition  of  the  asset  or  as  part  of  an  item  of  the  expense. 
Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST.
Cash  flows  are  presented  in  the  statement  of  cash  flows  on  a  gross  basis,  except  for  the  GST 
component of investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows. 
Comparative figures 
 
When  required  by  accounting  standards,  comparative  figures  have  been  adjusted  to  conform  to 
changes in presentation for the current financial year.

New Accounting Standards for application in future periods
ZYL Limited page 29
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Annual Report 30 June 2015
1
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The  AASB  has  issued  new  and  amended  accounting  standards  and  interpretations  that  have 
mandatory application dates for future reporting periods and which the Group has decided not to 
early adopt.  A discussion of those future requirements and their impact on the Group is as follows:
• AASB 9: Financial Instruments and associated Amending Standards (applicable for annual reporting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018).
The Standard will be applicable retrospectively (subject to the comment on hedge accounting below) 
and includes revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, 
revised  recognition  and  derecognition  requirements  for  financial  instruments  and  simplified 
requirements for hedge accounting.
The key changes made to the Standard that may affect the Group on initial application include certain 
simplifications to the classification of financial assets, simplifications to the accounting of embedded 
derivatives,  and  the  irrevocable  election  to  recognise  gains  and  losses  on  investments  in  equity 
instruments that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
Although the directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 9 may have an impact on the Group’s 
financial  instruments,  including  hedging  activity,  it  is  impracticable  at  this  stage  to  provide  a 
reasonable estimate of such impact.
• AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and associated Amending Standards (applicable 
for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018).
The Standard establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when 
revenue is recognised. The potential financial impact of the adoption of AASB 15 on the Group is not 
yet possible to determine.
The following amendments to existing standards are not yet mandatory and not expected to result in 
any significant changes to the Group’s accounting policies:
• 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between 
an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture;
•  2015-1  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting  Standards  –  Annual  Improvements  to  Australian 
Accounting Standards 2012–2014 Cycle;
• 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to 
AASB 101;
(x)
New and Amended Accounting Policies adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted the following new and revised Australian Accounting Standards from 1 July 
2015 together with consequential amendments to other Standards:
• Investment Entities – Amendments to AASB 10, AASB 12 and AASB 127
ZYL Limited page 30
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Annual Report 30 June 2015
1
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
These amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the 
definition of  an  investment  entity  under  AASB 10  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and must  be 
applied retrospectively, subject to certain transition relief. The exception to consolidation requires 
investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss. These amendments 
have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities in the Group qualifies to be an investment 
entity under AASB 10.
•  AASB  2013-3  Amendments  to  AASB  136  –  Recoverable  Amount  Disclosures  for  Non-Financial 
Assets
The  amendments  include  the  requirement  to  disclose  additional  information  about  the  fair  value 
measurement when the recoverable amount of impaired assets is based on fair value less costs of 
disposal. This amendment has resulted in increased disclosures in the Group’s financial statements.
• Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Amendments to AASB 132
These amendments clarify the meaning of ’currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’ and the 
criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and 
is applied retrospectively. These amendments have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities 
in the Group has any offsetting arrangements
•  AASB  2013-4  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting  Standards  -  Novation  of  Derivatives  and 
Continuation of Hedge Accounting
These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative 
designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria and retrospective application is required. 
These amendments have no impact on the Group as the Group has not novated any of its derivatives 
during the current or prior periods.
• Interpretation 21 Accounting for Levies
Interpretation 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers 
the payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching 
a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the 
specified minimum threshold is reached. Retrospective application is required for AASB Interpretation 
21. This interpretation has no impact on the Group as it has applied the recognition principles under 
AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets consistent with the requirements of 
AASB Interpretation 21 in prior years.
• AASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards 
The adoption AASB 2014-1 has required no additional disclosures in the Group’s segment note. The 
adoption of these standards did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
2. 
 
In  preparing  these  Financial  Statements  the  Group  has  been  required  to  make  certain  estimates  and 
assumptions concerning future occurrences. There is an inherent risk that the resulting accounting estimates 
will not equate exactly with actual events and results. 
 
(a)
Significant accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, 
apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements: 
 
Deferred tax assets 
The Group expects to have carried forward tax losses which have not been recognised as deferred tax assets 
as it is not considered sufficiently probable that these losses will be recouped by means of future profits 
taxable in the relevant jurisdictions. 
 
(b)   Significant accounting estimates and assumptions 
 
The carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions 
of  future  events.  The  key  estimates  and  assumptions  that  have  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period 
are: 
 
Impairment of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure 
The future recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is dependent on a number of 
factors, including whether the Group decides to exploit the related lease itself or, if not, whether it successfully 
recovers the related exploration and evaluation asset through sale. 
 
Factors  that  could  impact  the  future  recoverability  include  the  level  of  reserves  and  resources,  future 
technological  changes,  costs  of  drilling  and  production,  production  rates,  future  legal  changes  (including 
changes to environmental restoration obligations) and changes to commodity prices. 
 
Share-based payment transactions 
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of 
the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.  Fair values of share options are determined 
using  the  Black  Scholes  model.  Should  the  assumptions  used  in  these  calculations  differ,  the  amounts 
recognised could significantly change. 
 
Conservativism when dealing with Incomplete Financial Information 
When a lack of financial information makes it difficult estimating a balance, the Group has erred towards 
conservatively undervaluing assets and overvaluing liabilities.

The decrease in expenditure in relation to employees and directors during the year was due to 
the termination of employment of South African based employees and directors during the year 
ended 30 June 2014.  Due to the lack of accounting records, amounts which are suspected to 
have been termination payments during year ended 30 June 2014 were conservatively classified 
as director benefits expense as they included the termination payment of a South African based 
executive director, however, there are insufficient accounting records to determine the exact 
amount which related to the South African based executive director.

Kangwane Central project. The loan has no fixed repayment terms and is interest free. This loan has 
been impaired down to the expected recoverable value of $2,208,214. The increase in the loan balance 
receivable for 2015 of $130,750 was solely due to foreign exchange rate movements.
MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION EXPENDITURE
The balance carried forward represents projects in the exploration and evaluation phase. Ultimate 
recoupment of exploration expenditure carried forward is dependent on successful development 
and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of respective areas. Other than the Kangwane 
South  Anthracite  Project,  capitalised  exploration  expenditure  has  been  fully  impaired  based  on 
expected recovery. The interest in the Kangwane South Anthracite Project has been impaired down 
to  the  estimated  realisable  value  following  the  potential  completion  of  the  Deed  of  Company 
Arrangement.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The  Group  has  exposure  to  various  risks  from  the  use  of  financial  instruments.  The  Company’s  financial 
instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, short-term investments, accounts receivable and payable, 
and loans to and from subsidiaries.
Financial risk exposure and management
The main purpose of non-derivative financial instruments is to raise finance for Company operations. 
 
(a) 
 
Financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk (interest rate risk, and foreign currency risk) 
are  managed  such  to  maintain  on  optimal  capital  structure.  The  Group  does  not  enter  into  derivative 
transactions to manage financial risks. In the current period, the Group’s financial risk arises principally from 
cash financial assets. The Group invests its cash in term deposits and other appropriate bank accounts to 
obtain market interest rates. 
 
 (b)  Capital risk management 
 
The Group chose to incur significant debts to finance project acquisition and development. The Group is not 
subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in note 14 offset by cash and 
bank balances) and equity of the Group (comprising issued capital and reserves as detailed in notes 16 and 17, 
and retained earnings). 
 
(c)  Market rate risk 
 
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to the acquisition of goods and services in South 
African  Rand  (ZAR)  and  US  dollars  (USD).  The  Group  does  not  hedge  this  exposure  by  using  financial 
instruments.   
 
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian 
dollar, was as follows:
Financial Assets 
Cash at bank (ZAR)

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial 
loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.

The maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security, at the end of the 
reporting period to recognised financial assets, is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment 
of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements. 
 
The Group has adopted the policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating 
the risk of financial loss from defaults. The term deposits are held by a AA rated bank thereby mitigating the 
risk of default on these deposits.  The Groups policy is to review all outstanding debtors at the end of the 
reporting period and, based on directors' view on credit risk, an appropriate provision for impairment is raised. 
At the end of the reporting period, examination of the Group’s trade debtors ledger reveals no reason for an 
impairment adjustment. 
  
The  Group  does  not  have  any  material  credit  risk  exposure  to  any  single  receivable  or  Company  or  any 
receivables under financial instruments entered into by the Group.  
 
The directors' view is that the receivables past due but not impaired are of good credit quality.  
 
(f)  Net fair value 
 
The  carrying  amount  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  recorded  in  the  financial  statements  is 
considered a reasonable approximation of their respective net fair values.

Annual Report 30 June 2015
Directors’ Declaration 
 
1)
a)
b)
(ii)
In the opinion of the Directors of ZYL Limited, : 
 
the financial statements and notes, set out on pages 17 to 46, subject to the qualification set out in 
paragraph 2 below, are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including to: 
 
(i)
comply with Accounting Standards, which, as stated in accounting policy Note 1 to the financial 
statements,  constitutes  explicit  and  unreserved  compliance  with  International  Reporting 
Standards (IFRS); and
give a true and fair view of the financial position as at 30 June 2015 and of the performance for 
the year ended on that date of the company and consolidated Company;
as indicated in Note 1(c), subject to the successful recapitalisation of the Company there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the Company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and 
payable.
2)  Due  to  turnover  of  previous  staff  and  officers,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external 
administration, complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 
June 2013 and since, this has led to insufficient information being available to support several material 
contracts as well as transactions and balances of foreign subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the audited Remuneration disclosures, 
financial statements and notes are in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, 
due to the lack of records and certainty in connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 
30 June 2013 and since then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy 
the  creditors’  and  administrator’s  debts,  along  with  the  continued  existence  of  the  Kangwane  South 
Anthracite Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, 
the  absence  of  these  records  is  not  expected  to  significantly  detract  from  the  Company’s  ability  to 
maintain proper books and records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities,  when 
current directors were appointed. Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff 
and  officers,  unavailable  documents  of  foreign  subsidiaries,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to 
external administration, primarily affects the historical records of the economic entity rather than its 
ability to continue its retained business and operations.
The Directors have been given the declarations required by section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001, 
which is also subject to the qualification in paragraph 2 above.
Signed in accordance with a resolution of the Directors:
Mr Shaun Hardcastle 
Non-executive Director

capital, and hence remove significant doubt of its ability to continue as a going concern

appointed on 23 February 2015. As stated in Note 1(b) of the Annual Report, due

adjustments might have been found necessary in respect of recorded or
unrecorded amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position.
