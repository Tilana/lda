<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 21/15, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit to the Council, prior to its twenty-seventh 
session, an analytical study focusing on gender-based and sexual violence in relation to 
transitional justice in conflict and post-conflict situations, the effective participation of 
victims and the participatory procedures necessary to address the different needs and 
opportunities of women, men and children, including good practices of States in the field of 
truth-seeking, justice, reparation and institutional reform. 
</p><p>2. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
asked for contributions for the study. Information was provided by Algeria, Argentina, 
Colombia, Cuba, France, Germany, Georgia, Guatemala, Iraq, Serbia, Slovakia and 
Switzerland, as well as by Redress.1 The Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, 
justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality 
and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict were consulted in the preparation of the 
study. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Gender-based and sexual violence in relation to transitional 
justice 
</b>3. Gender-based violence is considered to be any harmful act directed against 
individuals or groups of individuals on the basis of their gender.2 Gender-based violence 
may include sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced/early marriage and 
harmful traditional practices. Sexual violence is a form of gender-based violence and 
encompasses &#8220;any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or 
advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person&#8217;s sexuality using 
coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting&#8221;.3 
Sexual violence takes multiple forms and includes rape, sexual abuse, forced pregnancy, 
forced sterilization, forced abortion, forced prostitution, trafficking, sexual enslavement, 
forced circumcision, castration and forced nudity.  
</p>
<p>4. An understanding and analysis of how gender intersects, for instance, with race, 
religion, economic situation, political affiliation and geography is also critical to 
understanding and addressing patterns and forms of gender-based violence. In some 
contexts, it is also important to take into consideration violence perpetrated against persons 
perceived as not conforming to traditional notions of masculinity or femininity, including 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. 
</p>
<p>5. Although men and boys are also targets of gender-based and sexual violence in 
conflict situations, the victims of such violence continue to be disproportionally women and 
girls. Experience shows that in conflict and post-conflict situations, and in periods of

<p>political or civil strife and instability, women and girls are exposed to heightened risks of 
violations of their human rights and higher levels of violence, including sexual violence. 
Trafficking in women and girls can be exacerbated owing to the breakdown of political, 
economic and social structures, increased militarism and related demands for women&#8217;s 
sexual, economic and military exploitation.4 During armed conflict, sexual violence is often 
used as a tactic of war to humiliate, dominate, instil fear in, disperse and/or forcibly 
relocate civilian members of a community or ethnic group.5 Ethnic cleansing and the 
destruction of the fabric of family and community are often also part of the deliberate 
strategies of warring parties.6 
</p>
<p>6. For the United Nations system, transitional justice comprises the full range of 
processes and mechanisms associated with a society&#8217;s attempt to come to terms with a 
legacy of large-scale past abuses, in order to ensure accountability, serve justice and 
achieve reconciliation. Transitional justice consists of both judicial and non-judicial 
processes and mechanisms, including prosecution initiatives, truth-seeking, reparations 
programmes, institutional reform or an appropriate combination thereof.7 Furthermore, 
comprehensive national consultations, particularly with those affected by human rights 
violations, have been recognized as critical element of transitional justice.8  
</p><p>7. Addressing gender-based and sexual violence in societies transitioning from conflict 
or repressive rule is vital to ensuring accountability and sustainable peace. Transitional 
justice processes can help to realize the rights of victims of such violence and can be 
instrumental in identifying and dismantling the underlying structural discrimination that 
enabled it to occur. As such, it is important to ensure that victims of gender-based and 
sexual violence are consulted effectively, that they receive adequate redress for violations, 
that women can fully participate in transitional justice processes and that their rights and 
perspectives are adequately reflected therein.  
</p>
<p>8. There has been an increased focus on the effective participation of victims in 
transitional justice processes, and the participatory procedures necessary to address the 
different needs of and opportunities for women, men, girls and boys. Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent Council resolutions on women, peace and security, 
including resolution 2122 (2013), recognized the need to include women in all aspects of 
peacemaking, post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding. This includes the design, 
implementation and evaluation of transitional justice processes, 
</p>
<p><b> III. National consultations 
</b></p>
<p>9. National consultations are a critical element of the human rights-based approach to 
transitional justice, and are founded on the principle that successful strategies require 
meaningful public participation. Consultations around the design, implementation and 
evaluation of transitional justice mechanisms are key to ensuring that those mechanisms are 
relevant and empowering to those affected by them. Without the consultation and 
participation of women and girls, transitional justice initiatives are likely to reflect only 
men&#8217;s concerns, priorities and experiences of violence and to largely overlook gender-

<p>based and sexual violence. In Timor-Leste, it was only when women were consulted that 
prosecutors began to pay attention to sexual-violence crimes.9 Similarly, consultations are 
necessary to create transitional justice processes that are sensitive to women&#8217;s particular 
needs, their priorities and their social and cultural contexts. Further, national consultations 
can themselves be an important tool of empowerment, recognition and redress for victims. 
Consultations with groups that are often silenced or marginalized, such as women, children, 
the elderly, and ethnic, racial or religious minorities, also sends a strong signal about equal 
rights in the post-conflict context, which itself has transformative social potential. 
</p>
<p>10. Representation of a cross section of women and girls in all their diversity must be 
ensured during consultations. Consultations with women should not solely focus on their 
experience of victimization, but should take account of the evolution of gender roles during 
and after conflict and the multiple roles women play in such situations. By highlighting 
women&#8217;s roles as vital contributors to the economy, household heads, guardians and agents 
of change in their communities, consultations can maximize their potential to empower 
women and challenge prejudices. 
</p><p>11. There is often a need to address the practical obstacles faced by women, men, girl 
and boy victims of gender-based and sexual violence in participating in consultation 
processes. For instance, to express free and frank opinions, women should be consulted 
separately from men and, as appropriate, by other women and without haste. Protections 
from backlash and stigmatization, including strict safeguards of confidentiality and 
anonymity, are essential. To avoid re-traumatizing victims, consultations must be held in 
safe, neutral spaces by people trained in working with victims of gender-based and sexual 
violence. This is particularly critical when consulting children, which should generally only 
be done by specially trained personnel.10 The reluctance of victims to disclose their 
experiences may be compounded in countries where there is little awareness that gender-
based and sexual violence is criminal, or where victims may face counter-charges of 
adultery or morality-related offences for bringing a sexual violence claim. Sensitization 
efforts giving local populations necessary information about transitional justice processes 
can play an important role in that regard. More efforts are also needed to understand and 
address the particular barriers that male, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and 
other marginalized victims of sexual violence may face in coming forward in consultations. 
</p>
<p>12. Attention must also be paid to obstacles that women and girls may face in 
participation. Those include low literacy levels, discussions being conducted in a language 
different to their common vernacular or too far from their homes, the cost of attending 
consultations, including in lost labour and childcare time, and a lack of identity documents. 
Measures such as using local dialects and providing childcare assistance can help address 
those issues.11 Conducting decentralized consultations, including in remote locations, is a 
particularly important element in supporting women&#8217;s participation and in ensuring that a 
diversity of women are consulted. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, 
OHCHR convened a high-level panel in 2011 that visited six communities around the 
country and met with local and provisional government authorities and with victims, non-
governmental organizations and other United Nations agencies in order to ascertain 
victims&#8217; views on reparations.12

<p>13. As women and children make up the vast majority of persons displaced by conflict, 
efforts should also be made to consult in camps for internally displaced persons and 
refugees. Some initiatives in this area include the consultation of Sierra Leonean refugees 
in Guinea in 1999, of Timorese refugees in Indonesia in 2000,13 and of internally displaced 
persons in Darfur in 2010 in relation to the Doha peace process. However, more efforts are 
needed. 
</p>
<p>14. Women&#8217;s groups and other local networks can play an invaluable role in reaching 
and engaging victims. However, care must be taken in ensuring that civil society 
intermediaries truly represent victims&#8217; views, not their own agenda or that of a narrow 
subgroup of victims,14 for example urban or well-educated women only. While 
consultations with children should make use of schools, clubs, child protection agencies 
and other networks for outreach and engagement, experience suggests that for children to 
speak frankly, they should be consulted in the absence of adult intermediaries.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Truth-seeking processes 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Truth commissions 
</b></p>
<p>15. Truth commissions play an important role in addressing not only sexual violence, 
but also other forms of gender violence. Truth commissions are often well placed to reflect 
the systematic nature of sexual violence, particularly where it is used as a method of 
warfare. In situations where there is social stigma attached to sexual violence, incorporating 
a gender perspective into the work of a truth commission will also help to break down that 
stigma and change societal attitudes regarding sexual violence. There may not be sufficient 
understanding of the long-term impact of such violence, including as suffered by girls and 
boys. Sensitizing the population to the work of truth commissions through an outreach 
programme is an important element in that regard. 
</p>
<p>16. A specific gender perspective, including attention to gender-based and sexual 
violence, was absent from the work of some early truth commissions.15 Some of the more 
recent commissions have successfully integrated closer attention to gender-based and 
sexual violence in their work and supported the participation of women and girls.16 That 
included creating a specialized gender unit within a commission; incorporating the issue of 
gender-based and sexual violence into their operational structure and rules of procedure, 
even where that was not specified in the formal mandate of the commission; ensuring the 
representation of women as commissioners, at expert levels and as staff; supporting a 
communication and outreach process that emphasizes that gender-based and sexual 
violence is within the ambit of the commission and should be reported; and conducting 
analysis and elaborating specific findings and recommendations regarding sexual violence 
or gender-based discrimination in their final reports.17

<p>17. The truth commissions in Guatemala, South Africa and Peru, which were pioneers in 
addressing gender-based and sexual violence, have been important reference points for later 
commissions. In Peru, for instance, the truth commission established a specific gender unit, 
and dedicated two chapters of its final report to gender issues, including gender-based and 
sexual violence.18 Other important examples of truth commissions that addressed gender-
based and sexual violence include those in Kenya, Liberia, Morocco, Sierra Leone, 
Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. 
</p>
<p>18. While dedicated attention to sexual violence continues to be critically important, 
there is growing acknowledgement that truth commissions have a unique role to play in 
uncovering the root causes of such violence and the complexity of its effects. The report of 
the Kenyan truth commission includes a lengthy chapter on sexual violence, and another on 
gender and gross violations of human rights, in which the commission explored patterns of 
discrimination and displacement, as well as the record of women&#8217;s political participation 
and their historical role in peacemaking.19  
</p>
<p>19. Incorporating issues of gender-based and sexual violence into the work of a truth 
commission, including research, outreach, statement taking and report writing, requires a 
considerable commitment in the context of a truth-seeking mandate that is already 
challenging.20 This may also include consideration of the economic, social and cultural 
dimensions of violations that disproportionately affect women, children and other specific 
groups.21 In Peru, the truth commission explored gender dimensions of the economic causes 
and consequences of violations, including the displacement of women and children and the 
rise in the number of female-headed households.  
</p>
<p>20. In Sierra Leone, the truth commission addressed violations of economic, social, 
cultural, civil and political rights and looked at linkages between pre-existing gender 
inequality and the gender-based and sexual violence that was prevalent during that 
country&#8217;s civil war. In its report, the truth commission made broad recommendations aimed 
at transforming gender relations, including through law reform; improvements to women&#8217;s 
access to justice; abolishment of discriminatory customs; education programmes; and the 
economic empowerment of women. Furthermore, the truth commission in Guatemala 
concluded that sexual violence was systematically directed at rural Mayan women during 
the conflict.  
</p>
<p>21. A number of factors may support a commission&#8217;s capacity to undertake a gender-
sensitive analysis and the likelihood that it will do so. While it is certainly possible for a 
commission to give sustained attention to issues of gender-based and sexual violence even 
without a specific mandate to that effect, there are many advantages to identifying such 
issues specifically in its legal framework.22 Those drafting a legal framework for a truth 
commission should take into account the importance of gender-based and sexual violence 
in the history of the conflict. In most cases, it is recommended that this issue be identified 
specifically in a commission&#8217;s mandate.23 Additionally, it is important to ensure that a

<p>commission&#8217;s design and mandate are informed by national consultations, including with 
women&#8217;s organizations, and to conduct a conflict-mapping exercise that documents the 
range of violations experienced by women. 
</p>
<p>22. Many recent commissions have built on the precedent established by Peru, setting 
up specialized gender units. Other truth commissions, such as the National Reconciliation 
Commission of Ghana, have incorporated gender concerns throughout its structure, rather 
than establish a specific unit. Gender units can play a valuable role as a focal point for 
efforts to address gender-based and sexual violence, but should not be a substitute for 
incorporating gender concerns across a commission&#8217;s work. Some experts recommend both 
establishing a gender unit and taking a cross-cutting approach, as was done by the 
commission in Timor-Leste.  
</p>
<p>23. Partnerships with women&#8217;s groups can strengthen a truth commission&#8217;s legitimacy, 
as well as its capacity to address gender-based and sexual violence. Past commissions have 
benefited from the involvement of women&#8217;s groups, which have made formal submissions, 
undertaken outreach, provided support to victims who provide testimony, drawn attention 
to overlooked issues, assisted with statement taking and gender training, and provided 
analysis on patterns of abuse. In Tunisia, women&#8217;s organizations are working to document 
stories and provide preliminary lists and databases of women victims, to be used in the 
initial mapping undertaken by the Truth and Dignity Commission. In Timor-Leste, 
partnerships with women&#8217;s civil society groups significantly strengthened the commission&#8217;s 
work.24 It is also important for a commission to reach out to organizations that work closely 
with child victims, including victims of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>24. A commission&#8217;s composition should reflect its priorities in the area of gender-based 
and sexual violence. Experience shows that appointing commissioners and staff who 
understand and are committed to addressing the gendered dimensions of conflict is vital to 
maintaining a proactive focus on gender-based and sexual violence. Some commissions 
have used quotas to ensure the representation of women as commissioners, at expert levels 
and as staff. Commissioners and staff who bring understanding and experience in dealing 
with this type of violence may also be better placed to create a supportive and enabling 
environment that allows victims to speak about their experiences. Female victims of sexual 
abuse may also prefer to speak with female statement takers, and male victims of such 
abuses may prefer to speak with men. This should be taken into account in staffing the 
teams of statement takers and in setting up hearings.  
</p>
<p>25. Internal training is also important. Many past truth commissions, including those in 
Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste, incorporated gender training for their staff. 
Training has covered, among other areas, international norms pertaining to gender-based 
and sexual violence; the history of gendered patterns of abuse in situations of conflict and 
repression; gender-sensitive approaches to statement taking, data collection and hearings, 
including support for and protection of women participants; conducting investigations that 
are responsive to the complex causes and manifestations of gender-based and sexual 
violence; and mainstreaming gender in report writing.25 The United Nations has often 
assisted with expertise during such training. 
</p>
<p>26. Investigators and statement takers may need training in interacting sensitively with 
victims experiencing psychological stress. The experience of many truth commissions has

<p>been that women providing statements speak more often about the victimization of others, 
particularly family members,26 and may leave out the stories of their own suffering. In 
South Africa, statement takers reminded women not to forget &#8220;to tell us what happened to 
you&#8221;.27 Requests to provide information to the commission anonymously should also be 
given serious consideration, as that may allow persons to speak about sexual abuse when 
they otherwise may not. Commissions should establish procedures to guarantee anonymity 
in appropriate cases.28  
</p>
<p>27. In some circumstances, alternative approaches to gather information about women&#8217;s 
experiences in a conflict may be necessary. In Timor-Leste, where the number of women 
who came forward was much lower than expected, the gender unit commissioned 200 in-
depth oral histories to supplement the commission&#8217;s understanding of women&#8217;s 
experiences. In Liberia, the United Nations Development Fund for Women organized peer 
meetings in affected communities, where women could share their experiences and have 
them transmitted to the Commission, rather than testifying in person.  
</p>
<p>28. Creating an enabling environment in the context of public hearings is also important. 
The Sierra Leonean commission held dedicated women&#8217;s hearings, and funded women&#8217;s 
groups to support those women who came before the commission. Women were given the 
options of testifying in camera, speaking in public from behind a screen or speaking openly 
to the audience.29  
</p>
<p>29. Addressing gender-based and sexual violence within a truth commission can also lay 
the foundation for recommendations regarding institutional and legislative reform in order 
to address an entrenched culture of discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International commissions of inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>30. Given the important role that international commissions of inquiry and similar 
investigatory bodies play in laying the foundation for transitional justice processes, a 
dedicated focus on gender-based and sexual violence by such commissions can bring about 
gender-sensitive truth, justice and redress measures. In recent years, there have been 
increasing efforts to ensure that gender-based and sexual violence is adequately addressed 
in the work of international commissions of inquiry. All such commissions and related 
investigative bodies established by the United Nations now include dedicated investigators 
specialized in the area of gender-based and sexual violence, with many recent international 
commissions of inquiry supported by UN-Women.  
</p>
<p>31. Recent commissions of inquiry, including on the Syrian Arab Republic,30 Libya,31 
and Guinea,32 have increasingly devoted attention in their work and reports to the issue of 
to sexual violence. The report of the commission of inquiry on the Democratic People&#8217;s

<p>Republic of Korea33 also paid specific attention to broader gender-based violations and 
crimes, particularly violence against women, and the impact of violations on particular 
groups, including women and children.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Criminal justice proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening national criminal justice proceedings 
</b>32. States have primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over serious crimes under 
international law.34 Accordingly, transitional justice strategies increasingly focus on 
strengthening national capacity to prosecute crimes of gender-based and sexual violence. 
Specialized chambers or courts have been established, for instance, in Croatia, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Serbia and Uganda, and prosecution and 
investigatory units have been created to deal specifically with gender-based and sexual 
violence. In Liberia, the sexual offences act of 2008 provided for a division of circuit courts 
in each county to deal with sexual offences, and the Sexual and Gender-Based Violence 
Crimes Unit was established. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office of the United 
Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(MONUSCO) has worked to strengthen national capacity, including by assisting military 
magistrates to establish mobile courts and specialized prosecution support cells. Those 
efforts have resulted in increasing numbers of convictions being registered.35 In Colombia, 
the Attorney General&#8217;s Office adopted a plan of action to defend the rights of women 
victims of sexual violence in the context of the armed conflict. The plan includes the 
establishment of a disaggregated database, the adoption of an inter-institutional model of 
special investigation and attention to victims that simplifies proceedings to avoid re-
victimization, and the creation of a subunit for the registration, assistance and orientation of 
victims of organized armed groups, which fall outside the scope of the Peace and Justice 
Law.  
</p>
<p>33. National capacity has also been strengthened through the creation of mixed 
chambers, located in the national judiciary but combining both national and international 
expertise. In Bosnia and Herzegovina for example, the War Crimes Chamber, staffed by 
both national and international staff, has prosecuted sexual violence as the crimes against 
humanity of rape, torture, sexual slavery, enslavement and persecution.36  
</p>
<p>34. An important focus of national capacity-building has been training investigators, 
prosecutors, judges, security officials, lawyers, medical staff, social workers and other rule-
of-law actors. Capacity-building trainings have been conducted with United Nations 
assistance, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, the Sudan (Darfur), 
and Kosovo.37 Furthermore, UN-Women has partnered with Justice Rapid Response38 to

<p>train and roster experts on sexual and gender crime and deploy them to international and 
national justice mechanisms. 
</p><p>35. There is increasing awareness of the need to address the obstacles faced by victims 
of gender-based and sexual violence in accessing criminal accountability processes. These 
include the often prohibitive cost of filing complaints, and the geographic inaccessibility of 
police stations, medical services needed to obtain forensic evidence, and courts, particularly 
for women victims living in remote areas without transportation and with childcare 
responsibilities. Victims also need free legal assistance to pursue cases, medical care and 
support to manage the health impact of gender-based and sexual violence, and education 
about the criminal justice system so that cases are not abandoned or withdrawn due to 
mistaken assumptions. Innovative strategies are being adopted to address some of those 
obstacles. Mobile courts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have allowed for 
criminal proceedings to be conducted in remote areas and specialist pro-bono legal clinics 
have been established for survivors of gender-based and sexual violence. Efforts have been 
made to integrate the provision of legal and medical services, creating &#8220;one-stop shops&#8221; for 
child and women survivors of such violence.39  
</p>
<p>36. More analysis is also needed of the potential and limitations of justice processes 
based on customary law. Customary justice mechanisms tend to be more accessible than 
formal courts, providing a means of filling the gap in judicial services to resolve minor 
disputes, enjoying community legitimacy and having the potential to provide culturally 
appropriate remedies. However, previous patterns of gender discrimination of such 
mechanisms make resolving gender-based and sexual violence cases through them 
extremely problematic. Efforts should be made to transform customary justice systems in 
gender-sensitive ways, and to ensure their compatibility with international human rights 
standards, while not allowing this to substitute for formal justice sector reform. For 
instance, in Uganda, the local council courts are now required to ensure that a minimum of 
one third of their judges are women. In South Africa, the Law Reform Commission has 
made recommendations for harmonization of customary law with that country&#8217;s 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International criminal justice and its impact at the national level 
</b>37. Over the past two decades, international justice approaches to gender-based and 
sexual violence have undergone significant transformation. Ad hoc tribunals, the Special 
Court for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court have contributed substantially 
to developing the legal and normative framework for such crimes, including through 
innovative jurisprudence. It is now well recognized that sexual violence can constitute a 
war crime, a crime against humanity or an act of genocide.40 The establishment of the 
International Criminal Court has been particularly significant, with the Rome Statute 
recognizing the international crimes of sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced 
pregnancy, enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence of comparable 
gravity.41 Specific forms of gender-based and sexual violence directed at children,

</p>

 See, for example, A/HRC/25/35, on access to justice for children.

 See for example International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, <i>Prosecutor </i>v.<i> Akayesu</i>, case No. ICTR-
</p>
<p>96-4-T, 731, Trial Chamber judgement, 2 September 1998; International Tribunal for the Prosecution 
of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the 
Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, <i>Prosecutor </i>v.<i> Kunarac et al.</i>, IT-96-23 &amp; IT-96-23/1-

arts. 7 and 8. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>41
 Rome Statute, arts. 7 and 8. </p>


<p>particularly girl child soldiers, have been highlighted. Gender-sensitive evidentiary 
principles have been adopted. For instance, the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the 
International Criminal Court do not allow for the admissibility of evidence of victims&#8217; 
previous sexual conduct in sexual violence cases, establish that proof of sexual violence 
does not require corroboration and elaborate circumstances in which consent cannot be 
inferred from the silence or actions of victims (see rules 71, 63 and 70).  
</p><p>38. Prosecutions before international and hybrid tribunals have greatly furthered the 
visibility of gender-based and sexual violence, in acknowledging and condemning the 
harms suffered by women in conflict, and in establishing an increasingly credible avenue 
for securing accountability for such violence.42 
</p>
<p>39. International legal developments have further catalysed the enactment of national 
legislation criminalizing gender-based and sexual violence, and have established legal 
precedents and international standards for domestic prosecutions and legislative reform. In 
recent years, for instance, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and South Africa 
have amended their penal codes to criminalize a broad range of gender-based violations.43 
On the basis of the definitions provided in the Rome Statute, various states signatories have 
defined these crimes in their national legislation and criminalized them. However, more 
work is needed, with inadequate legal frameworks in some States remaining a significant 
obstacle to combating impunity. Inadequate or imprecise definitions of gender-based and 
sexual violence can leave out certain types of violations, make successful prosecutions 
more difficult and exclude groups of victims. National legislation should be in line with 
international standards, including as regards criminalizing gender-based and sexual 
violence as an international and domestic crime and using gender-neutral definitions that 
allow for prosecutions of sexual offences perpetrated against men as well as women. It 
should also codify States&#8217; obligations to combat the full range of gender-based and sexual 
violence, including, but not limited to, those crimes recognized in the Rome Statute. In 
Uganda, OHCHR is providing technical advice to the International Crimes Division of the 
High Court to ensure that its rules of procedure and evidence are in accordance with 
international best practice.  
</p>
<p>40. Important lessons have been also learned about the processes necessary to conduct 
gender-sensitive prosecutions and support victims&#8217; effective participation. Achieving 
accountability for gender-based and sexual violence requires sustained political will, 
targeted prosecution strategies and timely collection of all types of relevant evidence, 
including forensic evidence. As in other transitional justice processes, training of 
investigation, prosecution and judicial staff is crucial. Experience suggests that many 
victims of gender-based and sexual violence feel more comfortable recounting their 
experiences to women, demonstrating a particular need to recruit more qualified female 
investigators. Prosecutors need training in prosecution strategy and the jurisprudence 
around this type of violence, and judicial staff require instruction in the interpretation of 
legislation and precedents and in creating enabling courtroom environments. Medical staff 
need training also, in the medico-legal aspects of crimes of gender-based and sexual 
violence, including how to gather forensic evidence and refer patients to law enforcement 
agencies. 
</p>
<p>41. Justice is a process, not merely an outcome, and there is increasing awareness of the 
need for courtroom procedures that ensure the dignity and protection of victims. Victims 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42

</p>
<p>violence&#8221; (2011). See also Fionnuala Ni Aol&#225;in, &#8220;Gendered harms and their interface with 
international criminal law: norms, challenges and domestication&#8221; (2013). </p>


<p>should never be, or feel they have been, manipulated, used or endangered by justice 
processes. Courtroom protection protocols, such as voice and image distortion, anonymity 
provisions, use of pseudonyms, protective screens and closed court sessions can play an 
important role in this context. Witness protection programmes should apply before and 
during the trial, but also after its conclusion, and there should be follow-up mechanisms in 
place to track witnesses post-trial. In some cases, relocation and provision of new identities 
may be necessary.44 Given the risk of witness identity being released, witnesses should be 
fully informed of the potential risk so that they are able to make an informed and 
autonomous choice about participation. 
</p>
<p>42. Victims and witnesses must also be protected from further traumatization. They 
should be provided with medical and psychological support, and children should receive 
specialist care and be called as witnesses only when their evidence is truly necessary. 
Judges, prosecutors, and lawyers must ensure that examinations and cross-examinations of 
victims are conducted respectfully and with sensitivity. The Rules of Procedure and 
Evidence of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia provide that &#8220;a Chamber 
shall, whenever necessary, control the manner of questioning to avoid any harassment or 
intimidation&#8221; (rule 75 (D)). Victims and witnesses must also be adequately prepared for the 
detailed and personal questions they are likely to face, particularly given the strong social 
taboos around discussing gender-based and sexual violence.45 Where child victims are 
involved, special measures should be taken to ensure they understand the trial process, 
consistent with their evolving capacities.46 
</p>
<p>43. Criminal justice processes should not only protect, but also aim to empower victims 
and witnesses. At a minimum, victims and witnesses have the right to be regularly informed 
about the progress and ultimate outcome of the cases. Efforts should also be made to 
improve victim participation in prosecutions. For instance, the International Criminal Court 
provides for separate legal representation for victims, and victim participation in the 
pretrial, trial, sentencing and reparations phases. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts 
of Cambodia also provide for a victim participation process whereby victims who become 
party to the proceedings have the right to claim moral and collective reparations.47 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>44. International law establishes different forms of reparation to redress gross violations 
of human rights law and serious violations of humanitarian law, such as restitution, 
compensation, satisfaction, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition.48  
</p>
<p>45. Reparation efforts have historically overlooked women and girls&#8217; needs and 
concerns. However, there has been an increasing recognition in recent years of the need for, 
and potential of, gender-sensitive reparations. Progress has taken place at the conceptual 
level, with the Nairobi Declaration on Women&#8217;s and Girls&#8217; Right to a Remedy and

<p>Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian 
Law, principle 18. </p>


<p>Reparation (2007) and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, advocating for gender-sensitive reparations.49 Also, in 2014, the Secretary-
General issued a guidance note on reparations for conflict-related sexual violence, to 
provide further policy and operational guidance for United Nations engagement in this area. 
</p>
<p>46. Reparations occupy a special place among redress measures in view of their 
potential direct impact on victims of gender-based and sexual violence.50 As such, it is 
particularly critical that victims of gender-based and sexual violence be involved in the 
design and implementation of reparations. Victims know their needs and priorities best, and 
are uniquely placed to address concerns about the modalities and distribution of reparations, 
including with regard to ensuring that benefits are accessible, equitable and effective. 
Accordingly, victim consultations have been a priority in several States. OHCHR, in 
collaboration with local stakeholders, has conducted extensive consultations with victims of 
gender-based and sexual violence in Nepal, Uganda and Kosovo.51 
</p>
<p>47. Supporting the effective participation of victims of gender-based and sexual 
violence in reparation efforts first requires outreach and awareness-raising activities. 
Outreach efforts should begin long before the reparations programme is fully designed and 
must be cognizant of the obstacles to victims&#8217; effective participation in transitional justice. 
Supportive spaces, confidentiality protection and the involvement of staff trained in gender-
based and sexual violence are essential. In Uganda, OHCHR and the Uganda Human Rights 
Commission have been conducting training since 2008 to build awareness of reparations, 
while simultaneously conducting research on the views of conflict-affected communities. 
During outreach, codes in local languages have been used to refer to body parts and gender-
based and sexual violence, allowing victims to circumvent the taboo of speaking about 
sexual violence.52 
</p>
<p>48. The criteria and procedures for accessing reparations must also be gender-sensitive. 
The imposition of strict application deadlines or closed-list systems, whether linked to 
participation in truth commissions or otherwise, is likely to exclude some victims. In Sierra 
Leone and Timor-Leste, the truth commissions decided that the potential list of victims 
should be kept open in order to ensure the widest possible access. Similarly, due to stigma, 
forcing survivors to &#8220;come out&#8221; as victims of gender-based and sexual violence in order to 
gain access to reparations may deter many. In Timor-Leste, rather than singling out victims 
of sexual violence, the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) 
recommended that the reparations be available to categories including single mothers, 
widows, and children affected by conflict, as well as survivors of gender-based and sexual 
violence, adding a layer of protection and confidentiality to female victims coming 
forward.53 Access criteria must also be sensitive to the difficulties women and children face 
in complying with formal requirements, such as providing official documentation or 
holding a bank account, and to literacy and linguistic barriers. In Guatemala, victims of the 
internal armed conflict are offered psychological assistance and rehabilitation adapted to 
their ethnic and cultural identity. The National Reparations Programme there has issued two

<p>manuals which contain good practices and lessons learned on how to conduct interviews 
with victims. In Colombia, a series of measures have been adopted to address sexual 
violence against women committed during the armed conflict. They include the setting up 
of a mobile unit which provides legal and psychological assistance to women and girl 
victims in remote areas.  
</p>
<p>49. Reparations proceedings should adopt adequate procedural and evidentiary rules for 
sexual violence. Onerous corroboration burdens and requirements that victims provide legal 
and medical evidence are likely to make proof impossible for many victims, particularly 
those who have become internally displaced persons. In Morocco, the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission applied a presumption that women who had been in detention 
had also suffered gender-specific violations and awarded additional compensation to 
women claimants on that basis, without victims needing to make a specific claim.54 In the 
Lubanga case, the International Criminal Court held a &#8220;balance of probabilities&#8221; test 
sufficient to establish the facts relevant to an order for reparations against the convicted 
person.55 In the case of children born of rape, as many are not told the circumstances of 
their birth, consideration should be given to allowing carers to claim reparations on behalf 
of the child, without disclosing the claim to the child. 
</p>
<p>50. Given the obstacles to effective victim participation, adopting structural incentives 
to encourage gender-sensitive outreach and procedures should be encouraged. In Timor-
Leste, CAVR recommended that 50 per cent of reparations resources be earmarked for 
women to ensure that the implementing mechanism makes a sufficiently strong effort to 
reach women and girls.56 
</p>
<p>51. One particularly important insight of recent years is that gender-sensitive reparations 
should strive to be transformative.57 Reparations processes and benefits should focus, where 
possible, not on restoring victims to pre-existing positions of inequality, but on subverting 
the structural discrimination that enables gender-based and sexual violence, and 
contributing to a more gender-equal society. In Morocco, the Equity and Reconciliation 
Commission chose not to adopt the concept of &#8220;heir&#8221; defined in Moroccan laws of 
succession when distributing benefits to victims&#8217; families, in order to accord equal 
treatment to men and women successors. That has subsequently been used by some 
organizations in defending reforms to inheritance laws.58 In Tunisia, sustained advocacy has 
similarly led to the reform of discriminatory inheritance laws that affect the receipt of 
reparations benefits.  
</p>
<p>52. Reparations programmes for gender-based and sexual violence should be 
comprehensive. Combining individual, collective, material and symbolic benefits can 
maximize the possibilities of redress for a larger number of victims.59 In Sierra Leone, the 
truth commission recommended a comprehensive reparations programme, covering free 
health care, educational support, skills training, microcredit and microprojects, community 
reparations, symbolic reparations, provision of housing and pensions and a number of 
gender-specific institutional reforms. In 2010, the President, Ernest Bai Koroma, publicly

<p>apologized to the women of Sierra Leone for failing to protect them during the armed 
conflict and pledged to protect women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>53. Collective reparations may have particular potential for victims of gender-based and 
sexual violence. They can reach a wide group of beneficiaries, prevent stigma by avoiding 
the identification of individual victims, and recognize the harm to families and communities 
intended and caused by such violence. Individual victims should, however, directly benefit 
from collective reparations and not feel excluded or marginalized, or even further 
stigmatized. In crafting collective reparations, adequate consultations with victims of 
gender-based and sexual violence should take place and aim to address their particular 
needs, for instance for specialized reproductive health care or fistula repair.60 Collective 
reparations should complement rather than replace individual reparations. 
</p>
<p>54. While reparations and development constitute two distinct and separate rights, 
creating linkages with development actors and programmes could be beneficial for 
delivering sustainable and transformative reparations, particularly in countries affected by 
mass violations and poverty. International cooperation and assistance should not be a 
substitute for the role that States must play in reparations, including acknowledgement of 
responsibility for violations and using their financial and institutional capacity diligently to 
repair the harm suffered by victims.61 
</p>
<p>55. Regarding the different forms of benefits distributed, experience shows that women 
victims often prioritize service-based benefits, such as educational opportunities and access 
to health and psychological rehabilitation services. Care must again be taken not to blur the 
distinction between reparations and social rights, services and development measures to 
which the general population is entitled.62 In relation to economic compensation, the 
obstacles faced by women in accessing and controlling money, including not holding a 
bank account, and pressure from family should be considered. Material benefits that can 
help women pursue what they perceive to be autonomy-enhancing projects and that, 
therefore, can be more transformative should be also considered. In Timor-Leste, in order 
to empower victims sustainably, CAVR recommended the provision of economic 
rehabilitation services, such as skills training and microcredit, rather than monetary 
compensation. Symbolic reparations can also play a valuable role in acknowledging 
gender-based and sexual violence and in affirming the position of victims as citizens and 
rights holders, particularly in the context of social stigma. However, victims&#8217; 
confidentiality must not be breached by measures of public recognition. Reparations 
programmes should pay more attention to guarantees of non-repetition of gender-based and 
sexual violence, which are likely to focus on the underlying structural causes of violence 
and therefore have transformative potential.63  
</p>
<p>56. The effectiveness of reparations efforts in several States, including Sierra Leone, 
South Africa and Timor-Leste, have been bolstered by urgent interim reparations 
programmes. Interim reparations can be valuable in meeting the immediate needs of victims 
of gender-based and sexual violence, as in Sierra Leone, where some victims received 
access to fistula surgery. Interim schemes may also provide important insights which can be 
applied to the design and implementation of the relevant State&#8217;s subsequent comprehensive 
reparations programme. In Timor-Leste, the difficulties in engaging women in the interim

<p>reparations process informed many of the CAVR gender-sensitive recommendations for the 
proposed reparations programme.64 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Institutional reforms 
</b></p>
<p>57. Institutional reforms are necessary to prevent the repetition of gender-based and 
sexual violence, build sustainable peace and re-establish trust between victims and State 
institutions, which may have perpetrated gender-based violence. Institutional reforms also 
have important transformative potential. By focusing on the prevention of future violations, 
they can trigger discussion about the causes of gender-based and sexual violence, prevent 
the normalization of such violence in the post-conflict context and contribute to building a 
more inclusive and gender-just political order. 
</p><p>58. In recent years, there has been increasing awareness of the need to address gender-
based and sexual violence as part of justice and security sector reform. Furthermore, the 
Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, established in 2009 
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1888 (2009), has provided technical advice and 
capacity-building assistance in, inter alia, the Central African Republic, Colombia, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Somalia and South Sudan.65 In the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, the Team provided support to 
investigations and prosecutions by military magistrates and military mobile courts, and 
assisted the national authorities in the development of an implementation plan for the joint 
communiqu&#233; on the fight against sexual violence in conflict signed by the Government and 
the United Nations in March 2013.

<p>59. Security-sector vetting must disqualify individuals who have perpetrated gender-
based and sexual violence.66 Failure to do so puts women and children at risk of further 
violence from those actors, constitutes a significant barrier to seeking justice assistance 
from the State, erodes public faith and confidence in rule-of-law institutions, humiliates 
victims, and sends the message that gender-based and sexual violence is socially 
acceptable.67 Conversely, the disqualification of perpetrators from security roles can itself 
constitute a measure of satisfaction to victims.68  
</p>
<p>60. Furthermore, structural reforms to enhance institutional accountability will often be 
necessary. This may include developing professional standards of conduct, complaint and 
disciplinary procedures and oversight mechanisms. For instance, initiatives in Liberia, 
Sierra Leone and Kosovo have harnessed the opportunity that institutional reform presents 
to increase the participation of women in security and law-enforcement forces,69 
recognizing the links between improved gender parity, higher rates of reporting of gender-
based and sexual violence, and improvements in institutional gender-sensitivity.

<p>61. The criminalization of all forms of gender-based and sexual violence, including rape 
in marriage and domestic violence, has been recognized as necessary to break the silence 
around and create a mandate to prevent and punish such violence. National laws should be 
harmonized to ensure consistency and clarity. Policy and contextual obstacles, such as 
requirements for medical certificates in rape cases, should similarly be reformed.70  
</p>
<p>62. Gender-sensitive training and capacity-building for security sector and law 
enforcement institutions to respond to gender-based and sexual violence is critical. In 
Rwanda, standard operating procedures for child, domestic and gender-based and sexual 
violence have been developed, along with a training curriculum. An important development 
has been the establishment of women&#8217;s police stations or specialist gender-based and sexual 
violence units in the police and military in Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste and 
Kosovo. The units are often staffed exclusively by female officers, or specially trained 
staff, and both directly support victims&#8217; access to justice and contribute to raising 
awareness about gender-based and sexual violence in the community and the institutions. In 
Kosovo, the creation of a police gender desk helped bring human trafficking and forced 
prostitution into the open.71 In Rwanda, the Gender Desk of the military has conducted 
training on women&#8217;s rights and gender-based violence for almost 5,000 members of the 
armed forces, as well as civilians, with support from the United Nations.72 More efforts are 
needed to ensure that those units are adequately resourced, including with appropriate 
physical and communications infrastructure, such as private interview and medical 
examination spaces. Additional support is needed within the justice sector to enable 
effective prosecution of cases.  
</p>
<p>63. Notwithstanding the importance of justice and security sector reforms, institutional 
reforms must also focus on ending gender discrimination more broadly, including through 
constitutional guarantees of gender equality, repealing discriminatory legislation, and 
adopting laws and policies which advance women&#8217;s rights. For example, reforms that 
strengthen women&#8217;s rights in relation to marriage, divorce, land and inheritance can 
contribute to addressing the economic insecurity and dependence that leaves women 
vulnerable to gender-based and sexual violence.

<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>64. <b>There has been notable progress in addressing gender-based and sexual 
violence by transitional justice processes, for instance, by focusing on the effective 
participation of victims of such violence and their particular needs, and striving to 
have a transformative impact. Recent examples show that greater attention has been 
given to such violence and some good practices have developed. Nevertheless, more 
efforts are needed to ensure that transitional justice processes address the full 
spectrum of gender-based and sexual violence. The good practices highlighted in the 
present study should be emulated in other countries concerned, while taking into 
account the specific national context. The study also contains recommendations about 
how transitional justice measures can be improved to address gender-based and 
sexual violence.</b>

<p><b>and the executive, should adequately address gender-based and sexual violence in 
their work. Transitional justice mechanisms, operating independently, should fully 
take into account issues of gender-based and sexual violence in their methods of work, 
operational structures, priorities, recruitment procedures, analysis, findings and 
recommendations. Civil society and other independent bodies should also play a role, 
for instance in raising awareness of, advocating for and supporting the inclusion of 
issues of gender-based and sexual violence in transitional justice processes.
