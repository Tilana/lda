RULING

[1]     
The appellant was charged with indecent assault and aggravated robbery. His application for bail was refused by the Magistrates' Court exercising extended jurisdiction of the High Court.

[2]     
The appellant filed an appeal to this Court against the refusal of bail. While this appeal was pending, the appellant was tried and acquitted of the charges. In these circumstances, the question of bail pending trial is now academic. The appeal cannot possibly succeed and is frivolous.

[3]     
The appeal is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act.
