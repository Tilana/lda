<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present, third, report of the Independent Expert on the promotion of a 
democratic and equitable international order to the Human Rights Council, submitted in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 25/15, summarizes the activities of the 
Independent Expert undertaken from June 2013 to June 2014 and supplements his previous 
reports to the Council and the General Assembly. In the report the Independent Expert 
(a) undertakes a preliminary study of the adverse impacts of military spending, including 
ongoing armed conflict, the war on terror, surveillance, procurement, military research, 
diversion and corruption, on the realization of a democratic and equitable international 
order; (b) recalls that peace is a condition for a just international order necessitating good 
faith disarmament negotiations and a gradual transition from military-first budgets to 
human security budgets; and (c) makes pragmatic recommendations to States, parliaments, 
national human rights institutions, civil society and the Human Rights Council.

<p> &#8220;The global arms trade, and its accompanying glut of military spending, continues to 
represent the single most significant perversion of worldwide priorities known today. It 
buttresses wars, criminal activity and ethnic violence; destabilises emerging democracies; 
inflates military budgets to the detriment of health care, education and basic infrastructure; 
and exaggerates global relationships of inequality and underdevelopment. Without massive 
and coordinated action, militarism will continue to be a scourge on our hopes for a more 
peaceful and just 21st century.&#8221; (Oscar Arias, former President of Costa Rica and Nobel 
Peace Laureate.)1 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present progress report should be read in conjunction with the Independent 
Expert&#8217;s previous reports to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, which 
are cumulatively aimed at addressing the vast scope of Council resolutions 18/6, 21/9 and 
25/15, taking due account of observations and proposals made by States, intergovernmental 
and non-governmental organizations, communications addressed to the mandate holder, 
answers to a questionnaire and interactive dialogues. Inspired by the conviction that peace 
is an indispensable condition for achieving a democratic and equitable international order, 
the present preliminary report on disarmament for development corroborates the idea that 
disarmament must be a priority concern of the international community. Such disarmament 
must include cessation of the production and stockpiling of weapons, particularly weapons 
of mass destruction, accompanied by a significant reduction in the arms trade. Downsizing 
military budgets will enable sustainable development, the eradication of extreme poverty, 
the tackling of global challenges including pandemics and climate change, educating and 
socializing youth towards peace, cooperation and international solidarity. A concerted 
effort at the conversion of military-first economies into human security economies will also 
generate employment and stability.2 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p>2. In the period from 15 June 2013 to 30 June 2014, the Independent Expert undertook 
numerous activities in pursuance of the diverse facets of the mandate. In February 2014, he 
sent a questionnaire to States (see annex I), intergovernmental organizations, national 
human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations in order to inform his 
thematic report to the Council. He expresses thanks for all responses. 
</p>
<p>3. He received letters and appeals from individuals and groups, which he 
acknowledged and considered. During the reporting period, the Independent Expert joined 
other mandate holders in appealing to Governments. He also issued numerous media

<p><b> III. Facts and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>6. In paragraph 17 of resolution 25/15 of 27 March 2014, the Human Rights Council 
requested that the Independent Expert submit a report to the Council at its twenty-seventh 
session. In that resolution, the Council reaffirmed that a democratic and equitable 
international order requires, inter alia, the realization of the right of all peoples to peace. 
Pursuant to paragraph 10, &#8220;all States should promote the establishment, maintenance and 
strengthening of international peace and security and, to that end, should do their utmost to 
achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control, as well as 
to ensure that the resources released by effective disarmament measures are used for 
comprehensive development, in particular that of the developing countries.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 See www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14215&amp;LangID=E. </p>


<p>7. The above-mentioned commitments are central to the purposes and principles of the 
Charter of the United Nations and essential to achieving a just international order. In that 
context, the Independent Expert is exploring the adverse impacts of military expenditures 
on the enjoyment of human rights, and the possibilities of reducing military budgets and 
redirecting resources to the post-2015 development agenda. He is convinced that a 
democratic international order presupposes a commitment to a democratic domestic order, 
and that an international equitable order can best be achieved when the right to 
development is promoted. Such a world order cannot be achieved unless domestic and 
international priorities are changed. One way to change those priorities is to make 
economic and social rights enforceable in the courts of all countries, and to make decisions 
regarding those rights reviewable by regional courts as well as, perhaps, an international 
court of human rights. Budget and fiscal transparency are necessary tools to prevent the 
hijacking of the international order by the international military-industrial complex,8 which 
seeks endless profits through the production and sale of weapons and thereby fuels conflict 
worldwide, hindering negotiation and peaceful solution of disputes.9 However, transparency 
is not enough. Balanced spending for economic and social rights will only be achieved 
through the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>8. The United Nations has adopted countless resolutions reflecting that understanding 
shared by think tanks and civil society alike. Nevertheless, in spite of accurate diagnoses, 
there has been little progress in redirecting military expenditures toward peaceful 
industries. Indeed, one of the challenges faced by the present mandate is precisely how to 
transform the &#8220;ethically obvious&#8221; into the politically feasible. The present report on the 
links between disarmament and development and on the urgent need to reduce military 
expenditures worldwide can be seen as a preliminary report only, since the problem is 
endemic and strategies to solve it have hitherto failed. The Independent Expert intends to 
continue examining this vast issue as a component of the overall strategy to overcome 
obstacles to the establishment of a just international order. 
</p><p>9. Other crucial elements of all the Independent Expert&#8217;s reports to date include a 
pertinent discussion of democracy and self-determination, which are closely related, both 
having individual and collective dimensions, as well as national and international 
implications. The ideal of direct democracy, including the power of legislative initiative of 
citizens and control of issues through genuine consultation and referenda has been partially 
achieved only in few countries. The prevalent model of representative democracy is not 
perfect and needs improvement. Representative democracy deserves the predicate 
&#8220;democratic&#8221; only if and when parliamentarians genuinely represent their constituents. 
Elected members of parliament hold the trust of the electorate and must proactively inform 
the latter of relevant developments that impact on decision-making, including on the 
allocation of national budgets for the military, education and health care. They must be 
committed to inquiring into what the voters need and want. In other words, representatives 
are accountable to the citizens, must act transparently and regularly consult with their 
constituency, since they are not plenipotentiaries, but represent the people with a mandate 
limited in time and scope, which must be administered in good faith and not in usurpation 
of power.

<p><b> A. Human security 
</b></p>
<p>10. Democracy and self-determination serve the overall goal of enabling human security 
and human rights. The concept of &#8220;human security&#8221; is not new. It is to be found, for 
example, in Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s &#8220;Four Freedoms&#8221;, notably in the concepts of &#8220;freedom 
from fear&#8221; and &#8220;freedom from want&#8221;.10 The United Nations Development Programme 
Human Development Report (1994) defined human security as &#8220;the security of people 
through development, not arms; through cooperation, not confrontation; through peace not 
war&#8221;.11 It encompasses: &#8220;first, safety from such chronic threats as hunger, disease and 
repression. And second &#8230; protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in the patterns of 
daily life &#8211; whether in homes, in jobs or in communities. Such threats can exist at all levels 
of national income and development&#8221;.12 A major shift in priorities is necessary, because 
human security cannot be achieved for as long as governments, corporations, banks and 
universities continue to invest trillions in the technology of war rather than in the promotion 
and protection of human rights.13 As the former Director-General of the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Federico Mayor, wrote in 
1998, &#8220;Concepts of security must change. Until now we thought that investment in arms 
was the key to security. Now we know that our real enemies are poverty, ignorance, the 
destruction of the environment.&#8221;14 
</p>
<p>11. One of the problems with addressing military spending is the lack of an all-
encompassing definition. That absence allows governments to dissimulate certain 
expenditures by attributing them to budgets not immediately identified as military-related. 
Frequently, military expenditures are &#8220;secret&#8221; or concealed, thus frustrating the right of 
citizens to know how their taxes are being spent. Military expenditures may be allocated, 
not only to the Army, Navy and Air Force, but sometimes also to a department of energy,15 
to &#8220;research and development&#8221;,16 &#8220;national security&#8221;, &#8220;intelligence&#8221;, &#8220;foreign relations&#8221;, 
etc. A definition of military expenditures must include not only procurement of weapons of 
all kinds, nuclear arms, conventional arms, tanks, aeroplanes, submarines and drones, but 
also expenditures for military exercises, bases, weapons research, testing, environmental 
damage, removal of land mines and explosives, personnel costs, demobilization, 
rehabilitation, health care of veterans, national surveillance, global espionage, and &#8211; not to 
be forgotten &#8211; the interest paid on debts from ongoing and past wars.17 
</p>
<p>12. Military expenditures are staggering18 and there is scant hope that disarmament 
negotiations will result in a significant reduction of military budgets and stop the trend to

<p>militarization in the foreseeable future. The Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute (SIPRI) estimates that, in the year 2013, approximately 1,747 billion dollars were 
spent worldwide for the military.19 The biggest spender devoted as much as 40 per cent of 
tax revenues to the military.20 The Independent Expert joins the United Nations Secretary-
General in deploring this situation; &#8220;the world is over-armed and development is 
underfunded&#8221;.21  
</p>
<p>13. The Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University published a study on the 
cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, estimating it at somewhere between four and six 
trillion United States dollars.22 This study focused on the cost to the United States taxpayer, 
not to other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the &#8220;coalition of 
the willing&#8221;, or to the population of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Much good could have 
been accomplished if a fraction of those military expenditures had been devoted to the 
promotion of the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>14. The links between militarism and development as well as the connection between 
war and the environment must be taken into account. The environment requires protection; 
the testing of new weapons, their use in war and their continuing polluting effects cause 
long-term environmental and economic damage that should be factored in when the costs of 
militarism are computed. It is useful to recall principle 24 of the Rio Declaration of 1992: 
&#8220;warfare is inherently destructive of sustainable development. States shall therefore respect 
international law by providing protection for the environment in times of armed conflict 
and cooperate in its further development, as necessary.&#8221;23  
</p>
<p>15. Many international statesmen have already pondered the issue of budgetary 
priorities. More than 60 years ago, the President of the United States of America, Dwight 
Eisenhower eloquently addressed the predicament: &#8220;Every gun that is made, every warship 
launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and 
are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money 
alone. It is spending the sweat of its labourers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its 
children.&#8221;24 Expenditures for military nuclear research and the production and stockpiling 
of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction have been astronomical, exceeding 
US$100 billion per year.25

<p><b> B. The sword of Damocles and nuclear annihilation 
</b></p>
<p>16. Since the invention of the atomic and hydrogen bombs, mankind has possessed the 
capacity to annihilate itself many times over.26 Winston Churchill was one of many alerting 
us to the grave dangers inherent in weapons of mass destruction, noting that &#8220;the Stone Age 
may return on the gleaming wings of science, and what might now shower immeasurable 
material blessings upon mankind may even bring about its total destruction&#8221;.27 More 
recently, this has been echoed by senior statesmen, including Vaclav Havel, Ricardo Lagos, 
Fernando Cardoso, Yasuo Fukuda, Ruud Lubbers and Helmut Schmidt, who launched the 
Global Zero campaign28 to advocate total nuclear disarmament.  
</p>
<p>17. Eminent figures like Mikhail Gorbachev29 have pointed out the constant danger that 
nuclear weapons pose for humanity and the consequent necessity to eliminate this danger, 
because nuclear destruction may occur not only as a result of a deliberate first strike by an 
aggressor but also by human, electronic or technical error. In view of numerous &#8220;close 
calls&#8221; since 1945, it is fortunate that a technological glitch has not ushered in the end of 
humanity.30 
</p>
<p>18. The General Assembly has adopted many resolutions concerning the nuclear threat, 
most recently resolution 68/40 in 2013, in which it urged States to take the measures 
necessary to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects and to promote 
nuclear disarmament, with the objective of eliminating nuclear weapon, requested the 
Secretary-General to intensify efforts and support initiatives that would contribute towards 
the full implementation of the seven recommendations identified in the report of the 
Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters that would significantly reduce the risk of nuclear 
war and urged States to convene an international conference, as proposed in the United 
Nations Millennium Declaration, to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers.  
</p>
<p>19. Disarmament is not just an idle promise; it is also a commitment under article 26 of 
the Charter of the United Nations, which stipulates: &#8220;In order to promote the establishment 
and maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion for armaments 
of the world&#8217;s human and economic resources, the Security Council shall be responsible for 
formulating plans to be submitted to the Members of the United Nations for the 
establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments.&#8221; The world is waiting for an 
effective system of disarmament that will ensure human security without warfare.

<p>20. In this context it is useful to recall the Nuremberg Judgment of 1946 holding that 
&#8220;To initiate a war of aggression &#8230; is not only an international crime; it is the supreme 
international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the 
accumulated evil of the whole.&#8221;31 In the post-nuclear world, a war of aggression would not 
only be a crime, but quite possibly would mean the destruction of any and all international 
order.32 The existence of zero nuclear weapons may sound utopian, but the effort is required 
in the name of humanity. We must not forget the sword of Damocles still suspended over 
our heads.33 
</p>
<p><b> C. Obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>21. In previous reports, the Independent Expert has identified multiple obstacles to the 
realization of a democratic and equitable international order. In the present report, he turns 
to the issue of spending imbalances prevalent in many countries, which privilege the 
military sector at the expense of peoples&#8217; basic needs. 
</p>
<p>22. Military spending is driven by a range of factors, including threat perceptions, which 
may be real or imagined, and which are exacerbated by warmongering and propaganda. 
During the cold war the superpowers justified almost any level of spending by the &#8220;missile 
gap&#8221; numbers game. Today a new all-purpose enemy has been identified: national and 
international terrorism. This adversary gives military alliances and defence contractors a 
new lease on life. Yet, it would seem obvious to everyone, not only economists, that the 
law of diminishing returns applies, and that there is a level beyond which further 
militarization is futile. Focusing on the root causes of human insecurity is more important 
than trying to apply stopgap solutions here and there.34  
</p>
<p>23. Notwithstanding the <i>jus cogens</i> obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means as 
stipulated in article 2, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the demonization 
of adversaries and sabre-rattling is practised by media and politicians alike, resulting in an 
atmosphere hardly conducive to fruitful negotiation. In fact, the prevalent culture of fear 
and paranoia adds oil to the fires of distrust and hostility among peoples and artificially 
creates a perceived need to buttress &#8220;security&#8221; by increasing military expenditures. This in 
turn provokes the designated &#8220;enemy&#8221; to reciprocate in kind, unleashing a spiral of 
armament and rearmament. The media could play a calming role in this cycle by 
encouraging solutions consistent with the Charter35 and with article 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which specifically prohibits war propaganda, but 
the opposite is frequently the case. This culture of hostility appears to be nurtured by the

<p>military-industrial complex, which has an interest in greater profits through the production 
and use of weapons. It is not surprising that the value of the international arms trade 
reached 385 billion dollars in 2012.36 
</p>
<p>24. In recent years, international tensions were stirred up in a manner that gives reason 
to fear that some governments might manoeuvre themselves into positions that would not 
allow them to retreat without losing face. There is a dynamic to this kind of media- and 
government-sponsored &#8220;hype&#8221; regarding the use of force, whereby a supposed adversary is 
demonized in such a manner that it feels threatened and reacts nervously, thus giving ex 
post facto &#8220;justification&#8221; to those who claim that the adversary must be put down by force, 
and pulling the rug from under the feet of those who propose diplomatic solutions. As the 
Independent Expert illustrated in previous reports, the corporate media often stand to gain 
from wars and this may explain the level of disinformation and profit-oriented propaganda 
disseminated. There is a need for a de-escalation committee with consultative competences 
in this regard. 
</p>
<p>25. Demonization of, and threatening gestures against, targeted States that are party to 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the Non-Proliferation Treaty) 
may induce them to denounce this treaty under its article 10.37 That is exactly what the 
international community would have to avoid. In that context it would be more important to 
engage in serious disarmament as envisaged in article 6 of the Treaty. It is clear that if a 
State party to the Treaty genuinely feels threatened, it may want to join the club of nuclear 
weapon Powers &#8211; not as an aggressive measure, but in exercise of the fundamental right of 
self-preservation, in response to a legitimate concern over threats that contravene article 2, 
paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>26. In the light of continued warmongering by some States, it is apparent that 
resolutions of the General Assembly, including its resolution 68/28, have not succeeded in 
reducing tensions.38 
</p>
<p>27. The spiral of world military expenditures goes hand-in-hand with a false culture of 
&#8220;patriotism&#8221;, &#8220;heroism&#8221; and chauvinism, which frequently equates love of country with 
promoting a large military force, while defaming sceptics and &#8220;pacifists&#8221; as unpatriotic or 
even as traitors. In many countries, the idea of being a good citizen is associated with 
military virtues and traditions, with a sense of awe towards the armed forces. Even in the 
twenty-first century young people in some countries are educated to believe that honour and 
glory are won on the battlefield, that &#8220;it is sweet and proper to die for one&#8217;s country&#8221;.39 It 
would be preferable to teach that honour and glory can also be won through civil courage 
and working for social justice.  
</p><p>28. That militaristic trend is also facilitated by the lack of transparency in budgetary 
matters. Indeed, military expenditures are frequently treated as a matter of &#8220;national 
security&#8221; and shrouded in secrecy. A truly democratic country must proactively inform the 
public so that the public can decide on spending priorities.40

 Colin Archer, <i>Whose Priorities?</i> (Geneva, International Peace Bureau, 2007). </p>


<p>29. Following the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 
international community had a legitimate expectation that the world could be reoriented 
towards cooperation and solidarity and that the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations would be vindicated. Billions of human beings were relieved to move away 
from needless distrust and confrontation. When, in 1991, the Warsaw Pact was dismantled, 
many considered that NATO had lost its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre as a bastion against expansionist 
communism and that the expensive military alliance would be dissolved. Instead, NATO 
expanded eastward and military expenditures continued. The hope of many that finally 
there would be long-term disarmament for sustainable development was dashed.  
</p>
<p>30. It is not unusual for regional military alliances to pressure their members to increase 
military expenditures,41 even at the expense of education and social services. Would it not 
be better to leave peacemaking and peacekeeping in the hands of the United Nations as 
envisaged in its Charter? According to a 2014 report, the European Union is spending at 
least 315 million euros on drone-related projects.42 Yet the use of armed drones against 
civilian targets having been found to be contrary to international humanitarian law, the 
research funds could certainly have been better spent elsewhere.43 Drones are no substitute 
for foreign policy. On 25 February 2014, the European Parliament adopted a resolution 
condemning the use of drones.44 
</p>
<p>31. Those States that undergo domestic unrest frequently fail to extend the degree of 
protection which the population deserves. According to the doctrine of non-intervention, 
foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the sale of weapons to the 
incumbent government or to insurgent groups are no solution. What is necessary is 
international solidarity in helping a State&#8217;s authorities to better protect the human rights of 
its population. There is a distinct danger of politically-motivated recourse to the right to 
protect (R2P) doctrine (formerly the &#8220;humanitarian intervention&#8221; doctrine),45 which would 
actually erode Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations and ultimately be 
counterproductive.  
</p>
<p>32. There are other obstacles to a democratic and equitable international order which 
cannot be examined in the present report, for instance the complications caused by the 
diversion of weapons to unauthorized groups or individuals.46 While military expenditures 
for the procurement of nuclear weapons are not justified, expenditures for conventional 
weapons are also fraught with problems, including diversion, corruption, bribery, theft, etc. 
Organizations such as the Small Arms Survey serve an important function by monitoring 
small arms stockpiles held by States throughout the world, ferreting out corruption. The

<p>Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index published by Transparency International 
makes useful proposals on how to address corruption.47  
</p>
<p>33. Another growing problem is the penetration of the military into universities and 
laboratories, creating a dangerous level of dependence, so that institutions of higher 
learning become reliant on government subsidies and research priorities are driven not by 
what science needs or what a population wants, but by what the military-industrial complex 
is willing to finance.48 A regrettable misuse of brainpower contributes to the technological 
development of weapons of mass destruction and other weaponry. The military research 
sector has emerged as a powerful lobbyist for armaments budgets. Other competitors for 
research and development funds are at a disadvantage. 
</p>
<p>34. Local military-employment concerns and a worrisome level of disinformation also 
hinder efforts to downsize the military. A frequently heard argument, though fundamentally 
flawed, is that the military creates jobs. The truth is that civilian investment generates more 
jobs than military investment.49 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Good practices and positive developments 
</b>35. The United Nations annual Reports on Military Spending, compiled from 
information submitted by States, are potentially a vital confidence-building tool for 
facilitating disarmament negotiations. Unfortunately, fewer than half of the States report in 
any one year. Here too, transparency is conducive to mutual reductions.50 In view of this 
situation, the General Assembly, in its resolution 68/23, requested the Secretary-General 
&#8220;to establish a group of governmental experts, on the basis of equitable geographical 
representation, to review the operation and further development of the United Nations 
Report on Military Expenditures, including the establishment of a process for periodic 
reviews in order to ensure the continued relevance and operation of the Report, 
commencing in 2016, taking into account the views expressed by Member States on the 
subject and the reports of the Secretary-General on objective information on military 
matters, including transparency of military expenditures, and to transmit the report of the 
group of experts to the General Assembly for consideration at its seventy-second session. 
</p>
<p><b> A. United Nations Conference on Disarmament 
</b></p>
<p>36. The United Nations Conference on Disarmament, established in 1979 in Geneva, is 
the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum for the entire world, and hence has a 
vital mandate which must translate into coordinated action worldwide.51 Its mandate 
includes practically all multilateral arms control and disarmament issues, focusing on the

<p>need to stop the nuclear arms race and agree on the modalities of nuclear disarmament, the 
prevention of nuclear war, the prevention of an arms race in outer space, effective 
international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of 
use of nuclear weapons, new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems 
including radiological weapons. In general terms it promotes a comprehensive programme 
of disarmament and transparency in armaments. However, since 1996 the Conference has 
failed to agree on any programme of work. It is encouraging, however, that other initiatives 
are emerging. Michael M&#248;ller, the Acting Secretary-General of the Conference on 
Disarmament, made reference to<b> </b>the Second Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of 
Nuclear Weapons, held in Nayarit, Mexico, in March 2014,52 which built on the 2013 Oslo 
Conference53 and heightened the awareness of the catastrophic toll that any use, deliberate 
or accidental, of a nuclear bomb would have on every aspect of human life: &#8220;for humanity, 
real security and freedom from fear will never come about as long as nuclear weapons 
exist.&#8221;54 
</p>
<p>37. Delegations at the Conference on Disarmament, held in Geneva in May 2014, again 
endorsed the commitments made in New York on 24 September 2010 at the high-level 
meeting on revitalizing the work of the Conference on Disarmament,55 recalling the 
standard-setting of prior decades, including the Biological and Chemical Weapons 
Conventions, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, and the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
</p>
<p><b> B. General Assembly resolutions and Secretary-General  
Pronouncements 
</b></p>
<p>38. The General Assembly adopts every year a resolution on disarmament and 
development with a focus on military spending. In resolution 68/37, it urged the 
international community to devote part of the resources made available by the 
implementation of disarmament and arms limitation agreements to economic and social 
development, with a view to reducing the ever-widening gap between developed and 
developing countries. The Assembly further expressed concern about nuclear weapons and 
the need to take measures to prevent any nuclear conflagration. In resolution 68/39, entitled 
&#8220;Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the implementation of nuclear 
disarmament commitments&#8221;, the goal of complete nuclear disarmament is reaffirmed and 
the creation of nuclear-free zones endorsed. In paragraph 11, all States are urged to pursue 
the 2010 commitments to revitalize the Conference on Disarmament resolution.  
</p>
<p>39. Similarly, the United Nations Secretary-General, in his speech of 24 March 2014 at 
the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, called on all nations to honour security 
guarantees: &#8220;clearly the time has come to strengthen the rule of law in both disarmament 
and non-proliferation. Commitments to undertake disarmament negotiations in good faith 
must be honoured. So, too, must security assurances provided to non-nuclear-weapon States 
by nuclear-weapon States.&#8221; He called on delegates to &#8220;address the legitimate interest of 
non-nuclear States in receiving unequivocal and legally-binding security assurances from 
nuclear-weapon States&#8221; and he concluded: &#8220;together we must ensure that nuclear weapons

<p>are seen by States as a liability, not an asset.&#8221;56 In December 2013, the United Nations High 
Representative on Disarmament observed: &#8220;any high-level meeting on nuclear disarmament 
advances nuclear disarmament, simply because it underlines the urgency of what needs to 
happen. The cornerstone of the whole architecture is clearly the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, which has three pillars. One of them is nuclear disarmament. But when you look at 
how much disarmament has actually taken place, it really isn&#8217;t there. There&#8217;s an increasing 
urgency on the part of those countries that do not have nuclear weapons to say to the 
nuclear weapons powers: you need to disarm, you need to fulfil your side of the bargain. 
Having a high-level meeting with many ministers underlined the fact that more needs to 
happen.&#8221;57  
</p>
<p><b> C. Role of the International Court of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>40. Bearing in mind the dangers inherent in the mere existence of stockpiles of nuclear 
weapons, the Republic of the Marshall Islands filed applications before the International 
Court of Justice, on 24 April 2014, against nine nuclear-armed States for their alleged 
failure to negotiate in good faith for nuclear disarmament, as required under the Non-
Proliferation Treaty.58 
</p>
<p>41. Many civil society organizations, including the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, 
applauded the initiative of the Marshall Islands to engage the World Court in an overdue 
action against the nuclear-armed nations and the stagnation of negotiations. It should be 
remembered that the people of the Marshall Islands continue to suffer today from the 
effects of nuclear weapon tests that took place on their territory in the 1940s and 1950s, and 
they want to ensure that such devastation is never brought on anyone ever again.59 
Moreover, it is important to have a pronouncement of the International Court of Justice 
concerning the international legal obligations assumed by nuclear weapons States pursuant 
to article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty: &#8220;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes 
to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the 
nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general 
and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>42. While the current applications are of a contentious nature, the General Assembly 
could consider, pursuant to Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, referring a 
pertinent legal question to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion: What 
are the legal consequences of the non-respect of article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty? 
</p>
<p><b> D. Arms trade and zones of peace 
</b></p>
<p>43. On 2 April 2013, the General Assembly adopted the Arms Trade Treaty. As of July 
2014, 118 States have signed the Treaty and 41 have ratified it.60 Fifty ratifications are 
necessary for its entry into force. However, the mere existence of the Treaty provides an 
example of good international practice that slowly but surely can bear fruit. 
</p>
<p>44. On 28 and 29 January 2014 the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States 
(CELAC) held its second summit in Havana and adopted a declaration on 29 January 2014

<p>proclaiming the entire region a &#8220;zone of peace&#8221;61<b> </b>(see annex III). The Declaration, which 
constitutes a strong and positive example for the entire world, is based on the desire of the 
inhabitants of the zone to preserve and consolidate peace through the promotion of friendly 
relations between States and the commitment of United Nations Member States to resolve 
differences through dialogue and peaceful means, in conformity with international law. It 
recalls the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which established a nuclear-free zone in Latin America and 
the Caribbean 45 years ago. The Declaration commits all members of the organization to 
strengthen regional integration with a vision to establish an international order based on the 
human right to peace.62 That vision excludes the use of force and illegitimate means of 
defence, including weapons of mass destruction. This implies the need to negotiate in order 
to reach complete nuclear disarmament and arrive at a significant reduction in the 
production and stockpiling of conventional weapons and trade thereon. The establishment 
of zones of peace and cooperation in an increasing number of regions of the world is to be 
welcomed, as it would carry the commitment of the governments concerned towards a 
significant decrease in military budgets and spending. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Recent studies on the negative impact on economic growth  
of inequality in wealth distribution 
</b></p>
<p>45. In March 2013, the South Centre in Geneva issued a working paper illustrating that 
the fiscal contraction strategy in many countries, as well as specific austerity measures are 
not conducive to socioeconomic recovery or the achievement of development and 
employment goals. Austerity with regard to social services is counterproductive. Austerity 
should instead begin by reducing military spending.63 
</p>
<p>46. In April 2014, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published its <i>World Economic 
Outlook,</i>64 followed by a paper concerning the negative consequences of wealth inequality 
for national and international economic growth.65 The paper argues that, not consistently 
with the Fund&#8217;s traditional position, income inequality can actually lead to slower or less 
sustainable economic growth, while redistribution of income, when measured, does not 
hurt, and may help, the economy. This constitutes a welcome sign of a shift in IMF thinking 
about income disparity. &#8220;It would still be a mistake to focus on growth and let inequality 
take care of itself, not only because inequality may be ethically undesirable but also 
because the resulting growth may be low and unsustainable,&#8221; according to the study.66

<p>policy trends, including negative impacts of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures; 
and calling on States to expand social protection for crisis recovery, inclusive development 
and social justice. The report notes that more than 70 per cent of the world population lacks 
proper social protection. </p>
<p>48. The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) in Geneva 
conducts ongoing projects on a variety of subjects, including transparency and 
accountability in nuclear disarmament, concerning which it is endeavouring to develop a set 
of practical proposals based on the arms control experience of Russia and the United States 
to facilitate universal transparency and accountability in nuclear disarmament.68<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. The Human Rights Council and its universal periodic review 
mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Human Rights Council is an appropriate forum in which to examine the human 
rights commitments of States as reflected in their budgetary priorities. If a State is truly 
committed to the larger concept of human security, which rests on the promotion and 
protection of human rights, it will allocate the budget accordingly, devoting not just a 
minimum of resources to education, health care, housing, infrastructure and the 
administration of justice,69 but a progressively larger proportion thereof. If, however, a 
State practises a &#8220;military-first&#8221; policy and subordinates social services to a perceived 
&#8220;national security&#8221; need, then the Human Rights Council can make sensible 
recommendations on how to shift priorities so as to promote and protect human rights more 
effectively. Thus, a systematic examination of the level of military expenditures by States 
and a comparison with national expenditures in the social sector would be instructive. The 
two following examples from the nineteenth session of the universal periodic review 
illustrate contrasting approaches. 
</p>
<p>50. The draft report of the Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review on the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea takes note of the Government&#8217;s report and its 
explanation with regard to its &#8220;military-first&#8221; policy (<i>Songun</i>), namely that &#8220;safeguarding 
national sovereignty provided a guarantee for the enjoyment by people of their human 
rights.70 The right to life was the foremost issue in guaranteeing human rights and of great 
importance to the people of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, who had been 
exposed, for more than half a century, to persistent military threats by hostile forces. 
Military-first politics served to safeguard national sovereignty and had prevented the 
outbreak of war, making it possible to attain tangible achievements in the economic 
front.&#8221;71 By contrast, the universal periodic review compilation of United Nations 
information on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea quotes the Special Rapporteur 
on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea as expressing concern over the allocation of 
the country&#8217;s resources for the elite and its &#8220;military-first&#8221; policy, to the detriment of the

 Article 26 of the Draft International Bill of Rights provides for increased funding to strengthen the

<p>population.72 In the summary of stakeholders&#8217; information, the Life Fund for North Korean 
Refugees claimed that the nuclear programme of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea was at the expense of basic needs of the population, and urged the Government not 
to divert precious resources to further military development.73 
</p>
<p>51. Many recommendations from the aforementioned report deserve exploring, 
including the recommendations that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea: 
&#8220;undertake profound legal reforms in accordance with international law, legalize and 
support free market activities that provide citizens with a livelihood, and release all 
prisoners detained for exercising private economic activities&#8221; (Germany); &#8220;consider further 
increase in State expenditures on the health sector with a view to meeting the demand for 
medical supplies, including essential drugs&#8221; (Belarus); &#8220;develop and implement more 
substantiated programmes and initiatives for the provision of enhanced level of the rights to 
education and health for all&#8221; (Cuba); &#8220;continue to promote economic, social and cultural 
development to provide better conditions for the enjoyment of all rights by its people&#8221; 
(China); and &#8220;strengthen measures to reinvigorate the national economy including allowing 
more people-to-people contact through engagement in economic, commercial activities, 
including tourism&#8221; (Malaysia).74 Such constructive recommendations show how to convert 
from a military-first to a human security paradigm. 
</p>
<p>52. During the same universal periodic review session, the Council also examined the 
report of Bhutan. The compilation of United Nations information highlights the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) assessment of the high share of public expenditure 
devoted by Bhutan to the social sectors. &#8220;The budget for 2011&#8211;2012 was confirmed as pro-
poor, with about 25 per cent earmarked for the social sector, including 17 per cent for 
education and 7 per cent for health care. In the draft United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework, Bhutan ONE Programme 2014&#8211;2018, it was stated that the 
Bhutanese concept of Gross National Happiness (GNH) promoted a balanced approach to 
development, encompassing good governance, conservation and community vitality, in 
addition to traditional socioeconomic progress indicators, and that that development 
paradigm, prudent economic management and political stability had brought about a 
significant rise in living standards and an improvement in development indicators.&#8221;75 
Besides praise, the draft report of the Working Group also gives practical 
recommendations. Among those are recommendations to: &#8220;attach more attention to job 
creation, especially addressing youth unemployment&#8221; (Turkey); &#8220;continue the programmes 
related to poverty reduction and continue the efforts to create a stronger system of social 
protection&#8221; (Kuwait); &#8220;continue the implementation of a more concrete system of social 
protection, through the initiatives listed in the national report and call on the international 
community to support those national efforts (Cuba)&#8221;; &#8220;remunerate the internship 
programmes and accompany them with technical education training processes with shared 
programmes with the country&#8217;s economic sector (Mexico)&#8221;; &#8220;further consolidate successful 
health programmes that provide medical care that is universal, free and of quality for all 
Bhutanese&#8221; (Venezuela Bolivarian Republic of)).76  
</p><p>53. The above recommendations quoted prove that the universal periodic review 
procedure has the potential to become an excellent forum for promoting an international 
order that is more democratic and equitable, including in the context of fiscal and budget 
priorities, transparency, disarmament and peacemaking.

<p><b> G. Human Rights Council workshop on unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Independent Expert participated in the one-day workshop convened in Geneva 
on 23 May 2014 pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/14. He endorsed the 
pertinent study being conducted by the Advisory Committee, which was presented by 
Advisory Committee member Jean Ziegler. The consensus of the expert meeting was that 
economic sanctions are not &#8220;peaceful&#8221; but a form of violence whose effects are often 
incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>55. Denis Halliday, a former Assistant-Secretary-General, stated that &#8220;in respect of 
unilateral coercive measures, this session needs to establish that all such measures are 
illegal, in violation of the Charter of the United Nations, and recommend complete 
cessation&#8230; [yet] recognizing unilateral measures will be hard to stop, we must find a 
means to demand close monitoring and accountability in respect of those States that 
illegally continue to impose such measures. Perhaps devices such as United Nations 
suspension, loss of General Assembly voting rights, payment of reparations, and payment 
of individual citizen compensation could be considered. Tight monitoring by the Human 
Rights Council would be required, with quarterly reporting to the General Assembly, or to a 
revitalized and operational International Court of Justice.&#8221;77  
</p>
<p>56. The Independent Expert observed that unilateralism and exceptionalism are 
anachronisms under international law, incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Charter 
of the United Nations and with a democratic and equitable international order. Although 
sanctions, in particular unilateral sanctions, are sometimes imposed with spurious human 
rights justifications, they frequently have opposite effects to those intended. Considering 
that many victims of sanctions are not governments but innocent populations, it is 
important to test the legality of sanctions regimes on a case-by-case basis. This can be done 
through the individual complaints procedures established pursuant to several human rights 
treaties, including the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Sanctions regimes should also be reviewed in the context of State reporting 
procedures before the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and under the universal 
periodic review of the Human Rights Council.78 
</p>
<p>57. Experience confirms the futility of trying to coerce States to change their human 
rights performance simply by imposing sanctions, which more often than not are avoided 
by governments and result in injustices vis-&#224;-vis innocent people. What is necessary is to 
persuade States that it is in their own interest to strengthen human rights in law and 
practice, for which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) can provide advisory services and technical assistance. The Independent Expert 
would also like to see the watchdog role of the media enhanced,79 with more attention being 
devoted to the human rights consequences of sanctions regimes. It is the function of the 
media to alert the public about the suffering that sanctions bring to innocent human beings, 
not to sweep it under the rug. In totalitarian States citizen have no voice. In democratic 
countries, however, citizens bear responsibility for the decisions taken by their

 On 13 August 2013, the New York Times published an interview with Edward Snowden in which he

<p>deplored the failure of the media to inform the public. &#8220;After 9/11, many of the most important news 
outlets in America abdicated their role as a check to power &#8211; the journalistic responsibility to

<p><b> H. International Day of Peace and Global Day of Action on Military 
Spending 
</b></p>
<p>58. Since  1981, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 36/67, the United Nations has 
celebrated the International Day of Peace on 21 September.80 In 2011, civil society 
launched the Global Day of Action on Military Spending, which on 14 April 2014 was 
celebrated worldwide by the organization of conferences and other events.81 Since part of 
the problem with regard to military spending has been lack of transparency and 
accountability, heightened awareness on the part of civil society will hopefully persuade 
governments that priorities must be shifted away from military spending and towards 
education and social services. In Geneva the International Peace Bureau convened a panel 
attended by, inter alia, the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations Disarmament 
Conference, a representative of SIPRI and the Independent Expert. There was consensus 
that budgetary decision-making should be open, with the reasons for spending clearly 
outlined so as to be understood by the public. Parliaments should monitor accountability in 
the budget decision process82 and implementation of expenditure, with procurements 
controlled by rigorous procedures and subject to civilian control. Auditing of military 
spending should be regularly carried out, with improper practices investigated and 
prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>59. From 6 to 10 June 2014, the Sarajevo Peace Event was attended by some 2,500 
participants from 32 countries, who demanded an end to war and the threat of war. 
Probably the largest peace event in 2014, that civil society gathering included more than 
190 workshops and cultural events as well as a youth camp in Sarajevo. As Nobel laureate 
Mairead Maguire said, &#8220;Let Sarajevo, where peace ended, be the starting point for the bold 
beginning of a universal call for peace through the wholesale abolition of militarism.&#8221; 
Again the importance of the UNESCO Culture of Peace programme as an alternative to war 
and militarization was emphasized.83 At the Peace Event it was announced that the Global 
Day of Action on Military Spending is now to become a year-round campaign.

<p><b> I. Brussels Declaration

conference was held at the European Parliament on 18 and 19 October to discuss the 
enhanced participation of citizens in domestic and global decision-making, including on 
national priorities and military spending. The Independent Expert was invited in view of 
operative paragraph 6 of Human Rights Council resolution 18/6, which stipulates that a 
democratic and equitable international order requires: &#8220;(<i>g</i>) The promotion and

<p>equitable participation of all, without any discrimination, in domestic and global decision-
making.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>61. Human Rights Council resolution 24/8 on the right to equal political participation 
was also discussed, as well as working papers on the right to public participation prepared 
by the Danish Institute for Human Rights (see annex VI).84 The Independent Expert argued 
that the right of public participation is not a vague promise, but actually has a solid legal 
basis in universal, regional and national legislation as well as in case-law. Participation is a 
hallmark of democratic governance, entailing a measure of timely consultation so as to 
legitimize the exercise of governmental power 
</p>
<p>62. Among the Independent Expert&#8217;s recommendations was that a study be conducted 
by the Human Rights Council on how the establishment of a World Parliamentary 
Assembly could significantly advance the goal of making a democratic transition from 
military-first to human security budgets and helping to realize an international order that is 
more democratic and more equitable.85 At the end of the conference, the Brussels 
Declaration was adopted (see annex V). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Bearing in mind that peace is indispensable to achieving a democratic and 
equitable international order, every effort must be undertaken to settle disputes 
through peaceful means, to prevent armed conflict and to end ongoing wars. 
Disarmament and demilitarization are keys to development and human security. Both 
must be democratically decided and implemented. This requires an enduring 
consciousness of the threat of nuclear annihilation, and enhanced awareness of the 
waste of resources. Reduced military budgets will release funds for the promotion and 
protection of human rights and for addressing global problems such as pandemics, 
climate change, deforestation and acute water shortages. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>For decades civil society has demanded the recognition of peace as a human 
right. The Human Rights Council has heard that call and its open-ended 
intergovernmental working group on a draft United Nations declaration on the right 
to peace has been carrying out important work on a draft declaration for adoption by 
the Council and the United Nations General Assembly. The draft is supported by civil 
society organizations, including PEN International, which adopted the Bled Manifesto 
of the Writers for Peace Committee (see annex IV) in September 2013.  
</b>65. <b>A democratic and equitable international order requires a comprehensive shift 
in priorities and a strategy for achieving human security through enhanced public 
participation in decision-making, in particular in the determination of domestic and 
international policy, including in budgetary matters. This entails more than a culture 
of transparency. States should proactively educate and inform their populations so 
that they can meaningfully exercise their democratic right of shaping policy and 
choosing among options. States should consult the electorate on budget priorities, 
including military expenditures, which must not be accepted as permanent features of

<p><b>government, nor shrouded in secrecy, nor justified on grounds of &#8220;national security&#8221;. 
Civil society rejects fear-mongering and sabre-rattling. Only through resolute political 
will can the dynamics of the military-industrial complex be countered, the demands of 
which on the public purse lack democratic legitimacy and whose success relies on 
undemocratic lobbying activities. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Sustainable solutions to both the international financial crisis and the 
dislocated economies of many countries lie in part in the recognition that military 
budgets are woefully inflated and must be downsized, that large armies and nuclear 
arsenals are anachronisms. Civil society demands transparency, accountability and 
most importantly the right to effective participation in setting budgetary priorities, 
which must not be left in the hands of defence contractors and corporate lobbyists.</b>86<b> A 
significant downsizing of military budgets should result in the creation of jobs 
elsewhere &#8211; not for the production of more consumer goods, since people can consume 
only so much, but in social services, education, food security, clean water, health care, 
infrastructures, research into sustainable sources of energy and the control of 
pandemics. Austerity is necessary in the military &#8211; not in the progressive achievement 
of economic, social and cultural rights. Retrogression in the latter field entails 
violations of articles 2 and 5 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>As in his 2013 report, the Independent Expert is honoured to put forward a few 
pragmatic recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations to States 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>States should regularly report to the Human Rights Council on their military 
expenditures and contrast them with expenditures for education, health care, the 
administration of justice, etc. States should ensure that such expenditures are 
discussed within the framework of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s universal periodic 
review mechanism and governments should be persuaded to devote a greater 
percentage of their budgets to the promotion of civil, cultural, economic, political and 
social rights, and to make concrete proposals to convert from a military-first to a 
human security paradigm. Military expenditures incurred by States in conflict zones 
and internationally disputed territories that give rise to confiscation of territory and

respond to the global climate change challenge, as envisaged by the United Nations in 
establishing the Green Climate Fund established by the United Nations pursuant to 
the Framework Convention on Climate Change.</b>89 <b>Furthermore, a portion of the

<p>74. <b>Parliamentarians should regularly inform, and consult with, their constituents, 
particularly on matters of fiscal and budget priorities. They should resist the pressure 
of vested interests, and the lobbies of defence contractors and others belonging to the 
military-industrial complex.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Parliamentarians should put in place specialized and well-resourced cross-
party parliamentary defence committees with competence to oversee military 
spending and ferret out diversion, corruption and waste. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Parliaments should organize training programmes for parliamentarians to 
assist them with the complexities of military budgets and with assessing the risks of 
diversion and corruption.

<p>77. <b>Parliaments should develop interparliamentary capacity-building and 
cooperation programmes to strengthen oversight functions in young democracies at 
bilateral and multilateral levels. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Parliaments should counter lobbyists who engage in undemocratic influence on 
behalf of the military-industrial complex. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Recommendations to civil society and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Civil society and national human rights institutions should demand public 
participation in defence policy and procurement and public participation in national 
budgeting, supporting the reallocation of military spending to meet urgent

<p>86. <b>The Council may consider tasking an existing mandate holder to focus on 
worldwide military expenditures and to report every year to the Council and to the 
General Assembly on trends and options.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Under the universal periodic review procedure, the conduct of States should be 
reviewed with regard to unilateral and multilateral coercive measures that result in 
grave violations of the human rights of the affected populations.

<p>88. <b>The Council may consider assigning to an existing mandate holder the task of

prohibition of war propaganda stipulated in article 20, paragraph 1, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b>91<b>

leading to greater consciousness about the need to work together for a peaceful, just 
and equitable world order. He welcomes contact with stakeholders from all related 
fields and looks forward to engaging with them in the upcoming reporting year.

<p>90. <b>By way of conclusion, the Independent Expert would like to reiterate his 
expression of appreciation to the hard-working OHCHR staff, and request the 
General Assembly to give increased resources to that secretariat, which actually 
makes a difference in the lives of many people. He would like to quote from a 
favourite poet, Walt Whitman: &#8220;the greatest country, the richest country, is not that

<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><b>  PEN International Bled Manifesto of the Writers for Peace 
Committee (full text)</b> <b> 
</b> PEN International, the world&#8217;s leading association of writers, promotes a culture of 
peace based on freedom of expression, dialogue, and exchange. PEN is dedicated to 
linguistic and cultural diversity and to the vibrancy of languages and their cultures whether 
spoken by many or few. PEN International&#8217;s Writers for Peace Committee has therefore 
approved this Manifesto calling for the universal right to peace, based on the Lugano 
Declaration for Peace and Freedom (1987), the Appeal of Linz Protesting Against the 
Degradation of the Environment (2009) and the Belgrade Declaration (2011). It was 
adopted by the Assembly of Delegates at the 79th PEN International Congress in Reykjavik 
(September 2013). 
 Bled Manifesto of the Writers for Peace Committee: 
</p>
<p>(a) All individuals and peoples have a right to peace and this right should be 
recognized by the United Nations as a universal human right. 
</p>
<p>(b) PEN promotes discussion and dialogue between writers from countries in 
conflict and across regions of the world where wounds are open and political will is unable 
to address tensions. 
</p>
<p>(c) PEN seeks to bring together people from around the world through literature 
and discussion amongst writers and with the broad public. 
</p>
<p>(d) PEN considers one of the world&#8217;s greatest challenges to be the transition 
from violence to debate, discussion and dialogue. We aim to be active participants in this 
process promoting where necessary the principles of international law. 
</p>
<p>(e) In order to achieve the conditions for peace, freedom of expression and 
creativity in all its forms must be respected and protected as a fundamental right so long as 
it respects all other basic human rights in accordance with the principles of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>(f) PEN acknowledges that it is of primary importance to be permanently 
committed to creating conditions that can lead to ending conflicts of all kinds. There is 
neither freedom without peace, nor peace without freedom; social and political justice is 
inaccessible without peace and freedom. 
</p>
<p>(g) In order to achieve sustainable conditions for peace, PEN calls for the respect 
of the environment in conformity with the Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development (1992). We condemn the excesses of technology and financial speculation 
that contribute to the impoverishment of a large part of the world&#8217;s population. 
</p>
<p>(h) PEN respects and defends the dignity of all human beings. PEN opposes 
injustice and violence wherever they are found, including oppression, colonisation, illegal 
occupation and terrorism. 
</p>
<p>(i) In accordance with the principles of freedom of expression and justice, every 
individual or group involved in conflict has the right to demand non-violent solutions to 
conflict and should be free to petition and appeal to international institutions and 
government authorities. </p>


<p>(j) All children have the right to receive a comprehensive peace and human 
rights education. PEN promotes the implementation of this right.  </p>

<p><b>  Declaration of Brussels: Toward a democratic and equitable 
international order, 16/17 October 2013 (full text) 
</b> Recalling and affirming: 
</p>
<p>(a) the &#8220;Appeal for the Establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United 
Nations&#8221; of April 2007,  
</p>
<p>(b) the &#8220;Conclusions regarding policies of the Campaign for a UN Parliamentary

<p>(d) the &#8220;Call for global democratic oversight of international financial and 
economic institutions&#8221; of April 2009, and  
</p>
<p>(e) the &#8220;Declaration of Buenos Aires&#8221; of October 2010,  
 We, the participants in the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations 
Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA), reiterate our joint appeal to the United Nations and its 
member states to advance the necessary processes for the establishment of a Parliamentary 
Assembly at the United Nations. 
</p>
<p> We express our concern that in the intergovernmental realm no adequate measures 
have been taken to address the democratic deficit of global governance in general and of the 
United Nations in particular. 
</p>
<p> We reiterate our view that a UNPA is a vital component to strengthen democratic 
participation in and the democratic legitimacy of the United Nations as well as other 
intergovernmental organizations such as the World Bank Group, the International Monetary 
Fund, and the World Trade Organization. 
</p>
<p> A UNPA would enable citizen representatives, i.e. elected parliamentarians, to be 
directly involved in global political deliberations, agenda-setting, and decision-making, in a 
formalized and institutionalized manner.  
</p>
<p> Global problems require global solutions. The daily lives of the world&#8217;s citizens are 
increasingly shaped by economic, social and political forces that transcend national 
boundaries and demonstrate a growing need for more inclusive, effective and transparent 
global governance. 
</p>
<p> The universality of human rights and the necessity of a democratic basis for 
legitimate governance are widely acknowledged. Yet, far too many people are denied their 
human rights and democratic participation. We are convinced that a UNPA as a global 
democratic body of elected representatives would strengthen the practice of democratic 
governance and fulfillment of human rights regionally, nationally and locally. Conversely, 
we believe that excluding democratic principles and participation from global governance 
undermines democracy at the regional, national, and local levels. 
</p>
<p> We emphasize our conviction that a UNPA needs to be inclusive and open for 
participation of parliamentarians of all UN member states and observer states. We 
acknowledge that ensuring the democratic character of a UNPA presents challenges. We 
are convinced that these challenges can be overcome, and that with political will a </p>


<p>parliamentary assembly for the United Nations can be constructed in a manner that is both 
representative and legitimate.  
</p>
<p> We welcome the decision of the UN&#8217;s Human Rights Council to mandate an 
Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order, 
and encourage the Independent Expert to keep considering the question of a UNPA and in 
particular to examine possible processes towards its creation. 
</p>
<p> We welcome the recent and ongoing broad-based consultations among a wide range 
of governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders, to develop a global consensus on the 
Post-2015 Development Agenda. We feel encouraged that these consultations have 
emphasized (1) the importance of a &#8220;rights-based&#8221; approach to sustainable development; 
and (2) the necessity of a comprehensive, global approach, to address poverty and 
inequality in all countries. 
</p>
<p> The UN High Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development 
Agenda recently noted that achieving the post-2015 vision will require &#8220;reshaped and 
revitalized global governance partnerships&#8221; to ensure that &#8220;the United Nations, multilateral 
systems, and all development actors effectively support the post-2015 development 
agenda.&#8221; Indeed, we observe that sustaining a multi-stakeholder consensus for shared 
global goals is one of the key functions that a UNPA would be expected to provide. 
</p>
<p> To maintain political support, to reinforce accountability and to bring global 
governance in the pursuit of post-2015 development goals closer to those directly affected, 
we encourage the creation of a UNPA when the international community adopts its Post-
2015 Development Agenda. 
</p>
<p> A UNPA is a global parliamentary body that includes distinctive innovative features 
that go beyond the characteristics of existing national and regional assemblies and 
parliaments. Acting as an institutionalized &#8220;network of networks&#8221;, a UNPA could allow 
representatives of existing parliamentary networks and institutions to formally participate in 
its work, thus providing them with more leverage and influence. Consideration should be 
given to the possibility of involving local authorities and representatives of indigenous 
peoples and nations in the activities of a UNPA. 
</p>
<p> We affirm that a UNPA can and should evolve gradually. Eventually members of a 
UNPA should be directly elected. From the UNPA&#8217;s inception its statutes should allow 
participating states to opt for direct elections of their delegates if they wish to do so.  
</p>
<p> With a view to exploring innovative forms of civic participation in a UNPA, 
implementing models of electronic direct or &#8220;liquid&#8221; democracy that allow citizens to 
participate in deliberations or to influence decision-making processes could be considered. 
</p>
<p> We congratulate the European Parliament on its pioneering role in promoting the 
establishment of a UNPA, dating back to resolution A3-0331/93 adopted in 1994, and most 
recently expressed in resolution P7_TA 0255 of 2011, which called on the EU Council to 
introduce the establishment of a UNPA into the proceedings of the UN General Assembly.  
</p>
<p> We call on the European Parliament and its members as well as on all other 
parliaments and their members to reinforce their commitment to more democratic global 
governance through continued support for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly.  </p>


<p><b>Annex VI 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Danish Institute of Human Rights submission on 
participation</b>93<b> 
</b></p>
<p> Public participation as a human right is a process through which individuals and 
groups have an opportunity to influence public decisions. This constitutes the basis of 
democratic governance and a key to the promotion and protection of human rights. It is 
recognized as fundamental for the legitimacy and authority of government and a crucial 
element for the quality, inclusiveness and sustainability of decision making processes.  
</p>
<p> From a human rights perspective, the ability of the individual to shape their lives 
and participate in the realization of human rights is inherent in human dignity. The principle 
that the authority of government should be the will of the people is also widely recognized.  
</p>
<p> The right to participate is rooted in Art 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, which recognizes the rights of every citizen to take part in the conduct of 
public affairs, the right to vote and the right to have access to public service. 
</p>
<p> Under the provisions of the Covenant, states are required to ensure that citizens have 
an effective opportunity to enjoy this right, including by initiative of the state being actively 
involved in public decision-making processes (working groups, observation groups, 
commissions), and to be given space to voice their opinions. 
 The right to participate in the conduct of public affairs is a composite right and is not 
limited to or fulfilled by merely organizing periodic free elections. Additionally, the right is 
equally not limited to instances where individuals participate directly in the conduct of 
public affairs as members of the legislative or executive branches; or indirectly, through 
freely chosen representatives. Individuals also take part in the conduct of public affairs by 
exerting influence through public debate and dialogue with their representatives, or through 
their capacity to organize themselves. This participation is supported by ensuring freedom 
of expression (including the right to access to information), assembly and association. 
 Taking part in public affairs also goes beyond mere political activities. People may 
seek influence in many other ways; therefore the three freedoms mentioned above are 
fundamental to all public participation. The close link between these three and democratic 
governance is recognized in a number of international documents. 
</p>
<p> The right to participate in public affairs has been standardized in the sphere of civil 
and political rights, but details on the quality and conduct of the participatory process have 
been elaborated mostly in the sphere of economic, social and cultural rights (environment, 
housing, education, health etc), and in relation to certain groups requiring specific attention, 
such as women, children, persons with disabilities, migrants, indigenous peoples and 
persons belonging to minorities, among others. 
</p>
<p> Traditionally, human rights law has taken a somewhat narrow approach to the right 
to participation, which is also reflected in the current general comment No. 25 of the 
Human Rights Committee on Art 25 of the ICCPR. Under this narrow approach, the right 
to participate does not imply a general right to be heard, and even participation itself is a 
right which does not belong to everyone in every situation.

 Submission for a side-event to the Human Rights Council on 11 June 2014, partly based on input 
</p>
<p>from the Independent Expert, who participated in the Copenhagen workshops in September 2013 and 
March 2014. </p>


<p> However, during the 18 years since the adoption of the general comment, human 
rights law has started to gradually move beyond the above described narrow interpretations 
of the right to participation. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
as well as a number of other treaty bodies, have adopted general comments pointing to 
governments&#8217; responsibility to inform and hear the opinions of groups affected by political 
decisions on, among other things, water and sanitation, adequate food and eviction from 
houses. Other examples of expansion of consultation rights can be seen in relation to the 
rights of certain group requiring particular attention. 
</p>
<p> Additionally, new human rights instruments have adopted hitherto unprecedented 
obligations on States parties to consult with certain groups or with regard to particular 
issues. In particular, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has adopted 
unprecedented obligations on States parties to consult with representatives of people with 
disabilities in the monitoring mechanisms of the convention. 
</p>
<p> We are witnessing similar expansion in the understanding of the scope and content 
of the right at the national, regional and international level as well. At the international level 
states are increasingly called upon to consult with relevant segments of the society before 
submitting information to UN human rights bodies and to include them in follow-up 
activities on recommendations stemming from these bodies.  
</p>
<p> While there has been increased recognition of the importance of the right, this has 
not been reflected in a corresponding level of international elaboration and standardization 
of what the rights and obligations entail or what quality of participation is required and how 
it should be enforced. This should establish the duty of states to ensure consultation in the 
development, implementation and monitoring of public legislation, policy, programmes and 
projects and also that this should involve everyone and not only citizens as is the case when 
exercising participation in relation to elections. 
</p>
<p> The increasing importance attributed to participation as a key principle has spawned 
growing interest in defining the extent to which states should open up to wider dialogue 
with the general public. The quality and nature of such participatory and consultation 
processes has not yet been addressed in an international human rights document that is 
generally applicable. Additionally, accountability mechanisms for the conduct and outcome 
of participatory processes are either weak or non-existent, or only relate to a very narrow 
segment of the process (right to access to information).  
 The challenge therefore is manifold. It is crucially important to raise awareness 
among governments and members of the general public of the current understanding and 
interpretation of the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs. Equally important is 
to attempt to arrive to a coherent understanding and interpretation of the right to 
participation and to fill the concept with content that is generally applicable and can be used 
as a tool by communities and relevant authorities at the local, national, regional and 
international levels. 
</p>
<p> The aim is to ensure that participation is recognized as a right at all relevant levels 
and to design more informed, effective and legitimate public participation processes with a 
strong evaluation and accountability component. There is also a need for new approaches 
that emphasize two-way interaction between decision-makers and the public as well as 
deliberation among participants. Lastly, enforcement mechanisms should be defined in 
order to ensure the implementation of the right at all relevant levels. </p>

<p><b>Annex IX 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allocation of income tax dollars 2013 (United States of 
America)</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;[&#8230;] This imbalanced spending has consequences: cuts in programs that help give 
people ladders out of poverty, as well as missed opportunities to prevent war and address 
climate change. The Pentagon budget still accounts for 40 cents of every tax dollar the U.S. 
Government spends.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Friends Committee on National Legislation explanation of USA Government spending: 
</p>
<p> (a) &#8220;For current and past wars: 40% 
 This includes the Pentagon budget and related programs with a military function, 
such as nuclear weapons production in the department of energy, and foreign military 
assistance (28%); interest on the federal debt accumulated from past Pentagon spending 
(7%); and care and benefits for veterans plus other costs and obligations from past wars 
(5%). 
 (b) For general government operations: 11% 
 This includes interest on the rest of the federal debt &#8211; the part that is not attributable 
to past military spending (10%) &#8211; and other government operations such as Congress, the 
judiciary, most of the department of homeland security, the IRS, treasury, etc. (1%) 
 (c) For health care, health care financing and health research: 23% 
 This includes Medicaid, public health programs, Indian health, the national institutes 
of health and the centers for disease control. (Most of the money for Medicare comes from 
a dedicated payroll tax, not from income taxes, so the Medicare trust fund, with its separate 
income, is not considered part of the &#8220;federal funds budget&#8221; and is not included here.) </p>


<p> (d) Energy, science and the environment: 3% 
 Includes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, National Science 
Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, most of the Department of the Interior, plus the Forest 
Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
</p>
<p> (e) To assist low income households: 16% 
 This category includes programs such as housing, income, education, and food 
assistance that are available to people who meet certain income guidelines. Some help to 
alleviate poverty (food assistance, income supplements) while others provide a firm 
foundation and ladders out of poverty (such as housing, health care and education.) 
 (f) Development, diplomacy and war prevention: 2% 
 This tiniest category includes funding for all the ways we relate to the rest of the 
world that do not engage our military capacities &#8211; the entire State Department, including the 
diplomatic corps and the agency for international development, support for the United 
Nations and other international institutions and non-military aid to other countries.&#8221;95
