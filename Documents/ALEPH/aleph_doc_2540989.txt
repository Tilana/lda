TORONTO,  ONTARIO  --  (Marketwired  –  September  16,  2015)  -  Lake  Shore  Gold  Corp.
(TSX:LSG) (NYSE MKT:LSG) ("Lake Shore Gold" or the "Company") today announced results
from  the  first  ten  underground  drill  holes  (4,771  metres)  from  the  Company’s  144  Exploration
Program. Results being reported today are for the first seven delineation holes (1,740 metres) on
the 144 Gap Zone as well as three exploration holes (3,031 metres) to test the Thunder Creek
Stock to the east, from an overall 40,000 metre program planned for 2015. The 144 Gap Zone is
a  new  discovery  announced  in  October,  2014  and  is  located  500  metres  southwest  of  the
Timmins  West  Mine  and  Thunder  Creek  Deposit.  The  current  underground  drill  program  was
launched  in  August,  2015  and  is  being  completed  from  a  new  underground  exploration  drift
developed near the 820 Level (see Figure 1).
 
Tony  Makuch,  President  and  CEO  of  Lake  Shore  Gold,  commented:  “We  are  very  pleased  to
announce the successful start of our underground drilling program at the 144 Gap area and to
report positive results from the first 10 holes of the program. Drilling to date has been focused on
delineation and exploration near the east limit of the broad mineralized envelope defined from
surface  drilling  and  indicates  multiple  high-grade  zones  which  are  similar  to,  or  better  than,
previous  surface  holes  from  the  same  area.  Given  the  encouraging  results  being  announced
today,  we  are  increasingly  confident  of  the  resource  potential  of  the  144  Gap  and  the  very
positive  impact  it  could  have  on  our  Timmins  operations.  Today’s  results  are  especially
significant given that they are located approximately 250 metres northeast of the initial discovery
holes for the 144 Gap Zone and the previously defined thick, high-grade core. Delineation drilling
of these areas will follow later in the underground program.”
 
Among  significant  results  from  delineation  drilling  to  date  (see  Table  1.)  are 7.81  gpt/10.40
metres  (“m”),  6.29  gpt/36.80  m and  7.83  gpt/18.80  m from  HW820-004,  5.29  gpt/31.80  m,
including  11.44  gpt/11.90  m, from  HW820-005,  10.97  gpt/14.40  m from HW820-006 and  4.51
gpt/12.90 m and 4.05 gpt/24.50 m from HW820-008 drilled on section 8875N, near the east limit
of  the  broad  mineralized  envelope  defined  from  previous  surface  drilling.  The  new  holes
intersected the 144 Gap Zone between the 800 and 900 Levels and close to previously reported
surface  holes  Hwy-15-79  and  Hwy-15-88.  Comparison  of  the  new  results  to  previous  surface
holes indicates grades and widths which are similar or better (see press releases dated February
24 and April 27, 2015).
Additional  significant  results  from  delineation  drilling  are 5.35  gpt/12.0  m,  including 11.16
gpt/4.30 m from HW820-009 and 8.16 gpt/10.30 m, including 11.48 gpt/4.10 m from HW820-012
drilled  on  section  8825N.  The  new  holes  intersected  the  144  Gap  Zone  and  are  close  to
previously reported surface hole Hwy-15-89, with grades and widths which compare favourably
(see press release dated April 27, 2015).
 
Interpretation of new drill results from the 144 Gap Zone continues to suggest the zone is closely
associated with a broad zone of hydrothermal alteration and deformation measuring up to 100 m
wide  containing  multiple  syenite  porphyry  intrusions,  quartz  veining,  pyrite,  scheelite  and/or
galena and multiple occurrences of visible gold. Based on results received to date, the 144 Gap
Zone is confirmed to have a minimum strike length of 400 m and dip length of 400 m.
 
Additional results being reported today include three widely-spaced exploration holes (HW820-
001,002 and 003) drilled within a 500 metre gap between Thunder Creek and the 144 Gap Zone.
The three holes were drilled to test the down dip extension of the Thunder Creek Stock, a large
intrusive  body  located  east  of  the  144  Gap.  The  new  holes,  which  were  collared  on  sections
9200N and 9325N, extend the lower limit of the Thunder Creek Stock to at least the 840 metre
level  and  indicate  several  local  zones  of  gold  enrichment  providing  new  targets  for  future
exploration.
 
Work on the 144 Exploration Program is continuing. At the 144 Gap, three underground drills are
active  with  the  Company’s  40,000  m  underground  program  on  track  for      Drilling  is  currently
ongoing at the 144 with three underground drills and on track to completion prior to the end of
2015 with an initial 43-101 resource to be released early in 2016. Drilling is also continuing on
surface with five drill rigs focused on testing of new exploration targets to the southwest of the
144 Gap zone.
 
Qualified Person
 
The Qualified Person (“QP”) for Lake Shore Gold’s drill program at the 144 is Eric Kallio, Senior
Vice-President  Exploration,  P.Geo.  Mr.  Kallio,  as  a  QP,  has  prepared  or  supervised  the
preparation  of  the  scientific  or  technical  information  for  the  property  and  verified  the  data
disclosed in this press release. Mr. Kallio is an employee of Lake Shore Gold.
 
Quality Control
 
Lake  Shore  Gold  has  implemented  a  quality-control  program  to  ensure  best  practice  in  the
sampling and analysis of the drill core. Assays have been completed using a standard fire assay
with a 30-gram aliquot. For samples that return a value greater than 10 grams per tonne gold, the
sample is fire assayed with a gravimetric finish.  Select zones with visible gold are tested by pulp
metallic  analysis.  NQ  size  surface  drill  core  is  saw  cut  and  half  the  drill  core  is  sampled  in
standard  intervals.  The  remaining  half  of  the  core  is  stored  in  a  secure  location.  BQ  size
underground drill core is either saw cut or whole core sampled. The drill core is transported in
security sealed bags for preparation to the ALS Minerals analytical facility located in Val d’Or
Quebec for fire assay.  This ALS Minerals facility is registered ISO 9001-2008 (CERT-0051527)
and is SCC ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Accredited (#689). Most underground drill core is analyzed by
Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) in Timmins, Ontario.  Actlabs is an ISO/IEC 17025:2005
Accredited laboratory.
