4 We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for beneﬁts of the Thriﬂ Plan for
Employees of Murphy Oil Corporation (the Plan) as of December 31, 201 1 and 2010, and the related
statement of changes in net assets available for beneﬁts for the year ended December 31, 20111 These
7 ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the Plan’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these ﬁnancial statemean based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
* Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement The Plan is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
. .. Our audits included consideration of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as a basis for designing
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Plan’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion, Our audits also included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
m amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
signiﬁcant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion1 the ﬁnancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the net
assets available for beneﬁts of the Plan as of December 31. 201 l and 2010, and the changes in net assets
__ available for beneﬁts for the year ended December 31, 201 1, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic ﬁnancial statements taken as
- a whole. The accompanying supplementary information as listed in the table of contents is not a required
part of the basic ﬁnancial statements, but is supplementary information required by the Department of
Labor’s Rules and Regmlations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income
.3, Security Act of 1974, The supplemental information is the responsibility of the Plan’s management.
Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic ﬁnancial
statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic ﬁnancial
statements taken as a whole,

The accompanying ﬁnancial statements of the Thriﬁ Plan for Employees of Murphy Oil Corporation [the
A Plan] have been prepared on the accrual basis and present the net assets available for beneﬁts to
participants in the Plan and changes in net assets available for beneﬁts. These statements present the
Plan’s investments as a beneﬁcial interest in the Master Tmst (see Note 2). Beneﬁts are recorded when
i paid. The Plan has made estimates in preparing the accompanying ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could

store managers for initial investment in the Murphy Stock Fund (see Note 3). A vested
participant may redirect this investment to the other options described in Note 3. Participation in

7 this account became frozen as of September 1, 2003. Employees eligible to receive Company

discretionary contributions as of September 1, 2003 continued to receive such contributions aﬁer
this date until their ﬁlll entitlement was contributed. The last Company discretionary

,4 Each participant’s account is credited with the participant’s contribution and allocations of (a) the
Company’s contribution and ([7) Plan earnings, and charged with an allocation of administrative
expenses. Allocations are based on participant earnings or account balances, as deﬁned. The beneﬁt to

I which a participant is entitled is the beneﬁt that can be provided from the participant’s vested account.

As of January 1, 2008 all active participants became immediately vested in all Company contributions.
Any amounts contributed by the Companies that are forfeited by participants in accordance with

“ provisions of the Plan are applied to reduce subsequent contributions by the Companies.

A vested participant who enrolled prior to January 1, 2008 may un'thdraw from the Matching Employer

 Contribution (“Matching Employer”) Account either totally or partially (limited to at least 10%, but no
less than $250, or any higher multiple of 5% up to 50% of the account balance) once every 24 months
or at any time after reaching age 59‘/z. Any participant enrolled aﬁer December 31, 2007 can only

- withdraw from the Matching Employer Account aﬁer reaching age 59%.

A withdrawal from either a Salary Deferral Account or Catch-up Contribution Account is not permissible

4 except upon a finding that a hardship exists as deﬁned by federal tax regulations, upon the attainment
of age 59% or upon termination. Aﬂer a hardship withdrawal from a Salary Deferral Account,
participation in the Salary Deferral Account and Matching Employer Contribution Account is

_ suspended for 6 months A withdrawal from a Rollover Account is permitted at any time without any
penalty or suspension.

” Withdrawals from Employee Contribution Accounts or Deductible Contribution Accounts must be at
least $250 and may not be made until at least 12 months alter the most recent such withdrawal. No
participation penalty is applied to such a withdrawal.

3' A withdrawal from a Minimum 401(k) Contribution Account is not permissible except upon termination.

A vested participant may withdraw from a Discretionary Employer Contribution Account under

” guidelines established by the Committee that are uniformly applicable to all participants.

_ 7


Thrift Plan for Employees of Murphy Oil Corporation
e Notes to Financial Statements (Contd.)
Any taxable income distributed to a participant may be subject to a 10% penalty tax under the Tax
y Reform Act of 1986. A $20 fee is charged for an in-service nonhardship withdrawal.
A vested in-service participant may borrow a minimum of $500 and a maximum equal to the lesser of
T (a) $50,000 less the highest outstanding loan balance(s) in the last twelve months or (b) 50% of their
vested account balance. A participant may have one general-pmpose loan and one residential loan
# outstanding at any one time. A residential loan must be approved by the Committee. The term of each
loan will be in whole years, with maximums of ﬁve years for a general-purpose loan and 15 years for a
residential loan. Loan repayments, including interest at the prime rate as of the beginning of the loan
 period, are made into the participant’s account through aﬁer—tax payroll deductions. Each loan has a
$35 initiation fee and a $15 annual maintenance fee. Interest rates on outstanding loans at
December 31, 2011 range from 3.25% to 9.5%.
Upon retirement, disability, or death of a participant, the participant or his/her designated beneﬁciary has
the option to receive settlement in a lump sum or installment payments over a period of time not to
’ exceed the aetuarial life of the participant.
Obligation for Contributions to the Plan
The Companies have voluntarily agreed to make contributions to the Plan based on each participant’s
allotments to the Salary Deferral Account subject to a maximum of 6% of the participant’s regular
"' earnings including overtime. Although the Companies have not expressed any intent to terminate the
Plan, they may do so at any time.
ﬂ Voting Rights
“ Each participant is entitled to exercise voting rights attributable to the shares of the Murphy Oil
Corporation common stock and Deltic Timber Corporation common stock allocated to his or her
account and is notiﬁed by the trustee prior to the time that such rights are to be exercised. The trustee
H is not permitted to vote any shares for which instructions have not been given by the participant.
Administrative Expenses
w Murphy pays certain costs of Plan administration. Trustee fees and related expenses will be paid by
either the Plan or by participants’ fees.
Change in Accounting Principle
- During 2010, the provisions ofASU 2010~25, Reporting Loans to Participants by Deﬁned Contribution
Pension Plans (ASU 2010-25), became effective. Tire ASU requires loans to participants to be
reported as Participant Loans Receivable at unpaid principal plus accrued but unpaid interest, instead of
m“ being reported as a part of investments at fair value as they were under previous guidance. Because the
Plan reports a beneﬁcial interest in the assets of the master trust and in investment income from those
assets, the provisions of ASU 2010-25 had no effect on presentation in the Statements of Net Assets
" Available for Benefits or Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits. The effect of the provisions of
ASU 2010-25 was not considered material to the Plan’s ﬁnancial statements.

Thrift Plan for Employees of Murphy Oil Corporation
'7 Notes to Financial Statements (Contd.)
Basis of Accounting
Investment contracts held by a deﬁned contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value.
However, contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available
v for beneﬁts of a deﬁned contribution plan attributable to fully beneﬁt-responsive investment contracts,
because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted
H transactions under the terms of the Plan. The Statement of Net Assets Available for Beneﬁts presents
the fair value of the investment contracts, as well as the adjustment of the fully beneﬁt-responsive
investment contracts from fair value to contract value relating to the investment contracts. The
, Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Beneﬁts is prepared on a contract value basis.
 2. Master Trust Net Assets
The assets of the Plan are commingled in a Master Trust with the assets of two other plans sponsored by
/ Murphy. Fidelity Management Trust Company [FMTC], Boston, Massachusetts, is the Trustee. The
Master Trust had no nonparticipant-directed investments related to the Plan.
M On September 30, 2011, the Company sold its Superior, Wisconsin reﬁnery. The associated Thrift Plan
for Employees of Murphy Cl] USA, Inc. Represented by International Union of Operating Engineers,
AFL-CIO, Local No. 317, was transferred to the new owner of the Superior refinery Subsequent to the
“ sale, plan assets are administered and reported on by the new owner.
On October 1, 2011, the Company sold its Meraux, Louisiana reﬁnery. The Company continues to
w administer and report on the Thrift Plan for Employees of Murphy Oil USA, Inc. Represented by
United Steelworkers, AFL-CIO, Local No. 8363, although subsequent to the sale, no additional
_ contributions are accepted into the Plan.

Thiiﬁ Plan for Employees of Murphy Oil Corporation

r Notes to Financial Statements (Contd.)

The Plan invests in a beneﬁt-responsive investment contract with FMTC. FMTC maintains the

re contributions in a general account. The account is credited with earnings on the underlying investments
and charged for participant withdrawals and administrative expenses. The guaranteed investment
contract issuer is contractually obligated to repay the principal and a speciﬁed interest rate guaranteed

a to the Plan. As described in Note 1, because the guaranteed investment contract is fully beneﬁt-
responsive, contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets
available for beneﬁts attributable to the graranteed investment contract. Contract value, as reported to

g the Plan by FMTC, represents contributions made under the contract, plus eamings, less participant
withdrawals and administrative expenses. Participants may ordinarily direct the withdrawal or transfer
of all or a portion of their investment at contract value. There are no reserves against contract value for

_‘ credit risk of the contract issuer or otherwise.

The guaranteed investment contract does not permit the insurance companies or financial institutions to
terminate the agreement prior to the scheduled maturity date.
m M
Average yield of guaranteed investment contract:
~ Based on actual earnings 1.52% 1.47%
Based on interest rate credited to participants 1.58% 1.70%

w With respect to the Murphy Stock Fund and Deltic Stock Fund, FMTC has arranged to utilize a line of
credit to facilitate the purchase activity in the event that trading transactions on any given day exceed
the cash position of the stock fund. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there was no outstanding balance

_ related to this line of credit.

5. Risk and Uncertainties
The Plan, through its investment in the Master Trust, provides for investment in various investment
securities. Investment securities, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit,

“ and overall market volatility risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment
securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the

W near term.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Master Trust had signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk in the

W Managed Income Portfolio 1] (MIP II), the Fidelity Fund, the Pimco Total Return Fund and the Fidelity
Balanced Fund. MIP His a common/collective trust sponsored by FMTC. The Fidelity Fund and the
Fidelity Balanced Fund are established mutual funds sponsored by a highly regarded investment

_ management company. The Pimco Total Return Fund is managed by Paciﬁc Investment Management
Company, also a highly regarded investment management company. Historically, the Master Trust has
not incurred any credit-related losses,

6. Related Party Transactions
Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. [FHOC] handles record keeping and
administration of the Plan and the Master Trust. Certain of the Plan’s investment options are in mutual

— funds managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company [FMRC]. FHOC and FMRC are both
afﬁliates of Fidelity Management Trust Company [FMTC], who is the Trustee for the Plan and also
manages the Managed Income Portfolio 1], the Murphy Stock Fund and the Deltic Stock Fund.

$92,898 in trustee and administrative fees to FMTC and FlIOC in 2011. In addition, the Plan provides
for investment in Murphy Oil Corporation common stock and participant loans, which also qualify as

w party-in—interest transactions. These transactions are covered by exemptions from the “prohibited

7. Income Taxes
The Committee believes that the Plan meets the necessary requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and accordingly, that the related Master Trust is exempt from

’ taxation under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A
favorable determination letter dated May 11, 2009 was received by the Plan. Until cash or shares are
withdrawn from the Plan by a participant or a participant’s beneﬁciary, no income tax is payable by the

‘ participant/beneﬁciary on: contributions made by the Company on the participant‘s behalf, allotments
made by the participant pursuant to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, or the participant’s
proportional share of the investment income of the Master Trust. With few exceptions, the Plan is no

" longer subject to US. Federal income tax examinations by tax authorities subsequent to 2008.

‘" 8. Assets at Fair Value

The Company carries certain assets at fair value in its Statements of Net Assets Available for Beneﬁts.
The fair value hierarchy is based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 being
the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active

”' markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than Level 1 prices,
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the

W full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little
or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

_' Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on
a recurring basis and recognized in the accompanying Statements of Net Assets Available for Benefits,
as well as the general classiﬁcation of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classiﬁed within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include common stock and mutual funds. If quoted market

_ prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of
securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash ﬂows. Level 2 securities include

_ common/collective trust. The common/collective trust’s fair value is determined by estimated cash
ﬂows less surrender charges. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available,
securities or other investments would be classiﬁed within Level 3 of the hierarchy. There are no level 3

__ investments.

There are no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
