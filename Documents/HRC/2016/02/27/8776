<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the second periodic report submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution S-9/1, in which the Council requested the High Commissioner to monitor, 
document and report on the violations of human rights of the Palestinian people. The report 
covers the period from 1 May 2009 to 3 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report also contains information regarding the implementation of the 
recommendations of the first periodic report of the High Commissioner (A/HRC/12/37) and 
the situation in East Jerusalem, as requested by the Human Rights Council in resolution S-
12/1. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Follow-up to the first periodic report 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the reporting period the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory (OPT) remained of serious concern. Recommendations made previously by the 
Secretary-General and the High Commissioner remain valid and need to be implemented as 
a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p>4. Peace negotiations and intra-Palestinian reconciliation remained at a standstill. The 
occupation continued to be the main cause of widespread violations of Palestinians&#8217; civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights. While arbitrary detention, torture and other 
ill-treatment were perpetrated by all parties, Israeli settlements continued to expand in the 
West Bank, including in East Jerusalem, as did home demolitions and forced evictions of 
Palestinians by Israeli authorities.1 
</p>
<p>5. Demonstrations against the wall continued, especially in the villages of Ni&#8217;lin and 
Bil&#8217;in. According to Yesh Din, an Israeli non-governmental organization, over the past six 
months, 31 residents of Bil&#8217;in have been arrested by Israeli authorities, including 10 
children. It is reported that 12 remain in custody.2 Demonstrators are frequently responded 
to with excessive force by Israeli security forces (ISF).3 This includes the use of rubber-
coated steel bullets and live ammunitions. During the reporting period, the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in the OPT (OHCHR-OPT) recorded the death of 
one demonstrator due to excessive force by ISF.4 
</p>
<p>6. The fragmentation of the West Bank continued, as did the severing of the West Bank 
hinterland from East Jerusalem through a system of checkpoints and permits. Severe 
restrictions on the freedom of movement in the West Bank &#8212; as well as in Gaza through 
the blockade &#8212; persisted throughout the reporting period. While there were no further

 A/HRC/12/37, paras. 38, 42&#8211;45 and 50&#8211;56. A report recently published by the Public Committee 
</p>
<p>against Torture in Israel notes that impunity for torture continues. See &#8220;Accountability denied: the 
absence of investigation and punishment of torture in Israel&#8221; (December 2009). Available from

 Information obtained by the OHCHR-OPT directly from Yesh Din during a 15 December 2009 
</p>
<p>meeting in Tel Aviv.

 The term Israeli security forces (ISF) is used in the present report when it is unclear which agency or 
</p>
<p>body (police, security or military) is involved.

 On 5 June 2009, Yousef Akil Srour, a Palestinian, was shot in the chest with 0.22 calibre live 
</p>
<p>ammunition and pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. On the same day, four other 
demonstrators were injured by 0.22 calibre live ammunition. See B&#8217;Tselem (The Israeli Information 
Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories), www.btselem.org/English/Firearms/20090618

</p>
<p>substantial efforts to construct the wall, its associated regime of checkpoints, bypass roads 
and related permits resulted in violations to a broad range of Palestinians&#8217; rights, in 
particular the rights to education, family, health, non-discrimination and work.5 
</p>
<p>7. An encouraging development, with respect to existing restrictions on the freedom of 
movement of Palestinians, relates to a recent judgement of the Israeli High Court of Justice 
regarding Route 443. This is one of the main thoroughfares that connect Jerusalem and Tel 
Aviv. Private Palestinian land was expropriated for the purpose of constructing Route 443. 
Yet in 1982 the High Court of Justice ruled that its construction was lawful since it would 
benefit the Palestinian population.6 Subsequently, in 2002, Palestinians were banned from 
using the road.7 On 29 December 2009 the Court ruled that this prohibition was 
&#8220;inconsistent with the rules of international law regarding a belligerent occupation&#8221;.8 The 
full implementation of this ruling would constitute a positive development in terms of 
respect for the right of Palestinians to freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p>8. The blockade of Gaza has become more severe since the conclusion of Operation 
Cast Lead. The population of Gaza has not received adequate assistance or support to 
recover from the impact of this operation. While the rights to health and water are given 
special attention below, the full range of human rights of the Gaza population continues to 
be violated on a regular basis, in particular as a consequence of the blockade. 
</p>
<p>9. Impunity for human rights violations remains a critical concern in the OPT. There is 
an urgent need to improve accountability for violations, with a view towards preventing 
future violations and ensuring justice for victims. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The human rights situation in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rule of law and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>10. Under international human rights law victims have the right to an effective remedy 
following substantive violations of their rights.9 The right to an effective remedy requires 
that the State carry out investigations promptly, thoroughly and impartially.10 It also 
requires that reparation be made to individuals whose rights (under the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) have been violated. The rights of victims to an 
effective remedy require urgent attention, since time is of the essence in meeting such 
obligations.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Investigations carried out by Israel in connection with Operation Cast Lead 
</b></p>
<p>11. Information received by the High Commissioner as well as information that can be 
found in the public domain11 indicate that approximately 150 incidents have been the 
subject of investigation by the Israeli armed forces.12 A total of 36 incidents are or have 
been the subject of criminal investigations by the Military Police Criminal Investigations 
Division (MPCID);13 the rest have been the subject of command investigations. The report 
published by the Government of Israel in January 2010 indicates that all investigations 
begin with the Military Advocate General (MAG), and may be referred either for a 
command investigation or a criminal investigation. The latter are carried out by the 
MPCID, trained in the exercise of criminal investigation, while the former are carried out 
by military officers with operational, rather than criminal, investigation expertise. 
</p>
<p>12. A total of 68 command investigations14 have concluded with the MAG determining 
that no criminal investigation is warranted. Seven criminal investigations have concluded 
that no prosecution is warranted. A total of 45 command investigations and 28 criminal 
investigations are ongoing. One case has resulted in the conviction of a soldier, in relation 
to the theft of a credit card. Investigations in relation to half of the above-mentioned 150 
incidents therefore appear to have been concluded. No information has been provided 
indicating that any of the decisions not to proceed with investigations have been the subject 
of a request for judicial review or review by the Attorney General. 
</p><p>13. Effective investigations must be independent, thorough and prompt.15 All of the 
command investigations, special and ordinary, appear to rely predominantly, if not 
exclusively, on information provided by those potentially implicated in the violations. They 
do not appear to meet the standards required for practical independence.16 
</p>
<p>14. Ordinary command investigations appear to fall short of the required standard of 
hierarchical independence17 and carry with them a risk of a conflict of interest that cannot 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 There are five documents: (a) Israeli Defense Forces, &#8220;Conclusion of investigations into central 
</p>
<p>claims and issues in Operation Cast Lead&#8221; (April 2009); (b) Israel (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), 
&#8220;Initial Response to the Fact-Finding Mission on Gaza pursuant to resolution S-9/1 of the Human 
Rights Council&#8221; (September 2009); (d) Letter from the Permanent Mission of Israel to the United 
Nations Office and Specialized Institutions in Geneva to the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(November 2009); and (e) Israel, &#8220;Gaza operation investigations: an update&#8221; (January 2010). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12
 The reports from the Government suggest that an investigation is taking place in respect of each 
</p>
<p>incident. Therefore 150 investigations correlate to 150 incidents. There may be investigations that 
cover multiple incidents, but certainty is not possible on the basis of available information. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
 Seven of these were referred by the Military Advocate General at the conclusion of command 
</p>
<p>investigations, according to information provided by the Government of Israel.

<p>

 See <i>Finucane v. the United Kingdom</i> (2003) 22 EHRR 29, para. 68: &#8220;For an investigation into alleged 
</p>
<p>unlawful killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the 
persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in 
the events (see, for example, <i>G&#252;le&#231; v. Turkey</i>, judgement of 27 July 1998, <i>Reports</i> 1998-IV, &#167;&#167; 81&#8211;
82; <i>Ogur v. Turkey</i>, [GC] No. 21954/93, ECHR 1999-III, &#167;&#167; 91&#8211;92). This means not only a lack of 
hierarchical or institutional connection but also practical independence (see, for example, <i>Ergi v. 
Turkey</i>, judgement of 28 July 1998, <i>Reports</i> 1998-IV, &#167;&#167; 83&#8211;84, and the recent Northern Irish cases, 
for example, <i>McKerr v. the United Kingdom</i>, No. 28883/95, &#167; 128, <i>Hugh Jordan v. the United 
Kingdom</i>, No. 24746/94, &#167; 120, and <i>Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom</i>, No. 30054/96, &#167; 114,

</p>
<p>be overcome by the fact that the final decision lies with the MAG. More information is 
required to ascertain the degree of institutional independence of special command 
investigations. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government of Israel points out that the review by the MAG is central to the 
system, not the command investigation.18 However, the MAG relies on the information 
provided by the command investigation.19 If there is reason to doubt the impartiality or 
independence of the evidence gathering process, this cannot be overcome by a subsequent 
reviewer, even if that reviewer can be considered independent.20 
</p>
<p>16. United Nations treaty bodies consistently reiterate that investigations must be 
thorough and effective.21 There are at least three significant examples which on their own 
indicate a lack of thoroughness in the command investigations in relation to extremely 
serious allegations.22 The absence of substantive information on other investigations makes 
evaluation of their thoroughness difficult at this point. 
</p>
<p>17. As regards criminal investigations, the Government of Israel indicates that 36 
criminal investigations, out of a total of 150 investigations, have been opened. Nineteen 
concern the alleged shooting towards civilians, while the remainder deal with allegations of 
the use of human shields, mistreatment of detainees or civilians, pillage or theft.23 
</p>
<p>18. The degree to which MPCID and prosecutors to whom it presents its findings can be 
viewed as institutionally independent from those carrying out military operations cannot be 
assessed without more detailed information. 
</p>
<p>19. The High Commissioner is aware of reports and criticisms contending that the 
investigations of MPCID have consistently failed to lead to adequate prosecutions for 
offences allegedly committed by ISF, and that they have fostered a culture of impunity. In 
particular, B&#8217;Tselem and Yesh Din have catalogued criticisms related to investigative 
techniques and charging practices.24 
</p>
<p>20. To be effective a remedy must also be provided promptly. While the standard for 
promptness will vary from case to case, the High Commissioner notes the frequent 
reference of treaty bodies to the need for prompt investigations, especially in cases of 
alleged unlawful killings.25 In this regard she is concerned that it appears that the

<p>19
 The Government states that command investigations &#8220;serve as a means of compiling an evidentiary 
</p>
<p>record for the Military Advocate General, enabling him, from his central vantage point, to determine 
whether there is a factual basis to open a criminal investigation&#8221;. It is not clear how that point allows 
the MAG to consider the facts other than those presented by the command investigation.

<p>investigation into one of the most serious incidents of Operation Cast Lead &#8212; relating to 
the death of over 20 people in the Al Samouni family home in Zeitoun &#8212; was not opened 
until November 2009.26 
</p>
<p>21. The High Commissioner notes that neither criminal nor command investigations are 
adequate to investigate whether policies, rules of engagement or orders that guided ISF 
during Operation Cast Lead were in violation of international law, or the responsibility of 
relevant senior officials &#8211; military or civilian. An independent inquiry into these matters is 
required, in addition to the investigation of specific incidents, for an effective right to 
remedy. 
</p>
<p><i>  Palestinian initiatives 
</i></p>
<p>22. On 25 January 2010, the Palestinian Authority issued a decree27 establishing a 
commission to follow up on the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission. 
According to the decree, the commission is independent, is comprised of five members, is 
authorized to carry out investigations into the violations alleged in the report, will report to 
relevant authorities with respect to the outcomes of its activities, and is empowered to 
appoint experts and specialists to assist it to fulfil its duties. 
</p>
<p>23. The de facto authorities in Gaza state that two committees have been formed to 
follow up on the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the United 
Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. The de facto authorities in Gaza also 
state that the committees are comprised of experts in international law and will immediately 
and independently follow up on the allegations of violations of international humanitarian 
law contained in the Fact-Finding Mission report, in accordance with Palestinian laws and 
practices. 
</p>
<p>24. There is insufficient information available at this time to draw conclusions regarding 
the compliance of responsible Palestinian authorities with the obligation to provide 
effective remedies. The High Commissioner notes that, at this point, there is no indication 
of credible investigations having taken place. In addition, the late launching of these 
initiatives brings into question the commitment of responsible Palestinian authorities to 
satisfying the criterion that a remedy be prompt. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations Fact-
Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Secretary-General has submitted a report to the Human Rights Council on the 
status of implementation of paragraph 3 of Council resolution S-12/1 (A/HRC/13/55). The 
Secretary-General&#8217;s report provides information on the implementation of the 
recommendations of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission.

<p><b> C. General human rights situation in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>26. Sporadic violence within the armed conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed 
groups continued during the reporting period, with Israel launching airstrikes on Gaza28 and 
Palestinian armed groups firing rockets and mortar shells into Israel.29 Since the end of 
Operation Cast Lead, 89 Palestinians and 1 Israeli have been killed, while 154 Palestinians 
and 7 Israelis have been injured in such incidents.30 
</p><p>27. The blockade of Gaza continues to further deprive the population. Denied basic 
supplies and services, 1.5 million persons are subjected to a worsening humanitarian crisis 
that disregards their human dignity. The blockade has had a devastating impact on a broad 
range of human rights of Gazans &#8212; more than half of whom are children &#8212; most notably 
impeding the fulfilment of core human rights such as the rights to health, water, food, 
shelter, work and education. 
</p>
<p>28. Restrictions in place on the importation of construction materials into Gaza have left 
over 6,000 houses that were destroyed or seriously damaged during Operation Cast Lead 
unrepaired.31 This exacerbates the difficult living conditions of families still living in tents 
or makeshift shelters near the remains of their homes, in particular during the winter 
season.32 Moreover, winter will increase electricity needs, resulting in an expected 
electricity shortage of up to 35 per cent.33 
</p>
<p><b> D. The right to water 
</b></p>
<p>29. The water and sanitation situation in Gaza is perilous. The United Nations 
Humanitarian Coordinator recently stated that &#8220;the deterioration and breakdown of water 
and sanitation facilities in Gaza is compounding an already severe and protracted denial of 
human dignity in the Gaza Strip. At the heart of this crisis is a steep decline in standards of 
living for the people of Gaza, characterized by erosion of livelihoods, destruction and 
degradation of basic infrastructure, and a marked downturn in the delivery and quality of 
vital services in health, water and sanitation&#8221;.34 A September 2009 report by the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that Gaza is on the verge of water and 
sanitation collapse. UNEP points to increased salinity from salt water intrusion caused by 
over-abstraction of ground water as a key concern, alongside pollution from sewage and 
agricultural runoff.35 Reinforcing this assessment, Amnesty International reports that the

</b></p>
<p>water situation in Gaza has reached a crisis point and highlights that today 90&#8211;95 per cent 
of Gaza&#8217;s water is unfit for human consumption due to sewage and seawater infiltration.36 
</p>
<p>30. The blockade has prevented the entry of materials necessary to repair, rehabilitate 
and maintain the water and sanitation infrastructure. Materials have been allowed in only 
on an exceptional basis. For example, construction of the North Gaza Emergency Sewage 
Treatment Plant has been slowed by the shortage of critical materials. Once completed the 
plant will treat the sewage of more than 500,000 people and filter the treated wastewater 
back into the ground aquifer.37 
</p>
<p>31. The dire water situation is illustrated by the situation of Al Shoka municipality 
(estimated population of 15,000), which is located at the easternmost part of Rafah. Since 
residents of Al Shoka do not have access to water through the public water network, they 
must purchase water from private vendors for all their needs. Thus, the average daily 
consumption of water in the municipality is less than half the 100 litres per day 
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the local staff of the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East explained 
to OHCHR-OPT that he spends as much as 30 per cent of his salary purchasing water for 
his family. According to the chief municipal engineer, new wells are required. A project of 
the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility includes plans to dig three wells in Tel El Sultan 
and build a carrier line from these new wells to the existing networks, which would allow 
access to water for some 60,000 people, including the Al Shoka residents. Yet the blockade 
prevents the importation of materials needed to complete this project. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>32. The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a 
fundamental human right.38 This includes the right of access to health facilities, goods and 
services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups. It 
also encompasses access to minimum essential food that is nutritionally adequate and safe, 
access to shelter, housing and sanitation and an adequate supply of safe drinking water, the 
provisions of essential drugs, and equitable distribution of all health facilities, goods and 
services. 
</p>
<p>33. The availability and quality of health care in Gaza has deteriorated over recent years 
because of political turmoil, Operation Cast Lead and the blockade.39 The blockade hinders 
the effective functioning of the health-care system on multiple levels, including by 
restricting access to basic supplies, such as drugs and consumables, such as syringes and 
gloves; basic medical equipment, such as x-ray machines; other equipment, such as 
computers and printers; and supplies to rehabilitate hospitals, such as glass, cement and 
wood. At present, it is only possible to import a minimum of essential medical supplies and 
equipment. 
</p>
<p>34. During the reporting period, there continued to be enormous difficulties for patients 
from Gaza who required emergency medical care available in the West Bank, East 
Jerusalem, Israel or abroad. From February 2009 until the end of October 2009, 25 persons

<p>died due to being unable to access medical treatment outside Gaza.40 Many applications to 
exit Gaza for medical treatment were delayed or denied by Israeli authorities.41 
</p>
<p>35. Patients applying for medical care outside of Gaza are typically summoned for 
questioning by ISF at the Erez checkpoint, in advance of obtaining an exit permit. This can 
be a difficult experience. For example, &#8220;K.&#8221;, a resident of Gaza, was referred by the 
Ministry of Health to Al-Makassed Hospital in East Jerusalem for back surgery. In July 
2009 a permit request was sent to ISF to allow him into Israel. ISF called him for a 
meeting. During this meeting the security officer questioned him about the circumstances in 
which his son was killed, by ISF, in 2002, as well as about his other sons. The security 
officer reportedly stated that his sons were &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and told him to return to Gaza. In 
October 2009 a new referral for treatment was issued. With the help of a local non-
governmental organization (NGO), K. again requested a permit. The permit was denied on 
&#8220;security grounds&#8221; and K.&#8217;s health continues to deteriorate. Without surgery K. risks 
paralysis. 
</p>
<p>36. According to WHO, from January to November 2009 ISF summoned approximately 
590 patients to Erez for such interrogations.42 In May 2009 Physicians for Human Rights-
Israel (PHR-Israel) presented data to the Committee against Torture regarding new 
measures employed by ISF during the interrogation of patients at Erez. New measures 
reportedly include photographing patients against their will; detaining patients for 
undisclosed periods of time; harassing, accusing, cursing and intimidating patients; and 
forcing uncooperative patients to return to Gaza without receiving a permit to exit.43 PHR-
Israel has informed OHCHR-OPT that these practices have increased since November 
2009, often resulting in patients missing medical appointments. In two cases, patients 
summoned for interrogation were immediately detained and transferred to the Shikma 
prison in Ashkelon, where they remained for approximately 20 days before being 
released.44 While before June 2009 PHR-Israel&#8217;s mobile clinic was allowed into Gaza on 3 
occasions (out of 6 requests), after June 2009 all 10 of its requests were refused.45 
</p>
<p><b> IV. East Jerusalem 
</b>37. Palestinians who live or work in East Jerusalem face distinct challenges to the 
enjoyment of their human rights. Those who live in East Jerusalem are issued different 
identity documents than residents of the West Bank, with the former being more difficult to 
obtain and more easily revoked.46 East Jerusalemites can lose their right to live in the city if 
they reside outside Israel or East Jerusalem for seven consecutive years, or if they obtain 
citizenship or permanent residency in another country. The information available to

denied. Of those delayed, 83 patients were asked to be questioned by Israeli security forces before 
approval of their application, of which 51 did not go to the interview, 29 were asked to submit new 
applications and 1 was approved after the interview.

</b></p>
<p>OHCHR-OPT indicates that this policy has been implemented by the Ministry of Interior of 
Israel since December 1995.47 However, in 2008, the last year for which data is available, 
Israel revoked the residency permits of 4,577 East Jerusalemites. This is reported to be 21 
times the average of each of the previous 40 years.48 
</p>
<p>38. Palestinians with West Bank or Gaza identity papers must apply for a permit to enter 
East Jerusalem. Even for those who are regularly employed in East Jerusalem, entry permits 
must be renewed every three or six months. West Bank identity-paper holders who are 
granted permits to enter Jerusalem are generally subject to a number of conditions, such as 
a time limit on the hours they can spend in Jerusalem and/or bans on driving or staying 
overnight. Restrictions on travel are often imposed, often during Israeli holidays, thereby 
preventing even permit holders from entering East Jerusalem. The extremely restrictive 
permit system impedes the freedom of movement of Palestinians between East Jerusalem, 
West Bank and Gaza.49 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, persons with East Jerusalem identification whose spouses hold West 
Bank identification (or are not Palestinian) are required to either surrender their residency 
and live in the West Bank, or apply for a family unification permit for the non-resident 
spouse.50 The challenges of family unification are illustrated by the following case 
documented by OHCHR-OPT. &#8220;S.&#8221;, living in the Silwan area of East Jerusalem and a 
holder of West Bank papers, married a Palestinian woman with East Jerusalem residency. 
While he had managed to obtain a permit to stay in East Jerusalem since his marriage, his 
permit was revoked after his house was demolished in December 2008. Since then Israeli 
authorities have refused to renew his permit, citing unspecified &#8220;security reasons&#8221;. In 2009, 
upon the expiration of his permit, he was arrested and detained for over three weeks. While 
now released, he remains without a permit and &#8220;illegally&#8221; in East Jerusalem with his wife, 
living in fear of being arrested again. Israeli authorities have also refused to issue a 
&#8220;certificate of good conduct&#8221; (no criminal record) for his wife, making it difficult for her to 
find employment. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Home demolitions 
</b></p>
<p>40. Israel&#8217;s obligations under international humanitarian law prohibit it from destroying 
private or public property, or from forcibly displacing the civilian population, except as 
required for reasons of military necessity.51 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination has expressed serious concerns regarding house evictions and home

</p>

 This policy has its roots in the judgement in the <i>Mubarak Awad</i> case of the High Court of Justice 
</p>
<p>delivered in 1988, which decided that the status of Palestinian residents should be regulated in 
accordance with the Entry in Israel Law, which is immigration legislation. See, for example,

</p>
<p>demolitions in the OPT, including in East Jerusalem.52 Furthermore, such home demolitions 
amount to forced evictions and are in violation of the right to adequate housing.53 
</p>
<p>41. Often the justification given by the Israeli authorities for home demolitions, 
particularly in East Jerusalem, is that Palestinian residents erect structures without building 
permits. Yet in practice Palestinians lack meaningful access to such permits. Palestinians 
applying for building permits face an unnecessarily stringent and costly process to 
demonstrate land ownership.54 Furthermore, it is important to note that only 13 per cent of 
the annexed East Jerusalem land area is currently zoned for Palestinian construction, and 
much of this land is already dense with construction. 
</p>
<p>42. While the Municipality of Jerusalem announced that 70 per cent of home 
demolitions in East Jerusalem would desist,55 forced evictions and home demolitions have 
continued unabated. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs determined 
that, from 16 May to 18 November 2009, at least 214 persons, including 103 children, were 
displaced due to home demolitions or forced evictions. The Israeli Committee against 
Home Demolitions estimates that demolitions from 1 January to 18 November 2009 
displaced at least 333 persons, including 157 children. It is estimated that there are more 
than 1,500 outstanding demolition orders in East Jerusalem alone. If these orders are 
implemented, as many as 60,000 further Palestinians would be displaced.56 
</p>
<p>43. Some cases documented by OHCHR-OPT indicate that Palestinian families being 
evicted are often not allowed to remove their belongings. On 26 October 2009 Israeli 
authorities demolished the home of four Palestinian families in the Al Ghezayel area of Sur 
Bahir, in the process displacing 15 persons, including 6 children. Persons in the house were 
separated into three different rooms and were not allowed to contact anyone by telephone. 
At 7 a.m. ISF arrived and the demolition began, with the families given little time to 
remove their belongings. OHCHR-OPT observed that items such as kitchenware and 
furniture were still in the house when it was demolished. Another home was demolished on 
27 October 2009, with ISF arriving at 5 a.m. and immediately ordering all residents to exit. 
The four families residing in the house were forced to wait in the cold until workers arrived 
at 7 a.m. The workers proceeded to clear the house of its furniture and belongings for 
approximately 30 minutes, until bulldozers arrived and demolished the house with the 
remaining belongings still inside. In all cases documented by OHCHR-OPT, victims stated 
that workers who cleared their homes hurled furniture out the windows and caused further 
damage to their belongings. 
</p>
<p>44. With respect to Israel&#8217;s continuing policy and practice of carrying out home 
demolitions in East Jerusalem, it is recalled that on 3 November 2009 the Secretary-General 
issued a statement in which he declared that he was &#8220;dismayed at continued Israeli actions 
in occupied East Jerusalem, including the demolition of Palestinian homes, the eviction of 
Palestinian families and the insertion of settlers into Palestinian neighbourhoods&#8221;.57 In a 1

</p>
<p><b> B. Freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>45. During Ramadan Israeli authorities customarily allow Palestinians with West Bank 
identity papers to enter East Jerusalem to attend Friday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque. 
However, in 2009 access for holders of West Bank identification was restricted to men over 
50 years of age, women over 45, and boys and girls under 12.58 On 16 September 2009 
OHCHR-OPT sent a communication to the head of the Civil Administration of the West 
Bank, requesting that he take measures to &#8220;ensure that the many Palestinians wishing to 
access religious sites in East Jerusalem are able to exercise their right to manifest their 
religion in an orderly and secure manner&#8221;. No response was received. 
</p>
<p>46. Restrictions on Palestinians accessing Al-Aqsa Mosque raise concerns under article 
18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees the right to 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion, 
be it individually or in community with others, in public or private.59 On 27 September 
2009 restrictions of Palestinians accessing Al-Aqsa Mosque led to clashes, which spread 
from the Old City into other parts of East Jerusalem. By the end of October 2009, 102 
Palestinians and 31 Israelis had been injured, mostly due to clashes relating to access to the 
Al-Aqsa Mosque and anti-wall demonstrations. The situation turned tense on 25 October 
2009, when Jewish clerics called on their followers to perform rituals inside the Al-Aqsa 
compound.60 
</p>
<p><b> V. Settlements and related violence 
</b>47. Settlement activity in the OPT, including in East Jerusalem, violates international 
human rights and international humanitarian law. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention stipulates that &#8220;the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its 
own civilian population into the territory it occupies&#8221;.61 As of late November 2009 the 
number of settlers in the West Bank is approximately 300,000, which includes 
approximately 200,000 in East Jerusalem.62 Settlement activity equally has an impact on the 
rights to life, property and basic services.

<p>59
 In paragraph 8 of its general comment No. 22 (1993) on this article, the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>stated that the article &#8220;permits restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or belief only if 
limitations are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. &#8230; In interpreting the scope of permissible limitation 
clauses, States parties should proceed from the need to protect the rights guaranteed under the 
Covenant, including the right to equality and non-discrimination ... restrictions are not allowed on 
grounds not specified there, even if they would be allowed as restrictions to other rights protected in 
the Covenant, such as national security. Limitations may be applied only for those purposes for which 
they were prescribed and must be directly related and proportionate to the specific need on which they 
are predicated. Restrictions may not be imposed for discriminatory purposes or applied in a 
discriminatory manner.&#8221;

<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12152 
</p>
<p>48. A related issue is that of settlements that are unauthorized under Israeli law, 
commonly known as &#8220;outposts&#8221;. Unlike settlements that are established and maintained as a 
matter of policy by the Government of Israel, outposts are established by groups of settlers 
and are illegal under Israeli law. Irrespective of authorization under Israeli law, all 
settlements in the OPT, including in East Jerusalem, are illegal under international law. 
</p>
<p>49. Incidents of settler violence continued throughout the West Bank with impunity. 
During the reporting period there were an average of 29 settler-related incidents of violence 
per month, and an average of 13 Palestinians a month injured in such incidents.63 
</p><p>50. The olive harvest has for many years been the flashpoint for tension between settlers 
and Palestinian farmers living in communities near settlements. For example, the village of 
Burin is frequently subjected to settler violence and related destruction of property. 
Information provided to OHCHR-OPT indicates that over 1,500 olive trees had been burnt 
or destroyed by settlers from January through October 2009. 
</p>
<p>51. OHCHR-OPT is also aware of cases where ISF, present on the scene of settler 
violence, did nothing to prevent attacks. A woman and her family living in the Tel Rumeida 
area of the old city of Hebron reported that she and her family are subject to severe 
movement restrictions by ISF and harassment and violence by settlers. On 11 April 2009 
this woman, who is 70 years old and requires regular medical attention, was returning from 
the hospital and had received special permission from ISF to approach her home using the 
paved front way in the ambulance, as opposed to the usual restriction against using the front 
entrance and the prohibition from driving vehicles to their homes. The ambulance was 
stopped by ISF troops near her home. As ISF examined their identity documents, a group of 
settlers gathered around the ambulance. The crowd insulted the passengers and hurled large 
stones through the ambulance&#8217;s back window, the first of which sent shattering glass 
throughout the ambulance. Throughout this time, the troops present did nothing to prevent 
the attacks or disperse the settlers, and eventually turned the ambulance back, where it was 
again attacked by settlers. 
</p>
<p>52. In another incident, on 13 July 2009, a 16-year-old boy was stopped by ISF 
approximately 150 metres from his home. The troops took him to a military camp, where he 
was handcuffed, blindfolded and placed in a chair in a concrete cubicle. The troops allowed 
a group of settlers to beat him until he was unconscious. It was only after members of his 
family, accompanied by a field worker from B&#8217;Tselem with a video camera, arrived at the 
scene that the beating ended. The boy was released and taken to the hospital. His family 
presented a complaint regarding this incident to the Israeli police on 8 June 2009. They 
have received no information regarding an investigation. 
</p>
<p>53. There are few cases where settlers have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities for 
crimes against Palestinians. In September 2009 the trial of a settler who refused to give the 
police the names of persons suspected of assaulting and beating Palestinian shepherds in 
March 2008 commenced.64 However, the prevailing situation is one of impunity. With the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>2008, there were approximately 290,000 in the West Bank and 195,000 in East Jerusalem. See 
OCHA, &#8220;West Bank movement and access update&#8221;, May 2009, p. 13. In July 2009, an Israeli 
newspaper cited a military report stating that the settler population had increased to 304,000 in the 
West Bank. See &#8220;More than 300,000 settlers live in the West Bank&#8221;, Haaretz.com, 27 July 2009.

settler protests and related violent incidents are likely to increase.

<p><b> VI. Violence and discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p>54. As Palestinians under occupation and as a group subject to a patriarchal value 
system, women in the OPT face multiple layers of violence and discrimination. Moreover, 
the current political, economic and humanitarian crisis has contributed to an increase in 
domestic violence.66 
</p>
<p>55. Palestinian NGOs report that violence against Palestinian women is widespread, and 
that women are discouraged from reporting abuses. Only 2 per cent of women victims of 
domestic violence seek legal assistance.67 For example, &#8220;Y.&#8221; explained how difficult it is 
for her to file a complaint with the Palestinian Authority police against her husband, who 
beats and verbally abuses her. She stated that filing a complaint with the police would 
disgrace her community, and that she would likely suffer stigmatization. She fears that 
filing a complaint would also mean that her husband would not allow her to see their 
children.68 
</p>
<p>56. One challenge in relation to violence against women is the lack of information-
gathering by official institutions. In particular, there are no reliable statistics on so-called 
&#8220;honour crimes&#8221;. Yet NGOs and other observers report that &#8220;honour killings&#8221; take place in 
the OPT and, as a matter of practice, are not investigated. It is believed that such crimes are 
not investigated due either to a lack of willingness on the part of family and community 
members to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, or a lack of willingness of law 
enforcement authorities to rigorously investigate such crimes.69 
</p>
<p>57. Information collected by the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights 
in Gaza indicates that the majority of &#8220;honour killings&#8221; in Gaza were committed by 
immediate relatives in the families&#8217; homes, though the bodies of some victims were 
discarded away from the home. Palestinian Authority police do not seem to have achieved 
any progress in investigating these crimes. 
</p>
<p>58. In May 2009 a Palestine Authority inter-ministerial committee drafted a presidential 
decree to amend existing legislation that discriminates against women. According to the 
decree, the killing of a spouse (male or female) suspected of or found to have committed 
adultery would be treated as murder and would be sentenced accordingly. The decree 
abolishes the exemption from punishment for killings committed in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221;. 
This decree, which has already been adopted by the legal working group of the Legislative 
Council, is currently with the President for signature. 
</p>
<p>59. An encouraging development is the signature by President Abbas of a decree 
accepting the applicability of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. This decree offers Palestinians a point of reference to

to end violence against women and girls, promises accountability for violations of women&#8217;s 
rights, and provides for the responsibility of the Palestinian Authority to fulfil the principles 
and measures enshrined in the Convention.70 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>60. <b>The human rights situation between 1 May 2009 and 3 February 2010 
remained of serious concern. A wide range of serious human rights violations 
occurred with disturbing frequency. The most critical violations that took place 
included a lack of respect for the right to life; arbitrary detention; impediments to the 
right to freedom of religion; obstacles to the fulfilment of the right to health; 
restrictions on freedom of movement; torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment or punishment; a lack of remedy and redress for abuses and violations; and 
violence against women and children, in both the public and private spheres.</b> 
</p>
<p>61. <b>The recommendations contained in reports by the Secretary-General and the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in the OPT 
remain valid and need to be implemented as a matter of the highest urgency.</b> 
</p>
<p>62. <b>The blockade of Gaza results in grave and widespread human rights violations, 
including in relation to the fulfilment of the right to health and the right to adequate, 
safe drinking water. Furthermore, Israel&#8217;s blockade impedes the reconstruction or 
repair of thousands of homes destroyed or damaged during Operation Cast Lead, 
resulting in violations to the right to adequate housing.</b> 
</p>
<p>63. <b>Israel still has not fully complied with the International Court of Justice&#8217;s 
Advisory Opinion on the wall. The continued expansion and establishment of 
settlements has further fragmented the West Bank. Notwithstanding a slight 
reduction in the number of Israeli checkpoints, severe restrictions on the movement of 
Palestinians within the West Bank and between East Jerusalem and the West Bank, in 
particular due to permit requirements, negatively affect a wide range of human rights 
on a daily basis. The extent of the fragmentation of the West Bank and the increasing 
separation of East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank brings into question the 
ability of Palestinians to effectively exercise their right to self-determination.</b> 
</p>
<p>64. <b>The situation in and around Jerusalem is particularly insecure. A dramatic 
increase in the revocation of Jerusalem residency permits for Palestinians in East 
Jerusalem was noted over the past year. Many Palestinian families in East Jerusalem 
and Area C of the West Bank were forcibly displaced, due to evictions and 
demolitions carried out by Israeli authorities.</b> 
</p>
<p>65. <b>Impunity for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law 
remains widespread, and needs to be addressed by all parties as a matter of the 
highest urgency. Investigations launched by the Government of Israel into alleged 
violations related to the military operations in Gaza of December 2008&#8211;January 2009 
remain inadequate to provide effective remedies. While the processes put in place by 
responsible Palestinian authorities are recent and not much information is available, 
there is at this point no indication of credible investigations having taken place with 
regard to allegations of violations by Palestinian armed groups.</b>
