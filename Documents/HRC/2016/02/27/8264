<p><b> I. Introduction </b>&#8211;<b> scope and objective of the study 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 15/24, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a thematic study on 
the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, including 
recommendations on actions aimed at ending such measures, taking into account all 
previous reports, resolutions and relevant information available to the United Nations 
system in that regard, and to present the study to the Council. The present document 
contains a thematic study pursuant to this resolution.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The notion of unilateral coercive measures  
</b></p>
<p>2. It is widely acknowledged that the term &#8220;unilateral coercive measures&#8221; is difficult to 
define. Unilateral coercive measures often refer to economic measures taken by one State to 
compel a change in policy of another State.1 The most widely used forms of economic 
pressure are trade sanctions in the form of embargoes and/or boycotts, and the interruption 
of financial and investment flows between sender and target countries.2 While embargoes 
are often understood as trade sanctions aimed at preventing exports to a target country, 
boycotts are measures seeking to refuse imports from a target country.3 However, 
frequently the combination of import and export restrictions is also referred to as a trade 
embargo.4  
</p>
<p>3. More recently, so-called &#8220;smart&#8221; or &#8220;targeted&#8221; sanctions, such as asset freezing and 
travel bans, have been employed by States in order to influence individuals who are 
perceived to be in a position to decide on a political action in a particular State.5  
</p>
<p>4. The prevailing definition requires a separate assessment as to whether and to what 
extent a specific form of unilateral coercive measures may be unlawful in the light of 
various legal standards. At the same time, it follows that unilateral coercive measures, 
regardless of their legality under a particular body of international law, may negatively 
impact human rights in various ways. Chapters III and IV are thus devoted to the issue of 
the legality of unilateral coercive measures and to their impact on the enjoyment of human 
rights, respectively.

<p><b> III. The question of the legality of unilateral coercive measures 
under international law 
</b></p>
<p>5. Whether unilateral coercive measures are legal or illegal under public international 
law cannot be easily answered in general. Much depends upon the specific form of coercive 
measures, on the applicable treaty law, if any, and on customary international law rules 
relevant to the assessment of coercive measures, as well as on potential grounds for 
precluding the wrongfulness of such measures. Consistent with resolution 15/24 of the 
Human Rights Council, the main focus in the present report, in terms of the legality of 
unilateral coercive measures, is the issue of the extent to which negative human rights 
impacts of unilateral coercive measures may render such measures unlawful.  
</p>
<p>6. As a preliminary matter, it is helpful to distinguish between broad general economic 
sanctions used between States and the more recent so-called smart or targeted sanctions 
aimed at individuals,6 because different sets of legal rules are implicated by their 
imposition.    
</p>
<p><b> A. General coercive measures  
</b></p>
<p>7. A potential unlawfulness of general economic sanctions can have various sources. 
International humanitarian law as well as human rights treaties may contain limitations on 
the imposition of economic sanctions.   
</p>
<p><b> 1. Treaty law 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Human rights and international humanitarian law treaties  
</i></p>
<p>8. Human rights and international humanitarian law treaties may be implicated in cases 
of unilateral coercive measures affecting basic human rights or the civilian population at 
large. Examples of specific human rights and international humanitarian law treaty norms 
limiting the use of unilateral coercive measures will be discussed in more detail in chapter 
IV.  
</p>
<p>9. In the field of human rights law, the rights most relevant to assessing the legality of 
economic measures seem to be the right to life,7 the right to an adequate standard of living, 
including food, clothing, housing and medical care,8 the right to freedom from hunger,9 and 
the right to health.10  
</p>
<p>10. In the field of international humanitarian law, the prohibition against the starvation 
of a civilian population as a method of warfare is among the most relevant provisions.11 In

rights, para. 3.

Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), art. 54; Protocol Additional to the Geneva 
Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed 
Conflicts (Protocol II), art. 14.  </p>


<p>addition, the obligation to permit the free passage of all consignments of essential 
foodstuffs as well as medical supplies12 and the prohibition of collective punishment 
already contained in the 1907 Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on 
Land13 are crucial for the evaluation of economic coercive measures. 
</p>
<p>11. In considering the negative impacts of sanctions, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights concluded that human rights must be taken fully into account 
when designing an appropriate sanctions regime, that effective monitoring should be 
undertaken throughout the period that sanctions are in force, and that the external entity 
imposing the sanctions has an obligation to take steps, individually and through 
international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical in order to 
respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups within the 
targeted country.14 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Customary international law and general principles 
</b></p>
<p>12. In addition to treaty law obligations, the imposition of unilateral coercive measures 
may infringe rules of general international law comprising both customary international law 
and general principles of law.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Trade relations among States as sovereign decisions  
</i></p>
<p>13. The starting point for any analysis of the interruption of trade relations between 
States, as the most widely used form of unilateral coercive measures in practice, is the 
question whether and, if so, to what extent States may be obligated to conduct and to 
continue trade relations with each other.  
</p>
<p>14. As confirmed by the International Court of Justice, the prevailing view appears to be 
that, in the absence of explicit treaty obligations, States are still considered to be free as to 
whether to maintain trade relations or not.15 Thus, their politically or otherwise motivated 
sovereign decisions to stop such relations as such cannot be considered unlawful.16   
</p>
<p><i> (b) Non-intervention  
</i></p>
<p>15. While economic coercive measures are not likely to fall under the notion of the use 
of force, non-intervention appears to be a more appropriate test for assessing their 
lawfulness. The principle of non-intervention focuses on the intensity of the interference 
and the purposes pursued by the action. In particular, many countries in Latin America 
appear to adhere to a broad notion of unlawful intervention.17 Within the United Nations 
more broadly, a growing movement can be ascertained in which numerous Member States 
have expressed their view that unilateral coercive measures of an economic character may 
constitute unlawful interferences.

art. 19. </p>


<p>16. Since the 1960s, the non-intervention principle has repeatedly figured in General 
Assembly resolutions,18 culminating in the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of 
Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and 
Sovereignty,19 the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations20 and the 1981 Declaration on 
the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States,21 with a 
particular emphasis on economic measures.  
</p>
<p>17. While it is accepted that General Assembly resolutions as such cannot create binding 
legal obligations, they may be declaratory of existing customary international law or 
contribute to its emergence.22  
</p>
<p>18. The difficulty lies, however, less in accepting the non-intervention principle as a 
principle of international law.23 Rather, it has proven difficult to agree on the precise 
definition of what constitutes &#8220;intervention&#8221; and, in particular, whether economic coercive 
measures fall under the core of the customary international law principle of non-
intervention.  
</p>
<p>19. What can be deduced from the above-mentioned resolutions and from the Court&#8223;s 
judgment in the <i>Nicaragua</i> case24 is that two elements are crucial for assessing to what 
extent measures, including economic ones, may contravene the principle of non-
intervention: coercion and the intention to change the policy of the target State where the 
latter choice should be a free one.25  
</p>
<p>  
 18  Already in 1957 the General Assembly, in its resolution A/1236 (XII) on peaceful and neighbourly 
</p>
<p>relations among States, referred to &#8220;non-intervention in one another&#8223;s internal affairs&#8221; as one of the 
bases for relations between States. See also the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States 
(resolution 3281 (XXIX)); Declaration on the Establishment of the New International Economic 
Order (resolution 3201 (S-VI)); and resolutions 31/91 (1976 Declaration), 32/153, 33/74, 34/101 and 
35/159 on non-interference in the internal affairs of States; 39/210, 40/185, 41/165, 42/173, 44/215, 
46/210 and 48/168 on economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against 
developing countries; and 52/181, 54/200, 56/179, 58/198, 60/185 and 62/183 on unilateral economic 
measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries.

<p>(&#8220;The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs 
without outside interference [&#8230;] the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary 
international law.&#8221;). 
</p>
<p> 24  Ibid., para. 205 (&#8220;the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly 
in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one 
bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide 
freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the 
formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to 
such choices, which must remain free ones&#8221;.) Nevertheless, on the facts in this case, the International 
Court of Justice upheld the economic coercive measures applied, namely the imposition of a 
unilateral trade embargo, drastic reduction of the sugar import quota, and cessation of economic aid, 
while taking issue with the military support afforded to an insurgent group (ibid., paras. 239 to 245). 
</p>
<p> 25 See also Maziar Jamnejad and Michael Wood, &#8220;The principle of non-intervention&#8221;, <i>Leiden Journal of 
International Law</i>, vol. 22 (2009), p. 371.  </p>


<p>20. Where States are economically fully dependent on other States, economic measures 
may reach an intensity of coercive quality. At the same time, in order to be regarded as 
intervention the measures must be aimed at influencing the sovereign will of another State 
in an undue fashion.26 Thus, where unilateral coercive measures intend to induce 
compliance with international legal obligations, such as non-use of force or human rights, 
they are less likely to infringe the principle than when they are directed against the 
legitimate sovereign political decision-making of a State.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Customary human rights and international humanitarian law norms  
</i></p>
<p>21. Many of the human rights and international humanitarian law norms mentioned 
above are likely to constitute norms of customary international law. Fundamental 
humanitarian law provisions are widely regarded as customary international law.27 
Although the blanket qualification of human rights law in general as customary law has 
been more controversial,28 it appears that those basic provisions that are in issue in the case 
of economic embargoes do have a customary international law character. In addition, there 
may be strong and convincing arguments to consider core provisions of humanitarian law, 
as well as the most basic human rights, as having received the status of non-derogable, 
peremptory norms in the sense of <i>jus cogens</i> obligations.29  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Potential preclusion of wrongfulness of coercive measures  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Countermeasures  
</i></p>
<p>22. Under the customary international law principles of State responsibility as codified 
in the International Law Commission articles on State responsibility,30 otherwise unlawful 
acts may be exceptionally justified as countermeasures.31 Countermeasures are permitted 
under certain restrictive circumstances: they may be taken only against a responsible State 
to induce it to comply with its obligations to cease the internationally wrongful conduct, if 
it is continuing.32 Where human rights or other obligations owed to the international 
community as a whole (obligations <i>erga omnes</i>) are concerned, any State may take lawful 
measures against the State that breached the said <i>erga omnes</i> obligation to ensure cessation

Bruno Simma and Philip Alston, &#8220;The sources of human rights law: custom, jus cogens, and general 
principles&#8221;, <i>Australian Year Book of International Law</i>, vol. 12 (1992), p. 90, suggesting general 
principles of law as a more adequate source of unwritten general international law.

Records of the General Assembly, Thirty-fifth Session, Supplement No. 10</i> (A/35/10), vol. II, part two, 
p. 46, stating that &#8220;some of the [rules of humanitarian law] are, in the opinion of the Commission, 
rules which impose obligations of <i>jus cogens</i>...&#8221;. See also Theodor Meron, &#8220;On a hierarchy of

<p>of the breach and reparation in the interest of the injured State or of the beneficiaries of the 
obligation breached.33 
</p>
<p>23. Where the above criteria are fulfilled, unilateral coercive measures may be justified 
as a temporary measure. However, countermeasures must not affect the prohibition on the 
use of force, obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights, obligations of a 
humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals and other obligations under peremptory norms 
of general international law.34 They also must be proportional.35 The proportionality of the 
countermeasure is a crucial element in assessing the legality of a specific measure.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Authorization by the United Nations 
</i></p>
<p>24. According to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, the Security Council 
may impose forcible or non-forcible measures in situations that constitute at least a threat to 
international peace and security.36 The preferred non-forcible measures adopted by the 
Security Council in the past were economic sanctions.37 States Members of the United 
Nations must implement such binding resolutions.38 This Charter-based obligation also 
overrides other obligations under international law. Although the wording of Article 103 of 
the Charter appears to be limited to other treaty obligations, the priority of the Charter 
obligations is generally regarded to apply also vis-&#224;-vis custom and other obligations under 
general international law.39   
</p>
<p>25. Thus, coercive measures taken by States not unilaterally, but on the basis of a United 
Nations Chapter VII resolution may be legally justified even if they contravened treaty 
obligations or customary international law rules per se, unless such contraventions 
amounted to breaches of peremptory norms<i> (jus cogens)</i>.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific coercive measures  
</b></p>
<p>26. Human rights concerns as well as the humanitarian implications of general economic 
sanctions have led the Security Council, and also States when imposing unilateral coercive 
measures, to increasingly adopt so-called targeted or smart sanctions, which are aimed at 
avoiding the indiscriminate effects of general economic sanctions by specifically targeting 
individuals considered to be crucial to the policy decisions that are meant to be influenced 
by the coercive measures.40   
</p>
<p>27. While many human rights and international humanitarian law issues stemming from 
the indiscriminate effect of general economic measures can be avoided by the adoption of 
&#8220;targeted&#8221; sanctions, some novel human rights issues arise in this context. Coercive 
measures, such as the freezing of bank accounts of individual terror suspects or targeted 
regime leaders, may infringe upon their right to a fair trial if they have no or only 
inadequate possibilities to challenge such determinations,41 as well as their rights to privacy

<p>and to property.42 In fact, the targeted effect of such &#8220;individualized&#8221; sanctions may be 
more likely to violate such individual rights than the more diffuse general trade sanctions.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights   
</b></p>
<p>28. The question of how to assess the harmful effects of unilateral coercive measures, in 
particular those of a general nature targeting the economy as a whole, rather than particular 
individuals, on human rights is a difficult one as evidenced by the empirical analysis of 
economic sanctions undertaken by Hufbauer and Schott.43  
</p>
<p>29. Some guidance may be drawn from the replies by Governments expressing their 
views on the implications and negative impacts of unilateral coercive measures on their 
populations in response to a note verbale sent out by OHCHR,44 and reflected in annual 
reports of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>30. The scope of Human Rights Council resolution 15/24 is confined to the impact of 
unilateral coercive measures on human rights. Multilateral measures such as those 
authorized by the United Nations under Chapter VII of the Charter or by the European 
Union, for example, are ipso facto excluded from the ambit of the present study. A key 
analytical challenge comes from the fact that countries are sometimes the target of both 
unilateral and multilateral sanctions, making the distinction of impacts difficult to assess.45 
</p>
<p>31. What is clear is that unilateral coercive measures encompass a range of actions, 
including trade embargoes, financial restrictions, acquisition of property, freezing of assets, 
visa restrictions, and withholding of vital medical supplies and spare parts for various 
machineries. The measures in question often extend extraterritorial application of domestic 
rules, adversely affecting the interests of third States and their nationals.  
</p>
<p>32. Unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions can have far-
reaching implications for the human rights of the general population of target States.46 The

Court held that the applicants&#8223; rights of defence as well as their right to an effective legal remedy had 
in fact been infringed. 
</p>
<p> 42  Ibid., para. 370. The European Court of Justice held that in the circumstances of the case, the 
imposition of the restrictive measures constituted an unjustified restriction of the right to property.

<p> 45 An article published by a group of medical researchers found &#8220;strong evidence that the Gulf war and 
trade sanctions caused a threefold increase in mortality among Iraqi children under five years of age&#8221;. 
The group estimated that an excess of more than 46,900 children died between January and August 
1991. (Alberto Ascherio et. al., &#8220;Effect of the Gulf war on infant and child mortality in Iraq&#8221;, <i>The New 
</i></p>
<p><i>England Journal of Medicine</i>, vol. 327, No. 13 (1992), pp. 931 and 933-934). See also the background 
paper on the human rights impact of the economic sanctions on Iraq, prepared by OHCHR for the 
meeting of the Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs, 5 September 2000, para. 6. 
</p>
<p> 46  The economic measures applied by the United States of America against Cuba have spanned over half 
a century (A/66/272, p. 7). Cuba maintains that these measures have devastating effects on all Cuban 
citizens irrespective of their age, race, sex, religion or social standing (ibid., pp. 7-10). See also Marc 
Bossuyt, &#8220;The adverse consequences of economic sanctions on the enjoyment of human rights&#8221;, 
working paper prepared for the Commission on Human Rights, Sub-Commission on the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2000/33). The paper concluded that the United States 
embargo on Cuba affects human rights in two distinct ways. First, &#8220;the fact that the United States is 
the major regional economic power and the main source of new medicines and technologies means 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>primary victims of these measures are often the most vulnerable classes, including women, 
children, the infirm and older persons, as well as the poor. These groups suffer more 
acutely as a result of denial of access to life-saving equipment and medications, basic food 
products and educational equipment. Others are prevented from joining the job market. 
Thus it has been observed, &#8220;under sanctions, the middle class is eliminated, the poor get 
poorer, and the rich get richer&#8221; as do those &#8220;who take control of smuggling and the black 
market. The Government and elite can actually benefit economically from sanctions, owing 
to this monopoly on illegal trade&#8221; (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2000/33, para. 50). This seems to indicate 
that unilateral coercive measures often have negative impacts that appear to 
disproportionately affect the poor and the vulnerable, the very persons for whom human 
rights principles seek to provide particular safeguards.  
</p>
<p>33. Further, there are several factors to be considered when assessing the impact of 
unilateral coercive measures on human rights in any given country. To begin with, the 
volume and type of trade/finance affected must be looked at very closely. This is because 
restrictions on capital flow and international trade can, in various ways and at different 
levels, reduce national income in the target State. This may exacerbate social problems such 
as unemployment. In addition, the extent of the economic linkage between the sender State 
and the target State should be scrutinized, as it has a direct connection with the gravity of 
the impact. Finding alternative suppliers of essential goods that are subjected to sanctions 
could prove to be costly and slow. Meanwhile, the population may be adversely affected by 
a lack of medication and other basic needs. Unilateral coercive measures tend to have an 
impact on the basic needs of the people, and thus on the enjoyment of their most basic 
human rights. When negative impacts affect the poor, weak and vulnerable, their lack of 
resilience and social protection can exacerbate the impacts further. 
</p>
<p>34. Long-term unilateral coercive measures may result in social problems and raise 
humanitarian concerns in relation to the most vulnerable segments of society. Accounts 
from target States maintain that unilateral coercive measures can adversely affect their job 
markets, impacting rights governed by article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>35. Unilateral coercive measures that impinge on the provision of an adequate standard 
of living, including medical care, food, clothing and housing, would have an impact on the 
implementation of article 25, paragraph 1, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
and of articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights.  
</p>
<p>36. Women appear to be disproportionately affected by the impact of unilateral coercive 
measures, which hinders the implementation of article 2 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Likewise, persons with 
disabilities appear to be disproportionately affected, which hampers the implementation of 
article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>37. Some States view unilateral coercive measures as infringing the right to self-
determination, basing their claim on Articles 1, paragraph 2, and 55 of the Charter of the 
United Nations. Finally, these States note that unilateral coercive measures can also have 
the impact of the deprivation of one&#8223;s means of subsistence, and can constitute an obstacle 
to the realization of the right to development.   
</p>
<p>  
that Cuba is subject to deprivations that impinge on its citizens&#8223; human rights&#8221; (paras. 98-99). Second, 
it found that, by trying to force other countries into embargoing Cuba as well, the Government of the 
United States is attempting to turn a unilateral embargo into a multilateral embargo through coercive 
measures. The paper concluded that the effect of these sanctions will be &#8220;to deepen further the 
suffering of the Cuban people and increase the violation of their human rights&#8221; (para. 100). </p>


<p>38. The High Commissioner for Human Rights notes that even carefully targeted 
sanctions imposed to end gross human rights violations, as part of a wider diplomatic effort 
and preferably in a multilateral framework, must be subject to stringent conditions.47 They 
must be imposed no longer than necessary, be proportional and be subject to appropriate 
human rights safeguards, including human rights impact assessments and monitoring 
conducted by independent experts. In particular, the positive impact that sanctions imposed 
with the objective of protecting human rights can be reasonably expected to have must 
outweigh the negative impact, taking into account the views of the population suffering 
under the human rights violations that gave rise to the sanctions and the impact on the most 
vulnerable parts of society. In this context, it has to be borne in mind that targeted sanctions 
aimed at applying pressure on specific decision-makers bearing responsibility for the 
human rights situation typically have a less harmful impact on the population as a whole 
than measures targeting the economy as a whole.<b>

<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>39.<b> The actions of States in the international arena must be consistent with 
customary international law principles and the Charter of the United Nations as also 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpreted by the International Court of Justice.   
</b></p>
<p>40.<b> States must refrain from adopting unilateral coercive measures that breach 
their human rights obligations under treaty or customary international law.  
</b></p>
<p>41.<b> All States Members of the United Nations should avoid the application of any 
coercive measures having negative effects on human rights, particularly on the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable. Where such measures are imposed, explicit safeguards to protect human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights are imperative.  
</b></p>
<p>42.<b> States are urged to adopt measures ensuring that essential supplies, such as 
medicines and food, are not used as tools for political pressure, and that under no 
</b></p>
<p><b>circumstances should people be deprived of their basic means of survival. These 
</b></p>
<p><b>considerations should also apply in the case of an armed conflict, in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law. As overly broad coercive measures may breach the 
</b></p>
<p><b>most basic human rights, every effort must be made to limit such measures.

 47 See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 8, para. 1: &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>Committee does not in any way call into question the necessity for the imposition of sanctions in 
appropriate cases in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations or other 
applicable international law. But those provisions of the Charter that relate to human rights (Articles 
1, 55 and 56) must still be considered to be fully applicable in such cases.&#8221; See also the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food on his mission to Madagascar (A/HRC/19/59/Add.4, para. 
51), in which the Special Rapporteur takes the position that sanctions, even where otherwise 
legitimate, must comply with human rights, protect the essential core of economic, social and cultural 
rights, and include relevant humanitarian exceptions and procedural safeguards. </p>
