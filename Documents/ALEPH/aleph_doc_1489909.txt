CONDENSED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(An Exploration Stage Company) 
March 31, 2009 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles for the interim financial information with the 
instructions to Form 10-QSB and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they 
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally 
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion 
of the Company's management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal 
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 
 
For further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto 
included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10KSB for the year ended June 
30, 2008. Operating results for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2009 are 
not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year 
ended June 30, 2009. 
 
The Company's fiscal year-end is June 30. 
 
NOTE 2 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
This summary of significant accounting policies of Apolo Gold & Energy, Inc. is 
presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. The 
financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management, 
which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting 
policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements. 
 
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share 
-------------------------------- 
Loss per share was computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of 
shares was calculated by taking the number of shares outstanding and weighting 
them by the amount of time that they were outstanding. Basic and diluted loss 
per share are the same, as inclusion of common stock equivalents would be 
antidilutive. 
 
Going Concern 
------------- 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of 
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has suffered material 
recurring losses from operations since inception. At March 31, 2009, the Company 
had a negative working capital of $428,565 from operations. These factors raise 
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Continuation of the Company is dependent on achieving sufficiently profitable 
operations and possibly obtaining additional financing. Management has and is 
continuing to raise additional capital from various sources. There can be no 
assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital 
should it decide additional capital is required. 
 
The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the 
recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be 
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
Use of Estimates
---------------- 
The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use 
of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities, 
revenues, and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled 
transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, 
upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts. 
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
----------------------------------- 
The carrying amounts for cash, accounts payable and loans payable to related 
parties approximate their fair value due to their short term nature. The Company 
is. Further, not exposed to significant interest, credit or currency risk 
arising from these financial instruments due to their short term nature. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
-------------------------------- 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R, Business Combinations. SFAS 141R 
replaces SFAS 141. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for 
acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way 
assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. It changes the 
recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from 
contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and 
development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related 
costs as incurred. The statement will apply prospectively to business 
combinations occurring in fiscal years beginning November 1, 2009. The Company 
is evaluating the impact adopting SFAS 141R will have on its financial 
statements. 
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Non-controlling Interests in 
Consolidated Financial Statements". This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish 
accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling (minority) interest 
in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a 
non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the 
consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated 
financial statements. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, 
that SFAS No. 160 will have on its financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is 
effective for fiscal years beginning October 1, 2009.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" ("FAS 
161"). FAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments 
and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures 
about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative 
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and 
its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related 
hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and 
cash flows. The guidance in FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued 
for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with 
early application encouraged. This Statement encourages, but does not require, 
comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The Company is 
currently assessing the impact of FAS 161. 
 
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles". SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting 
principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the 
preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are 
presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. This 
statement shall be effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "the Meaning of 
Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". We 
do not expect this adoption will have a material impact on our financial 
statements. 
 
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 163, "Accounting for Financial Guarantee 
Insurance Contracts - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60" ("SFAS 163"). 
SFAS 163 interprets Statement 60 and amends existing accounting pronouncements 
to clarify their application to the financial guarantee insurance contracts 
included within the scope of that statement. SFAS 163 is effective for financial 
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and all 
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating 
the impact of SFAS 163 on its financial statements by does not expect it to have 
a material effect.

NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
Foreign Operations 
------------------ 
The accompanying balance sheet at March 31, 2009 includes $976 of cash in Canada 
and $95,174 of equipment, primarily in Indonesia. This equipment has been fully 
depreciated at June 30, 2008. Although these countries are considered 
economically stable, it is always possible that unanticipated events in foreign 
countries could disrupt the Company's operations. 
 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations 
----------------------------------------- 
The Company's mining activities are subject to laws and regulations controlling 
not only the exploration and mining of mineral properties, but also the effect 
of such activities on the environment. Compliance with such laws and regulations 
may necessitate additional capital outlays, affect the economics of a project, 
and cause changes or delays in the Company's activities. 
 
NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
The Company accrued consulting fees as due to two officers for a total of 
$90,000 for the nine months ending March 31, 2009. 
 
On October 2, 2008, a director submitted his resignation as a director of the 
Company. In addition, the director submitted an invoice for services of $24,000 
that the Company does not recognize as there was no agreement and no 
authorization for said expense.

ITEM 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
         Results of Operations 
 
 
General Overview 
 
Apolo Gold & Energy Inc. ("Company") was incorporated in March 1997 under the 
laws of the State of Nevada. Its objective was to pursue mineral properties in 
South America, Central America, North America and Asia. The Company incorporated 
a subsidiary - Compania Minera Apologold, C.A in Venezuela to develop a 
gold/diamond mining concession in Southeastern Venezuela. Project was terminated 
in August 2001, due to poor testing results and the property abandoned. This 
subsidiary company has been inactive since 2001 and will not be reactivated. 
 
On April 16, 2002, the Company announced the acquisition of the mining rights to 
a property known as the Napal Gold Property, ("NUP"). This property is located 
48 km south-west of Bandar Lampung, Sumatra, Indonesia. The property consisted 
of 733.9 hectares and possesses a Production Permit (a KP) # KW. 098PP325. 
 
The terms of the Napal Gold Property called for a total payment of $375,000 US 
over a six-year period of which a total of $250,000 have been made to date. 
Company paid $250,000 over the past 5 years and subsequent to the year ending 
June 30, 2008 the Company terminated its agreement on the NUP property and 
returned all exploration rights to the owner. 
 
The Company continues to pursue opportunities in the natural resource industry 
and will consider an investment in any other energy related business in order to 
create value. 
 
At March 31, 2009, the Company had funds on hand of $976. 
 
The Company recognizes that it does not have sufficient funds on hand to finance 
its operations on an ongoing basis. The Company further recognizes that it is 
dependent on the ability of its management team to obtain the necessary working 
capital in order to complete projects started and operate successfully. There is 
no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital as 
required, or if the capital is available, to obtain it on terms favorable to the 
Company. The Company may suffer from a lack of liquidity in the future that 
could impair its exploration efforts and adversely affect its results of 
operations. 
 
 
Results of Operations 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
In the nine months ended March 31, 2009, the Company incurred a loss of $9,737 
vs. a loss of $ $148,991 for the nine months ended March 31, 2008. Company 
operations benefited from the forgiveness of $136,020 in accounts payable. 
Expenses in the nine months ending March 31, 2009 amounted to $145,757, compared 
to expenses incurred in the nine months ending March 31, 2008 of $148,991. 
Consulting fees were vertually unchanged at $135,074 vs. $116,380 as a result of 
expenses incurred in the continuation of investigating and evaluating business 
opportunities in the energy field. General and administrative expenses in the 
nine months ending March 31, 2009 amounted to $10,682 vs. $32,434 for the nine 
months ending March 31, 2008. The main reason for the reduction in costs is

Item 4. Controls and procedures 
 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to 
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act 
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions 
regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure 
controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company's disclosure controls 
and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of 
reaching the Company's desired disclosure control objectives. In designing and 
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that 
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can 
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, 
and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the 
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company's 
certifying officer has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and 
procedures are effective in reaching that level of assurance. 
 
As of the end of the period being reported upon, the Company carried out an 
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's 
management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's 
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the 
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the 
Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls or in other 
factors that have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the internal 
controls subsequent to the date the Company completed its evaluation.
