<p><b>7/&#8230;  Human rights and climate change 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>that climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and 
communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights, </p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that climate change is a global problem and that it requires a global solution, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the findings of the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, including, that the warming of the climate system is unequivocal and that most 
of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is likely 
to have been human-induced,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change<b>1</b> remains 
the comprehensive global framework to deal with climate-change issues, reaffirming the 
principles of the Framework Convention as contained in article 3 thereof, and welcoming the 
decisions of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, held in Bali, Indonesia, in 
December 2007, and in particular the adoption of the Bali Action Plan, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the right to development was reaffirmed in the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a 
universal and inalienable right and as an integral part of fundamental human rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development 
and that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet the development and 
environmental needs of present and future generations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also </i>that the world&#8217;s poor are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate 
change, in particular those concentrated in high-risk areas, and also tend to have more limited 
adaptation capacities, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/62/276, annex 1. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recognizing further</i> that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with 
low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, 
and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the 
adverse effects of climate change, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the relevant provisions of declarations, resolutions and programmes of action 
adopted by major United Nations conferences, summits and special sessions and their follow-up 
meetings, in particular Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 
and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Johannesburg Plan of 
Implementation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/60 of 20 April 2005 on 
human rights and the environment as part of sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> Human Rights Council resolution 6/27 of 14 December 2007 on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and in particular 
paragraph 3 thereof, and Council decision 2/104 of 27 November 2006 on human rights and 
access to water, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking</i> <i>note</i> of the contribution provided by special procedures of the Council in 
examining and advancing the understanding of the link between the enjoyment of human rights 
and the protection of environment,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> <i>also</i> of the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health to the General Assembly<b>2</b> which include a call for the Council to 
study the impact of climate change on human rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, in consultation with and taking into account the views of States, other relevant 
international organizations and intergovernmental bodies, including the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  A/62/214. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>Change and other stakeholders, to conduct, within existing resources, a detailed analytical study 
of the relationship between climate change and human rights, to be submitted to the Council 
prior to its tenth session; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages</i> States to contribute to the study conducted by the Office of the High 
Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> to consider the issue at its tenth session under agenda item 3, and thereafter 
to make available the study, together with a summary of the debate held during its tenth session, 
to the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
for its consideration.
