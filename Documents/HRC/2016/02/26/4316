<p><b>  16/&#8230;  Enforced or involuntary disappearances  
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that protect the right of life, the 
right of liberty and security of the person, the right not to be subjected to torture and the 
right to recognition as a person before the law,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 
February 1980, in which the Commission decided to establish a working group of five 
members to serve as experts in their individual capacity and to examine questions relevant 
to enforced or involuntary disappearance, and reaffirming all previous resolutions on this 
subject, in particular Human Rights Council resolution 7/12 of 27 March 2008, in which the 
Council renewed by consensus the mandate of the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, by which the 
Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances as a body of principles for States, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the entry into force of the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearances on 23 December 2010 and the fact that eighty 
eight States have signed it and twenty three States have ratified or acceded to it, and 
recognizing that its implementation will be a significant contribution to end impunity and to 
the promotion and the protection of all human rights for all,  
</p>

<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> <i>in particular</i> by the increase in enforced or involuntary 
disappearances in various regions of the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, 
when these are part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number 
of reports concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of 
disappearances or relatives of persons who have disappeared,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the Convention sets out the right of victims to truth regarding the 
circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and the result of the investigation 
and the fate of disappeared person, and sets forth State party obligations to take appropriate 
measures in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> of the general comment of the Working Group on the 
right to the truth with regard to enforced disappearances,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the fact that acts of enforced disappearance are crimes against 
humanity, as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> of the general comment of the Working Group on 
enforced disappearances as a crime of continuous nature and, in this regard, recalling the 
relevant provisions of the Convention and the Declaration,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the decision of the General Assembly to declare 30 August International 
Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances and its call upon Member States, the 
United Nations system and other international and regional organizations, as well as civil 
society, to observe this day,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that many Governments have cooperated with the Working Group,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1, entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council&#8221;, and 5/2, entitled &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures 
Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council&#8221;, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the 
mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and the 
annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p> 1.  <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet signed, ratified or acceded to the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances to 
consider doing so as a matter of priority, and to consider as well the option provided for in 
articles 31 and 32 of the Convention regarding the Committee on Enforced Disappearances;  
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Notes</i> that 2012 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the 
General Assembly of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance,1 and encourages all States to translate the Declaration into their languages 
in order to assist its global dissemination and the ultimate goal of prevention of enforced 
disappearances; <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 3.  <i>Takes note with satisfaction</i> of the report of the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances on best practices on enforced disappearances in domestic 
criminal legislation,2 and encourages States to give due consideration to the good practices 
identified in the report;  
</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Working Group for a further period of 
three years, in conformity with the terms set forth in the Human Rights Council resolution 
7/12;  
</p>

<p> 5.  <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not provided for a long period of time substantive 
replies concerning claims of enforced disappearances in their countries to do so, and to give 
due consideration to relevant recommendations concerning this issue made by the Working 
Group in its reports;  
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Notes with concern</i> that, according to the Working Group, it has insufficient 
resources to effectively exercise its mandate, particularly in relation to human resources, 
where there is an acute need,3 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the 
Working Group receives all the assistance and resources it requires to fulfil its mandate;  
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of the question of enforced disappearances 
in accordance with its programme of work<i>.</i>
