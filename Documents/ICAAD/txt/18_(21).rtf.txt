4.      
THE LAW ON ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM

4.1     
In so far as it applies, section 245 of the Penal Code states:

"245- Any person who commits an assault occasioning actual bodily harm is guilty of misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment for five years."

4.2     
The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements: 

a.      
The accused

b.      
Committed an assault on the complainant PW1

c.      
Thereby occasioned actual bodily harm to PW1

The standard of proof

 In State v Seniloli [2004] FJHC 48; HAC0028.2003S (5 August 2004) Her Ladyship Justice Nazhat Shameem told to assessors (summing up):

"The standard of proof in a criminal is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means that you must be satisfied so that you feel sure of the guilt of the accused persons before you express an opinion that they are guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt as to whether the accused persons committed the offence charged against the each of them on the information, then it is your duty to express an opinion that the accused are not guilty. It is only if you are satisfied so that you feel sure of their guilty that you must express an opinion that they are guilty. One of the defence counsels asked you if you had the slightest doubt about the accused's guilt. That is not the correct test. The correct test is whether you have any reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused."

5.      
ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE

5.1     
Element 4.2 (a), as outlined above, is not disputed by the accused and therefore will not be discussed in this analysis.

5.2     
The accused however strongly dispute element 4.2 (b), the element of assault.

5.3     
As stated in paragraph 2.3 (c) above, PW1 stated in evidence that the accused came from behind and started beating PW1. He slapped PW1. She then ran off to her mother (PW2) crying. The tried to pick up a knife which was in the kitchen. PW2 prevented it.

5.4     
PW2 stated in evidence that PW1 came running to the kitchen and the accused was after PW1. PW2 further stated that her daughter (PW1) told her (PW2) that the accused is hitting. In cross examination PW2 told that her daughter and the son in law always fighting and that day PW1 came running from the road side and she was crying.

5.5     
PW3 stated in evidence that he saw the accused assaulting a girl on the road side. He was told that they are husband and wife. PW3 told that the accused was punching on the face. In cross examination he confirmed that what he said in court is true.

5.6     
Medical Examination report issued in respect of PW1 confirms that the victim had membrane at forearm. The doctor in Summary and Conclusion paragraph states that this membrane might have been caused by a pinching.

5.7     
The accused stated in evidence that he did not assault PW1 and on that day at about 9.00 am he made a police complaint at Navai Police Station that he is leaving his wife's place. He did not relate the incident that happened in the morning at about 7.00 am.

6. CONCLUSION

6.1     
Evidence of PW1 has been sufficiently corroborated by the evidence of PW2 and PW3 so as to remove all reasonable doubts. The Medical Report confirms that PW1 had membrane at the forearm.

6.2     
The evidence of the accused is not plausible. He merely denied the charge.

6.3     
The prosecution has succeeded in proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused assaulted and thereby occasioned actual bodily harm to PW1.

6.4     
I therefore find the accused as charged on assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
