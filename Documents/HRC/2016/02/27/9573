</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since 1994, annual meetings of special rapporteurs/representatives, experts and 
chairpersons of working groups of the special procedures and the advisory services programme 
of the Commission on Human Rights have been organized as a follow-up to the World 
Conference on Human Rights.  The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action underlined the 
importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures and specified that 
the procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work 
through periodic meetings (Part II, para. 95).   
</p>
<p>2. The thirteenth annual meeting of special procedures was held in Geneva from 19 
to 23 June 2006.  It had before it a provisional annotated agenda and a series of documents 
prepared by the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>3. A list of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights and those attending 
the thirteenth annual meeting appears in annex I. 
</p>
<p>4. Mandate-holders participated in the opening ceremony of the first session of the Human 
Rights Council.  During the meeting, mandate-holders held meetings with representatives of 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and national institutions, and a joint meeting with 
participants at the eighteenth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies.  
Participants further met with the High Commissioner, the Deputy High Commissioner and 
OHCHR senior managers.  Mandate-holders also had an exchange with the Special Rapporteur 
on human rights defenders of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.  The 
Chair of the Coordination Committee held an exchange of views with the Human Rights Council 
at its first session.   
</p>
<p>5. On the occasion of International Refugees Day, on 20 June, participants called on the 
international community to strengthen its support to the United Nations Office of the 
High Commissioner for Refugees and to assist post-conflict societies to guarantee respect for all 
human rights:  civil, cultural, economic, political and social, so as to allow for a safe return of 
refugees to their home countries.   
</p>
<p>6. Participants further welcomed the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture.   
</p>
<p><b>I.  ORGANIZATION OF WORK 
</b></p>
<p>7. The meeting was opened by Philip Alston, the Chairperson of the twelfth annual meeting, 
who emphasized the importance of the thirteenth meeting as a crossroads for the special 
procedures in their relationship with the new Human Rights Council.   
</p>
<p>8. Vitit Muntarbhorn was elected Chairperson and Gay McDougall was elected Rapporteur 
of the thirteenth annual meeting.  It was suggested that ahead of the fourteenth annual meeting 
consultations be undertaken for the nomination of the Chair and Rapporteur of the meeting.  The 
desirability of including an interaction with United Nations agencies in the programme of the 
fourteenth meeting was flagged.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. It was agreed that the Coordination Committee for 2006/07 would consist of:  
Vitit Muntarbhorn (Chairperson of the thirteenth meeting), Gay McDougall (Rapporteur 
of the thirteenth meeting), Philip Alston (ex-officio member), Charlotte Abaka, 
Amada Benavides de Perez and Asma Jahangir.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. The next annual meeting is scheduled to take place from 18 to 22 June 2007.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. The participants adopted the present report on 23 June 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE  
COORDINATION COMMITTEE 
</b></p>
<p>12. The outgoing chair of the Coordination Committee briefed participants on the activities 
of the Committee.  He reported on an exchange held by members of the Committee with the 
High Commissioner the previous day, during which the role of special procedures in the context 
of the Human Rights Council and the universal periodic review (UPR) was addressed.   
</p>
<p>13. Concerning the Manual of the United Nations Human Rights Special Procedures, which 
was adopted by the annual meeting in 1999, the Coordination Committee had worked on an 
initial revision and updated the Manual to reflect the evolving practice of special procedures.  
The Manual is intended to be a living document to be updated regularly.  It is meant to provide 
guidance to mandate-holders.  It was decided that after a preliminary discussion at the present 
annual meeting, mandate-holders, in a spirit of transparency, would call for comments on the 
draft from Governments, civil society organizations, treaty bodies&#8217; experts and all other 
stakeholders in a period of four months.  The Committee would then go through the different 
comments to revise the Manual accordingly.  It would also issue an explanatory memorandum on 
major approaches in the comments, as well as reactions to them.  The new draft would be 
circulated a month ahead of the fourteenth meeting, which should adopt the new Manual.  The 
new Manual would be made public for reasons of transparency.  Some participants stressed that 
the circulation of the Manual would also serve educational purposes and would raise awareness 
about the role of special procedures.   
</p>
<p>14. The majority of participants expressed support for a stronger and more proactive role for 
the Coordination Committee which would facilitate the interaction between special procedures 
and the Human Rights Council and increase synergies between mandate-holders.  It would also 
ensure that mandate-holders speak with one voice, which is particularly important at a time 
where fundamental reforms, which could have an impact on the role of special procedures, are 
being discussed.  Some participants stressed that, while it was agreeable that there should be a 
mechanism of coordination, this should not lead to conformity.   
</p>
<p>15. There was general agreement on the following points:  the outgoing chair of the 
Coordination Committee, or another member, should become an ex officio member of the 
Committee; due consideration should be given to geographical representation and gender balance 
in the elections of members; there should be a rotation system; the Committee should be 
appointed for a one-year term; in case of vacancies, these should be filled through electronic </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>consultations with all mandate-holders; the Committee would as appropriate seek advice and 
assistance from other mandate-holders; the Committee should not be a substitute for bilateral 
consultations between mandate-holders and other institutions; the Committee should respect the 
independence of mandate-holders; and the Committee should circulate updates on its activities 
through e-mail.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. In terms of the functions to be performed by the Coordination Committee, several 
proposals were made, including:  the participation of the Committee in consultations regarding 
the review of mandates; bringing into the discussion with the Human Rights Council the 
concerns of mandate-holders, including the issue of cooperation with special procedures; 
advocating for more resources for special procedures in the context of the reform; identifying 
innovative ways to raise awareness about special procedures and their work; taking action in a 
proactive manner to ensure that the &#8220;rationalization&#8221; of mandates does not result in an erosion of 
the effectiveness of the system. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE SPECIAL PROCEDURES SYSTEM AND  
THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
</b></p>
<p>17. Participants welcomed the fact that the timing of the thirteenth annual meeting coincided 
with the first session of the Human Rights Council.  Participants were briefed by the Secretariat 
on latest developments at the Council.  They were informed of existing proposals concerning the 
extension of mandates and the consideration of reports submitted by mandate-holders at the 
sixty-second session of the Commission.   
</p>
<p>18. Under this agenda item, participants discussed the relationship of the special procedures 
system with the Council, including in the context of the UPR and of the review of mandates.  All 
mandate-holders unequivocally stressed the need to ensure that a system of special procedures is 
maintained and strengthened.  Special procedures were indicated repeatedly as a fundamental 
pillar of the international human rights machinery. 
</p>
<p>19. The need to ensure that special procedures would be central to the UPR system while at 
the same time maintaining their autonomy and independence was strongly underscored.  In this 
context, participants emphasized the role that the Coordination Committee should play as an 
interlocutor of the special procedures in their relations with the Human Rights Council.   
</p>
<p>20. Participants agreed to draft a statement to be read by the Chairperson during its 
interaction with the Council (see annex II).  In the statement, participants welcomed the 
establishment of the Council as a window of opportunity to enhance the promotion and 
protection of human rights.  They also welcomed General Assembly resolution 60/251 on the 
Human Rights Council, calling for the maintenance of a system of special procedures and 
expressed the wish to be actively involved with the process of review that will take place this 
year.   
</p>
<p>21. Mandate-holders requested the Council to directly and effectively interact with the 
special procedures by expeditiously examining the mission reports submitted by 
mandate-holders; responding swiftly to early warnings of impending egregious violations; 
providing, during its plenary sessions, for at least a one-hour interactive dialogue with each 
mandate-holder; effectively involving special procedures mandates-holders in early-warning </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>initiatives as well as in thematic debates and emergency sessions; and encouraging its members 
to respond to each specific recommendation made by special procedures mandate-holders in 
their reports.   
</p>
<p>22. Mandate-holders also requested that the work of the special procedures be central (among 
others) to the system of universal periodic review (UPR), inter alia by ensuring that the measure 
of cooperation given to special procedures is a central criteria used to assess States in the spirit of 
cooperation and constructive dialogue called for in General Assembly resolution 60/251 on the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>23. Mandate-holders invited the Council to encourage States to strengthen cooperation with 
special procedures by calling on States to:  extend standing invitations; promptly provide 
substantive replies to special procedures&#8217; communications; promptly respond to requests for 
country visits; and implement the recommendations submitted after the visit. 
</p>
<p>24. Finally, mandate-holders requested the Human Rights Council to become an active 
participant in monitoring and urging State implementation of recommendations emerging from 
mandate-holders&#8217; mission reports and communications and to recognize the fundamental role of 
NGOs, regional and national human rights institutions as key partners of the Council and special 
procedures.   
</p>
<p>25. During the exchange of views with the Human Rights Council, which took place 
on 23 June 2006, almost all delegations reiterated that special procedures were an essential 
element of the human rights system and that the Council would greatly benefit from their 
expertise and expert advice.  It was repeatedly stated by Governments&#8217; delegations as well as 
NGOs that the reform should be guided by the principles of impartiality, independence and 
expertise.  A number of NGOs urged States to ensure that review would focus on strengthening 
the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>26. The crucial importance of maintaining the independence of the special procedures system 
was highlighted.  Some delegations also stressed that special procedures, in order to function 
effectively, needed the cooperation of States, in particular in the context of country visits and 
responses to communications.  In this connection members of the Council were called upon to 
extend open invitations to all special procedures.  It was stressed that follow-up to special 
procedures&#8217; findings and recommendations should represent an important element of UPR.  The 
need to ensure closer cooperation between procedures, including in the context of country visits, 
so as to ensure broader geographic coverage, was flagged.   
</p>
<p>27. A number of delegations stressed the need to ensure that the review of mandates 
addressed issues such as selectivity, politicization and double standards.  The need to avoid 
duplications was also emphasized.  The revised Manual was welcomed by delegations as a 
positive step.  The need to ensure more coherence in the methods of work and to ensure 
independence from all stake-holders was raised by some delegations.  The need to improve the 
appointment procedures was also raised. 
</p>
<p>28. Several delegations welcomed the involvement of the Coordination Committee in the 
discussions on the reform.  It was suggested that periodic meetings between the Committee and 
regional groups should be held. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. FOLLOW-UP TO THE ACTIVITIES OF MANDATE-HOLDERS  
AND COMMUNICATION STRATEGY 
</b></p>
<p>29. Under this agenda item, participants addressed the issues of follow-up to their activities 
and of a strengthened communication strategy.  Discussions were based on recommendations 
adopted by the twelfth annual meeting.   
</p>
<p>30. The Secretariat briefed participants on efforts undertaken to improve the communication 
strategy, including through the establishment of a Communication Section at OHCHR.  Efforts 
to increase awareness of special procedures&#8217; activities were directly linked to the promotion of 
follow-up, through ensuring that special procedures&#8217; output are known and available to key 
players and are used as advocacy and programming tools.  In this respect the Secretariat had 
been working on a number of initiatives.  They included the preparation of country analysis and 
trends based on the activities of all special procedures to feed into the overall OHCHR country 
engagement strategy; the preparation of thematic trends and statistics for internal analysis, as 
well as circulation to partners in the field; the preparation and circulation among 
mandate-holders and OHCHR staff of weekly briefing notes on the activities of mandate-holders 
and monthly bulletin and statistics on communications, as well as &#8220;success stories&#8221;; the 
preparation of quarterly bulletins, posted on the OHCHR website and distributed to a network of 
partners, on the activities of mandate-holders.  The Office was also working on a training module 
for different partners, including OHCHR staff, and United Nations partners; NGOs; professional 
groups with the objective to build capacities to cooperate with the special procedures system.  
OHCHR maintained websites for special procedures as a system and for each mandate-holder. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Communications strategy 
</b></p>
<p>31. Participants emphasized the need to ensure broad circulation of press releases, as well as 
the desirability of having interviews with United Nations radio services during country missions 
to make their findings widely known.  It was pointed out that it would be useful to assess the 
extent to which the work of special procedures was covered by the media.  The need to ensure 
that the information on the findings of visits filters down to the rights-holders was raised, as well 
as the need to ensure that country visit reports, as soon as available, are broadly circulated to all 
partners and key players at the national level.  Some good practices were reported in this regard, 
including Governments&#8217; cooperation in translating reports into national languages and ensuring 
dissemination through various channels.   
</p>
<p>32. In order to make the website more informative, it was suggested that the information 
included in the internal analytical tools developed by the Secretariat be posted on the web.  It 
was suggested that a medium-term study be undertaken by OHCHR to envisage ways to make 
the wealth of information produced by special procedures more easily accessible. 
</p>
<p>33. In order to ensure that the mandate-holders can always be reached by relevant partners it 
was suggested that general e-mail addresses should be created for each mandate.  It was also 
suggested that access should be given to such accounts to mandate-holders in order to allow 
them to be more closely involved in the communications with partners. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>34. When discussing &#8220;follow-up&#8221;, the need for streamlined procedures for sending 
communications was raised by several mandate-holders.  The need for a closer cooperation with 
United Nations country teams was pointed out as a crucial element to ensure follow-up and 
implementation of recommendations, as well as the need to ensure that prior to country visits key 
players and interlocutors are identified.  One country rapporteur reported that the United Nations 
country team had organized a follow-up workshop on her report during which key national 
players discussed the recommendations and developed a plan of action based on them.  The need 
of a system whereby mandate-holders are informed by United Nations agencies of activities to 
implement their recommendations was flagged.   
</p>
<p>35. Other possible ways to enhance the effectiveness of special procedures by promoting 
follow-up to their recommendations and actions were mentioned.  Among them, there was a 
proposal to rethink the period during which communications remain confidential, especially 
given the changing periodicity of the Council.  Making the communications known soon after 
the deadline for responding has expired would allow national actors to follow up on them when 
they are still relevant.  The need to draft communications in a more effective way was also 
raised.  Participants also stressed the need to ensure that the recommendations contained in their 
reports be specific, targeted and prioritized. 
</p>
<p>36. Participants congratulated the five mandate-holders who had worked on the report on the 
Guant&#225;namo detention centre (E/CN.4/2006/120):  the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, Leila Zerrougui; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy; the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak; the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir; and the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
Paul Hunt.  Participants noted with satisfaction that the report had prompted a series of reactions 
that led to encouraging indications about the possible closure of the detention centre.  The group 
called upon the relevant mandate-holders to continue to contribute in every constructive way 
possible for the resolution of the issue. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONSULTATIONS WITH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>37. Under this agenda item participants had an open discussion with representatives of the 
civil society on the role of the special procedures in the context of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>38. In their statements several NGOs stressed that the reform process and the review of 
mandates represented great opportunities to strengthen the special procedures system, but also 
great risks.  All NGOs expressed their strong support to the special procedures system and to 
mandate-holders.  They emphasized the need to work together to ensure that the review process 
to be undertaken by the Human Rights Council would result in a strengthened role of thematic 
and geographic mandates. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>39. It was highlighted that the Human Rights Council would have to address not only each 
individual mandate but also the nature, structure and functioning of the system.  It was argued 
that the Council should not embark on the review of mandates until it had established sound 
objective criteria on the basis of which such a review should be undertaken.   
</p><p>40. Concerning the numerous and complex issues to be addressed in the context of the 
review, representatives of civil society would be presenting concrete proposals to the Council 
and share already existing documents with mandate-holders.  It was stressed that 
mandate-holders should also have a collective position with regard to these fundamental issues 
and embark in a dialogue with the Council with a view to strongly defending the fundamental 
principles that have successfully guided the special procedures system.  In this context the role of 
the Coordination Committee was emphasized by many participants.  Mandate-holders were in 
particular invited to think about ways in which they would like the Human Rights Council to 
consider their reports, and the type of interaction which would be desirable during the Council&#8217;s 
sessions; the periodicity of reports; and the type of outcome of the discussions of the latter.  It 
was reiterated that in the context of the review of mandates it was crucial to consider the issue of 
follow-up and implementation, in particular it had to be considered how special procedures could 
assist the Council in follow-up and vice versa.   
</p>
<p>41. The importance of ensuring the integration of special procedures&#8217; findings and 
recommendations into the work of the Human Rights Council was repeatedly raised.  The work 
of special procedures should in particular not only be integrated in UPR, but also into the other 
activities of the Council, including when it addresses gross human rights violations or, provides 
emergency responses and technical cooperation.  For special procedures&#8217; work to be able to feed 
into the work of the Human Rights Council there was, on the one hand, a need to ensure 
cooperation from Member States in allowing special procedures&#8217; visits and responding promptly 
to their communications and, on the other, a need for special procedures to adjust their methods 
of work so as to be able to provide regularly qualitative and quantitative assessment of 
cooperation on communications and on visit requests, as well as to formulate strategic and 
precise recommendations indicating a time frame for implementation.  It was suggested that, in 
order to ensure that the wealth of information produced by mandate-holders is properly utilized 
by all stakeholders, there should be a compilation of communications submitted by special 
procedures by country.   
</p>
<p>42. A representative of a national human rights institution (NHRIs) stressed how beneficial 
the cooperation between special procedures and NHRIs is for both actors and provided concrete 
examples of such cooperation.  In particular they emphasized the role that NHRIs can have in 
ensuring outreach during and after country visits and in providing follow-up to special 
procedures&#8217; recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. The following issues were stressed by various representatives of the civil society as 
deserving specific attention from special procedures:  human rights violations based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity; gender equality; the rights of indigenous peoples; and women in 
prison and children of imprisoned mothers. 
</p>
<p>44. Numerous mandate-holders intervened to express deep appreciation for the support 
received in the performance of their duties by the civil society and to thank NGOs for their 
partnership for human rights protection and assistance in granting access to those affected.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Mandate-holders warmly thanked representatives of the civil society for the fruitful suggestions 
brought forward during the debate.  In response to such suggestions some mandate-holders 
stressed that there was a need to work together to ensure that United Nations reform and the 
review of mandates would result in a strengthened special procedures system.  To this end the 
desirability of more regular consultations was flagged.   
</p>
<p>45. Mandate-holders also referred to their efforts to strengthen their methods of work and 
emphasized that they welcomed constructive criticism from civil society partners.  
Representatives of civil society were informed that mandate-holders would soon make a call for 
comments on their revised Manual.  One mandate-holder invited NGOs to work together and in a 
holistic manner on issues such as the reform and the role of special procedures and civil society 
within the Human Rights Council.  NGOs were repeatedly invited to assist mandate-holders in 
disseminating their reports and findings.  Some mandate-holders proposed to formulate a 
comprehensive position paper addressing the role of special procedures within the Council and 
addressing all the issues mentioned by participants in this exchange. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. PRESENTATION BY THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
SECRETARY-GENERAL ON CHILDREN AND ARMED CONFLICT 
</b></p>
<p>46. Under this agenda item, participants were briefed by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on children and armed conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy, on the activities of 
her mandate and discussed possible avenues of cooperation and mutual support.   
</p>
<p>47. The Special Representative reported that the mandate was created in 1997 by the 
General Assembly to look at the impact of armed conflict on children.  The mandate reports to 
the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly and the Security Council.  The Special 
Representative reported that, according to available statistics, some 300,000 minors were being 
exploited as child soldiers in 30 areas of conflict around the world, while 10 per cent of world 
armed forces continued to be children.  The International Criminal Court (ICC) Statute provides 
for the prosecution for acts of forced recruitment and the Special Representative&#8217;s Office is 
cooperating with ICC on a number of prosecutions.   
</p>
<p>48. The Special Representative referred to Security Council resolution 1539 (2004) listing 
grave violations against children during armed conflicts:  the recruitment and use of child 
soldiers by parties to armed conflicts; killing and maiming of children; rape and other sexual 
violence mostly committed against girls; abduction and forced displacement; denial of 
humanitarian access to children; attacks against schools and hospitals; and trafficking, forced 
labour and all forms of slavery.  The resolution also provides for the Secretary-General&#8217;s report 
to contain two lists, those of parties to conflict engaged in recruitment of children that are in the 
Security Council agenda and those that are not.  The resolution also provides for the possibility 
to move towards punitive actions, including targeted sanctions, if these parties do not conform. 
</p>
<p>49. Security Council resolution 1612 (2005) further set up a monitoring and reporting 
mechanism.  In each of the countries where parties are listed, there is a task force chaired by 
UNICEF or OHCHR collecting information on violations against children in the context of 
armed conflicts.  It includes also NGOs and NHRIs.  The information can then be channelled </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>through the Office of the Special Representative to the Secretary-General and through him to the 
Security Council.  A Security Council&#8217;s working group meets every two months to look at the 
reports from the Office of the Special Representative.  The Working Group can suggest punitive 
action against non-complying parties to the Security Council.  The need to ensure that due 
process be guaranteed in the context of the procedure was stressed.   
</p>
<p>50. The Special Representative invited mandate-holders to assist in the described monitoring 
and reporting process, especially during country visits, in terms both of information sharing and 
advocacy.   
</p>
<p>51. Mandate-holders welcomed the briefing by the Special Representative and plead for close 
cooperation with her.  They stressed the importance of ensuring coordination and mutual 
assistance.  In this context it was suggested that a mechanism be established to consistently alert 
the Special Representative&#8217;s Office when mandate-holders undertake visits to countries where 
there are listed parties.  The desirability of looking at the monitoring mechanisms adopted by the 
Security Council, as a concept to be possibly replicated in other areas, was also flagged.   
</p>
<p>52. The special rapporteur on human rights defenders of the African Commission on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights, Reine Alpini Gansou, also addressed the meeting.  In her presentation she 
stressed the importance of her close cooperation with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders.  She referred to the fact that the African 
Commission has currently five rapporteurs:  detention in prisons; freedom of expression; 
women&#8217;s rights; refugees and IDPs; and human rights defenders.  Her mandate was tasked with 
seeking, receiving, examining and acting upon information on the situation of human rights 
defenders in Africa; submitting reports at every ordinary session of the African Commission; 
cooperating and engaging in dialogue with Member States, national human rights institutions, 
relevant intergovernmental bodies, international and regional mechanisms for protection of 
human rights defenders, human rights defenders and other stakeholders; developing and 
recommending effective strategies to better protect human rights defenders; raising awareness 
and promoting the implementation in Africa of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders.   
</p>
<p>53. Mandate-holders warmly welcomed the presence of the special rapporteur of the African 
Commission and flagged the idea of establishing networks of regional mechanisms working on 
similar or related issues and strengthening cooperation and coordination with them.  The 
possibility of considering the participation of such partners in future annual meetings, as well as 
of establishing institutional links to ensure joint activities were also mentioned. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  COOPERATION WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY BODIES  
</b></p>
<p>54. Under this agenda item, participants had an opportunity to meet with the Chairpersons of 
treaty bodies and to exchange views on the current reform system.  
</p>
<p>55. Representatives of both special procedures and treaty bodies expressed satisfaction about 
the existing level of mutual cooperation and coordination.  Specific examples of cooperation 
with regard to exchange of information on specific countries, as well as concerning the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>formulation of general comments/recommendations by treaty bodies were reported.  The 
importance of building on each other&#8217;s recommendations was stressed by many participants.  
The possibility for special procedures mandate-holders of submitting written information and 
proposing issues for consideration to treaty bodies prior to their sessions was flagged by one 
mandate-holder. 
</p>
<p>56. Participants emphasized how the creation of the Human Rights Council called for even 
increased complementarity of the work of the two mechanisms.  The need to ensure increased 
personal interaction was stressed, including by providing for relevant mandate-holders to address 
the treaty bodies directly on the occasion of the review of reports of States in which they have a 
specific interest.  The role of the Secretariat in ensuring exchange of information between treaty 
bodies and special procedures was highlighted.  In this regard, it was suggested that a 
compilation of good practices be prepared annually.   
</p>
<p>57. Concerning the proposal for a unified standing treaty body, some participants expressed 
concerns that this might dilute the specificities of the work of the individual committees.  
However, other participants saw the creation of a unified standing treaty body as a positive step 
towards the creation of a world court of human rights.  Other participants expressed the view 
that, while continuing to take measures to harmonize and streamline treaty bodies&#8217; procedures, 
such as the common guidelines for the submission of reports, there was a need to maintain 
substantive specificities.  One proposal in this sense was to have a unified standing body to deal 
with individual complaints, so as to reduce delays in consideration of complaints and ensure a 
consistent jurisprudence, while maintaining the existing committees to review reports and to 
undertake inquiries. 
</p>
<p>58. It was repeatedly stressed that one of the main shortcomings of both the special 
procedures and the treaty bodies&#8217; systems was the lack of follow-up to their findings and 
recommendations, especially by the main political bodies of the United Nations.  The Human 
Rights Council was seen as a window of opportunity to remedy this shortcoming.  In this 
connection several participants stressed that the Universal Periodic Review should be understood 
not as States assessing the human rights situation in other States, but rather as States assessing 
the degree to which other States implement the decisions and recommendations of independent 
expert bodies.  The Council should count on existing human rights mechanisms to perform 
fact-finding and normative assessment functions, while focusing on implementation.  This would 
address the issues of possible duplication of UPR with the work of treaty bodies and also prevent 
UPR from becoming an appeals body for those States whose compliance with human rights 
treaties has already been reviewed by relevant treaty bodies.  The role of the High Commissioner 
in promoting UPR as a forum for follow-up was emphasized. 
</p>
<p>59. It was recommended that a joint letter be prepared calling upon the Human Rights 
Council to ensure that UPR has as at least one of its core sources of information the findings and 
recommendations of treaty bodies and special procedures, and to develop a review system that 
strengthens the implementation of those recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VIII. MEETING WITH THE HIGH COMMISSIONER AND  
PRESENTATION OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER&#8217;S  
STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT PLAN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Exchange with the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>60. In her opening remarks, the High Commissioner expressed her appreciation and 
admiration for the courage and achievements of special procedures.  The High Commissioner 
stressed that, while in the past couple of years the main focus had been on the establishment of 
the Human Rights Council and on devising a strategy for her Office, &#8220;this would be the year of 
special procedures&#8221; and during the year to come the focus would switch to them.  The High 
Commissioner stressed that all efforts would be made to ensure that the necessary resources 
would be made available to special procedures.   
</p>
<p>61. In the context of the current reform, the High Commissioner stressed that special 
procedures had her full support.  She called on mandate-holders to collectively make the case not 
just for the preservation, but also for the improvement, of the special procedures system.  There 
was a widespread view that the system of special procedures needed to be strengthened to ensure 
more coherent and consistent working methods.  Mandate-holders needed to respond to these 
and other general concerns.  In this connection, the High Commissioner greeted as a positive and 
timely development the establishment of the Coordination Committee.  There was in fact a need 
for mandate-holders to work cooperatively and to speak with a collective voice on institutional 
issues.  The High Commissioner encouraged mandate-holders to be fully involved in the process 
of review so as to anticipate possible challenges and be able to provide sophisticated and well 
analysed responses to them.   
</p>
<p>62. Mandate-holders warmly thanked the High Commissioner for her presence and words of 
support and complimented her work.  Questions were raised concerning:  potential areas of 
cooperation between special procedures and OHCHR and the extent to which special procedures 
can be involved in the initiatives of the High Commissioner; the desirability that the entire Office 
provide substantive and intellectual support to special procedures on specific thematic issues; the 
need to ensure an equal level of support and opportunities of cooperation to all mandate-holders; 
the desirability of special procedures and OHCHR devising joint strategies on specific situations; 
the need to take into account special procedures&#8217; views in the formulation of country 
engagement strategies and programmes.  It was also pointed out that often coherence depends on 
outside factors such as the procedure to appoint mandate-holders and the resources available to 
them.  The support of the High Commissioner on these and similar issues was encouraged. 
</p>
<p>63. The High Commissioner reiterated that she cheered the institutional independence and 
personal liberty of special procedures, as well as that of her Office, and stressed the need to 
preserve the prerogative for both of them to use their professional judgement in all situations.  
On these premises, the High Commissioner stressed that there was scope for mutual support and 
cooperation in many areas.  To this end, there was a need to ensure the existence of an 
established system of communication between special procedures and OHCHR at large.  The 
High Commissioner referred to current efforts to strengthen the thematic expertise of the Office, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>which would also support the work of special procedures.  The High Commissioner further 
stressed that UPR should be embraced and efforts not be spared to make it a very meaningful 
addition to the system of promotion and protection of human rights.  The High Commissioner 
said she was committed to enhance the visibility and impact of the work of special procedures. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Exchange with the Deputy High Commissioner and senior officials of the  
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>64. Participants had an opportunity to meet with OHCHR senior managers.  During this 
session mandate-holders were provided with an opportunity to ask questions and raise issues 
with:  the Deputy High Commissioner, Mehr-Khan Williams; the Chief of the Treaties and 
Commission Branch, Bacre Ndiaye; the Chief of the Special Procedures Branch, 
Soussan Raadi-Azarakhchi; the Chief of the Capacity-Building and Field Operations Branch, 
Fabrizio Hochshild; the Chief of the Research and Right to Development Branch Ibrahim Wani; 
the Chief of the Communication Section, Susan Curran; and the Chief of the Planning, 
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, Michael Fruhling.  
</p>
<p>65. Among the issues raised by mandate-holders were:  explanations on the rationale for 
grouping all thematic mandates under one branch; the need to ensure that support to mandates be 
even; the desirability of looking at ways in which OHCHR could give follow-up to special 
procedures&#8217; recommendations and findings; the need to strengthen the communication capacity 
of OHCHR and its media outreach to raise the visibility of special procedures&#8217; findings and 
make sure that reports do not &#8220;sink without trace&#8221;; the need to ensure that the special procedures&#8217; 
individual web pages are more personalized and the information in it more easily accessible; the 
role of field presences in raising awareness and disseminating special procedures&#8217; findings and 
recommendations at the national level, as well as in providing advice to special procedures on 
countries to prioritize; the importance of the translation of reports into local languages; and the 
need for intellectual leadership of the Office.  
</p>
<p>66. The Deputy High Commissioner emphasized the need for better communications 
between mandate-holders and OHCHR, so as to increase the understanding of each other&#8217;s 
capacities and create an environment conducive to strengthened cooperation.  The High 
Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Management Plan was a result-based, two-year plan which addressed 
many of the issues raised by special procedures.   
</p>
<p>67. Recently, a Communication Section had been created at OHCHR and more human 
resources would be devoted to it to strengthen its capacity.  Consultations would be undertaken 
by the Communication Section with mandate-holders through the Coordination Committee to 
envisage ways to respond to the need of ensuring better outreach and dissemination of their 
work, as well as understanding of their role and functions.  Efforts to strengthen the website were 
under way, but for the time being, OHCHR had a limited capacity in this regard.   
</p>
<p>68. It was stressed that the transfer of all thematic procedures to the Special Procedures 
Branch would ensure even and coherent support to all procedures and cross-fertilization between 
different mandates.  Efforts were under way to ensure the same level of human resources to all </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>mandates, although the recruitment process had been slow.  OHCHR was also expanding its 
geographic desks and field presences, especially regional ones.  This would ensure better 
cooperation in the preparation and conduct of, and follow-up to, special procedures&#8217; country 
visits.  The country engagement process would ensure the dissemination of special procedures&#8217; 
recommendations and findings and would facilitate their implementation.  Furthermore, 
technical substantive interaction would be organized between mandate-holders and substantive 
staff of the Office to identify thematic areas where the Office could be of support to special 
procedures. </p>

<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p><b>STATEMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
MANDATE-HOLDERS ON THE OCCASION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT 
                                 OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
</b></p>
<p> We, the mandate-holders of the special procedures, welcome the establishment of the 
Human Rights Council.  We see the establishment of this new institution as a window of 
opportunity to reinvigorate efforts to promote and protect the global human rights system.  We 
look forward to contributing actively to this collective effort. 
</p>
<p> As the Secretary-General recalled in his statement to the first session of the Human 
Rights Council, &#8220;these mechanisms - most of which take the form of individual people, chosen 
for their expertise and serving without pay - constitute the frontline troops to whom we look to 
protect human rights, and to give us early warning of violations.  By raising the alarm and then 
investigating, they keep the spotlight of world attention focused on many of our most pressing 
human rights dilemmas&#8221;.  Special procedures &#8220;give a voice to the voiceless victims of abuses, 
and their reports provide a starting point for discussion on the concrete measures that 
Governments need to take to put a stop to violations, and to ensure that human rights are 
protected in future&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Over the years, that voice has brought credibility and integrity to the human rights 
machinery, providing daily protection to victims of human rights violations in all parts of the 
world and working with Member States to make human rights protection more effective. 
</p>
<p> The mechanism of special procedures - which encompasses Special Rapporteurs; 
Special Representatives of the Secretary-General; Representatives of the Secretary-General; 
Representatives of the Commission on Human Rights; independent experts; and Working 
Groups - was created by the United Nations human rights system to bring objectivity, expertise 
and credibility to the process of monitoring human rights protection.  
</p>
<p> Their independence from external political or other influence is the crucial element which 
enables them to fulfil their functions with true impartiality.  To retain this unique quality, it is 
important that potential mandate-holders are in no way perceived to be partisan.  Therefore it is 
required that independent human rights experts appointed as these special procedures are not in 
decision-making positions within the executive or legislative branches of their Governments.  
Special procedures include thematic mandates which investigate the situation of human rights in 
all parts of the world.  Other mandates deal with the overall human rights situations in a specific 
country.  This requires them to take the measures necessary to monitor and respond quickly to 
allegations of human rights violations against individuals or groups, either globally or in a 
specific country or territory, and to report on their activities to the United Nations.   
</p>
<p> We note that cooperation with special procedures was a factor taken into account in the 
elections of the present States Members of the Human Rights Council.  We encourage the 
Council to further strengthen this approach by calling on its current and future members to 
extend full cooperation to special procedures, including by extending standing invitations to visit 
the country.  We welcome the ongoing collaboration and constructive dialogue between special 
procedures and current members of the Council, 17 of which have extended standing invitations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to all special procedures.  We hope that the remaining States Members of the Council will 
consider doing so.  We strongly urge that all those countries that have failed altogether to 
respond to requests for visits, including those which have extended standing invitations, should 
do so as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p> We urge that political commitment now be transformed into substantive action.  For our 
part, we have collectively and individually resolved to take up the challenge of ensuring that the 
work of the special procedures is even more effective and that values of human rights reach 
every corner of the world.  In this context, we strongly urge the Council to play its lead role and 
provide the maximum space for all human rights mechanisms to flourish in an enabling system. 
</p>
<p> We welcome the General Assembly resolution 60/251 on the Human Rights Council, 
which called for the maintenance of a system of special procedures and we wish to be actively 
involved with the process of review, called for by the resolution, that will take place this year.   
This should lead, inter alia, to the strengthening of the Special Procedures system and to a 
greater synergy between the latter and the rest of the United Nations system for the protection of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p> Any review should start with a full conceptualization of what role the special procedures 
should play as independent experts advising and supporting the new Human Rights Council, 
above all in the universal periodic review, to &#8220;address situations of violations of human rights, 
including gross and systematic violations, and make recommendations thereon&#8221; and to &#8220;respond 
promptly to human rights emergencies&#8221; (General Assembly resolution 60/251, paras. 3 
and 5 (f)).  Only then should a review of the present mandates be undertaken, which could cover 
some of the following issues:  selection process designed to ensure independence of action, 
complementarity and gaps, capacity to fulfil the mandate and related resources, enhancement of 
follow-up mechanisms and emerging new issues in human rights. 
</p>
<p> Through consultations over the past year both at our annual meeting and during the 
informal consultations held in Geneva in October 2005 we have committed ourselves to enhance 
and strengthen our methods of work in order to carry out our mandates in the most effective way. 
</p>
<p> We are committed to continue enhancing our working methods in an open and 
transparent manner.  We have two concrete examples illustrating this commitment:  we 
established a Coordination Committee of special procedures last year at our annual meeting, and 
we updated the Manual on our working methods.  We will post the current draft on the Internet 
and invite comments from all our partners before its finalization and adoption.  Both these 
initiatives can facilitate the involvement and active participation of special procedures in 
defining the designs for their reinforcement and in the process of review of mandates that 
follows, as well as in the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p> At this moment of change, challenges and hope within the international human rights 
community, we call upon the Council to recognize the essential role of the special procedures in 
strengthening human rights protection by taking the following steps: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Recognize the special procedures system as an indispensable mechanism for 
the promotion and protection of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>2. Provide an opportunity to special procedures to directly and effectively 
interact with the Council by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Expeditiously acknowledging and responding to the mission reports 
submitted by mandate-holders; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Responding swiftly to early warnings of impending egregious 
violations and systematically involving special procedures mandate-holders in the 
Council&#8217;s early-warning initiatives as well as in thematic debates and emergency 
sessions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Providing, during its plenary sessions, for at least one-hour interactive 
dialogues with each mandate-holder; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Encouraging its members to respond to each specific 
recommendations made by special procedures mandate-holders in their reports; 
</b></p>
<p><b>3. Make the work of the special procedures central to the system of universal 
periodic review, which will be undertaken by the Human Rights Council, by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Focusing the universal periodic review on assessing States&#8217; effective 
implementation of the findings and recommendations of independent expert bodies, 
rather than duplicating their efforts; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Making the findings and recommendations of the special procedures 
and treaty bodies (monitoring committees established by human rights treaties) an 
essential element of the universal periodic review; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensuring that the measure of cooperation given to special procedures 
is a central criterion used to assess States in the spirit of cooperation and 
constructive dialogue called for in General Assembly resolution 60/251 on the 
Human Rights Council; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Involving effectively special procedures mandate-holders in the 
process of universal periodic review. 
</b></p>
<p><b>4. Encourage States to strengthen cooperation with special procedures by 
calling on States to extend invitations to special procedures; to promptly provide 
substantive replies to their communications; to promptly respond to requests for 
country visits, facilitating access to victims, rights-holders and non-governmental 
organizations; and to implement the recommendations submitted after the visit. 
</b></p>
<p><b>5. Become an active participant in urging States&#8217; implementation of 
recommendations emerging from mandate-holders&#8217; mission reports and 
communications, including enhancement of follow-up mechanisms. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>6. Ensure the active participation of special procedures in the review of 
mechanisms through the participation of the Coordination Committee which serves 
as the contact group with the mandate-holders on issues of collective nature and 
should be associated <i>ab initio</i> and with a consultative status to all reforms 
undertaken. 
</b></p>
<p><b>7. Request the Secretary General, in cooperation with the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, to provide special procedures with human, material and 
financial resources that will enable them to respond actively to the challenges and 
expectations that arise in the context of the reform process. 
</b></p>
<p><b>8. Recognize the fundamental role of NGOs, regional and national human 
rights institutions as key partners of the Council and special procedures.  We urge 
that civil society access and participation is maintained and enhanced as an 
indispensable element of the Council&#8217;s effectiveness. 
</b></p>
<p> We believe that all of these elements are essential for States to fulfil the great 
expectations they have raised by creating this new body.  They are now expected to take 
advantage of the pool of experience and knowledge that existed in the former Commission on 
Human Rights and at the same time shedding the approach which often undermined the 
Commission&#8217;s work.<b>  </b>Special procedures stand ready to take up the challenge to respond to these 
increased expectations for the benefit of all, in particular the victims of human rights violations, 
in all parts of the world who continue to look upon them for effective protection of their rights.
