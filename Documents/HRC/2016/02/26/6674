<p><b>6/&#8230;  Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that no one shall be 
held in slavery or servitude and that slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their 
forms, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the various international instruments, including the Slavery Convention 
of 1926, the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and 
Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956 and International Labour Organization 
Convention No. 29 on Forced Labour of 1930, which prohibit all forms of slavery and call on 
Governments to eradicate such practices, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action strongly condemned the 
fact that slavery and slavery-like practices still exist today in parts of the world and urged States 
to take immediate measures as a matter of priority to end such practices, which constitute 
flagrant violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that contemporary forms of slavery is a global issue which affects all 
continents and most countries of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that the minimum estimate of the number of people in slavery is over 
12 million and that the problem appears to be increasing,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognising</i> that broad international cooperation among States as well as between States 
and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations is essential for effectively 
countering contemporary forms of slavery,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> with great appreciation of the work, reports and recommendations of the 
Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery of the former Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, since its establishment in 1975, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> the proposals to replace the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of 
Slavery with a Special Rapporteur as a mechanism for better addressing the issue of 
contemporary forms of slavery within the United Nations system which were made in May 1998 
in a review of the implementation of the conventions on slavery for the twenty-fourth session of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery; in the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8217; report &#8220;Abolishing slavery and its contemporary 
forms, 2002&#8221; (HR/PUB/02/4); and in the recommendations of the Working Group on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery itself at its thirty-first session in 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council decision 5/1 of 18 June 2007 and its annex which stated 
that the Council would decide at its sixth session on the most appropriate mechanisms to 
continue the work of the Working Groups on Indigenous Populations, on Contemporary Forms 
of Slavery, on Minorities and the Social Forum, as well as Council decision 5/2 of 18 June 2007,</p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that 2007 marks the two hundredth anniversary of the beginning of the 
abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that the mandates of existing Special Rapporteurs do not adequately cover all 
slavery practices, and that the issue of contemporary forms of slavery needs to be given greater 
prominence and priority within the United Nations system if these practices are to be eradicated 
once and for all, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides</i> to appoint, for a three-year period, a Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and its consequences, to replace the Working Group on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> that the Special Rapporteur shall examine and report on all contemporary 
forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, but in particular those defined in the Slavery 
Convention of 1926, and the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave 
Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956, as well as all other issues 
covered by the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery; in the discharge of his/her 
mandate, the Special Rapporteur will: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Promote the effective application of relevant international norms and standards on 
slavery; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Request, receive and exchange information on contemporary forms of slavery from 
Governments, treaty bodies, special procedures, specialized agencies, intergovernmental 
organizations, and non-governmental organizations and other relevant sources, including on 
slavery practices and, as appropriate, and in line with the current practice, respond effectively to 
reliable information on possible human rights violations with a view to protecting the human 
rights of victims of slavery and preventing violations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Recommend actions and measures applicable at the national, regional and 
international levels to prevent and eliminate slavery practices wherever they occur, including 
remedies which address the causes and consequences of contemporary forms of slavery, such as 
poverty, discrimination and conflict as well as the existence of demand factors; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Focus principally on aspects of contemporary forms of slavery which are not covered 
by existing mandates of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out his/her mandate: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To give careful consideration to specific issues within the scope of the mandate and 
to include examples of effective practices as well as relevant recommendations;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To take account of the gender and age dimensions of contemporary forms of slavery; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To focus principally on aspects of contemporary forms of slavery which are not 
covered by existing mandates of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in 
the performance of the tasks and duties mandated, to supply all necessary information requested 
by him/her and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s requests to visit their countries, so as to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate 
effectively; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, regional 
intergovernmental organizations, Governments, independent experts, interested institutions, and 
non-governmental organizations to cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the Special 
Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his/her mandate; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to cooperate fully and effectively with other existing 
human rights mechanisms and treaty bodies, including, but not limited to, the Special Rapporteur 
on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, the Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on children in armed conflict, as well as the Board of 
Trustees for the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, taking full 
account of their contribution while avoiding duplication of their work;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit annual reports on the activities of the 
mandate to the Human Rights Council together with recommendations on measures that should 
be taken to combat and eradicate contemporary forms of slavery and protect the human rights of 
victims of such practices; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to give the Special Rapporteur all necessary human 
</p>
<p>and financial assistance for the effective fulfilment of his/her mandate.
