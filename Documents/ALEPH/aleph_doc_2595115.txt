*** Vote Today FOR the ExxonMobil Transaction ***
August 19, 2016
Dear InterOil Shareholders,
On July 21, 2016, InterOil entered into a definitive agreement under which ExxonMobil agreed to
acquire the company in a transaction valued at more than $2.5 billion. Your Board of Directors
has unanimously recommended that InterOil shareholders vote FOR the transaction in
connection with a Special Meeting scheduled to be held on September 21, 2016.
VOTE FOR THE EXXONMOBIL TRANSACTION TO REALIZE
COMPELLING VALUE FOR YOUR INVESTMENT IN INTEROIL
A vote for the ExxonMobil transaction is a vote FOR:
•  A Material and Immediate Premium: For each share of InterOil stock held, InterOil
shareholders will receive $45 worth of ExxonMobil common shares (calculated based on
a 10-day VWAP) and a Contingent Resource Payment (“CRP”). The share consideration
represents a premium of 42.2% to InterOil’s closing price on May 19, 2016 (the day prior
to the announcement of the Oil Search transaction).1
•  Significant Potential Upside in PRL 15 Resource through the CRP: The CRP
provides a cash payment to shareholders of ~$7.07 for each share they hold for each
incremental certified tcfe of PRL 15 2C resource above 6.2 tcfe, up to a maximum of 10
tcfe of certified resource.
•  Exposure to Future Value: InterOil shareholders who retain their ExxonMobil shares
will benefit from ownership in the world’s preeminent energy company, which provides a
larger asset base, a current 3.2 percent dividend yield and 34 consecutive years of
dividend growth, and is listed on the NYSE.
To realize the immediate benefit of the ExxonMobil transaction, we encourage you to vote FOR
the ExxonMobil transaction. Vote TODAY online, by telephone or by completing, signing and
dating the enclosed proxy, and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope by 12:00PM

The CRP will be deposited into escrow at closing and will be paid to former InterOil shareholders
based on and following the completion of the interim resource certification process in accordance
with InterOil’s existing Share Purchase Agreement with Total SA, which will include the
Antelope-7 appraisal well that is scheduled to be drilled later in 2016. Importantly, the CRP is
structured so ExxonMobil’s interests are aligned with the interests of InterOil shareholders
to ensure a robust and accurate certification process.
