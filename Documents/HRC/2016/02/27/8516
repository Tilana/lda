<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, 
in which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
to continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions 
adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and 
studies. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
had initially interpreted decision 2/102 as extending previous reports of the Commission on 
Human Rights and providing for an annual reporting cycle. Until recently, this 
interpretation had been deemed to have received the tacit approval of member States. 
However, an objection was placed on the record in 2010 in the context of another report 
which also referred to decision 2/102 as the basis for its annual reporting. OHCHR has thus 
reviewed the said decision, and concluded that the Human Rights Council sought to fill a 
technical gap by ensuring that reports which were deemed to have been submitted to the 
sixty-second session of the Human Rights Commission would be extended by one year and 
transferred to the subsequent substantive session of the Human Rights Council. With this 
transition period over and an objection now on record with regard to the initial 
interpretation of annual reporting cycles, if the Human Rights Council wishes such 
reporting to be continued, a new Human Rights Council resolution or decision on the matter 
should be tabled. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report outlines progress achieved since the last report of the Secretary-
General submitted to the Human Rights Council at its thirteenth session in March 2010 
(A/HRC/13/44). This report should be read in conjunction with the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
report to the General Assembly on the role of the Ombudsman, mediator and other national 
human rights institutions in the promotion and protection of human rights (A/65/340), and 
the Secretary-General&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council on the process currently 
utilized by the International Coordinating Committee to accredit national institutions in 
compliance with the Paris Principles (A/HRC/16/77). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) and national human rights institutions 
(NHRIs) 
</b></p>
<p>3. In compliance with the Paris Principles, NHRIs are essential pillars of national 
human rights systems for the promotion and protection of human rights. They can play a 
crucial role in promoting and monitoring the effective implementation of international 
human rights standards at the national level. By its resolution A/RES/64/161 and a number 
of earlier resolutions, the General Assembly recognized the role of NHRIs in working with 
governments to ensure full respect for human rights at the national level, including by 
contributing to follow-up actions, as appropriate, to the recommendations resulting from the 
international human rights mechanisms. In her opening statement at the 23rd Annual 
Meeting of the International Coordinating Committee, held in Geneva from 23 to 25 March 
2010, the High Commissioner highlighted the instrumental role that NHRIs play in 
monitoring the implementation of international human rights law and standards. 
</p>
<p>4. OHCHR accords priority to the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs with due 
regard for the Principles Relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris Principles) 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/134. OHCHR supports the increased 
contribution of NHRIs in the United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. 
OHCHR encourages the sharing of good practices among NHRIs, supports the 
strengthening of their regional networks, and facilitates their cooperation with United </p>


<p>Nations country teams and other relevant partners. OHCHR is also engaged in improving 
United Nations system-wide coordination on NHRIs. 
</p>
<p>5. Since 2003, OHCHR has maintained the National Human Rights Institutions Forum 
website (www.nhri.net). The website is linked to the web pages of OHCHR and NHRIs, 
and includes information on the United Nations human rights system, country and thematic 
issues, and the activities of the International Coordinating Committee.  
</p>
<p>6. Since 2008, the OHCHR fellowship programme for NHRIs has hosted staff from A-
status institutions in Australia, El Salvador, Egypt, Nepal, Nicaragua, the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, Republic of Korea, Togo and Uganda. This programme has enabled 
the fellows to gain knowledge of, and experience within, the United Nations. It has also 
been beneficial for OHCHR, in terms of substantive expertise and the consolidation of 
contacts with staff from national institutions. OHCHR has issued a new call for candidates 
for 2011. Up to four staff members from NHRIs will be selected to work in the National 
Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section of OHCHR for a period up to 12 months. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  Advisory services provided by OHCHR to NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p>7. OHCHR activities to strengthen the role of NHRIs at the country, regional and 
international levels are carried out mainly through the National Institutions and Regional 
Mechanisms Section, which works in consultation with other parts of OHCHR, including 
field presences. OHCHR has continued to provide advice and assistance in the 
establishment and strengthening of institutions through its country and regional offices, 
human rights advisers and human rights components of United Nations peace missions, as 
well as through collaboration with other United Nations partners, including the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs. 
OHCHR also works closely with intergovernmental organisations, academic institutions 
and civil society organisations. 
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR provides legal and technical assistance to NHRIs and other national 
stakeholders. Advice is provided on constitutional or legislative frameworks regarding the 
establishment of NHRIs, as well as on their nature, functions, powers and responsibilities. 
Comparative analysis, technical cooperation needs assessments, project formulation and 
evaluation missions are also undertaken to establish and strengthen the institutions&#8217; 
compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>9. During the reporting period, OHCHR provided advice and/or assistance on 
strengthening NHRIs in Bahrain, Benin, Congo, Dakar, Djibouti, Ecuador, Gambia, Ghana, 
Haiti, Indonesia, Ireland, Jordan, Kenya, Kosovo, Liberia, Malaysia, Mexico, Namibia, 
Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Serbia, South Africa, Oman, Qatar, Tanzania, Thailand, 
Togo, Netherlands, Venezuela, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. OHCHR also provided 
assistance for activities aimed at the establishment of NHRIs in Belarus, Botswana, 
Burundi, Central African Republic, Chile, Comoros, Ethiopia, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Mali, 
Monaco, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Swaziland, Somalia and United Arab 
Emirates. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Americas and the Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the reporting period, OHCHR regional offices in South and Central America, 
OHCHR country offices in Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico, human rights 
advisers with United Nations country teams (UNCTs) in Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and 
Paraguay, and the human rights component of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in 
Haiti (MINUSTAH) continued to provide advice and assistance for the establishment 
and/or strengthening of NHRIs in the Americas and the Caribbean. </p>


<p>11. During 2010, OHCHR held bilateral meetings with Government officials and civil 
society organizations, such as the Chilean Chapter of the Ombudsman (<i>Cap&#237;tulo Chileno 
del Ombudsman)</i>, in order to establish a Paris Principles-compliant NHRI in Chile. 
</p>
<p>12. In the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, OHCHR, in cooperation 
with the <i>Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie </i>(OIF) and the independent expert 
on the human rights situation in Haiti, helped the Ombudsman (<i>Protectrice du Citoyen</i>) to 
build the capacities of this institution. In March, OHCHR supported the participation of the  
Ombudsman at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the International Coordinating Committee. 
During the session, a special meeting took place to discuss support to the Ombudsman of 
Haiti. In July, OHCHR and OIF launched a joint project to help the institution carry out a 
capacity assessment with a view to promoting a human rights-based approach during the 
reconstruction phase. A consultant worked with the NHRI to develop a capacity-needs 
assessment and programmatic documents. 
</p>
<p>13. In June 2010, OHCHR, in cooperation with the Ombudsman (<i>Defensor del Pueblo</i>) 
of Ecuador, organized a training session aimed at reinforcing the skills of Ombudsman staff 
and civil servants with regard to monitoring human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>14. On 4 November 2010, OHCHR conducted a training session for staff of the 
Ombudsman (<i>Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo)</i> of Venezuela on preparing the stakeholders&#8217; report

Commission for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, an A-status NHRI, was 
dissolved. On 20 May, the Government established a National Observatory for Human 
Rights, which acted as a human rights monitoring body during the transitional period. In 
May 2010, OHCHR provided advice to the Government on the establishment of an NHRI 
in compliance with the Paris Principles and based on the experience and best practices of 
other NHRIs in the region. 
</p>
<p>17. In February 2010, OHCHR, UNDP and civil society organizations discussed areas 
of technical support for the newly established Human Rights Commission of Zimbabwe. In 
August 2010, OHCHR and UNDP supported a training workshop for the newly appointed 
Commissioner. The training was aimed at familiarizing the new Commissioner with core 
NHRI functions under the Paris Principles, and with the role of NHRIs in regional and 
international human rights mechanisms. From 8 to 12 November 2010, OHCHR facilitated 
a study tour to South Africa for the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commissioner. The tour was 
organized in cooperation with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), 
and included meetings with members of SAHRC and its key interlocutors in Government,

<p><b> III. Cooperation between United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>71. OHCHR supports NHRIs&#8217; engagement with the Human Rights Council, in 
accordance with resolution 2005/74 of the Human Rights Commission. Human Rights 
Council resolution 5/1 provides opportunities for institutions and their regional 
coordinating mechanisms to participate in the Human Rights Council, and to engage with 
its various mechanisms. Institutions accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status by the International 
Coordinating Committee, together with the Committee itself, and its regional coordinating 
bodies speaking on behalf of A-status accredited NHRIs may participate and address the 
Council on all agenda items. They can also circulate written statements, have 
documentation issued as United Nations official documents and have separate seating 
arrangements at Council sessions. With regard to the UPR, input from NHRIs is included in 
the stakeholders&#8217; report. OHCHR assists in the implementation of UPR recommendations 
concerning the establishment or strengthening of NHRIs, including supporting institutions 
in applying to the International Coordinating Committee for accreditation. 
</p>
<p>72. In 2010, an average of 20 NHRIs participated in each of the Human Rights Council 
sessions. They were active before and during the sessions, presenting statements, 
submitting written documentation, participating in general debates, organizing parallel 
events, and interacting with the Special Rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>73. On 8 March 2010, in the margins of the 13th session of the Human Rights Council, 
OHCHR and the Advisory Council on Human Rights of Morocco organized a side event on 
community reparations in the context of transitional justice.   
</p>
<p>74. Also in the margins of the 13th session of the Human Rights Council, OHCHR, in 
cooperation with the Human Rights Commission of Mexico City and the NGO, 
International Network of Human Rights, organized a side event on the promotion and 
protection of human rights at the local level. 
</p>
<p>75. The Human Rights Council held the second interactive debate on the rights of 
persons with disabilities on 5 March 2010. The debate focused on the structure and role of 
national mechanisms for the implementation and monitoring of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The Chairperson of the International 
Coordinating Committee delivered a statement on the role of A-status NHRIs in monitoring 
the implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Human Rights Council Review 
</b></p>
<p>76. On 7 October 2010, the Bureau members adopted the International Coordinating 
Committee&#8217;s position paper on the 2011 Human Rights Council Review, with specific 
proposals aimed at strengthening NHRI participation in the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>77. The first session of the Working Group on the Human Rights Council Review took 
place in Geneva from 25 to 29 October 2010. Representatives from the International 
Coordinating Committee, the APF, and individual NHRIs participated in the meeting. In 
line with its position paper, the International Coordinating Committee&#8217;s delegates presented 
proposals aimed at strengthening NHRIs&#8217; contribution to the work of the Council with a 
view to making the Council more effective in its responses to crisis situations and 
addressing rights violations, and more accessible to persons who have suffered rights 
violations as well as persons working to defend them, including NHRIs.   </p>


<p>78. From 8 to10 December 2010, representatives from the International Coordinating 
Committee attended the Ambassadorial Retreat on the review of the Human Rights 
Council, hosted by the Thai Government in Bangkok, Thailand.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p>79. In 2010, 48 countries were reviewed during the 7th to 9th sessions of the Universal 
Periodic Review (UPR). Of those countries, 19 have an NHRI accredited by the 
International Coordinating Committee. 12 of those NHRIs submitted information for the 
stakeholders&#8217; report,2 including 10 holding &#8220;A&#8221; status, and two with &#8220;B&#8221; status.  
</p>
<p>80. Individual NHRIs and regional networks continued to submit written and oral 
statements under Council agenda item 6 (Universal Periodic Review). During the reporting 
period, the NHRIs of Azerbaijan (A/HRC/14/NI/1), Great Britain (A/HRC/13/NI/4), Egypt 
(A/HRC/14/NI/9), and Asia Pacific Forum (A/HRC/14/NI/10) submitted written 
contributions under this agenda item, while the NHRIs of Bolivia, El Salvador, Nicaragua 
and Portugal delivered oral statements. The statements followed up the UPR 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. During the review of Kenya and Panama by the Working Group of the UPR at its 
8th and 9th sessions respectively, OHCHR provided assistance to the NHRIs of these 
countries to organize side events on the UPR preparation process and the role that the 
NHRI could play in this regard.  
</p>
<p>82. The President of the Council appointed a facilitator to lead informal consultations on 
the UPR as part of the work of the Working Group on the Human Rights Council Review. 
A number of States and civil society organizations supported a strengthened role of NHRIs 
in the UPR. The International Coordinating Committee presented the following proposals 
concerning A-status NHRIs: 1) NHRIs should be allocated speaking time during the review 
of their countries by the Working Group on the UPR, following the respective State&#8217;s 
presentation; 2) NHRIs should be able to submit a separate report on their State in future 
UPR cycles; 3) NHRIs should be able to submit written questions and recommendations 
relating to the UPR review of their country; 4) during Council&#8217;s plenary discussion and 
adoption of the UPR report, NHRIs should be given the floor immediately after their 
corresponding State; 5) NHRIs should be able to provide regular updates to the Council on 
the implementation of UPR outcomes; 6) the UPR Trust Fund should be extended to 
support NHRI attendance of the Working Group on the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>83. During the reporting period, a number of NHRIs interacted with special procedures 
mandate holders and submitted written contributions to the Human Rights Council to 
complement the mandate holders&#8217; country mission reports. 
</p>
<p>84. The Chairperson of the International Coordinating Committee participated in the 
17th Annual Meeting of Special Procedures, held in Geneva from 28 June to 2 July 2010. 
OHCHR and the International Coordinating Committee organized a parallel event in the 
margins of the meeting on the role of NHRIs in following up special procedures&#8217; 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>85. Special Rapporteurs have increasingly recognised the role that NHRIs can play at 
the national level to assist in the implementation of the special procedures mandates. 
</p>
<p>  
 2 The NHRIs of Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Egypt, El Salvador, Kenya,  Maldives, 
</p>
<p>Mongolia, Nicaragua, Panama, Slovenia and Spain. </p>


<p>During 2010, the SRSG on violence against children, the Independent Expert on the human 
rights situation in Haiti, and the SRSG on business and human rights carried out a number 
of activities aimed at strengthening their cooperation with individual NHRIs and the 
International Coordinating Committee. 
</p>
<p>86. In October 2010, the SRSG on violence against children and the Special Rapporteur 
on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography addressed a questionnaire 
to NHRIs regarding the report that they have been mandated to present to the Human 
Rights Council on effective and child-sensitive counseling, complaint and reporting 
mechanisms by which children can safely report incidents of violence, including sexual 
violence and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>87. OHCHR regularly provides special procedures mandate holders with information 
concerning the work of NHRIs in the preparation of their country missions. The mandate 
holders increasingly look to NHRIs for assistance in ensuring that their recommendations 
are followed up at the national level. This is an important area of work for NHRIs and 
should be further encouraged. 
</p>
<p>88. The President of the Council appointed a facilitator to lead informal consultations on 
Special Procedures as part of the Working Group on the Human Rights Council Review. 
The International Coordinating Committee supported the following proposals, <i>inter alia</i>: 1) 
where a special procedures mandate holder addresses a country situation to the Council, 
either through presentation of a country-specific report or addressing the situation in a 
thematic report, the A-status NHRI from that State should have the opportunity to take the 
floor immediately after intervention by the State concerned so as to directly contribute to 
interactive dialogue; and 2) A-status NHRIs should be able to regularly provide the Council 
with information on the implementation of special procedures recommendations in their 
State. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>89. As an ongoing activity, OHCHR has systematically engaged with treaty bodies by 
providing updated information and expert analysis on NHRIs and their related activities. It 
also regularly updates a compilation of all concluding observations and recommendations, 
issued by the treaty bodies, that mention NHRIs (www.nhri.net), and forwards the 
concluding observations to the NHRIs concerned.  
</p>
<p>90. The NHRI of Morocco organized a meeting on strengthening the relationship 
between NHRIs and the human rights treaty bodies system on 9 and 10 June 2010 in 
Marrakech. The meeting gathered representatives from all the regional networks of NHRIs, 
the OHCHR and the Chairperson of the International Coordinating Committee. Treaty-body 
experts participated as observers. Participants adopted the Marrakech Statement which 
includes recommendations to enhance the treaty-body system, ensure broader access to 
treaty bodies, as well as on NHRI follow-up to treaty-body recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. On the occasion of the 100th session of the Human Rights Committee, held in 
Geneva from 11 to 29 October 2010, the NHRI of Morocco delivered a statement on behalf 
of the International Coordinating Committee on the role of NHRIs in the implementation of 
the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s recommendations at the national level. The statement 
highlighted the significant role that NHRIs play at the national level in monitoring, 
protecting and promoting human rights.   </p>


<p><b> C. Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Chairperson of the International Coordinating Committee and 11 NHRIs from 
the four regional networks attended the 54th session of the CSW, held in New York from 1 
to 12 March 2010. They participated in meetings and delivered oral statements advocating 
for the independent participation of A-status NHRIs in the work of the CSW. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cooperation among OHCHR, United Nations agencies and 
programmes, and international and regional organizations to 
support NHRIs  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. United Nations Development Programme 
</b></p>
<p>93. During the reporting period, OHCHR continued to strengthen its strategic 
partnership with UNDP.  
</p>
<p>94. On 10 December 2010, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UNDP 
Administrator launched the UNDP-OHCHR Toolkit for Collaboration with NHRIs. The 
Toolkit was developed over a 2-year consultative process to support UNCT staff in their 
work with NHRIs, and to help NHRIs better understand the United Nations and identify 
mutual areas of interest. A joint UNDP-OHCHR letter was sent to all United Nations 
Resident Coordinators together with the electronic version of the Toolkit.3 
</p>
<p><b> B. Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT) and the Asia Pacific 
Forum (APF) 
</b></p>
<p>95. On 8 October 2010, during the 10th International Conference of NHRIs, the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights launched the publication, &#8220;Preventing Torture: An 
Operational Guide for NHRIs&#8221;.4 This guide is the outcome of cooperation between 
OHCHR, the APT and the APF. It builds on the experience acquired during previous joint 
training projects such as the APT-OHCHR Actors for Change, and the APT-APF training 
programmes for NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Association of Mediterranean Ombudsmen

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>NHRIs compliant with the Paris Principles are key elements of a strong and 
effective national human rights system aimed at the promotion and protection of 
human rights. The development of appropriate mechanisms of cooperation between 
NHRIs and other national institutions with a role in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, including Ombudsman institutions, should be encouraged. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>NHRIs are well placed to support Governments to ensure the implementation 
of international human rights norms and standards. An increasing number of 
independent NHRIs are carrying out an implementing role in relation to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading 
Treatment and Punishment, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Governments and NHRIs are encouraged to work 
together to ensure the implementation of international human rights law and 
standards at the national level. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>A constructive relationship between independent NHRIs and Parliaments can 
make an invaluable contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights at 
the national level, particularly in ensuring the compliance of national laws and 
practices with international human rights norms. Initiatives undertaken with a view 
to promoting closer cooperation between Parliaments and NHRIs should be 
promoted. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Paris Principles require effective cooperation between NHRIs and 
representatives from civil society organizations. There is a need for open, 
participatory and pluralistic processes when establishing or strengthening NHRIs in 
compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The active involvement of NHRIs, through the International Coordinating 
Committee, in the ongoing Human Rights Council&#8217;s review is welcome. Likewise, the 
engagement of NHRIs compliant with the Paris Principles in the UPR mechanism is 
increasingly important both in its preparation and its follow-up.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The adoption of the Marrakech Statement on strengthening the relationship 
between NHRIs and the Human Rights Treaty Bodies System is welcome. NHRIs are 
encouraged to continue engaging in the process of reflection on how to streamline and 
strengthen the treaty-body system. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The adoption of the Edinburgh Declaration on business and human rights and 
the role of NHRIs is welcome. The Declaration confirmed the expanding role of 
NHRIs in addressing corporate-related human rights violations. NHRIs and civil 
society organizations are encouraged to work together towards the implementation of 
the commitments made in Edinburgh. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>United Nations country teams are encouraged to actively use the UNDP-
OHCHR Toolkit for Collaboration with NHRIs in their daily work, including in 
developing United Nations-coordinated approaches towards NHRIs.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The important work of the regional networks of NHRIs has been 
acknowledged, and greater cooperation between the regional networks and the 
International Coordinating Committee is encouraged.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>It is important that adequate financial resources be allocated to NHRIs and 
there is need for them to enjoy financial independence and autonomy for their 
effective performance.  
</b></p>
