</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Madagascar: Algeria, Costa Rica and 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Madagascar, headed by Noeline Ramanantenasoa, Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice, indicated that the national report had been prepared by the Interministerial 
</p>
<p>Committee for the Drafting of Human Rights Reports, with the assistance of all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders at national and regional level and representatives of civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations. The implementation of the recommendations had been greatly affected by 
</p>
<p>the crisis of 2009 as well as by the sanctions taken against Madagascar and their negative 
</p>
<p>effects on all sectors. However, with the support of the United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Programme (UNDP), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and other bilateral and multilateral partners, it had been possible to implement 
</p>
<p>certain recommendations. Others had been rejected, including the dismantling of the 
</p>
<p>Special Intervention Force ordered by the Council of Ministers following the investiture of 
</p>
<p>the President of the fourth Republic; the consideration by the Government Council and 
</p>
<p>Council of Ministers of the bill ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, and the 
</p>
<p>tabling before the National Assembly of the private parliamentary bill abolishing the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-24933 
</p>
<p>6. With regard to recommendations that had been accepted and implemented, 
</p>
<p>Madagascar noted in particular the return to constitutional order following the holding of 
</p>
<p>peaceful presidential and legislative elections; the enactment of Act No. 2014-007 
</p>
<p>establishing the Independent National Human Rights Commission in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights (the Paris Principles); the accession to the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families by 
</p>
<p>Parliament in November 2013, and the consideration by the Government Council and 
</p>
<p>Council of Ministers of draft legislation authorizing the ratification of the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Second Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. 
</p>
<p>7. Other recommendations that had been implemented included wider referral to the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court of cases involving violations of fundamental rights recognized in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution; consideration by the Government Council and Council of Ministers prior to 
</p>
<p>submission to Parliament of the bill establishing the Parliamentary Court of Justice with 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction to try the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, members of the 
</p>
<p>Government, the two Presidents of the two chambers of Parliament and the President of the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court; and the inclusion of human rights modules in training programmes for 
</p>
<p>law enforcement officials in the major professional training establishments for the legal 
</p>
<p>profession, the police, the gendarmerie, the prison administration and the armed forces, 
</p>
<p>with the aim of preventing the excessive use of force and promoting respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights in the performance of daily duties. 
</p>
<p>8. In response to questions prepared in advance, Madagascar indicated that, with regard 
</p>
<p>to special procedures, it had formalized the standing invitation to special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders, on 26 August 2011, and had received the successive visits of three special 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs since 2011. Following the elections held in 2013, the visit by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions had been postponed. 
</p>
<p>Regarding the acceptance of the individual complaints procedure for all ratified 
</p>
<p>conventions, given that the admissibility of such complaints was dependent upon the 
</p>
<p>exhaustion of domestic remedies, Madagascar considered that the public should be made 
</p>
<p>aware beforehand of the rights protected by the ratified conventions, which may be invoked 
</p>
<p>before the courts that were bound to uphold them. 
</p>
<p>9. Regarding the overdue periodic reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, those were 
</p>
<p>currently being drafted and would be submitted to the bodies concerned before the end of 
</p>
<p>2014. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to violence against women, Madagascar intended to devise a national 
</p>
<p>action plan to combat such violence involving all stakeholders. Furthermore, measures had 
</p>
<p>already been taken to establish a national office under the Ministry of Population to monitor 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding women&#8217;s access to landownership and customary practices preventing 
</p>
<p>women from inheriting land, awareness-raising workshops had been organized in the areas 
</p>
<p>affected, such as the south-east. These efforts would be maintained and strengthened 
</p>
<p>through the effective implementation of the landownership law in order to eliminate the de 
</p>
<p>facto discrimination faced by women. 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding freedom of expression and the press, consultations had been held with all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders since July 2014, at the initiative of the Ministry of Communication and with 
</p>
<p>the support of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, with a view to 
</p>
<p>finalizing the draft code of communication due to be submitted to the National Assembly in </p>


<p>GE.14-24933 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>May 2015. This new code would take account of international standards aimed at ensuring 
</p>
<p>that journalists could pursue their activities freely. 
</p>
<p>13. As for the practice of <i>moletry</i>, Madagascar stated that the Government would 
</p>
<p>monitor and assess the implementation of the road map prohibiting <i>moletry</i> against minors. 
</p>
<p>14. In regard to the economic dependence of women and poverty, adding to information 
</p>
<p>given in the report, Madagascar stated that with the support of UNDP the &#8220;Intensive 
</p>
<p>functional literacy for development&#8221; approach had led in 2013 to the establishment of 18 
</p>
<p>literacy centres, which enabled recipients to acquire the reading, writing and arithmetic 
</p>
<p>skills they required to manage their affairs and follow basic technical training courses. 
</p>
<p>Some 150 resource persons had also been trained and deployed in local communities. 
</p>
<p>15. Regarding anti-human trafficking measures and the evaluation of their effectiveness, 
</p>
<p>Madagascar indicated that the anti-trafficking bill adopted by the Government Council and 
</p>
<p>the Council of Ministers would be put before Parliament. This bill provided for the criminal 
</p>
<p>responsibility of legal persons involved in trafficking, including placement agencies 
</p>
<p>engaging in trafficking. The evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-trafficking measures 
</p>
<p>would be based, inter alia, on the numbers of alleged perpetrators of trafficking 
</p>
<p>investigated, prosecuted, tried and convicted and the number of victims obtaining effective 
</p>
<p>redress. 
</p>
<p>16. Concerning the fight against torture and ill-treatment, Madagascar stated that the bill 
</p>
<p>criminalizing cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment had been submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Government for referral to Parliament. The new laws against trafficking and the law on 
</p>
<p>torture and ill-treatment would be incorporated into the Criminal Code so as to facilitate 
</p>
<p>their effective implementation by law enforcement officials. The ratification of the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment was currently under consideration. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to reducing the length of pretrial detention, Madagascar had adopted 
</p>
<p>Act No. 2007-021 of 30 July 2007 reducing the duration of pretrial detention in order to 
</p>
<p>avoid long detentions without due process. The following measures had been taken in that 
</p>
<p>respect: prompt drafting of a bill on alternative measures to imprisonment and alternatives 
</p>
<p>to detention, including community service; simplification of the parole process and quicker 
</p>
<p>processing of cases. 
</p>
<p>18. Madagascar had achieved significant results in its reform of the prison system since 
</p>
<p>2013, thanks to the support of the European Union. Madagascar intended to reform its 
</p>
<p>prison system according to the concept of the correction and rehabilitation of detainees 
</p>
<p>through a reorganization of prison work and prison camps. 
</p>
<p>19. Regarding the reform of the judicial system, following two studies of the 
</p>
<p>shortcomings of the criminal justice and anti-corruption systems, concrete proposals had 
</p>
<p>been made by all stakeholders of the criminal justice system to develop a national action 
</p>
<p>plan aimed at reforming the criminal justice and anti-corruption systems. 
</p>
<p>20. As for the promotion of equality between men and women, the bill ratifying the 
</p>
<p>Southern African Development Community Protocol on Gender and Development adopted 
</p>
<p>by the Government Council would shortly be submitted to the Council of Ministers. The 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Women in Africa (the Maputo Protocol) would be considered subsequently. In an 
</p>
<p>effort to promote the participation of women in decision-making in public affairs, the bill 
</p>
<p>on the proportional representation and participation of men and women in elected or non-
</p>
<p>elected decision-making positions in the public sector had been submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Government for referral to Parliament. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.14-24933 
</p>
<p>21. The bill reforming the Nationality Code before the Government Council and the 
</p>
<p>Council of Ministers for referral to Parliament was aimed at eliminating discrimination 
</p>
<p>against children born to Malagasy mothers who were married to foreign fathers without 
</p>
<p>Malagasy nationality. 
</p>
<p>22. In respect of the implementation in practice of legislation protecting the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, the State acknowledged that not enough facilities had been 
</p>
<p>adapted to the needs of persons living with disabilities. However, a number of public and 
</p>
<p>private buildings or spaces were provided with access to car parks, toilets and ramps. 
</p>
<p>23.  With regard to moving towards the Abuja objective and improving access to free 
</p>
<p>health care for all, the Government would be taking the steps in due course. Free care was 
</p>
<p>provided to victims of disasters, catastrophes and epidemics. 
</p>
<p>24.  With regard to the observance of human rights by companies, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the requirements of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice had held a series of training sessions since 2012, with the support of 
</p>
<p>the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and in partnership with the mining 
</p>
<p>companies Sherrit and QMM, for the benefit of their employees, law enforcement officials 
</p>
<p>and representatives of civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding investigations into cases of extrajudicial executions and collective 
</p>
<p>punishments of cattle thieves allegedly perpetrated by the security forces, the latter had had 
</p>
<p>no choice but to resort to the use of force in order to protect themselves as well as the lives 
</p>
<p>of the defenseless population. However, certain individuals who had engaged in illegal acts 
</p>
<p>had been subject to investigation. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to the fight against corruption, the Ministry of Justice, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Anti-Corruption Office and the Committee for the Safeguard of Integrity had signed an 
</p>
<p>agreement on 29 August 2014 to update their 10-year joint action plan. The three 
</p>
<p>signatories had pledged to implement the action plan and increase efforts to combat 
</p>
<p>corruption. 
</p>
<p>27. Regarding the measures taken to combat child labour and provide assistance to street 
</p>
<p>children, Madagascar indicated that, since March 2014 and with the support of the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO), the National Commission to Combat Child 
</p>
<p>Labour had conducted prevention, withdrawal and support activities for child victims of 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation for commercial purposes in several regions of Madagascar. These 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s parents will receive assistance to improve their living conditions. The Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Tourism also adopted a Code of Conduct on 3 March 2014 to combat the sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children for commercial purposes covering 155 tourism operators, with the 
</p>
<p>support of ILO and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). 
</p>
<p>28. Madagascar stated that following its incorporation into domestic law, the road map 
</p>
<p>had become a State law applicable upon its entry into force. Under this law, the Malagasy 
</p>
<p>Reconciliation Council had been established in January 2013. In order to succeed with 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation, the Government had decided to send a delegation on a fact-finding 
</p>
<p>mission in October 2014, with the support of UNDP, to study good practices in South 
</p>
<p>Africa and Togo. The findings of this mission would be used to ensure the success of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s national reconciliation. The completion of the national reconciliation process 
</p>
<p>would facilitate the full implementation of the road map. 
</p>
<p>29. With regard to the effective application of legislation on the illegal trade in 
</p>
<p>rosewood, the Government had established an interministerial committee in June 2014 with 
</p>
<p>responsibility for cleaning up the supply channels of rosewood and ebony wood and for 
</p>
<p>proposing laws compatible with a human rights-based approach, particularly the right to a </p>


<p>GE.14-24933 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>preserved environment and the right to sustainable development. The fight against such 
</p>
<p>trafficking was conducted in partnership with international partners. 
</p>
<p>30. Madagascar stressed that the extreme poverty affecting 60 per cent of the population 
</p>
<p>represented a major stumbling block which hindered the realization of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights. It also cited the lack of human and financial resources, widespread 
</p>
<p>corruption and the persistence of harmful customary practices as other constraints. In 
</p>
<p>accordance with its general State policy, Madagascar intended to restore the rule of law and 
</p>
<p>good governance, strengthen respect for human rights, and combat corruption with a view 
</p>
<p>to building an environment favourable to sustainable and inclusive development. 
</p>
<p>31. In its efforts to promote and protect all human rights, Madagascar called for the 
</p>
<p>international community&#8217;s support in terms of capacity-building and technical assistance.

</p>
