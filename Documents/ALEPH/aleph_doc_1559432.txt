                           FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
Certain  statements  made in this Annual Report are "forward-looking statements" 
(within  the  meaning  of  the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) 
regarding  the  plans  and  objectives of management for future operations. Such 
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that 
may  cause  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements of the Company to be 
materially  different  from  any  future  results,  performance  or achievements 
expressed  or  implied  by  such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking 
statements  made  in  this Report are based on current expectations that involve 
numerous  risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, 
in  part,  on  assumptions  involving  the  growth  and  expansion  of business. 
Assumptions  relating  to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among 
other  things,  future  economic,  competitive  and market conditions and future 
business  decisions,  all  of  which  are  difficult  or  impossible  to predict 
accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the 
Company  believes that its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements 
are  reasonable,  any  of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, 
there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the forward-looking statements made in this 
Report  will  prove  to  be  accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties 
inherent in the forward-looking statements made in this Report, the inclusion of 
such  information  should  not be regarded as a representation by the Company or 
any  other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. 
 
As  used  in  this  annual  report,  the terms "we", "us", "our", "Company", and 
"Thrust"  means  Thrust  Energy  Corp.,  unless  otherwise  indicated.

GENERAL 
 
We are an energy company, engaged in the exploration of commercially exploitable 
oil  and gas reserves and the development of renewable energy resources, such as 
solar  and  wind.  We  were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 15, 
2004.  Our office is located at Suite 1440, 3044 Bloor Street, Toronto, Ontario. 
We  have  no subsidiaries. Our telephone number is (647) 456-9521. Our facsimile 
number  is  (647)  439-3785. 
 
BUSINESS 
 
From  inception  until 2009, our business was exclusively limited to oil and gas 
exploration  in the United States and Canada.  In 2009, we expanded our business 
plan  to include the development of renewable energy sources, photovoltaic solar 
energy  in  particular. 
 
Since  our  business requires significant capital and we have limited assets and 
resources,  we  intend  to  initially participate in the oil and gas industry by 
acquiring  undivided  working  interests  in  small  oil  and  gas  exploration 
properties  and  non-operating  interests  in  both  producing  and  exploration 
projects  throughout  the  United  States and Canada.  There can be no assurance 
that  we  will  be  successful  in our exploration and investment activities.  A 
"working  interest"  is  an  interest  in  a  well  that  bears the drilling and 
operating  expenses  thereof.  A  "non-operating interest" is a working interest 
for  which  the  owner  does  not  operate  the  well. 
 
We  have  only just recently begun to pursue the development of renewable energy 
sources.  We  plan  to  develop,  construct  and  operate  commercial  solar 
installations  in  North  America.  We  will  require  significant  additional 
financing  in  order  to  commence  any  such  development. 
 
Our management is not experienced in either the energy sector.  We are therefore 
relying  on  consultants  to  identify,  evaluate  and  structure  suitable 
opportunities.  We  have  not  retained  any geologist, geoscientist or engineer 
qualified  to provide such services.  With the assistance of consultants and, to 
a  lesser  extent,  unsolicited  submissions,  we  intend  to evaluate potential 
opportunities  in  the  United  States  and  Canada that may become available on 
acceptable  terms  and  that  have  the  potential to provide us with production 
revenue  and  reserves.  We  intend  to  outsource  an  appropriate level of the 
capital-intensive  aspects  of our business om order to achieve significant cost 
savings  and  operational  efficiencies. 
 
We  have  not earned any revenue since our inception and presently have negative 
cash  flow.  Our  business plan is to focus on acquiring non-operating interests 
in  oil  and  gas  projects  that  are  already  producing and that will yield a 
positive cash flow to fund our operations and re-investment in other oil and gas 
projects.  We  also  intend  to  acquire  non-operating interests in exploration 
projects,  but  these  investments  have  a  higher  risk and are less likely to 
generate revenue.  While we have reviewed several farm-in opportunities, we have 
not  made  any  acquisitions  or  investments to date.  We intend to continue to 
pursue  the  development  of  large  scale  (in  excess  of  one  Megawatt), 
ground-mounted  solar  power plants, either alone or in partnership with others. 
 
We do not presently have any oil, gas or renewable energy interests.  Our assets 
are  presently  limited  to  cash. 
 
 
<PAGE> 
 
COMPETITION 
 
The oil and gas business is highly competitive, and we do not hold a significant 
competitive  position  within  it.  Our competitors include major integrated oil 
and  gas  companies  and numerous independent oil and gas companies, individuals 
and  drilling  and  income  programs. Some of our competitors are also potential 
customers.  Many  of  our competitors are large, well established companies with 
substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we have 
and  which  have been engaged in the energy business for a much longer time than 
we  have.  Such  companies  may  be  able to pay more for productive oil and gas 
properties  and  exploratory  prospects  and  to  define,  evaluate, bid for and 
purchase  a  greater  number  of  properties and prospects than our financial or 
human  resources  permit.  Our  ability  to acquire additional properties and to 
discover  reserves  in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate 
and  select  suitable  properties  and  to  consummate  transactions in a highly 
competitive  environment. 
 
The renewable energy industry is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. The 
number  of  solar  plant  developers  has  rapidly  increased  due to government 
incentives and relatively low barriers to entry.  We have only recently expanded 
our  business  plan  to  include  renewable  energy, and do not presently hold a 
significant competitive position in the solar industry.  Many of our competitors 
are large, well established companies with substantially larger operating staffs 
and greater capital resources than we have, which have been engaged in the solar 
energy  business  for  a  much  longer  time  than  we  have. 
 
GOVERNMENT  AND  ENVIRONMENTAL  REGULATION 
 
Domestic  development,  production  and  sale  of  oil  and  gas are extensively 
regulated  at  both  the federal and state levels. Legislation affecting the oil 
and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently 
increasing  the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both 
federal  and state, have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas 
industry  and  its  individual members, compliance with which is often difficult 
and  costly and some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. 
State statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling

bonds and reports concerning wells. Texas and other states in which we intend to 
conduct  operations  also  have  statutes and regulations governing conservation 
matters,  including  the  unitization  or  pooling of oil and gas properties and 
establishment  of  maximum  rates  of  production  from  oil  and  gas  wells. 
 
Our  planned  operations  will  be  subject to extensive and developing federal, 
state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  relating to environmental, health and 
safety  matters;  petroleum;  chemical  products  and  materials;  and  waste 
management.  Permits, registrations or other authorizations will be required for 
any  future  oil  and  gas exploration and production activities. These permits, 
registrations  or authorizations will be subject to revocation, modification and 
renewal.  Governmental  authorities  have  the  power to enforce compliance with 
these regulatory requirements, the provisions of required permits, registrations 
or  other  authorizations,  and  lease  conditions, and violators are subject to 
civil  and  criminal penalties, including fines, injunctions or both. Failure to 
obtain  or maintain a required permit may also result in the imposition of civil 
and  criminal  penalties.  Third  parties  may  have the right to sue to enforce 
compliance. 
 
Some  risk  of costs and liabilities related to environmental, health and safety 
matters  is  inherent  in  our planned operations, as it is with other companies 
engaged in similar businesses, and there can be no assurance that material costs 
or  liabilities  will  not  be incurred. In addition, it is possible that future 
developments,  such  as  stricter  requirements  of  environmental or health and 
safety  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  business  or  more  stringent 
interpretations  of,  or  enforcement  policies  with  respect to, such laws and 
regulations,  could  adversely  affect  us.  To  meet  changing  permitting  and 
operational  standards,  we  may  be  required,  over  time,  to  make  site  or 
operational  modifications at our facilities, some of which might be significant 
and  could  involve  substantial  expenditures.  There  can be no assurance that 
material  costs  or  liabilities  will  not  arise  from  these  or  additional 
environmental  matters that may be discovered or otherwise may arise from future 
requirements  of  law. 
 
The  market  for  electricity  generation  products  is  heavily  influenced  by 
national,  regional and local government regulations and policies concerning the 
electric  utility  industry,  as  well  as  internal  policies  and  regulations 
promulgated  by electric utilities.  These regulations and policies often relate 
to  electricity  pricing  and  technical  interconnection  of  customer-owned 
electricity  generation.  In  Canada  and  in a number of other countries, these 
regulations  and  policies  are  being modified and may continue to be modified. 
Customer purchases of, or further investment in the research and development of, 
alternative  energy sources, including solar power technology, could be deterred 
by these regulations and policies, which could result in a significant reduction 
in  the  potential  demand  for  our  solar  products.

EMPLOYEES 
 
We currently have no employees other than our sole officer and director, who has 
not  been  paid for his services.  We do not have any employment agreements with 
our  sole  director  and  officer.  We  do  not  presently have pension, health, 
annuity,  insurance,  stock  options,  profit  sharing or similar benefit plans; 
however,  we  may  adopt  plans  in  the future. There are presently no personal 
benefits  available  to  our  sole  officer  and  director. 
 
Since our sole officer and director is not experienced with the energy business, 
we intend to retain qualified persons on a contract basis as needed from time to 
time  to  identify,  evaluate and structure suitable opportunities.  We have not 
looked for or talked to any geologist, geoscientist or engineer who will perform 
work  for  us  in  the  future.

SHAREHOLDERS 
 
Our  shares  of  common  stock  are issued in registered form. The registrar and 
transfer  agent  for our shares of common stock is Transfer Online, Inc., 317 SW 
Alder  Street,  2nd  Floor,  Portland,  OR  97204  (Telephone:  503.227.2950; 
Facsimile:  503.227.6874). 
 
On  November  10,  2009,  the  shareholders'  list of our shares of common stock 
showed 39 registered holders of our shares of common stock and 13,603,950 shares 
of  common  stock outstanding.  The number of record holders was determined from 
the  records  of  our  transfer  agent and does not include beneficial owners of 
shares  of  common  stock whose shares are held in the names of various security 
brokers,  dealers,  and  registered  clearing  agencies. 
 
DIVIDEND  POLICY 
 
Our  Board  of  Directors may declare and pay dividends on outstanding shares of 
common  stock  out  of funds legally available there for in our sole discretion; 
however,  to  date  no  dividends  have  been  declared or paid on common stock. 
 
PENNY  STOCK  REGULATION 
 
Our  shares  must  comply  with  the  Penny  Stock Reform Act of 1990, which may 
potentially  decrease our shareholders' ability to easily transfer their shares. 
Broker-dealer  practices  in  connection with transactions in "penny stocks" are 
regulated.  Penny  stocks  generally  are equity securities with a price of less 
than  $5.00.  The  penny  stock  rules  require  a  broker-dealer,  prior  to  a 
transaction  in  a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a 
standardized  risk  disclosure  document  that  provides information about penny 
stocks  and  the  risks  in  the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must 
provide  the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, 
the  compensation  of  the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, 
and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held 
in  the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require 
that  prior  to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special 
written  determination  that  the  penny  stock is a suitable investment for the 
purchaser  and  receive  the  purchaser's  written agreement to the transaction. 
These  disclosure  requirements  may  have  the  effect of reducing the level of 
trading  activity  in the secondary market for a stock that must comply with the 
penny  stock  rules.  Since  our shares must comply with such penny stock rules, 
our  shareholders  will  in  all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their 
securities. 
 
USE  OF  PROCEEDS  FROM  REGISTERED  SECURITIES 
 
On April 19, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared our Form SB-2 
Registration Statement (Commission File No. 333-130922) effective. Our offering 
commenced on the effective date and terminated on October 18, 2006. We sold 
3,603,950 shares through the offering at a price of $0.10 per share, for gross 
proceeds of $360,395. 
 
Our total offering expenses were $25,290. Of this amount, $14,523 was paid from 
the offering proceeds. The remainder ($10,767) was paid from the proceeds of a 
non-interest bearing loan of $25,000 from our President, Thomas Mills, which was 
convertible into shares of our common stock at the rate of $0.25 per share. On 
July 31, 2007, we repaid the convertible loan in full. We did not intend to 
repay the loan from the proceeds of our initial public offering, but in light of 
our lack of revenue, the convertibility of the loan and the fact that the loan 
proceeds were primarily used to pay for offering and startup expenses, the 
directors resolved (Mr. Mills abstaining) that it was in the best interests of 
the corporation to repay the loan from the proceeds. 
 
After paying offering expenses and repaying the loan from our director, the net 
offering proceeds were $322,872. As of August 31, 2009, we have used the net 
proceeds to pay $51,973 for professional services and office expenses. 
 
In fiscal 2009, our management determined that it was in the best interests of 
the company to diversify its business interests to include the development of 
renewable energy projects, and in particular, solar power plants.  In connection 
therewith, we spent $105,227 in business development costs arising from its

ITEM  6.     SELECTED  FINANCIAL  DATA 
 
We  are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act 
and  are  not  required  to  provide  the  information required under this item.

ITEM  7.     MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS 
 
FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES. 
 
We  are  an exploration stage oil and gas company that has not begun operations. 
Our  capital  has  been  obtained  via  issuance of common stock and shareholder 
loans. 
 
We  plan  to acquire undivided working interests in small exploration properties 
and  non-operating  interests in both producing and exploration projects, and to 
develop,  construct  and operate commercial solar installations throughout North 
America. 
 
On April 19, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared our Form SB-2 
Registration Statement (Commission File No. 333-130922) effective.  Our offering 
commenced  on  April  19,  2006,  and  terminated  on October 16, 2006.  We sold 
3,603,950  shares  through the offering at a price of $0.10 per share, for gross 
proceeds  of  $360,395. 
 
As  of  August  31, 2009, we had total assets of $177,741, comprised entirely of 
cash.  This  was a decrease from $291,562 in total assets as of August 31, 2008. 
This  decrease  primarily  resulted from business development activities arising 
from  pursuing renewable energy opportunities.  The remainder of the decrease in 
our  assets  is  due  to  professional  fees  and  office  expenses. 
 
As  of August 31, 2009, our total liabilities increased to $2,791 from $1,691 as 
of  August 31, 2008. This increase resulted from outstanding invoices payable to 
trade  creditors. 
 
We  have  not  generated revenue since the date of inception.  We presently have 
sufficient  working  capital  to  satisfy  our cash requirements for the next 12 
months  of  operations. 
 
Other  than  the purchase of some office equipment, we do not intend to purchase 
or  sell  any  significant  equipment  during  the  next  twelve  months. 
 
We  do  not  anticipate  hiring  any  employees  over  the  next  12  months. 
 
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS 
 
We  posted  an  operating loss of $114,921 for the fiscal year ending August 31, 
2009,  due primarily to our attendance and participation at the Intersolar solar 
trade  shows  in  Munich  and  San  Francisco.  This  was  an  increase from the 
operating  loss  of  $27,458  for  the  previous  fiscal  year.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 
TO  THE  BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  STOCKHOLDERS  OF 
 
THRUST  ENERGY  CORP. 
(An  exploration  stage  company) 
 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Thrust Energy Corp. (an 
exploration  stage  company)  as  at  August  31,  2009 and 2008 and the related 
statements  of  stockholders'  equity,  operations and cash flows for the period 
from  September 15, 2004 (date of inception) to August 31, 2009. These financial 
statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our 
responsibility  is  to express an opinion on these financial statements based on 
our  audits. 
 
We  conducted  our  audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those standards require that we 
plan  and  perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a 
test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the overall 
financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a 
reasonable  basis  for  our  opinion. 
 
In  our  opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all  material  respects,  the financial position of the Company as at August 31, 
2009  and  2008  and  the  results  of its operations and its cash flows for the 
period  from  September  15,  2004  (date  of  inception) to August 31, 2009, in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America. 
 
The  accompanying  financial  statements have been prepared assuming the Company 
will  continue  as  a  going  concern.  As  discussed in Note 1 to the financial 
statements, the Company incurred losses from operations since inception, has not 
attained  profitable  operations  and  is  dependent  upon  obtaining  adequate 
financing to fulfill its exploration activities. These factors raise substantial 
doubt  about  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's 
plans  in  regard  to  these matters are also discussed in Note 1. The financial 
statements  do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of 
this  uncertainty.

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS 
 
Thrust Energy Corp. is engaged in the exploration, exploitation, development and 
production of oil and gas projects within North America.  We incorporated in the 
state  of  Nevada  on  September 15, 2004. Our principal offices are in Toronto, 
Ontario,  Canada.  Our  fiscal  year  end  is  August  31.

These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America with the on-going 
assumption  that  we  will  be  able  to  realize  our  assets and discharge its 
liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business. As shown in the accompanying 
financial  statements,  we  have  incurred  operating losses since inception and 
further  losses are anticipated in the development of our business. As of August 
31,  2009,  we have limited financial resources and require additional financing 
to  fund our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability 
to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  Our  ability  to  achieve  and  maintain 
profitability  and  positive  cash  flow is dependent upon our ability to locate 
profitable  mineral  properties,  generate  revenue  from  our  planned business 
operations,  and  control  exploration  cost.  These financial statements do not 
include  any  adjustments  to  the  amounts  and  classifications  of assets and 
liabilities  that  might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going 
concern.  Management  plans to fund its future operation by obtaining additional 
financing  and  commencing commercial production. However, there is no assurance 
that  we  will  be able to obtain additional financing from investors or private 
lenders. 
 
NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES 
 
Cash  Equivalents 
 
We  consider  all  highly liquid investments and debt instruments purchased with 
maturity  of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At August 31, 2009, we 
had  no  cash  equivalents. 
 
Use  of  Estimates 
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require 
us  to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and  liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of  the  financial  statements  and  the reported amounts of revenue and expense 
during  the  reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Concentration  of  Credit  Risk 
 
We  place  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  with high credit quality financial 
institutions  in  246843517uninsured  accounts246843517idiris 
duan2468435171188807710Shouldn't there be $100,000 insurance on the bank 
account?. 
 
Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments 
 
The  carrying  amount of our financial instruments, which includes cash and cash 
equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair 
value  due  to  the  short  period  to  maturity  of  these  instruments. 
 
Revenue  Recognition 
 
We  record  revenue  when title passes, delivery occurs to our customers and the 
customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, when the price is fixed and 
determinable,  and  when  collectibility  is  reasonably  assured. 
 
Income  Tax 
 
We  recognize  deferred  tax assets and liabilities based on differences between 
the  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets and liabilities using the 
enacted  tax  rates  and  laws  that  are  expected  to  be  in  effect when the 
differences  are  expected to be recovered. We provide a valuation allowance for 
deferred  tax  assets  when  we  consider  realization of such assets to be less 
likely  than  not.

NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED) 
 
Net  Loss  per  Common  Share 
 
We  have  adopted  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings 
Per  Share.  Statement  128  requires  the  reporting  of  basic  and  diluted 
earnings/loss  per share. We calculate basic loss per share by dividing net loss 
by  the  weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. 
 
Comprehensive  Loss 
 
We  apply  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  130,  Reporting 
Comprehensive  Income. Statement 130 establishes standards for the reporting and 
display of comprehensive income or loss, requiring its components to be reported 
in  a financial statement. For the year ended August 31, 2009 our only component 
of  comprehensive  income  or  loss  was the net loss reported in the operations 
statement. 
 
Foreign  Currency  Translation 
 
We  maintain  our  accounting records in U.S. Dollars.  At the transaction date, 
each  asset,  liability,  revenue  and  expense  involves  foreign currencies is 
translated  into  U.S. dollars by the use of the exchange rate in effect at that 
date.  At  the  period  end,  monetary  assets and liabilities involving foreign 
currencies are remeasured by using the exchange rate in effect at that date. The 
resulting  foreign  exchange  gains  and losses are included in operations.  Our 
currency  exposure  is insignificant and immaterial and we do not use derivative 
instruments  to  reduce  our  potential  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk. 
 
Oil  and  Gas  Activity

We  follow the successful-efforts method of accounting for oil and gas property. 
Under this method of accounting, we capitalize all property acquisition cost and 
cost  of  exploratory and development wells when incurred, pending determination 
of  whether  the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not 
find  proved  reserves,  we  charge to expense the cost of drilling the well. We 
include  exploratory dry hole cost in cash flow from investing activities within 
the  cash  flow  statement.  We capitalize the cost of development wells whether 
productive  or  nonproductive. 
 
We  expense as incurred geological and geophysical cost and the cost of carrying 
and  retaining  unproved  property.  We will provide depletion, depreciation and 
amortization  (DD&A)  of  capitalized  cost  of proved oil and gas property on a 
field-by-field  basis  using  the  units-of-production  method based upon proved 
reserves.  In  computing  DD&A  we  will  take  into  consideration restoration, 
dismantlement  and  abandonment cost and the anticipated proceeds from equipment 
salvage. When applicable, we will apply the provisions of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which 
provides  guidance  on  accounting  for  dismantlement  and  abandonment  cost. 
 
We  review  our  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  when  events or changes in 
circumstances  indicate  that an impairment may have occurred. In the impairment 
test we compare the expected undiscounted future net revenue on a field-by-field 
basis  with  the  related net capitalized cost at the end of each period. Should 
the  net  capitalized  cost  exceed  the  undiscounted  future  net revenue of a 
property,  we  will  write down the cost of the property to fair value, which we 
will  determine  using  discounted  future  net  revenue.  We  will  provide  an 
impairment  allowance on a property-by-property basis when we determine that the 
unproved  property  will  not  be  developed. 
 
Stock-Based  Compensation 
 
The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(revised), "Share-Based Payment", to account for 
its  stock  options  and  similar  equity  instruments  issued.  Accordingly, 
compensation  costs  attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments 
granted  are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the 
expected vesting period.   SFAS No. 123(revised) requires excess tax benefits be 
reported  as  a  financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. 
 
We did not grant any stock options during the years ended August 31, 2009 and 
2008.

NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED) 
 
Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements 
 
In  December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 
No.  141(revised  2007)  ("SFAS 141(R)"), "Business Combinations".  SFAS 141 (R) 
applies  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  for  business  combinations 
established  in  SFAS  141  to  all  acquisitions  where  the  acquirer  gains a 
controlling  interest,  regardless  of  whether  consideration  was  exchanged. 
Consistent  with  SFAS 141, SFAS 141 (R) requires the acquirer to fair value the 
assets and liabilities of the acquiree and record goodwill on bargain purchases, 
with  main  difference  the  application  to  all  acquisitions where control is 
achieved.  SFAS  141 (R) is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal 
years  beginning after December 15, 2008.  The adoption of this statement is not 
expected to have a material effect on the Company's future financial position or 
results  of  operations 
In  December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 
No.  160  ("SFAS  160"),  "Non-controlling  Interests  in Consolidated Financial 
Statements  -  An amendment of ARB No. 51". SFAS 160 requires companies with non 
controlling  interests to disclose such interests clearly as a portion of equity 
but  separate  from the parent's equity.  The non controlling interest's portion 
of  net income must also be clearly presented on the Income Statement.  SFAS 160 
is  effective  for  financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after 
December  15,  2008.  The  adoption  of this statement is not expected to have a 
material  effect  on  the  Company's  future  financial  position  or results of 
operations. 
In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161 ("SFAS 161"), "Disclosures 
about  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities".  SFAS  161  requires 
companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable 
financial-statement  users  to  understand how and why a company uses derivative 
instruments,  how  derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted 
for  under  FASB  Statement  No.  133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and 
Hedging  Activities"  and  how  derivative  instruments and related hedged items 
affect  a  company's  financial  position, financial performance and cash flows. 
SFAS  161  is  effective  for  financial  statements issued for fiscal years and 
interim  periods  beginning  after  November  15,  2008.  The  adoption  of this 
statement  is  not  expected  to  have a material effect on the Company's future 
financial  position  or  results  of  operations. 
In  May  2008,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No. 162 ("SFAS 162"), "The Hierarchy of 
Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles". SFAS 162 identifies the sources of 
accounting  principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used 
in the preparation of financial statements of non-governmental entities that are 
presented  in  conformity  with  generally accepted accounting principles in the 
United  States.  It  is  effective  60  days following the SEC's approval of the 
Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The 
Meaning  of  Present  Fairly  in  Conformity  With Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles".  The  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material 
effect  on  the  Company's  financial  statements. 
In  April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142-3, "Determination of the Useful Life 
of  Intangible  Assets"  ("FSP  142-3").  FSP 142-3 amends the factors an entity 
should  consider  in  developing  renewal  or  extension  assumptions  used  in 
determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under FASB Statement
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1343009/000130368109000077/tegc10k_31aug...

No.  142,  "Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets". This new guidance applies 
prospectively  to  intangible  assets  that  are acquired individually or with a 
group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142-3 
is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued  for  fiscal years and interim 
periods  beginning  after  December  15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The 
adoption  of  this  statement  is  not expected to have a material effect on the 
Company's  financial  statements. 
In  May  2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") APB 14-1, "Accounting for 
Convertible  Debt  Instruments  That  May  Be  Settled  in  Cash upon Conversion 
(Including  Partial  Cash  Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14-1"). FSP APB 14-1 clarifies 
that  convertible  debt  instruments  that  may  be  settled in cash upon either 
mandatory  or  optional  conversion  (including partial cash settlement) are not 
addressed  by  paragraph  12  of APB Opinion No. 14, "Accounting for Convertible 
Debt  and Debt issued with Stock Purchase Warrants."  Additionally, FSP APB 14-1 
specifies  that  issuers  of  such instruments should separately account for the 
liability  and  equity  components  in  a  manner that will reflect the entity's 
nonconvertible  debt  borrowing  rate  when  interest  cost  is  recognized  in 
subsequent  periods.  FSP  APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued 
for  fiscal  years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within 
those fiscal years. We will adopt FSP APB 14-1 beginning in the first quarter of 
2010,  and  this standard must be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption 
of  this  statement  is  not expected to have a material effect on the Company's 
financial  statements. 
In  April,  2009,  the  FASB  issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-4 ("FSP FAS 
157-4"),  "Determining  Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the 
Asset  or  Liability  Have  Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions 
That  Are Not Orderly". The FSP provides additional guidance for estimating fair 
value  in  accordance with FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, when 
the  volume  and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly 
decreased.  This  FSP  also  includes guidance on identifying circumstances that 
indicate a transaction is not orderly. The adoption of this FSP does not believe 
to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED) 
 
Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements  (continued) 
In  April,  2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 
("FSP  FAS  107-1  and  APB  28-1"),  Interim  Disclosures  about  Fair Value of 
Financial  Instruments.  The FSP amends SFAS 107, Disclosure about Fair Value of 
Financial  Instruments,  and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28, Interim 
Financial  Reporting,  to  require  disclosures  about  fair  value of financial 
instruments  for  interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well 
as in annual financial statements. Adoption of this FSP does not believe to have 
a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements. 
On  April 1, 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 
124-2  ("FSP  FAS  115-2  and  FAS  124-2"),  Recognition  and  Presentation  of 
Other-Than-Temporary  Impairments.  The  FSP  amends  the  other-than-temporary 
impairment  guidance  in U.S. GAAP for debt securities to make the guidance more 
operational  and  to  improve  the  presentation  and  disclosure  of 
other-than-temporary  impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial 
statements.  This  FSP  does  not  amend  existing  recognition  and measurement 
guidance  related  to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. The 
adoption of this FSP does not believe to have a material impact on the Company's 
financial  statements. 
In  June  2009,  the  FASB  issued  FASB  No.  168 The FASB Accounting Standards 
Codification  and  the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles - a 
replacement  of  FASB  Statement  No. 162 ("SFAS 168"). SFAS 168 establishes the 
FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting 
principles  recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in 
the  preparation  of  financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United 
States.  SFAS  168  is effective for financial statements issued for interim and 
annual  periods  ending  after  September  15,  2009. 
In  June  2009,  the  FASB  issued  FASB  No.  166,  Accounting for Transfers of 
Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 ("SFAS 166"). SFAS 166 
requires  additional  disclosures  about  the  transfer  and  derecognition  of 
financial  assets  and  eliminates  the  concept  of  qualifying special-purpose 
entities  under SFAS 140. SFAS 166 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 
November  15,  2009. 
Other  accounting  standards  that  have  been issued or proposed by the FASB or 
other  standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date 
are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements 
upon  adoption. 
 
 
NOTE  3  -  OIL  AND  GAS  PROPERTY 
 
La  Vaca  Prospect 
 
By  an  Oil,  Gas and Mineral Lease Agreement ("Lease Agreement") dated July 31, 
2005,  we  were  granted  the exclusive right of exploring, drilling, mining and 
operating for, producing and owning oil, gas, sulfur and all other minerals on a 
346.16  undeveloped acres of land located in the county of Jim Wells, Texas, USA 
for  a  term  of five years by the payment of $10,000. We capitalized the amount 
for  the  acquisition  of  the Lease Agreement and the related acquisition costs 
(legal  and  broker  fees)  for  a  total  of  $13,895. 
 
Pursuant  to the Lease Agreement, we were required to commence our operations on 
the  above  said  land  before  the  first anniversary date or tender the sum of 
$1,730.75 as the delay rental to cover the privilege of deferring operations for 
one  year  from  said  date.  During  the  fiscal  year 2008, Company management 
determined  that  under  prevailing  market  conditions  it  was not in the best 
interests  of  the  Company  to  continue  to  pay  delay rental under the Lease 
Agreement.  The  Company  did  not pay any sum towards the delay rental in 2008.

Any  and  all  rights  the  Company had under the Lease Agreement terminated and 
reverted  back  to the lessor on July 31, 2008.  The Company has written off all 
costs  related  to  acquiring  the  leasehold interest which amounts to $13,895. 
 
 
NOTE 4 - PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK 
 
We have 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized and none issued. 
 
We  have  100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized. All shares of stock are 
non-assessable  and  non-cumulative,  with  no  preemptive  rights. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<PAGE> 
NOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES 
 
At  August  31,  2009,  we  had  deferred  tax  assets  of approximately $25,500 
principally  arising  from  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  for  income tax 
purposes.  As  our  management  cannot determine that it is more likely than not 
that  we  will  realize  the  benefit  of  the  deferred  tax asset, a valuation 
allowance  equal  to  the  deferred tax asset has been established at August 31, 
2009.  A  reconciliation  of  income  taxes at statutory rates with the reported 
taxes  is  as  follows: 
 
                                              August 31, 2009    August 31, 2008 
Net loss before income taxes                  $      114,921    $        27,458 
 
Income tax recovery at statutory rates of 35%         40,222              9,610 
Unrecognized benefits of non-capital losses          (40,222)            (9,610) 
Total income tax recovery                     $            -    $             - 
 
The  significant components of the deferred tax asset at August 31, 2009 were as 
follows: 
 
                                             August 31, 2009     August 31, 2008 
Deferred tax assets: 
  Net operating loss carryforwards           $       65,600      $       25,500 
  Valuation allowance                               (65,600)            (25,500) 
  Net deferred tax asset                     $            -      $            - 
 
At  August  31,  2009,  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 
$187,400,  which  expire  in  the  year  2025  through  2029. 
 
NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
 
On  November  25, 2009, we obtained an assignment of the right to acquire a 4.9% 
working  interest  in  certain oil and gas properties located in Alberta from an 
independent  third  party.  As consideration for the working interest, we agreed 
to pay a total of $160,000 immediately, and issue 75 million common shares and 5 
million  preferred  shares  upon  closing.

ITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND 
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 
There have been no changes in or disagreements with our independent accountants 
since our inception. 
 
ITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
EVALUATION  OF  DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS  AND  PROCEDURES 
 
As  of  August 31, 2009, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and 
with  the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer 
and  Chief  Financial  Officer  (who  are  one  and  the  same  person),  of the 
effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure controls and 
procedures  pursuant  to  Exchange  Act  Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  Based solely on the material 
weaknesses  described  below,  our  Chief  Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer concluded that, as of August 31, 2009, the Company's disclosure controls 
and  procedures  were  not  effective: 
 
1.     The  Company  presently  has  only  one  officer,  who  is  also the sole 
director,  and  no  employees.  Inasmuch  as  there  is no segregation of duties 
within  the  Company, there is no management oversight, no one to review control 
documentation  and  no  control  documentation  is  being  produced. 
 
CHANGES  IN  DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS  AND  PROCEDURES 
 
There were no changes in disclosure controls and procedures that occurred during 
the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  have  materially  affected, or are 
reasonably  likely to materially effect, our disclosure controls and procedures. 
We  will  not  be  implementing  any  changes  to  our  disclosure  controls and 
procedures  until  there  is  a  significant change in our operations or capital 
resources.

LIMITATIONS  ON  THE  EFFECTIVENESS  OF  CONTROLS 
 
Our  management,  including  our  CEO and CFO (who are one and the same person), 
does  not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent 
all  errors  and  all  fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and 
operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable,  not  absolute,  assurance  that  the 
objectives  of  the  control  system  are  met. Further, the design of a control 
system  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are resource constraints, and the 
benefits  of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the 
inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  no evaluation of controls can 
provide  absolute  assurance  that all control issues and instances of fraud, if 
any,  within  the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include 
the  realities  that  judgments  in  decision-making  can  be  faulty,  and that 
breakdowns  can  occur  because  of  a  simple  error  or mistake. Additionally, 
controls  can  be  circumvented  by  the  individual  acts  of  some persons, by 
collusion  of  two  or  more  people,  or by management or board override of the 
control. 
 
The  design  of  any  system  of  controls  also  is  based in part upon certain 
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance 
that  any  design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential 
future  conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in  conditions,  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.  Because  of  the  inherent limitations in a cost-effective control 
system,  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
CEO  AND  CFO  CERTIFICATIONS 
 
Appearing  immediately following the Signatures section of this report there are 
Certifications  of  our  CEO  and  CFO  (who  are one and the same person).  The 
Certifications are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act  of  2002  (the Section 302 Certifications). This Item of this report is the 
information  concerning  the  Evaluation  referred  to  in  the  Section  302 
Certifications  and  this  information  should  be  read in conjunction with the 
Section  302  Certifications  for  a  more  complete understanding of the topics 
presented. 
 
MANAGEMENT'S  REPORT  ON  INTERNAL  CONTROL  OVER  FINANCIAL  REPORTING 
 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control  over  financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 
13a-15(f).  Our  internal control over financial reporting is a process designed 
to  provide  reasonable  assurance  to  our  management  and  board of directors 
regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting and the preparation of the 
financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  accounting 
principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America. 
 
Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those policies and 
procedures  that  (i)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail,  accurately  and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets  of  the  Company;  (ii)  provide 
 
<PAGE> 
reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit 
preparation  of  financial  statements  in accordance with accounting principles 
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America, and that receipts and 
expenditures  of  the  Company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with 
authorizations  of  management  and  directors of the Company; and (iii) provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  Company's assets that could have a 
material  effect  on  the  financial  statements. 
 
Because  of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter 
how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human 
error  and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective 
internal  control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance 
with  respect  to  financial  statement  preparation.  Also,  projections of any 
evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are subject to the risk that 
controls  may  become  inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may  deteriorate. 
 
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial 
reporting  as  of  August  31,  2009.  In  making  this  assessment, it used the 
criteria  set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission  (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based solely on the 
material  weaknesses  described  below, our management has concluded that, as of 
August 31, 2009, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not 
effective.  Management  has  identified  the  following  deficiencies that, when 
aggregated,  may  possibly  be  viewed  as  a  material weakness in our internal 
control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  August  31,  2009: 
 
1.     We  do not have an Audit Committee - While not being legally obligated to 
have  an  audit  committee,  it  is our management's view that such a committee, 
including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control 
over  our  financial  statements.  To  date  we  have  not  established an audit 
committee. 
 
2.     Insufficient  documentation of financial statement preparation and review 
procedures  -  We  employ  policies  and  procedures  in  reconciliation  of the 
financial  statements and the financial information based on which the financial 
statements  are  prepared.  Notwithstanding, the controls and policies we employ 
are  not  sufficiently  documented. 
 
3.     We  did  not maintain proper segregation of duties for the preparation of
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1343009/000130368109000077/tegc10k_31aug...

Page 14 of 17
our financial statements - As of August 31, 2009 the majority of the preparation 
of  financial  statements  was  carried  out  by  one  person.  Additionally, we 
currently  only  have one officer/director having oversight on all transactions. 
This  has  resulted  in  several  deficiencies  including: 
 
a.     Significant,  non-standard  journal entries were prepared and approved by 
the  same  person,  without  being  checked  or approved by any other personnel. 
 
b.     Lack  of  control  over  preparation  of financial statements, and proper 
application  of  accounting  policies. 
 
4.     We lack sufficient information technology controls and procedures - As of 
August 31, 2009, we lacked a proper data back-up procedure, and while backup did 
take  place in actuality, we believe that it was not regulated by methodical and 
consistent  activities  and  monitoring. 
 
CHANGES  IN  INTERNAL  CONTROL  OVER  FINANCIAL  REPORTING 
 
We  have  also  established  and  evaluated  our internal control over financial 
reporting,  and  there have been no significant changes in our internal controls 
or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to 
the  date of their last evaluation.  Nor have there have been any changes in our 
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  during  the  last fiscal quarter. 
Except  as  set  out  below,  we  do  not intend to implement any changes to our 
internal control over financial reporting until there is a significant change in 
our  level  of  operations  and  capital  resources: 
 
1.     We will engage additional personnel to assist with the preparation of our 
financial statements; which will allow for proper segregation of duties, as well 
as  additional  manpower  for  proper  documentation. 
 
2.     We  will  engage  in a thorough review and restatement of our information 
technology  control  procedures,  in addition to procurement of all hardware and 
software  that  will  enable us to maintain proper backups, access, control etc. 
 
This  annual  report  does  not  include an attestation report of our registered 
public  accounting  firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. We 
are  not  required  to  provide  an  attestation report by our registered public 
accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 10.     DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS AND CONTROL PERSONS; 
COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 
 
DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
 
The  following  sets  forth  our  directors,  executive  officers, promoters and 
control  persons,  their ages, and all offices and positions held. Directors are 
elected  for  a  period  of one year and thereafter serve until the shareholders 
duly  elect  their  successor. Officers and other employees serve at the will of 
the  Board  of  Directors. 
 
               TERM PERIOD SERVED AS DIRECTOR/OFFICER 
                           NAME     POSITION     AGE 
 
Thomas Mills     CEO, President, CFO, Secretary and a director     41     2005 
to present 
 
Thomas  E.  Mills  serves  as  our  President, Secretary, Treasurer and our sole 
director.  From  2001  until 2004, Mr. Mills was the President of Torrent Energy 
Corp. (formerly, Scarab Systems, Inc.), an oil and gas exploration company.  Mr. 
Mills  was  a  director and executive officer of Kingston Mines, Ltd., a mineral 
exploration  company,  from  2005  to  2008.  Since 2003, Mr. Mills has been the 
President,  CEO  and  a  director  of  AMP  Productions  Ltd.,  a motion picture 
production  company.  In  2009,  Mr. Mills became the sole executive officer and 
director  of  Novagen Solar Inc., a company involved in the sale of photovoltaic 
products.  Mr.  Mills  maintains  a part-time legal practice to which he devotes 
not more than 25 hours per week.  Mr. Mills received his Bachelor of Laws degree 
from  the  University  of British Columbia in 1996, and holds a Bachelor of Arts 
degree  obtained from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario in 1992.  He 
was  called  to  the  Bar  of  British  Columbia  in  1997. 
 
All  directors  serve for terms of one year each, and are subject to re-election 
at  our  regular  Annual  Meeting  of  Shareholders, unless they earlier resign. 
 
There  are  no  material  proceedings to which any of our directors, officers or 
affiliates, any owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of any 
class  of our voting securities, or any associate of any such director, officer, 
affiliate,  or  security  holder  is  a  party  adverse  to  us  or  any  of our 
subsidiaries  or  has  a  material  interest  adverse  to  us  or  any  of  our 
subsidiaries. 
 
We  have  attempted and will continue to attempt to insure that any transactions 
between  us  and  our  officers,  directors,  principal  shareholders,  or other 
affiliates  have been and will be on terms no less favorable to us than could be 
obtained  from  unaffiliated  third  parties  on  an  arm's-length  basis. 
 
INVOLVEMENT  IN  CERTAIN  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS 
 
Except  as  noted  herein  or  below, during the last five-(5) years none of our 
directors  or  officers  have:

(1)  had  any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such 
person  was  a  general  partner  or executive officer either at the time of the 
bankruptcy  or  within  two  years  prior  to  that  time; 
 
(2)  been  convicted  in  a criminal proceeding or subject to a pending criminal 
proceeding; 
 
(3)  been  subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, 
suspended  or  vacated,  of  any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or 
temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement 
in  any  type  of  business,  securities  or  banking  activities;  or 
 
(4)  been  found  by  a  court  of competent jurisdiction in a civil action, the 
Commission  or  the  Commodity  Futures  Trading  Commission  to have violated a 
federal  or  state  securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been 
reversed,  suspended,  or  vacated. 
 
COMPLIANCE  WITH  SECTION  16(A)  OF  THE  EXCHANGE  ACT 
 
Under  the  Securities  Laws  of the United States, the Company's Directors, our 
Executive  (and  certain  other) Officers, and any persons holding more than ten 
percent  of the Company's common stock are required to report their ownership of 
the  Company's  common stock and any changes in that ownership to the Securities 
and  Exchange  Commission.  Specific  due  dates  for  these  reports  have been 
established  and the Company is required to report in this report any failure to 
file  by  these  dates. 
 
All  of  these  filing  requirements  were  satisfied by the Company's Officers, 
Directors,  and  ten-percent  holders. 
 
 
<PAGE> 
In  making these statements, we have relied on the written representation of our 
Directors  and  Officers  or copies of the reports that they have filed with the 
Commission. 
 
COMMITTEES  OF  THE  BOARD 
 
All  proceedings  of the board of directors for the fiscal year ended August 31, 
2009  were  conducted  by  resolutions  consented  to in writing by our board of 
directors  and  filed  with  the  minutes  of  the  proceedings  of our board of 
directors.  Our  company  currently  does  not  have nominating, compensation or 
audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our company 
have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of 
directors  does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because 
it believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by 
the  board  of  directors. 
 
Our  company  does  not  have  any  defined policy or procedure requirements for 
shareholders  to  submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The board 
of  directors  believes  that,  given  the  stage of our development, a specific 
nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business 
operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not currently have 
any  specific  or  minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the board of 
directors  and  we  do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating 
such  nominees.  The  board  of  directors  will  assess all candidates, whether 
submitted  by  management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election 
or  appointment. 
 
A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by 
directing  a  written request addressed to our CEO, Thomas Mills, at the address 
appearing  on  the  first  page  of  this  registration  statement. 
 
AUDIT  COMMITTEE  FINANCIAL  EXPERT 
 
We  do not have a standing audit committee.  Our directors perform the functions 
usually designated to an audit committee.  Our board of directors has determined 
that  we  do  not  have  a  board  member  that qualifies as an "audit committee 
financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have 
a  board  member  that  qualifies  as  "independent" as the term is used in Item 
7(d)(3)(iv)(B)  of  Schedule  14A  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended,  and  as  defined  by  Rule  4200(a)(14)  of  the  NASD  Rules. 
 
We  believe  that  our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating 
our  financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for 
financial  reporting.  Our  board  of  directors  does  not  believe  that it is 
necessary  to  have  an  audit  committee  because  management believes that the 
functions  of  an  audit  committees can be adequately performed by the board of 
directors.  In  addition,  we believe that retaining an independent director who 
would  qualify  as  an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly 
and  burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our 
development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from 
operations  to  date. 
 
As  we  generate  revenue  in  the  future,  we  intend to form a standing audit 
committee  and  identify  and  appoint  a financial expert to serve on our audit 
committee. 
 
CODE  OF  ETHICS 
 
The  Company  has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that is 
applicable  to  our  principal  executive  officer, principal financial officer, 
principal  accounting  officer  or  controller,  or  persons  performing similar 
functions.  A  copy of our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers is filed

as  an  exhibit  to  this  annual  report  on  Form  10-K. 
 
INDEMNIFICATION 
 
Under  our  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  Bylaws  of the corporation, we may 
indemnify  an  officer  or  director  who  is  made  a  party to any proceeding, 
including  a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in 
a  manner  he  reasonably  believed  to  be in our best interest. We may advance 
expenses  incurred  in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or 
director  is  successful  on  the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be 
indemnified,  we  must  indemnify  him  against all expenses incurred, including 
attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only 
for  expenses  actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and 
if  the  officer  or  director  is  judged  liable,  only  by a court order. The 
indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of 
the  State  of  Nevada. 
 
Regarding  indemnification  for  liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 
1933,  which  may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are 
informed  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission, 
indemnification  is  against  public  policy,  as  expressed  in the Act and is, 
therefore,  unenforceable. 
 
 
<PAGE> 
ITEM  11.     EXECUTIVE  COMPENSATION 
 
To  date we have no employees other than our officers.  No compensation has been 
awarded,  earned or paid to our officers.  We have no employment agreements with 
any  of  our  officers.  We  do  not  contemplate  entering  into any employment 
agreements  until  such  time  as  we  have  proven  mineral  reserves. 
 
There  is  no  arrangement pursuant to which any of our directors has been or is 
compensated  for  services  provided  as  one  of  our  directors. 
 
There  are  no  stock option plans, retirement, pension, or profit sharing plans 
for  the  benefit  of  our  officers or directors.  We do not have any long-term 
incentive  plans  that  provide  compensation intended to serve as incentive for 
performance. 
 
ITEM  12.     SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND 
RELATED  STOCKHOLDERS  MATTERS 
 
The  following  table  sets  forth  certain information regarding the beneficial 
ownership  of our common stock as of August 31, 2009 by (i) each person known by 
us  to  be  a  beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of our issued and 
outstanding common stock; (ii) each of our Directors and executive officers; and 
(iii)  all  our  directors  and  executive  officers  as  a  group.

Directors and officers as a group (one person)     10,000,000     74 
 
Unless otherwise noted, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole 
voting  and  investment  power  with  respect  to  all  shares  of  common stock 
beneficially  owned  by  them. For purposes hereof, a person is considered to be 
the beneficial owner of securities that can be acquired by such person within 60 
days  from  the  date  hereof,  upon  the exercise of warrants or options or the 
conversion  of  convertible  securities.  Each  beneficial  owner's  percentage 
ownership  is  determined  by  assuming  that  any  such  warrants,  options  or 
convertible  securities  that are held by such person (but not those held by any 
other  person)  and  which can be exercised within 60 days from the date hereof, 
have  been  exercised. 
 
ITEM  13.     CERTAIN  RELATIONSHIPS  AND  RELATED  TRANSACTIONS,  AND  DIRECTOR 
INDEPENDENCE 
 
There  has  not  been  any transaction since September 1, 2007, nor is there any 
currently  proposed  transaction,  in which Thrust Energy Corp. has been or is a 
participant  involving an amount in excess of $120,000, and in which any related 
person  had  or  will  have  a  direct  or  indirect  material  interest. 
 
ITEM  14.     PRINCIPAL  ACCOUNTING  FEES  AND  SERVICES 
 
AUDIT  FEES 
 
The  aggregate  fees  billed by Chang Lee LLP for professional services rendered 
for  the audit of our annual financial statements included in this Annual Report 
on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended August 31, 2009 is estimated to be 
$5,000. 
 
The  aggregate  fees  billed by Chang Lee LLP for professional services rendered 
for  the audit of our annual financial statements included in this Annual Report 
on  Form  10-KSB  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  August  31,  2008  was  $5,250. 
 
AUDIT  RELATED  FEES 
 
For  the  fiscal years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate fees billed 
for  assurance  and  related services by Chang Lee LLP relating to our quarterly 
financial  statements  which  are  not  reported  under the caption "Audit Fees" 
above,  were  $2,500  and  $2,740,  respectively.

TAX  FEES 
 
For  the  fiscal years ended August 31, 2008 and 2009, the aggregate fees billed 
for  tax  compliance,  by  Chang  Lee  LLP  were  nil. 
 
 
<PAGE> 
ALL  OTHER  FEES 
 
For  the  fiscal years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate fees billed 
by  Chang  Lee  LLP  for other non-audit professional services, other than those 
services  listed  above,  totaled  nil. 
 
Effective May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that 
require that before Chang Lee LLP is engaged by us or our subsidiaries to render 
any  auditing  or  permitted  non-audit  related  service,  the  engagement  be: 
 
     -approved  by  our  audit  committee;  or 
 
-entered  into  pursuant  to pre-approval policies and procedures established by 
the audit committee, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the 
particular  service,  the  audit committee is informed of each service, and such 
policies  and  procedures  do  not  include  delegation of the audit committee's 
responsibilities  to  management. 
 
We  do not have an audit committee.  Our sole director pre-approves all services 
provided  by  our  independent  auditors. The pre-approval process has just been 
implemented  in response to the new rules. Therefore, our sole director does not 
have  records  of what percentage of the above fees were pre-approved.  However, 
all  of  the  above  services  and  fees  were reviewed and approved by our sole 
director  either  before  or  after  the  respective  services  were  rendered.
