<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Grenada was held at the 12th meeting on 26 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Grenada was headed by Robert Branch, Senior Legal 
</p>
<p>Counsel, Attorney General&#8217;s Chambers. At its 17th meeting held on 29 January 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on Grenada. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Grenada: Japan, Mexico and the United 
</p>
<p>States of America. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Grenada: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/GRD/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/GRD/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/GRD/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Mexico, Slovenia, Spain and 
</p>
<p>the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Grenada 
</p>
<p>through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review (UPR). A summary of additional questions posed by Canada, France, Jamaica, 
</p>
<p>Montenegro, Panama, Paraguay and the Philippines during the interactive dialogue is to be 
</p>
<p>found in section I B of the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation was pleased to present the report of Grenada to the 
</p>
<p>second universal periodic review and to give an account of the status of the implementation 
</p>
<p>of recommendations made during its first review in 2010. Grenada reiterated its 
</p>
<p>commitment to human rights and pledged to continue supporting the strengthening of the 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation apologized for the delay in submitting the national report, a 
</p>
<p>challenge faced by small countries. The report had been prepared in consultation with a 
</p>
<p>number of stakeholders and civil society organizations, including the Grenada Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Organization, and described progress made since the first review in 2010, regarding 
</p>
<p>the fulfilment of its human rights commitments and international obligations. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation thanked delegations that had sent questions in advance. While 
</p>
<p>Grenada had not accepted all of the recommendations made during the first review, it 
</p>
<p>continued efforts to achieve the commitments made in 2010. </p>


<p>8. The delegation reported on the ongoing constitutional reform process, highlighting 
</p>
<p>consultations being held in that regard. The proposals for reform of the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>specifically as they related to gender equality, discrimination and the equal treatment of all 
</p>
<p>children, directly responded to the most recent concluding observations issued by the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child and recommendations from the 2010 review under the UPR mechanism. 
</p>
<p>A number of other proposed changes, relating to the rights of persons with disabilities and 
</p>
<p>to economic, social and cultural rights, showed a commitment on the part of Grenada to 
</p>
<p>incorporate the principles underlying major international human rights treaties into national 
</p>
<p>law. 
</p>
<p>9. In response to an advance question on the impact of climate change in the country, 
</p>
<p>Grenada noted that discussions were taking place on the incorporation of the new 
</p>
<p>international concept of &#8220;protection for climate change&#8221; into the Constitution. Provisions 
</p>
<p>referred to the duty of the State to protect the country against adverse effects of climate 
</p>
<p>change and the duty to promote awareness of and preparedness for natural disasters. The 
</p>
<p>proposed amendments would be voted on in a referendum to be held later in the year. 
</p>
<p>10. Grenada noted with optimism the resolution of the Human Rights Council to host a 
</p>
<p>full day of discussion on human rights and climate change on 6 March 2015. The Grenada 
</p>
<p>delegation highlighted the value and importance of ensuring that small States, especially 
</p>
<p>those without representation in Geneva, had an opportunity to contribute to and benefit 
</p>
<p>from the exchange of views and best practices during that discussion and related events. 
</p>
<p>11. Grenada provided information on legislative reforms undertaken since the last 
</p>
<p>review, including the adoption of the new Domestic Violence Act and a new Child 
</p>
<p>Protection Act in 2010, as well as the Education Act of 2012. Amendments to the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Code were also made in 2012. The definition of sexual abuse of minors under the age of 16 
</p>
<p>now included boys, and provisions regarding the statute of limitation with regard to 
</p>
<p>reporting incidents of sexual intercourse with minors had been amended. The time 
</p>
<p>limitation, as well as the &#8220;honest belief&#8221; defence clause had now also been removed. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the interactive dialogue, 44 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. All written 
</p>
<p>statements of the delegations, to be checked against delivery on the United Nations webcast 
</p>
<p>archives,1 are posted on the extranet of the Human Rights Council when available.2 
</p>
<p>13. Ghana commended Grenada for being party to key human rights instruments and 
</p>
<p>applauded the progress made in implementing a number of accepted recommendations from 
</p>
<p>the first review. 
</p>
<p>14. Guatemala welcomed progress made by Grenada, in particular with regard to 
</p>
<p>legislative measures to eliminate discrimination against women and the protection of 
</p>
<p>children. It further commended Grenada for the constitutional reform process aiming at 
</p>
<p>promoting and protecting human rights, as well as for its open policy with regard to 
</p>
<p>migrants.

<p>15. Indonesia welcomed the constitutional review in progress, which would result in 
</p>
<p>stronger protection for human rights. It took positive note of the adoption of key legislation 
</p>
<p>which, when implemented, would provide protection for human rights. Indonesia stated that 
</p>
<p>the ratification and implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) would contribute to the efforts to 
</p>
<p>prevent torture. 
</p>
<p>16. Germany appreciated the commitment of Grenada since the first UPR, in particular 
</p>
<p>to the ratification and accession to various international instruments. Germany remained 
</p>
<p>concerned about the protection of children against all forms of violence and the situation of 
</p>
<p>family violence and child abuse, as well as the lawfulness of corporal punishment of 
</p>
<p>children. 
</p>
<p>17. Italy commended Grenada for its commitment to human rights, particularly for the 
</p>
<p>steps taken to further protect the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p>18. Jamaica stated that Grenada had made significant strides to improve the legislative 
</p>
<p>framework for the protection of human rights. It referred to the recommendation from the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) to develop data collection systems and expand 
</p>
<p>the mandate of the Central Statistical Office and the recommendation from the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to adopt temporary special measures 
</p>
<p>to guarantee equal representation of women in Parliament and Government, and requested 
</p>
<p>the views of Grenada on the feasibility of those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>19. Maldives commended Grenada for the progress made since the last review, 
</p>
<p>including it acceding to key instruments and its efforts to combat violence against women 
</p>
<p>and protect the rights of children. It encouraged Grenada to continue and strengthen its 
</p>
<p>efforts in that regard, and in the overall protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>20. Mexico acknowledged progress made by Grenada since the last review. It urged 
</p>
<p>Grenada to seek technical assistance to meet its human rights commitments, including its 
</p>
<p>reporting obligations and the strengthening of their plans and human rights programmes. 
</p>
<p>21. Montenegro welcomed the ratification of several human rights treaties. It requested 
</p>
<p>information about progress in implementing the 2014 national sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>health policy and strategic plan; and about activities undertaken to increase the age of 
</p>
<p>criminality and to ensure that children were held separately from adults in pretrial detention 
</p>
<p>and after being sentenced. 
</p>
<p>22. Morocco welcomed efforts to strengthen the protection of human rights and to revise 
</p>
<p>national legislation in line with international human rights instruments. It noted that the 
</p>
<p>difficulties experienced by Grenada were generally connected to the lack resources. 
</p>
<p>Because of the cooperation of Grenada with it, the international community had the moral 
</p>
<p>responsibility to help strengthen the human rights system in the country.  
</p>
<p>23. Namibia commended Grenada for adopting legislative measures aimed at 
</p>
<p>eliminating discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>24. Denmark commended Grenada for its constructive engagement in the UPR process 
</p>
<p>and for the ratification of several human rights treaties since its last review. It hoped that 
</p>
<p>Grenada would consider ratification of CAT. Denmark referred to the CAT Initiative which 
</p>
<p>aimed to assist Governments in overcoming obstacles to ratification. It indicated readiness 
</p>
<p>to explore avenues to assist Grenada in that regard.  
</p>
<p>25. Nicaragua took note of progress made by Grenada, highlighting the ongoing 
</p>
<p>constitutional reform process and the adoption of the Domestic Violence and the Child 
</p>
<p>Protection Acts. It recognized Grenadian efforts to improve the socioeconomic conditions </p>


<p>of the population. It encouraged Grenada to seek technical assistance to strengthen its 
</p>
<p>human rights protection system. 
</p>
<p>26. Panama commended Grenada for its efforts. It asked Grenada to share information 
</p>
<p>on progress made in the implementation of policies aimed at reducing violence against 
</p>
<p>women and all forms of abuse of children. It also requested information on measures 
</p>
<p>adopted to eradicate the sale and trafficking of children for sexual and labour exploitation. 
</p>
<p>27. Paraguay appreciated the efforts made by Grenada, in particular to ratify human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments. It asked Grenada to provide information on national legislation, in 
</p>
<p>particular article 65 of the Criminal Code which, according to information received, would 
</p>
<p>allow parents and others with parental responsibilities to have the authority to use force 
</p>
<p>against children younger than 16 years. 
</p>
<p>28. The Philippines, while noting positive developments, stated that challenges 
</p>
<p>remained in addressing violence against women and corporal punishment of children. The 
</p>
<p>Philippines asked how the Strategic Plan for Education Enhancement and Development 
</p>
<p>contributed to improving the quality of and access to education, as well as about the efforts 
</p>
<p>undertaken to ensure the right to health.  
</p>
<p>29. Portugal noted the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED), the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the International Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). It noted measures taken with regard to 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights and encouraged Grenada to pursue those efforts and develop additional 
</p>
<p>measures for ensuring the right to education.  
</p>
<p>30. Sierra Leone stated that the review would have been better facilitated had Grenada 
</p>
<p>submitted a national report. The commitment of Grenada to human rights was demonstrated 
</p>
<p>by its ratification of core instruments. Grenada should review its laws and regulations in 
</p>
<p>order to amend gender-based discriminatory provisions, and adopt asylum and refugee 
</p>
<p>legislation and procedures.  
</p>
<p>31. Singapore took positive note of legislative measures undertaken by Grenada to 
</p>
<p>eliminate discrimination against women and to protect women and children. It welcomed 
</p>
<p>the ratification of CRPD.  
</p>
<p>32. Slovenia regretted that Grenada had not submitted a national report. Four reports to 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies were overdue. It expressed concern that there was no formal moratorium on 
</p>
<p>the death penalty. It was also concerned by the high incidence of violence against women, 
</p>
<p>the high rate of unsafe abortions and the punitive provisions imposed on women who 
</p>
<p>underwent abortions.  
</p>
<p>33. Spain welcomed Grenadian efforts to ratify various international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, in particular CRPD and ICPPED. It noted that the last execution in Grenada 
</p>
<p>had occurred in 1978, but was concerned that the country had not supported General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolutions calling for moratoriums on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>34. Sweden noted that capital punishment could be applied for murder, but that no 
</p>
<p>executions had occurred since 1978 and a de facto moratorium was in place. It was 
</p>
<p>concerned at reports of intolerance against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) 
</p>
<p>persons, but noted the responses of Grenada, including the launching of a dialogue on the 
</p>
<p>rights of LGBT persons. 
</p>
<p>35. The delegation responded to questions and comments, including those received in 
</p>
<p>advance. Regarding questions raised by Germany, the United Kingdom of Great Britain of 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland and other delegations on the issue of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender 
</p>
<p>and intersex (LGBTI) persons, Grenada reported that the issue of discrimination against </p>


<p>LGBTI persons was being considered within the context of the ongoing process of 
</p>
<p>constitutional reform and had been raised in several of the public consultations held 
</p>
<p>throughout Grenada. The general view in that regard was that the Constitution should not 
</p>
<p>be amended to give protection to LGBTI persons. Notwithstanding that, on 15 October 
</p>
<p>2014, the Constitutional Reform Advisory Committee had commissioned two non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations advocating for the rights of LGBTI persons to create a platform 
</p>
<p>for national consultations. In the end, protection for the LGBTI population would not be 
</p>
<p>one of the issues to be decided in the referendum; the Committee did not recommend that to 
</p>
<p>be an issue to go forward. Within the democratic process, it was obvious that there was not 
</p>
<p>much support for that issue nationally. It should be noted, however, that apart from the 
</p>
<p>recommendations on constitutional reform made by the Committee to the Government, the 
</p>
<p>Committee had recommended that ordinary legislation be passed with regard to &#8220;protection 
</p>
<p>against discrimination at workplaces based only on sexual orientation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the issue of violence against women and child abuse, raised by  
</p>
<p>Mexico, Slovenia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain of Northern Ireland and other 
</p>
<p>delegations, Grenada had passed the Domestic Violence Act, which required police officers 
</p>
<p>to report and record any report of domestic violence. The Criminal Code had also been 
</p>
<p>amended; the statute of limitation with regard to sexual offences had been removed; and the 
</p>
<p>mandatory reporting by parents and guardians of minors subject to sexual offences had 
</p>
<p>been reinforced. Other sensitization and community outreach strategies to address the issue 
</p>
<p>of violence against women were also in place, such as promoting healthy relationships and 
</p>
<p>confronting myths, beliefs and practices through various activities with the support of 
</p>
<p>community organizations. 
</p>
<p>37. Regarding the issue of corporal punishment, Grenada was cognizant of the call for 
</p>
<p>the total abolition of corporal punishment. The delegation called attention to a pilot project 
</p>
<p>being implemented in several schools and which facilitated the use of positive behaviour 
</p>
<p>management strategies, removing the need for the use of corporal punishment. The 
</p>
<p>feedback from the project had been positive and it was the intention of the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education to extend the programme to all schools in Grenada.  
</p>
<p>38. Regarding juvenile justice, Grenada had made significant progress in the legislative 
</p>
<p>reform critical to the juvenile justice platform, as well as on the overall agenda to ensure 
</p>
<p>care and protection of its children and young people. Grenada had sought support to adjust 
</p>
<p>the development of the organizational structure to support the operation of the Bacolet 
</p>
<p>Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre, which was under construction and expected to open in 
</p>
<p>2015. Grenada had also increased the criminal age of responsibility to 12 years, with a 
</p>
<p>proviso in the Criminal Code that the Court could consider the level of maturity of the 
</p>
<p>child. The Juvenile Justice Programme was being moved forward with programmes for 
</p>
<p>diversion, rehabilitation and reintegration. Rehabilitation centre staff were expected to be 
</p>
<p>trained in 2015. 
</p>
<p>39. On the issue of the establishment of a national human rights institution in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles), Grenada would seek 
</p>
<p>technical assistance to hold a national consultation in order to strengthen knowledge on the 
</p>
<p>Paris Principles and consider the establishment of a national human rights institution.  
</p>
<p>40. Responding to an advance question from Slovenia on the issue of the protection of 
</p>
<p>boys against sexual exploitation, Grenada reiterated that the Criminal Code had been 
</p>
<p>amended in 2012 so that the definition of sexual abuse of minors under the age of 16 now 
</p>
<p>included boys. 
</p>
<p>41. Regarding the issue of sexual harassment, raised by Mexico and other delegations, 
</p>
<p>Grenada indicated that sexual harassment was not yet punishable by law. A draft bill had </p>


<p>been developed, however. The Ministry of Labour was looking at draft amendments to the 
</p>
<p>Labour Code and had recommended that sexual harassment be included within the 
</p>
<p>amendment to be brought to Parliament in 2015. 
</p>
<p>42. On the issue of human trafficking raised by Mexico and the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain of Northern Ireland in their advance questions, Grenada was pleased to report 
</p>
<p>that it had passed the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act in 2014. It would come into 
</p>
<p>force on a date to be named by the Minister by notice published in the Official Gazette. 
</p>
<p>That Act would give effect to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
</p>
<p>against Transnational Organized Crime of 2000. 
</p>
<p>43. Responding to questions raised by the delegations of Jamaica and Mexico on the 
</p>
<p>issue of women, the delegation was pleased to report that one of the issues that would be 
</p>
<p>put to referendum referred to the role of women in Grenadian society. A provision on 
</p>
<p>equality of women had been included in the draft bill. There was an opportunity for 
</p>
<p>Grenada to seek assistance in the drafting of those provisions and in the public education 
</p>
<p>process that would lead to the referendum.  
</p>
<p>44. Switzerland welcomed the efforts of Grenada in the ratification of international 
</p>
<p>instruments and encouraged it to continue that endeavour. It also noted the ongoing process 
</p>
<p>of constitutional reform and consultations. 
</p>
<p>45. Thailand welcomed the ratification of CRPD and steps taken towards the ratification 
</p>
<p>of other international human rights instruments. It encouraged Grenada to further 
</p>
<p>harmonize its legislation with its international human rights obligations. It stood ready to 
</p>
<p>share with Grenada its experience in the area of health care. 
</p>
<p>46. Trinidad and Tobago considered that poverty and unemployment required further 
</p>
<p>attention. Despite challenges, Grenada had taken a positive stance in fulfilling its human 
</p>
<p>rights obligations as evidenced by the country&#8217;s ratifications. Trinidad and Tobago noted 
</p>
<p>the constitutional reform process and acknowledged the progress made in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the National Strategic Plan to Reduce Gender-based Violence. 
</p>
<p>47. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Grenada to: 
</p>
<p>ratify CAT and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights (ICCPR); establish a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles; increase its efforts to reduce domestic violence; and establish a moratorium on 
</p>
<p>executions. 
</p>
<p>48. The United States of America was encouraged by the efforts to consult broadly in 
</p>
<p>the constitutional reform process and encouraged Grenada to consider recommendations 
</p>
<p>from the first UPR in that process. It commended legislation which prohibited child 
</p>
<p>pornography, but remained concerned at the limitations of certain other child protection 
</p>
<p>legislation. 
</p>
<p>49. Uruguay regretted the absence of the country&#8217;s national report and encouraged it to 
</p>
<p>solicit international technical cooperation, including from OHCHR, in order to strengthen 
</p>
<p>its participation in international human rights mechanisms. It noted with satisfaction the 
</p>
<p>accession of Grenada to various international human rights instruments, including ICERD 
</p>
<p>and CRPD.  
</p>
<p>50. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela highlighted the Grenadian approach to 
</p>
<p>education as a national priority and its making education obligatory and free from 5 to 16 
</p>
<p>years. It stressed that Grenada had not spared any efforts to improve living standards, 
</p>
<p>despite its economic difficulties and the impact of natural phenomena. </p>


<p>51. Algeria welcomed positive developments in Grenada for the protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights, including the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2012 and CRPD in 2014.  
</p>
<p>52. Argentina regretted that the national report had not been made available on time. In 
</p>
<p>relation to women&#8217;s rights, it noted the measures taken towards the elimination of 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women, such as the Domestic Violence Act and the Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence and Sexual Abuse Protocol. 
</p>
<p>53. Armenia welcomed the ratification by Grenada of core international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments as well as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
</p>
<p>(UNESCO) conventions on the protection and promotion of cultural rights. It welcomed the 
</p>
<p>legislative measures aimed, inter alia, at ending violence against women. It noted the high 
</p>
<p>rate of dropout from school of children belonging to vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>54. Australia welcomed the establishment by Grenada of the Constitutional Reform 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee to advise the Government on the adoption of a new Constitution and 
</p>
<p>its ratification of ICERD and CRPD. It was concerned that discrimination and violence 
</p>
<p>based on sexual orientation and gender identity remained an issue in Grenada. 
</p>
<p>55. Brazil acknowledged progress since the first UPR. The constitutional reform process 
</p>
<p>and its participatory nature were noteworthy. It believed that the process would lead to 
</p>
<p>greater enjoyment of fundamental rights. It was concerned, inter alia, that consensual same-
</p>
<p>sex relations could entail 10 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>56. Canada noted the acceptance by Grenada of its recommendation at the first UPR on 
</p>
<p>undertaking a comprehensive review of prison conditions and requested a further update on 
</p>
<p>the steps taken to implement the recommendation. It welcomed the ratification of CRPD 
</p>
<p>and ICERD. 
</p>
<p>57. Chile regretted that the national report had not been provided prior to the review. It 
</p>
<p>looked with satisfaction upon the advances made by Grenada and highlighted the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court, ICERD and CRPD. It 
</p>
<p>urged Grenada to strengthen its efforts in human rights protection. 
</p>
<p>58. China appreciated that Grenada had taken legislative and administrative measures to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect human rights, in particular to combat poverty, to advance in reforming 
</p>
<p>its social protection system, to improve the education and health-care system and to protect 
</p>
<p>women, children and people with disabilities, as well as to promote gender equality and 
</p>
<p>fight sexual violence. China called on the international community to provide constructive 
</p>
<p>assistance to Grenada. 
</p>
<p>59. Colombia highlighted the commitment demonstrated by Grenada in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of recommendations from its first UPR. It noted in particular the 
</p>
<p>transparency and collaboration of Grenada with the human rights mechanisms. Colombia 
</p>
<p>offered to share its experience in the areas of the recommendations made by Colombia to 
</p>
<p>Grenada. 
</p>
<p>60. Costa Rica noted the ratification of various international instruments and urged 
</p>
<p>Grenada to bring its national legislation into line with international standards. It urged 
</p>
<p>Grenada to review the national legislation with the aim of abolishing the death penalty and 
</p>
<p>to consider ratifying CAT and the Optional Protocol thereto. 
</p>
<p>61. Cuba recognized the efforts of Grenada and steps being taken to comply with the 
</p>
<p>accepted recommendations from its first review under the UPR. It highlighted, among 
</p>
<p>others, efforts in the areas of education, to combat poverty and to improve the health 
</p>
<p>system. It noted that the international community should continue supporting Grenada, 
</p>
<p>based on its national priorities. </p>


<p>62. The Netherlands congratulated Grenada for its adherence to a number of core human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments. It remained concerned about the law which criminalized consensual 
</p>
<p>sexual acts between adult males. Also, despite recommendations from the first review, 
</p>
<p>corporal punishment remained lawful.  
</p>
<p>63. Ecuador recognized the efforts of Grenada to implement UPR recommendations 
</p>
<p>from the first review, in particular the adoption of legislative measures, among other 
</p>
<p>initiatives, such as the Domestic Violence and the Child Protection Acts. 
</p>
<p>64. France asked if Grenada intended establishing a national human rights institution in 
</p>
<p>conformity with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>65. Ireland urged Grenada to bring the Juvenile Justice Act into force and take all 
</p>
<p>possible steps to submit overdue treaty body reports. Grenada had not implemented the 
</p>
<p>first-cycle recommendations on establishing a national human rights institution in 
</p>
<p>compliance with the Paris Principles. Ireland expressed concern that the Criminal Code 
</p>
<p>penalized consensual same-sex relations.  
</p>
<p>66. The delegation thanked again all delegations for their comments and additional 
</p>
<p>questions. 
</p>
<p>67. Responding to additional questions from Ireland and Trinidad and Tobago on the 
</p>
<p>Juvenile Justice Act and the work to be done to bring the Act into force, the delegation 
</p>
<p>stated that one of the conditions to enable the coming into force of the Act was the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Bacolet facility, which was expected to be completed in 2015. Once 
</p>
<p>that was be done, the Government would move to implement that Act.  
</p>
<p>68. Grenada further thanked the delegations of Argentina, Cuba and the Bolivarian 
</p>
<p>Republic of Venezuela, which spoke on the issue of education, noting the priority placed by 
</p>
<p>Grenada on education. Grenada indicated that it intended to promote education even 
</p>
<p>further. In terms of the legal framework, and as part of the fundamental rights provisions, 
</p>
<p>Grenada intended to include education in the constitutional reforms. A new clause was also 
</p>
<p>being drafted to ensure that every child with a disability would have the right to an 
</p>
<p>education, in accordance with their needs. 
</p>
<p>69. On a question regarding the prison conditions, Grenada referred to ongoing efforts to 
</p>
<p>reactivate the Prison Review Committee to review conditions in prison. The Committee had 
</p>
<p>met in 2013 and had made some recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. With regard to additional questions raised by France and Ireland on the national 
</p>
<p>human rights institute, as indicated earlier, Grenada was actively discussing that as part of 
</p>
<p>the constitutional reform process. Grenada had requested assistance from the United 
</p>
<p>Nations for the establishment of a permanent mechanism for constitutional reform. Grenada 
</p>
<p>was also seeking assistance to hold a seminar to raise awareness on the issue. 
</p>
<p>71. In conclusion, the delegation thanked all delegations. Grenada continued to pursue 
</p>
<p>its commitments made to the Human Rights Council in 2010 and was committed to the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of fundamental human rights. It was cognizant that capacity and 
</p>
<p>resource constraints continued to impede its ability to more effectively and efficiently 
</p>
<p>implement many of its initiatives and programmes aimed at improving the livelihood of its 
</p>
<p>citizens and those who visited or resided in their shores. In the face of the many challenges 
</p>
<p>that Grenada faced, economic, social and otherwise, Grenada looked forward to continued 
</p>
<p>partnership with the international community in the protection and promotion of human 
</p>
<p>rights through the strengthening of human rights mechanisms in the national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international forums. </p>
