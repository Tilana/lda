rules and regulations of the SEC. Therefore, these condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
NOTE 2: Income Taxes
The Company’s provision for income taxes differs from the statutory rate primarily due to estimated federal and state
benefits generated from estimated excess federal and Oklahoma percentage depletion, which are permanent tax
benefits. Excess percentage depletion, both federal and Oklahoma, can only be taken in the amount that it exceeds
cost depletion which is calculated on a unit-of-production basis.
Both excess federal percentage depletion, which is limited to certain production volumes and by certain income
levels, and excess Oklahoma percentage depletion, which has no limitation on production volume, reduce estimated
taxable income or add to estimated taxable loss projected for any year. Due to the lower expected 2016 oil and
natural gas prices, fiscal 2016 percentage depletion is not expected to significantly exceed cost depletion as in past
years. Therefore, the permanent tax benefit in 2016 is not expected to be as significant as in 2015. The federal and
Oklahoma excess percentage depletion estimates will be updated throughout the year until finalized with detailed
well-by-well calculations at fiscal year-end. Federal and Oklahoma excess percentage depletion, when a provision for
income taxes is recorded, decreases the effective tax rate, while the effect is to increase the effective tax rate when a
benefit for income taxes is recorded. The benefits of federal and Oklahoma excess percentage depletion are not
directly related to the amount of pre-tax income recorded in a period. Accordingly, in periods where a recorded pre-tax
income or loss is relatively small, the proportional effect of these items on the effective tax rate may be significant. The
effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2016, was 42% as compared to 32% for the nine months ended
June 30, 2015.  The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, was 55% as compared to -47% for the
quarter ended June 30, 2015.  The higher estimated effective tax rate as of the end of the 2015 third quarter of 32%,
as compared to 29% estimated at the end of the 2015 second quarter, resulted in a tax provision recorded during the
2015 third quarter. When a tax provision is recorded in a quarter with net loss (as opposed to a net income) before
provision for income taxes, the result is a negative effective tax rate for the quarter, as was the case for the 2015 third
quarter.
NOTE 3: Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share
Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated using net income (loss) divided by the weighted average
number of voting common shares outstanding, including unissued, vested directors’ deferred compensation shares
during the period.
NOTE 4: Long-term Debt
The Company has a $200,000,000 credit facility with a group of banks headed by Bank of Oklahoma (BOK) with
a current borrowing base of  $80,000,000 and a maturity date of November 30, 2018.  The credit facility is subject to a
semi-annual borrowing base determination, wherein BOK applies their commodity pricing forecast to the Company’s
reserve forecast and determines a borrowing base. The facility is secured by certain of the Company’s properties with
a net book value of $169,155,141 at June 30, 2016. The interest rate is based on BOK prime plus from 0.375% to
1.125%, or 30 day LIBOR plus from 1.875% to 2.625%. The election of BOK prime or LIBOR is at the Company’s
discretion. The interest rate spread from BOK prime or LIBOR will be charged based on the ratio of the loan balance
to the borrowing base. The interest rate spread from LIBOR or the prime rate increases as a larger percent of the
borrowing base is advanced. At June 30, 2016, the effective interest rate was 2.77%.
The Company’s debt is recorded at the carrying amount on its balance sheet. The carrying amount of the Company’s
revolving credit facility approximates fair value because the interest rates are reflective of market rates.
Determinations of the borrowing base are made semi-annually (June and December) or whenever the banks, in their
(5)
discretion, believe that there has been a material change in the value of the oil and natural gas properties. On June 7,
2016, the borrowing base was adjusted by the banks from $100,000,000  to $80,000,000. The loan agreement
contains customary covenants which, among other things, require periodic financial and reserve reporting and place
certain limits on the Company’s incurrence of indebtedness, liens, payment of dividends and acquisitions of treasury
stock. In addition, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios, a current ratio (as defined) of no less
than 1.0 to 1.0 and a funded debt to EBITDA (trailing twelve months as defined) of no more than 4.0 to 1.0. At June 30,
2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the loan agreement and has $30,800,000 of availability
under its outstanding credit facility.
NOTE 5: Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
Annually, non-employee directors may elect to be included in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors. The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides that each outside director may
individually elect to be credited with future unissued shares of Company common stock rather than cash for all or a
portion of the annual retainers, Board meeting fees and committee meeting fees, and may elect to receive shares,
when issued, over annual time periods up to ten years. These unissued shares are recorded to each director’s
deferred compensation account at the closing market price of the shares (i) on the dates of the Board and committee
meetings, and (ii) on the payment dates of the annual retainers. Only upon a director’s retirement, termination, death,
or a change-in-control of the Company will the shares recorded for such director under the Deferred Compensation
Plan for Non-Employee Directors be issued to the director. The promise to issue such shares in the future is an
unsecured obligation of the Company.
NOTE 6: Restricted Stock Plan
In March 2010, shareholders approved the Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc. 2010 Restricted Stock Plan (2010 Stock
Plan), which made available 200,000 shares of common stock to provide a long-term component to the Company’s
total compensation package for its officers and to further align the interest of its officers with those of its shareholders.
In March 2014, shareholders approved an amendment to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for
issuance under the 2010 Stock Plan from 200,000 shares to 500,000 shares and to allow the grant of shares of
restricted stock to our directors. The 2010 Stock Plan, as amended, is designed to provide as much flexibility as
possible for future grants of restricted stock so that the Company can respond as necessary to provide competitive
compensation in order to retain, attract and motivate directors and officers of the Company and to align their interests
with those of the Company’s shareholders.
Effective in May 2014, the board of directors adopted resolutions to allow management, at their discretion, to purchase
the Company’s common stock up to an amount equal to the aggregate number of shares of common stock awarded
pursuant to the Company’s Amended 2010 Restricted Stock Plan, contributed by the Company to its ESOP and
credited to the accounts of directors pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.
On December 9, 2015, the Company awarded 13,482 non-performance based shares and 40,446 performance based
shares of the Company’s common stock as restricted stock to certain officers. The restricted stock vests at the end of a
 three-year period and contains nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends and voting rights during the vesting period.
The non-performance and performance based shares had a fair value on their award date of $223,397 and $376,915,
respectively. The Company recognized $211,363 of compensation expense on the award date for performance based
shares for officers that were eligible for retirement. The remaining fair value for the performance based awards as well
as the entire fair value of the non-performance based awards will be recognized as compensation expense ratably
over the vesting period. The fair value of the performance based shares on their award date is calculated by
simulating the Company’s stock prices as compared to the Dow Jones Select Oil Exploration and Production Index
(DJSOEP) prices utilizing a Monte Carlo model covering the performance period (December 9, 2015, through
December 9, 2018).
On December 31, 2015, the Company awarded 12,996 non-performance based shares of the Company’s common
stock as restricted stock to its non-employee directors. The restricted stock vests quarterly over one year starting on
March 31, 2016. The restricted stock contains nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends and voting rights during the
vesting period. These non-performance based shares had a fair value on their award date of $210,018.
The following table summarizes the Company’s pre-tax compensation expense for the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, related to the Company’s performance based and non-performance based restricted stock.

NOTE 7: Oil, NGL and Natural Gas Reserves
Management considers the estimation of the Company’s crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves to be the most
significant of its judgments and estimates. Changes in crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserve estimates affect the
Company’s calculation of DD&A, provision for retirement of assets and assessment of the need for asset impairments.
On an annual basis, with a semi-annual update, the Company’s Independent Consulting Petroleum Engineer, with
assistance from Company staff, prepares estimates of crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves based on available
geological and seismic data, reservoir pressure data, core analysis reports, well logs, analogous reservoir
performance history, production data and other available sources of engineering, geological and geophysical
information. Between periods in which reserves would normally be calculated, the Company updates the reserve
calculations utilizing appropriate prices for the current period. The estimated oil, NGL and natural gas reserves were
computed using the 12-month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-
month oil, NGL and natural gas price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the balance sheet date, held
flat over the life of the properties. However, projected future crude oil, NGL and natural gas pricing assumptions are
used by management to prepare estimates of crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows used
in asset impairment assessments and in formulating management’s overall operating decisions. Crude oil, NGL and
natural gas prices are volatile and affected by worldwide production and consumption and are outside the control of
management.
NOTE 8: Impairment
All long-lived assets, principally oil and natural gas properties, are monitored for potential impairment when
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its estimated future net cash flows.
The evaluations involve significant judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as: inflation
rates; future drilling and completion costs; future sales prices for oil, NGL and natural gas; future production costs;
estimates of future oil, NGL and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof; the economic and
regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in
sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Between periods in which reserves
would normally be calculated, the Company updates the reserve calculations to reflect any material changes since
the prior report was issued and then utilizes updated projected future price decks current with the period. For the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the assessment resulted in impairment provisions on producing properties of
$0 and $132,118, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the assessment resulted in
impairment provisions on producing properties of $11,849,064 and $3,532,760, respectively. The impairment
provision for the nine months ended June 30, 2016,  is principally the result of lower projected future prices for oil,
NGL and natural gas. A further reduction in oil, NGL and natural gas prices or a decline in reserve volumes may lead
to additional impairment in future periods that may be material to the Company.
NOTE 9: Capitalized Costs
As of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, non-producing oil and natural gas properties include costs of
$5,917 and $1,762, respectively, on exploratory wells which were drilling and/or testing.
NOTE 10: Derivatives
The Company has entered into commodity price derivative agreements including fixed swap contracts and costless
collar contracts. These instruments are intended to reduce the Company’s exposure to short-term fluctuations in the
price of oil and natural gas. Fixed swap contracts set a fixed price and provide payments to the Company if the index
price is below the fixed price, or require payments by the Company if the index price is above the fixed price. Collar
contracts set a fixed floor price and a fixed ceiling price and provide payments to the Company if the index price falls
below the floor or require payments by the Company if the index price rises above the ceiling. These contracts cover
only a portion of the Company’s natural gas and oil production and provide only partial price protection against
declines in natural gas and oil prices. These
(7)
derivative instruments may expose the Company to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of future increases in
prices. All of the Company’s derivative contracts are with Bank of Oklahoma and are secured under its credit facility
with Bank of Oklahoma. The derivative instruments have settled or will settle based on the prices below.

The Company has elected not to complete all of the documentation requirements necessary to permit these derivative
contracts to be accounted for as cash flow hedges. The Company’s fair value of derivative contracts was a net
liability of $1,690,516 as of June 30, 2016, and a net asset of $4,210,764 as of September 30, 2015.
The fair value amounts recognized for the Company’s derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty under
a master netting arrangement may be offset. The Company has the choice to offset or not, but that choice must be
applied consistently. A master netting arrangement exists if the reporting entity has multiple contracts with a single
counterparty that are subject to a contractual agreement that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a
single payment in a single
(8)
currency in the event of default on or termination of any one contract. Offsetting the fair values recognized for the
derivative contracts outstanding with a single counterparty results in the net fair value of the transactions being
reported as an asset or a liability in the Condensed Balance Sheets.
The following table summarizes and reconciles the Company's derivative contracts’ fair values at a gross level back
to net fair value presentation on the Company's Condensed Balance Sheets at June 30, 2016, and September 30,
2015.  The Company has offset all amounts subject to master netting agreements in the Company's Condensed
Balance Sheets at June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015.

immaterial for all periods presented.
NOTE 11: Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, i.e., an exit price. To estimate an exit price, a three-level
hierarchy is used. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions market
participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability, into three levels. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified
(contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2
inputs include the following: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability; or (iv) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the financial asset or liability.
The following table provides fair value measurement information for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016.

Level 2 – Market Approach - The fair values of the Company’s swaps are based on a third-party pricing model which
utilizes inputs that are either readily available in the public market, such as natural gas curves, or can be corroborated
from active markets. These values are based upon future prices, time to maturity and other factors. These values are
then compared to the values given by our counterparties for reasonableness.
Level 3 – The fair values of the Company’s costless collar contracts are based on a pricing model which utilizes
inputs that are unobservable or not readily available in the public market. These values are based upon future prices,
volatility, time to maturity and other factors. These values are then compared to the values given by our counterparties
for reasonableness.
(9)
The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 derivative contracts include market volatility and credit risk of
counterparties. Changes in these inputs will impact the fair value measurement of our derivative contracts. An
increase (decrease) in the volatility of oil and natural gas prices will decrease (increase) the fair value of oil and
natural gas derivatives and adverse changes to our counterparties’ creditworthiness will decrease the fair value of our
derivatives.

(a) At the end of each quarter, the Company assesses the carrying value of its producing properties for impairment.
This assessment utilizes estimates of future cash flows. Significant judgments and assumptions in these assessments
include estimates of future oil and natural gas prices using a forward NYMEX curve adjusted for locational basis
differentials, drilling plans, expected capital costs and an applicable discount rate commensurate with risk of the
underlying cash flow estimates. These assessments identified certain properties with carrying value in excess of their
calculated fair values.
At June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, the fair value of financial instruments approximated their carrying
amounts. Financial instruments include long-term debt, which the valuation is classified as Level 3 and is based on a
valuation technique that requires inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value
measurement. The fair value measurement of our long-term debt is valued using a discounted cash flow model that
calculates the present value of future cash flows pursuant to the terms of the debt agreements and applies estimated
current market interest rates. The estimated current market interest rates are based primarily on interest rates currently
being offered on borrowings of similar amounts and terms. In addition, no valuation input adjustments were
considered necessary relating to nonperformance risk for the debt agreements.

NOTE 12: Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard’s core principle is
that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We
are evaluating our existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the
guidance will be affected by the new requirements. The standard is effective for us on October 1, 2018. The standard
allows for either “full retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or
“modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the
financial statements. We are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected.
In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on the presentation of debt issuance costs. The
update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by the update. For public entities, the guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This
update is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which allows for line-of-credit arrangements to be
handled consistently with the presentation of debt issuance costs update issued in April 2015. For public entities, the
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. This update is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on the presentation of deferred income tax
assets and liabilities. The update requires that deferred income tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in
the balance sheet. For public entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. This update is not expected to have a material impact on our
financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new guidance is
intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for
public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. We are assessing the potential impact that this update will have on our financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued its new lease accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with
the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a  lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to
make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and 2) a  right-of-use asset, which is an
asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new
lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet
financing. For public entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all public business entities upon issuance.
Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must
apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the
earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not
require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees
and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. This update is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new guidance is
intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-
based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award
transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. We are assessing the potential impact that this update
will have on our financial statements.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB, or other standards-setting bodies, that
do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon
adoption.

NOTE 13:  Subsequent Events
On July 19, 2016, the Company closed on a sale of certain non-core assets for an adjusted sale price of $3.9
million.   These properties consist of very small working, royalty and mineral interests spread over several states and
were not strategic to the Company. These properties are shown on the June 30,  2016, balance sheets as Held for
Sale and were remnants of a long-time partnership that was dissolved in November 2015.
ITEM 2  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS
Forward-Looking Statements for fiscal 2016 and later periods are made in this document. Such statements represent
estimates by management based on the Company’s historical operating trends, its proved oil, NGL and natural gas
reserves and other information currently available to management. The Company cautions that the Forward-Looking
Statements provided herein are subject to all the risks and uncertainties incident to the acquisition, development and
marketing of, and exploration for oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Investors should also read the other information in
this Form 10-Q and the Company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K where risk factors are presented and further
discussed. For all the above reasons, actual results may vary materially from the Forward-Looking Statements and
there is no assurance that the assumptions used are necessarily the most likely to occur.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company had positive working capital of $2,018,426 at June 30, 2016,  compared to $8,907,437 at September
30, 2015.
Liquidity:
Cash and cash equivalents were $506,541 as of June 30, 2016, compared to $603,915 at September 30, 2015,  a
decrease of $97,374. Cash flows for the nine months ended June 30 are summarized as follows:

Change
Operating activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $24,289,078 during the 2016 period, as compared to the 2015
period, the result of the following:
·Receipts of oil, NGL and natural gas sales (net of production taxes and gathering, transportation and marketing
costs) and other decreased $23,394,615.
·Decreased net receipts on derivative contracts of $3,148,147.
·Decreased payments for G&A and other expenses of $469,022.
·Decreased payments for field operating expenses of $1,714,863.
Investing activities:
Net cash used by investing activities decreased $27,028,600 during the 2016  period, as compared to the 2015
 period, due to:
·A decrease in cash used to acquire properties of $308,180.
·Lower payments for drilling and completion activity during 2016 decreased capital expenditures by
(12)
$20,253,831.
·Increased receipts from leasing of fee mineral acreage of $5,475,863.
·Increased proceeds from sales of assets of $627,547.
Financing activities:
Net cash used by financing activities increased $3,252,360 during the 2016 period, as compared to the 2015 period,
the result of the following:
·During the period ended June 30, 2016, net borrowings decreased $15,800,000; during the period ended June 30,
2015, net borrowings decreased $12,500,000.
Capital Resources:
Capital expenditures to drill and complete wells decreased $20,253,831 (86%) from the 2015 to the 2016
period. There continues to be no drilling activity on the Company’s acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale oil play in South
Texas and in the Arkansas Fayetteville Shale natural gas play. Well proposals which met our participation criteria in
the Company’s other plays continued to be extremely low through the first nine months of fiscal 2016. These
decreases in drilling activity have resulted in the 86% decline in capital expenditures. Although oil, NGL and natural
gas prices have, to a certain extent, rebounded during the fiscal 2016 third quarter, 2016 capital expenditures to drill
and complete wells are expected to be significantly less than in 2015.
Panhandle has recently received eight drilling proposals on Company owned mineral acres in the southeast
Oklahoma Woodford Shale play and has agreed to participate with an average 20% working interest; combined with
the royalty interest to be received on the portion of the minerals that were leased, the net revenue interests will
average 27.4%. The Company’s capital obligation to drill and complete these eight wells is approximately $7.4
million. Some of the wells are expected to spud in August 2016, with drilling continuing into fiscal 2017. Completion of
all eight wells is expected to be near the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures on these wells in
fiscal 2016 are expected to be funded from cash flows, while utilization of the Company’s credit facility is expected to
partially fund fiscal 2017 expenditures.
Oil, NGL and natural gas production volumes decreased 16% on an Mcfe basis during the 2016 period, as compared
to the 2015 period. As a result of low drilling activity, new production coming on line continued to fall considerably
short of replacing the natural decline of existing wells.
Oil production decreased 16% and was principally the result of the natural decline in production from the Eagle Ford
Shale in South Texas. To a lesser extent, declining production from several smaller fields in Oklahoma, Texas and
New Mexico also contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by production from five Eagle Ford
Shale and five North Dakota Bakken Shale wells that were placed on production during the second half of 2015 and
new production from the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma.
Natural gas production decreased 15%, largely the result of the natural decline in production from the Fayetteville
Shale in Arkansas, the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale and the Anadarko Basin Granite Wash. Production
declines in several fields in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico also contributed to the decrease. New production from
the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma partially offset the decrease.
NGL production decreased 23%, primarily the result of declining production in the Anadarko Basin Woodford Shale
and Granite Wash fields. Production declines in several fields in Oklahoma and Texas also contributed to the
decrease. Production from five Eagle Ford Shale wells and five North Dakota Bakken Shale wells (placed on
production during the second half of 2015) partially offset the decline.
Due to the natural production decline of existing wells and insignificant new production coming on line (the result of
minimal capital expenditures to drill and complete new wells during 2016), we expect oil, NGL and natural gas
production to experience a higher rate of decline during 2016 than was experienced in 2015.
Since the Company is not the operator of any of its oil and natural gas properties, it is extremely difficult for us to
predict levels of future participation in the drilling and completion of new wells and their associated capital
expenditures. This makes 2016 capital expenditures for drilling and completion projects difficult to forecast.
Even at the lower levels of expected production and product prices during 2016, the Company expects to generate
cash flows sufficient to fund 2016 capital expenditures, dividends and any overhead. The Company received lease
bonus payments during the first nine months of 2016 totaling approximately $7.5 million. The Company has also
received $3.9
(13)
million thus far during the 2016 fourth quarter from the sale of properties. These properties are shown on the balance
sheet as Assets Held for Sale (with a financial basis of approximately $1.5 million) and consist of very small working,
royalty and mineral interests spread over several states and were not strategic to the Company. Looking forward, the
cash flow benefit from bonus payments associated with the leasing of drilling rights on the Company’s mineral
acreage is very difficult to project as the Company’s mineral acreage position is so diverse and spread across several
states. Excess cash will be used to reduce debt.
With continued oil and natural gas price volatility, management continues to evaluate opportunities for product price
protection through additional hedging of the Company’s future oil and natural gas production. See NOTE 10 –
“Derivatives” for a complete list of the Company’s outstanding derivative contracts.
The use of the Company’s cash provided by operating activities and resultant change to cash is summarized in the
table below:

  (13,156,098)
   
$ (97,374)
Outstanding borrowings on the credit facility at June 30, 2016, were $49,200,000.
Looking forward, the Company expects to fund overhead costs, capital additions related to the drilling and completion
of wells, treasury stock purchases, if any, and dividend payments primarily from cash provided by operating activities
and cash on hand. As stated above, the Company does expect to utilize the credit facility in 2017 to partially fund the
drilling and completion of eight wells in the southeast Oklahoma Woodford Shale play. As management evaluates
opportunities for additional drilling or to acquire additional assets, borrowings utilizing our bank credit facility could be
necessary. Also, during times of oil, NGL and natural gas price decreases, or increased capital expenditures, it could
be necessary to utilize the credit facility further in order to fund these expenditures. The Company has availability
($30,800,000 at June 30, 2016) under its revolving credit facility and is in compliance with its debt covenants (current
ratio, debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined, and dividends as a percent of operating cash flow). Non-cash
expenses (such as impairment) are excluded from the EBITDA calculation. The debt covenants require a maximum
ratio of the Company’s debt to EBITDA of 4:1. As of June 30, 2016, the debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.81:1.
The borrowing base under the credit facility was redetermined in June 2016 and set at $80 million, which is a level
that is expected to provide ample liquidity for the Company to continue to employ its normal operating strategies.
Based on expected capital expenditure levels and anticipated cash provided by operating activities for 2016, the
Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its ongoing operations and, combined with availability under its credit facility,
to fund acquisitions, if any.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 – COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
Overview:
The Company recorded a third quarter 2016 net loss of $786,795, or $0.05 per share, as compared to net loss of
$728,946,  or $0.04 per share, in the 2015 quarter. The decrease in net income was principally the result of decreased
oil, NGL and natural gas sales, increased losses on derivative contracts; partially offset by increases in lease
bonuses and rentals, decreased LOE and increased benefit from income taxes. These items are further discussed
below.
(14)
Oil, NGL and Natural Gas Sales:
Oil, NGL and natural gas sales decreased $4,077,692 or 36% for the 2016 quarter. Oil, NGL and natural gas sales
were down due to decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas sales volumes of 19%,  3% and 12%, respectively,
and decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices of 24%,  10% and 26%, respectively. The following table outlines
the Company’s production and average sales prices for oil, NGL and natural gas for the three month periods of fiscal

The oil production decrease is principally the result of production decline from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas
and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. To a lesser extent, declining production from the Northern Oklahoma
Mississippian also contributed to the reduction. The decrease was partially offset by production from five Eagle Ford
Shale wells that were placed on production during the second half of 2015. The reduction in natural gas production
was largely the result of declining production from both the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and the Anadarko Basin
Granite Wash in Oklahoma. The decrease was partially offset by production from new wells in the Anadarko
Woodford Shale (SCOOP Play) and the STACK Play, both in Oklahoma. The NGL production decrease primarily
resulted from declining production in the Eagle Ford Shale and the Northern Oklahoma Mississippian. The reduction
was somewhat offset by production from five Eagle Ford Shale wells that were placed on production during the
second half of 2015.
The Company anticipates that oil, NGL and natural gas volumes will continue to decline in the fourth quarter of 2016
at rates similar to those experienced during the first three quarters of 2016, due to the current reduced level of capital
expenditures. The Company has recently agreed to participate in eight southeastern Oklahoma Woodford wells with
an average working interest of 20% and an average revenue interest of 27.4%. The operator of the proposed wells is
a major international energy company with ongoing successful operations in this field. The wells are projected to
commence drilling in mid-August 2016 and to begin producing late in calendar 2016 or early 2017. Assuming the
activity takes place as planned and wells perform as anticipated, the Company expects 2017 natural gas production
volumes and proved developed natural gas reserves to increase materially.
Production for the last five quarters was as follows:

Lease Bonuses and Rentals:
Lease bonuses and rentals increased $2,617,693 in the 2016 quarter. The increase was mainly due to the Company
leasing mineral acres in Blaine, Canadian, Custer, Dewey, Grady and McClain County, Oklahoma, in the 2016
quarter.
Gains (Losses) on Derivative Contracts:
The fair value of derivative contracts was a net liability of $1,690,516 as of June 30, 2016, and a net asset of
$5,402,106 as of June 30, 2015. We had a net loss on derivative contracts of $1,782,903 in the 2016 quarter as
compared to a net loss of $1,443,472 in the 2015 quarter. The change is principally due to the oil and natural gas
collars and fixed price swaps being less punitive in the 2015 quarter, as NYMEX oil and natural gas futures
experienced less of an increase in price in relation to the collars and the fixed prices of the swaps.
Lease Operating Expenses (LOE):
LOE decreased $551,438 or 14% in the 2016 quarter. LOE per Mcfe decreased in the 2016 quarter to $1.22
compared to $1.23 in the 2015 quarter. LOE related to field operating costs decreased $492,991 in the 2016 quarter
compared to the 2015 quarter, a 20% decrease. Field operating costs were $.69 per Mcfe in the 2016 quarter as
compared to $.75 per Mcfe in the 2015 quarter. The decrease in rate in the 2016 quarter is principally the result of
operating efficiencies gained in the Eagle Ford Shale field due to the addition of a salt water disposal system and
electrification of the field.
(15)
The decrease in LOE related to field operating costs was coupled with a decrease in handling fees (primarily
gathering, transportation and marketing costs) of $58,447 in the 2016 quarter compared to the 2015 quarter. On a per
Mcfe basis, these fees increased $.05 due mainly to prior period adjustments that were received in the 2016 period.
Natural gas sales bear the large majority of the handling fees while oil sales incur a much smaller amount. Handling
fees are charged either as a percent of sales or based on production volumes.
Production Taxes:
Production taxes decreased $165,815 or 46% in the 2016 quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter. The decrease in
amount is primarily the result of decreased oil, NGL and natural gas sales of $4,077,692 during the 2016 quarter.
Production taxes as a percentage of oil, NGL and natural gas sales were 2.7% for the 2016 quarter and 3.2% for the
2015 quarter.  The decrease in tax rate is mainly the result of production tax refunds being received in the 2016
quarter that were in excess of our previous estimates.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A):
DD&A increased $230,022 or 4% in the 2016 quarter. DD&A in the 2016 quarter was $2.06 per Mcfe as compared to
$1.73 per Mcfe in the 2015 quarter. DD&A increased $969,687 as a result of this $.33 increase in the DD&A rate per
Mcfe. An offsetting decrease of $739,665 was the result of production decreasing 13% in the 2016 quarter compared
to the 2015 quarter. The rate increase is mainly due to lower oil, NGL and natural gas prices utilized in the reserve
calculations during the 2016 quarter, as compared to 2015 quarter, shortening the economic life of wells thus resulting
in lower projected remaining reserves on a significant number of wells causing increased units of production DD&A.
Income Taxes:
Benefit for income taxes increased in the 2016 quarter by $1,176,000, the result of a $1,233,849 decrease in pre-tax
income in the 2016 quarter, compared to the 2015 quarter, and an increase in the effective tax rate from -47% in the
2015 quarter to 55% in the 2016 quarter. When a provision for income taxes is recorded, federal and Oklahoma
excess percentage depletion decreases the effective tax rate, while the effect is to increase the effective tax rate when
a benefit for income taxes is recorded, as was the case for the 2016 quarter. The higher estimated effective tax rate as
of the end of the 2015 third quarter of 32%, as compared to 29% estimated at the end of the 2015 second quarter,
resulted in a tax provision recorded during the 2015 third quarter. When a tax provision is recorded in a quarter with
net loss (as opposed to a net income) before provision for income taxes, the result is a negative effective tax rate for
the quarter, as was the case for the 2015 third quarter.
NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 – COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
Overview:
The Company recorded a nine month net loss of $11,024,074, or $0.65 per share, in the 2016 period, as compared to
net income of $10,209,022, or $0.61 per share, in the 2015 period. The change from net income to net loss was
principally the result of decreased oil, NGL and natural gas sales, decreased gains on derivative contracts and
increases in provision for impairment and DD&A; partially offset by decreased income taxes, increases in lease
bonuses and rentals, and decreased production taxes and LOE. These items are further discussed below.
Oil, NGL and Natural Gas Sales:
Oil, NGL and natural gas sales decreased $20,843,467 or 48% for the 2016 period. Oil, NGL and natural gas sales
were down due to a decrease in oil, NGL and natural gas sales volumes of 16%,  23% and 15%, respectively, and
decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices of 37%, 39% and 39%, respectively. The following table outlines the
Company’s production and average sales prices for oil, NGL and natural gas for the nine month periods of fiscal 2016
and 2015:

The oil production decrease is principally the result of the natural production decline from the Eagle Ford Shale in
South Texas. To a lesser extent, declining production from several smaller fields in Oklahoma, Texas and New
Mexico also contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by production from five Eagle Ford Shale
wells plus five North Dakota Bakken Shale wells that were placed on production during the second half of 2015 and
new production from the
(16)
SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma. The decrease in natural gas production was largely the result of declining
production from the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale and the Anadarko
Basin Granite Wash. To a lesser extent, production decline in several fields in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico
also contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by new production from the SCOOP and STACK
plays in Oklahoma. The NGL production decrease primarily resulted from declining production in the Anadarko Basin
Woodford Shale and Granite Wash fields. To a lesser extent, several fields in Oklahoma and Texas also contributed
to the decline. The decrease was partially offset by production from five Eagle Ford Shale wells plus five North
Dakota Bakken Shale wells that were placed on production during the second half of 2015.
The Company anticipates that oil, NGL and natural gas volumes will continue to decline in the fourth quarter of 2016
at rates similar to those experienced during the first three quarters of 2016, due to the current reduced level of capital
expenditures. The Company has recently agreed to participate in eight southeastern Oklahoma Woodford wells with
an average working interest of 20% and an average revenue interest of 27.4%. The operator of the proposed wells is
a major international energy company with ongoing successful operations in this field. The wells are projected to
commence drilling in mid-August 2016 and to begin producing late in calendar 2016 or early 2017. Assuming the
activity takes place as planned and wells perform as anticipated, the Company expects 2017 natural gas production
volumes and proved developed natural gas reserves to increase materially.
Lease Bonuses and Rentals:
Lease bonuses and rentals increased $5,242,409 in the 2016 period. The increase was mainly due to the Company
leasing 4,057 net mineral acres in Cochran County, Texas, 663 net mineral acres in Blaine, Canadian, Custer and
Dewey County, Oklahoma, and 706 net mineral acres in Grady and McClain County, Oklahoma, in the 2016 period.
Gains (Losses) on Derivative Contracts:
The fair value of derivative contracts was a net liability of $1,690,516 as of June 30, 2016, and a net asset of
$5,402,106 as of June 30, 2015. We had a net loss on derivative contracts of $842,726 in the 2016 period as
compared to a net gain of $11,706,955 recorded in the 2015 period. The change is principally due to the oil and
natural gas collars and fixed price swaps being more beneficial in the 2015 period, as NYMEX oil and natural gas
futures were below the floor of the collars and the fixed prices of the swaps.
Lease Operating Expenses (LOE):
LOE decreased $2,959,895 or 22% in the 2016 period. LOE per Mcfe decreased in the 2016 period to $1.17
compared to $1.26 in the 2015 period. LOE related to field operating costs decreased $2,155,878 in the 2016 period
compared to the 2015 period, a 26% decrease. Field operating costs were $.70 per Mcfe in the 2016 period as
compared to $.79 per Mcfe in the 2015 period. The decrease in rate in the 2016 period is principally the result of
operating efficiencies gained in the Eagle Ford Shale field due to the addition of a salt water disposal system and
electrification of the field, as well as fewer workovers.
The decrease in LOE related to field operating costs was coupled with a decrease in handling fees (primarily
gathering, transportation and marketing costs) of $804,017 in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period. The
decrease in the amount in the 2016 period is the result of decreased oil and gas production and sales. On a per Mcfe
basis, these handling fees were $.47 for both periods. Natural gas sales bear the large majority of the handling fees
while oil sales incur a much smaller amount. Handling fees are charged either as a percent of sales or based on
production volumes.
Production Taxes:
Production taxes decreased $636,503 or 46% in the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period. The decrease in
amount is primarily the result of decreased oil, NGL and natural gas sales of $20,843,467 during the 2016 period.
Production taxes as a percentage of oil, NGL and natural gas sales were 3.3% for the 2016 period and 3.2% for the
2015 period. The increase in tax rate is the result of the expiration of production tax discounts on a number of the
Company’s horizontally drilled wells in Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as the increased proportionate sales coming
from Texas and North Dakota where initial tax rates are higher.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A):
DD&A increased $1,282,948 or 7% in the 2016 period. DD&A in the 2016 period was $2.15 per Mcfe as compared to
$1.68 per Mcfe in the 2015 period. DD&A increased $4,128,145 as a result of this $.47 increase in the DD&A rate per
Mcfe. An offsetting decrease of $2,845,197 was the result of production decreasing 16% in the 2016 period compared
to the 2015 period. The rate increase is mainly due to lower oil, NGL and natural gas prices utilized in the reserve
calculations during the 2016 period, as compared to 2015 period, shortening the economic life of wells thus resulting
in lower projected remaining reserves on a significant number of wells causing increased units of production DD&A.

Provision for Impairment:
The provision for impairment increased $8,316,304 in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period. During the 2016
period, impairment of $11,849,064 was recorded on thirty-nine fields. Four oil and liquids rich fields accounted for
approximately $9.5 million (Anadarko Basin Granite Wash - $5.9 million, Cheyenne West - $1.7 million, Ellis County
Marmaton - $1.0 million and Permian Basin - $.9 million) of the impairment mainly due to continued declining oil, NGL
and natural gas prices. During the 2015 period, impairment of $3,532,760 was recorded on twenty fields. One oil field
in Hemphill County, Texas, accounted for $1,846,488 of the impairment due mainly to declining oil prices.
Income Taxes:
Provision for income taxes decreased in the 2016 period by $12,684,000, the result of a $33,917,096 decrease in pre-
tax income in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period. The effective tax rate for the 2016 and 2015 periods was
42% and 32%, respectively. When a provision for income taxes is recorded, federal and Oklahoma excess
percentage depletion decreases the effective tax rate, while the effect is to increase the effective tax rate when a
benefit for income taxes is recorded, as was the case for the 2016 period.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Critical accounting policies are those the Company believes are most important to portraying its financial conditions
and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management.
Judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts
being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to the
critical accounting policies previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2015.
ITEM 3  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk
Oil, NGL and natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty
continues to exist as to the direction of oil, NGL and natural gas price trends, and there remains a rather wide
divergence in the opinions held in the industry. The Company can be significantly impacted by changes in oil and
natural gas prices. The market price of oil, NGL and natural gas in 2016 will impact the amount of cash generated
from operating activities, which will in turn impact the level of the Company’s capital expenditures and production.
Excluding the impact of the Company’s 2016 derivative contracts, the price sensitivity in 2016 for each $0.10 per Mcf
change in wellhead natural gas price is $974,522 for operating revenue based on the Company’s prior year natural
gas volumes.  The price sensitivity in 2016 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead oil price is $453,125 for
operating revenue based on the Company’s prior year oil volumes.
Commodity Price Risk
The Company periodically utilizes derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to unfavorable changes in natural gas
and oil prices. The Company does not enter into these derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. All of our
outstanding derivative contracts are with Bank of Oklahoma and are secured. These arrangements cover only a
portion of the Company’s production and provide only partial price protection against declines in natural gas and oil
prices. These derivative contracts expose the Company to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of future increases
in prices. For the Company’s natural gas fixed price swaps, a change of $.10 in the NYMEX Henry Hub forward strip
pricing would result in a change to pre-tax operating income of approximately $81,000. For the Company’s natural
gas collars, a change of $.10 in the NYMEX Henry Hub forward strip pricing would result in a change to pre-tax
operating income of approximately $192,000. For the Company’s oil collars, a change of $1.00 in the NYMEX WTI
forward strip prices would result in a change to pre-tax operating income of approximately $106,000.
Financial Market Risk
Operating income could also be impacted, to a lesser extent, by changes in the market interest rates related to the
Company’s credit facilities. The revolving loan bears interest at the BOK prime rate plus from 0.375% to 1.125%, or 30
day LIBOR plus from 1.875% to 2.625%. At June 30, 2016, the Company had $49,200,000 outstanding under this
facility and the effective interest rate was 2.77%.  At this point, the Company does not believe that its liquidity has
been materially affected by the interest rate uncertainties noted in the last few years and the Company does not
believe that its liquidity will be significantly impacted in the near future.
ITEM 4  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(18)
The Company maintains “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the
Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is collected and communicated to management,
including the Company’s President/Chief Executive Officer and Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating its disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that no matter how well conceived and operated, disclosure controls and
procedures can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and
procedures are met. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and
management believes they do meet, reasonable assurance standards. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the
fiscal period covered by this report, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, subject to
the limitations noted above, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure material
information relating to the Company is made known to them. There were no changes in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting made during the fiscal quarter or subsequent to the date the
assessment was completed.
