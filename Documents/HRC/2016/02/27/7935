<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In spite of some positive developments, many nationality laws still discriminate 
against women. The present report examines how women in certain countries do not enjoy 
equal rights with men to acquire, change and retain their nationality and are also not 
allowed to transfer nationality to their children or spouses on the same basis, which very 
often results in statelessness. It analyses the negative impact of discriminatory nationality 
laws on the enjoyment of women&#8217;s rights and the rights of their children and spouses, and 
also includes best practices and other measures to eliminate discrimination against women 
in nationality laws.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 20/4, the Human Rights Council invited the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare, in consultation with 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Working 
Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice, States and other 
relevant stakeholders, a report on discrimination against women in nationality-related 
matters. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request. The Council requested that 
the report include an analysis of the impact on children and best practices by States and 
other measures that eliminate nationality discrimination against women and avoid or reduce 
statelessness.  
</p>
<p>2. The comments and advice of UNHCR and the Working Group on discrimination 
against women in law and in practice and the contributions of States, international and non-
governmental organizations are gratefully acknowledged.1  
</p>
<p>3. The right to a nationality is a fundamental human right that also has an impact on the 
enjoyment of other human rights. In an increasingly globalized world, persons without a 
nationality find themselves in an extremely vulnerable situation. Despite the fact that the 
right to a nationality is guaranteed under various human rights treaties, discrimination in 
nationality-related matters persists in many countries. Although each State has the power to 
determine who its nationals are according to its law, the boundaries of this discretion are 
found in international human rights guarantees, which are legally binding upon States. 
</p>
<p>4. An individual nationality may be determined by descent from a national or by being 
born within the State&#8217;s territory. Most States have combined these two principles in their 
</p>
<p>laws on nationality. Historically, these two principles have favoured the nationality of the 
father: the father&#8217;s descent line was prioritized and a woman was traditionally more likely 
to move to her husband&#8217;s State. Nationality may also be acquired by naturalization and 
through marriage.  
</p>
<p>5. It was widely accepted at the beginning of the twentieth century that nationality was 
governed by the principle of &#8220;dependent nationality&#8221; or &#8220;unity of nationality of family&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>This principle is based on the idea that a family should have the same nationality owing to 
concerns of divided loyalty and on the patriarchal notion that the nationality of the entire 
family should follow that of the husband.2 This principle is still reflected in discriminatory 
nationality laws in force in different regions of the world.  
</p>
<p>6. International law on women&#8217;s nationality rights began to develop in the 1930s 
within the framework of the League of Nations. Initially, the approach to women&#8217;s 
nationality regarded the problem as one of statelessness and dual nationality caused by 
conflicts among the nationality laws of different States rather than on the basis of gender 
equality. Progressively, the focus shifted to women&#8217;s right to equality, and various regional 
and international human rights instruments were adopted. The adoption of the Convention 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 1979 was a turning point, as it was

Discrimination against Women: a Commentary</i>, Oxford Commentaries on International Law, 2012, p. 
234. </p>


<p>the first international treaty to recognize the principle of women&#8217;s equal rights with men 
with respect to the nationality of their children. Since then, many States have repealed 
nationality laws that discriminate against women. Many discriminatory laws, however, 
remain. 
</p>
<p>7. Nationality laws fully respectful of the principle of gender equality are not only a 
human rights requirement but are also crucial to women&#8217;s empowerment. Enjoying the right 
to nationality and the right to pass their nationality to their husband and children increases a 
woman&#8217;s opportunities to participate in public and political life, work, travel and have 
access to resources and property. The economic and social independence that flows from 
such rights also enhances a woman&#8217;s ability to escape an abusive and violent relationship. 
In addition, discriminatory nationality laws are one of the main causes of statelessness, 
which is thought to affect as many as 12 million women, men and children across the 
globe.3 Non-discriminatory nationality laws are therefore important for preventing and 
reducing statelessness. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. The right to a nationality and the principles of equality and non-discrimination are 
recognized in various human rights instruments, starting with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights in its article 15.4  
</p>
<p>9. The main international human rights treaties include a provision prohibiting 
discrimination based on, inter alia, sex. The International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also share 
an article guaranteeing equality between men and women in the enjoyment of the rights 
contained in those instruments.  
</p>
<p>10. The Convention on the Nationality of Married Women is the first international 
instrument to call upon States to eliminate the principle of dependent nationality; it does 
not, however, include any provision on the nationality of the children. Its article 1 provides 
that &#8220;each contracting State agrees that neither the celebration nor the dissolution of a 
marriage between one of its nationals and an alien, nor the change of nationality by the 
husband during marriage, shall automatically affect the nationality of the wife&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>11. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
provides in its article 9.1 that States &#8220;shall grant women equal rights with men to acquire, 
</p>
<p>change or retain their nationality. They shall ensure in particular that neither marriage to an 
alien nor change of nationality by the husband during marriage shall automatically change 
the nationality of the wife, render her stateless or force upon her the nationality of the 
husband.&#8221; Article 9.2 requires States to &#8220;grant women equal rights with men with respect to 
the nationality of their children&#8221;. This applies to both biological and adoptive relationships, 
as well as to children born in and out of wedlock. Articles 2 (policy measures to eliminate 
discrimination), 3 (equality with men), 5 (sex role stereotyping and prejudice), 15 (equality 
before the law) and 16 (marriage and family life) respectively are also relevant to article 9, 
and mutually reinforcing. A significant number of States have made reservations to article 9 
of the Convention and to other articles that may potentially affect the nationality rights of

</p>
<p>www.unhcr.org/4fc5ceca9.html), p. 14. 
 4 See also A/HRC/13/34. </p>


<p>women.5 There are also States that retain discriminatory nationality laws even if they have 
not entered any reservation to the Convention. 
</p>
<p>12. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides in its article 24.3 
that &#8220;every child has the right to acquire a nationality&#8221;. Article 26 sets out the principle of 
equality before the law.  
</p>
<p>13. Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that children &#8220;shall 
be registered immediately after birth and shall have (&#8230;) the right to acquire a nationality&#8221; 
from birth. It also mandates States to ensure the implementation of these rights in 
accordance with their national law and international obligations, &#8220;in particular where the 
</p>
<p>child would otherwise be stateless&#8221;. According to its article 8, States are also obliged &#8220;to 
respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality (&#8230;) as 
</p>
<p>recognized by law without unlawful interference.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>14. Article 29 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families specifies that children of a &#8220;migrant 
worker shall have the right to a name, to registration of birth and to a nationality.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>15. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides in its article 18 
that States should recognize the right of persons with disabilities, including children, &#8220;to a 
nationality, on an equal basis with others, including by ensuring that&#8230;[ they] are not 
</p>
<p>deprived (&#8230;) of their ability to obtain, possess and utilize documentation of their 
nationality&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. Article 5 (d)iii of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination also addresses State obligations to eliminate racial discrimination in 
nationality-related matters.  
</p>
<p>17. Regional human rights treaties also recognize the right to a nationality: the Inter-
American Convention on the Nationality of Women, the American Convention on Human 
Rights, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the European 
Convention on Nationality and the Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Other regional instruments also have provisions 
on equality with regard to nationality-related matters, even though they qualify this with 
deference to domestic laws, which effectively nullifies women&#8217;s equality in countries with 
</p>
<p>discriminatory laws.6  
</p>
<p>18. This human rights framework is complemented by two conventions specifically 
dealing with the issue of statelessness. According to articles 1 and 4 of the Convention on 
the Reduction of Statelessness, a contracting State &#8220;shall grant its nationality to a person 
born in its territory&#8221; or born to one of its nationals abroad in a non-State party &#8220;who would 
otherwise be stateless&#8221;.7 Its article 5 provides that &#8220;if the law of a contracting State entails 
loss of nationality as a consequence of any change in the personal status of a person such as 
marriage, termination of marriage (&#8230;,) such loss shall be conditional upon possession or 
acquisition of another nationality&#8221;. Article 32 of the Convention relating to the Status of 
Stateless Persons provides that the States &#8220;shall as far as possible facilitate the assimilation 
</p>
<p>  
 5 As at 5 February 2013, 17 of 187 States maintained their reservation to article 9 of the Convention:

8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en#2.

<p> 6 On the nationality of children, see the Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa, art. 6 (h), and the 
Arab Charter on Human Rights, art. 29.2.

<p> 7 See the UNHCR Guidelines on Statelessness No.4 (HCR/GS/12/04) (available from 
www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/50d460c72.html), para. 2. </p>


<p>and naturalization of stateless persons.&#8221; These conventions complement article 9 of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Read 
together, this international legal framework imposes an obligation on States to reform their 
nationality laws to ensure that they do not discriminate against women or their children and 
that they do not create or perpetuate situations of statelessness.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Discrimination in the acquisition, change and retention of 
nationality  
</b></p>
<p>19. In many countries, nationality laws still do not grant women equal rights with men 
to acquire, change and retain their nationality; some laws contain discriminatory provisions 
that do not allow women to transfer nationality to their spouses on the same basis as men. 
These discriminatory laws are based on the principle of &#8220;dependent nationality&#8221;, which 
provides that a married woman&#8217;s nationality is dependent on that of her husband.  
</p>
<p>20. Where both the countries of the husband and the wife follow the principle of 
dependent nationality, the woman automatically acquires the nationality of her husband but 
loses her own. Where only the country of the wife follows the principle of dependent 
nationality, she will lose her nationality when marrying a foreigner, even if she does not 
automatically acquire the nationality of her husband. Women in those cases will become 
stateless, even if they remain in their country of origin. Where the husband&#8217;s country 
follows the principle of dependent nationality, the husband&#8217;s nationality will be imposed on 
the wife, regardless of whether she would like to acquire such a nationality. 
</p>
<p>21. In all of the above cases, if the nationality of the husband changes or is lost during 
the marriage, the wife&#8217;s nationality also changes. Similarly, in the event of termination of 
the marriage by death or divorce, the married woman may lose her entitlement to her 
husband&#8217;s nationality. Sometimes, couples divorce before the wife has gained her 
husband&#8217;s nationality. Women in these circumstances will be able to revert to their 
nationality of origin only if the laws of that State permit her to do so. Women are often not 
able to regain easily their nationality in a timely manner because of cumbersome 
procedures and, as a result, may become stateless.8  
</p>
<p>22. Women are also subjected to discrimination through laws that do not allow women 
to pass their nationality to their husbands or that impose on husbands stringent requirements 
before they are able to acquire the nationality of their wives; conversely, no such 
requirements or prohibitions are imposed on foreign wives married to male nationals.9 Such 
discriminatory laws are based on the State&#8217;s concern that men as the &#8220;head of the family&#8221; 
and by virtue of being a male are more likely to take advantage of economic 
opportunities.10 These laws discriminate against women and men of different nationalities 
who marry: for instance, foreign husbands may not be permitted to obtain a work permit, 
which may then force women to accept precarious and exploitative conditions of work that

<p>have a negative impact on their human rights. These laws also perpetuate statelessness 
where they prevent a stateless husband from acquiring his wife&#8217;s nationality. 
</p>
<p>23. Indirect discrimination in the implementation of nationality laws also threatens 
women&#8217;s right to equality. Very often, identical naturalization procedures for women and 
men may actually discriminate against women in practice.11 Where non-national women 
have lesser opportunities to learn the local language and culture (for instance because of 
domestic responsibilities limiting their interaction with the community), standard tests for 
the acquisition of nationality may put them at a disadvantage. Naturalization criteria 
requiring economic self-sufficiency or adequate housing may also be more difficult for 
women to meet, especially if they are female-headed households with little income or are 
financially dependent on their spouses.  
</p>
<p>24. When women are unable to document their nationality, they can be at risk of 
statelessness; for instance, women may lack access to the documentation necessary to prove 
or claim their nationality, such as passports, identity cards or birth or marriage certificates. 
Their birth may not have been registered owing to laws and practices discriminating against 
and excluding girls, in particular girls from poor families, minority and foreigner 
communities or with disabilities.12 Their marriage may not have been registered either 
owing to the lack of the husband&#8217;s consent, lack of awareness or any other reason. In 
certain circumstances, such as in cases of trafficking or situations of violence and abuse, 
women&#8217;s documentation may have been deliberately appropriated or destroyed as a means 
of control. In some countries, discriminatory practices, such as requirements of third-party 
male authorization to obtain nationality documents, further affect women&#8217;s enjoyment of 
their right to nationality.13 
</p>
<p>25. Women living in poverty, women with disabilities, older women, migrant women or 
women belonging to racial or ethnic minorities, facing sometimes multiple forms of 
discrimination, bear additional administrative, financial and other burdens when claiming 
their right to nationality. 
</p>
<p>26. Restrictions on retention of dual nationality also have the potential to discriminate 
against women in practice. Where dual nationality is not allowed, women can be 
disproportionately affected, as they tend to reside in their husband&#8217;s country. If dual 
nationality is forbidden, they will have to decide between retaining their nationality or 
acquiring that of their husband&#8217;s. If they do not take on the nationality of their husband, 
they will not be able to enjoy fully their political, civil, economic and social rights in their 
husband&#8217;s country. They will be especially vulnerable to abuse because of the inherent 
powerlessness of their position. If they lose their nationality of origin upon acquiring the 
nationality of their spouses, they risk statelessness in the event that the marriage ends by 
death or divorce, and may be cut off from the enjoyment of a range of human rights in their 
country of origin. They may also become stateless by &#8220;administrative delay&#8221; pending the 
granting of new nationality.14

<p>27. Under international human rights law, States are required to take all measures 
necessary to remove laws and procedures and to abolish practices that directly or indirectly 
discriminate against women.15 States must also take proactive measures to achieve 
substantive equality between men and women in nationality-related matters. Ensuring 
access to legal assistance and literacy, language courses, subsidies for fees related to 
residence permits, and facilitating dual nationality are important measures for addressing de 
facto discrimination against women in this area. 
</p>
<p>28. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has repeatedly 
reminded States that they are required to amend discriminatory nationality provisions that 
violate article 9.1 of the Convention.16 The Committee further clarified in its general 
recommendation No. 21 (para. 6) that &#8220;nationality should be capable of change by an adult 
woman and should not be arbitrarily removed because of marriage or dissolution of 
marriage or because her husband or father changes his nationality&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>29. The Committee has also clearly stated that laws that do not allow women to transmit 
nationality to their foreign spouses on the same basis as men are discriminatory and in 
violation of the Convention.17 This opinion is also consistent with the jurisprudence of other 
human rights mechanisms.18 
</p>
<p>30. The Committee has also reminded States that they must address those cases where 
foreign wives waiting for the acquisition of their husband&#8217;s nationality are put in a 
vulnerable situation and at risk of violence, exploitation and abuse.19  
</p>
<p>31. With regard to passport entitlement, the Committee has explained that domestic laws 
that require a woman to obtain her husband&#8217;s consent to include the name of children in her 
passport or to have a passport violate article 9.20 Concerning birth registration, it also 
recalled the obligation of States to facilitate birth registration for girls and women, in 
particular to indigenous and rural women, so they may claim nationality.21 The Committee 
has also welcomed amendments by States to their nationality laws in order to allow dual 
nationality.22  
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
practice is actively involved in promoting women&#8217;s equal right to nationality as part of its 
</p>
<p>work on discrimination against women, including in relation to political and public life.23

<p>universal periodic review, and the Human Rights Committee have also reminded States of 
their obligations to ensure equal rights for men and women in the acquisition, change and 
retention of nationality.24 
</p>
<p>33. UNHCR and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), in accordance with the 
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, have recommended that where women have 
lost their citizenship through dissolution of marriage, their former State should introduce 
provisions to allow these women to automatically reacquire that nationality through a 
simple declaration.25  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Discrimination relating to the nationality of children  
</b></p>
<p>34. Despite the progress witnessed in many countries since the adoption of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, laws in 
around 30 countries still do not grant women equal rights with men with regard to the 
nationality of their children.26 These countries attribute nationality to children solely on the 
basis of the father&#8217;s nationality; this constitutes discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>35. Often women discover that they cannot transmit their nationality to their children 
only when they have their first child or when their husband leaves the family or dies, 
sometimes leaving them stateless.27 As a direct result of such discriminatory laws, women 
become disempowered, as their rights and opportunities are restricted. In such situations, 
for example, women are more reluctant to return to their country of origin for a job 
opportunity or a position in public services because their children will have no opportunity 
to attend school or have access to health services, given that they lack the nationality of 
their mothers.  
</p>
<p>36. Children living under laws that do not allow women to pass on nationality to their 
children risk becoming stateless, for instance when the father is stateless, unknown or not 
married to the mother at the time of birth; the father has been unable to take the 
administrative steps necessary to confer his nationality or acquire proof of nationality for 
his children owing to death, forcible separation from his family or inability to fulfil onerous 
documentation or other requirements; the father is unwilling to fulfil administrative steps to 
confer his nationality or acquire proof of nationality for his children (for example, if he has 
abandoned the family); or the laws of the father&#8217;s country do not permit him to confer 
nationality in certain circumstances, such as when the child is born abroad.28 In addition, 
some contemporary families formed by single women or lesbian couples may find that their 
children are rendered stateless, because women are prevented from conferring their 
nationality. 
</p>
<p>37. Discriminatory laws in some countries allow no, or very limited, exceptions to their 
rules preventing mothers from conferring their nationality to their children. Other countries

<p>have included some safeguards in their discriminatory nationality laws to prevent the 
creation of statelessness. For instance, some make exceptions to allow mothers to pass their 
nationality on to children born within their territories or, more exceptionally, abroad, if the 
father is stateless, of unknown nationality or unknown. In some countries, children born to 
national women and foreign fathers may apply to acquire citizenship if they reside in the 
country; this provision is, however, reportedly not often implemented in practice owing to 
the overly bureaucratic requirements.29 In other countries, even if the law is apparently 
gender-neutral, often, in practice, the children of national women and foreign men are not 
regarded as nationals.30  
</p>
<p>38. Women are also discriminated against in nationality-related matters, when different 
rules apply to children born in or outside of wedlock. In some countries, the nationality of 
children born out of wedlock or to a foreign mother living abroad is determined by that of 
the mother, to the exclusion of the father. Women in those circumstances may face many 
challenges in claiming support for their children. Since the children do not have the 
nationality of the father, the father&#8217;s State of origin might be reluctant to accept the 
mother&#8217;s claim for support.31  
</p>
<p>39. Women with disabilities, women belonging to ethnic or racial minorities, migrant 
women and imprisoned foreign women, among others, may face additional difficulties in 
transferring their nationality to their children, an issue that States also must address.32  
</p>
<p>40. Various human rights mechanisms, such as the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Human 
Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Human 
Rights Council, including through the latter&#8217;s universal periodic review, regularly remind 
States of their obligation to ensure equal rights to men and women with regard to the 
nationality of their children, and urge them to amend discriminatory laws.33 The Working 
Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice is also actively involved in 
promoting women&#8217;s equal right to transfer nationality to their children as part of its work on 
discrimination against women in political and public life.34 
</p>
<p>41. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has noted that 
failure to amend discriminatory laws in this area cannot be justified by arguments based on 
diversity in culture or religion.35 It has also explained that the prohibition of dual nationality 
cannot result in the nationality of children being determined by the father&#8217;s nationality 
alone.36 The consequences for children of not having a nationality on their enjoyment of

<p>human rights, such as the rights to education and to health care, have also been raised.37 
With regard to the entitlement to a passport, the Committee has raised concerns about the 
requirement for the father as legal guardian to consent to the inclusion of children in the 
married women&#8217;s passport.38 The Committee has also recommended that States raise 
awareness about the equality of spouses or guardians in their right to apply and collect 
passports or birth certificates on behalf of their children without the need for the spouses&#8217; 
written consent.39 
</p>
<p>42. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has reminded States about their obligation 
to register births and its relevance to the acquisition of nationality.40 It is also crucial that 
States ensure prompt, equal and independent access to marriage registration. The 
registration of births and marriages is crucial for the formal recognition by the State of the 
new child in the family and the newly formed family bond.41 The ability of women to have 
independent, equal access to these documents is critical, especially if the father or husband 
dies or leaves the family, given that birth and marriage registration certificates are used to 
prove the child&#8217;s filiation. The non-registration of births and marriages is one of the main 
sources of statelessness. The Committee has also called on States to amend their nationality 
laws to ensure that no discrimination exists against children born out of wedlock.42  
</p>
<p><b> V.  Impact on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>43. As discussed above, gender-discriminatory nationality laws often lead to the 
statelessness of women and children or situations where women, their children or husbands 
are deprived of the nationality of the country where they reside. Such laws result also in 
situations where children are denied the nationality of their mothers, causing direct 
prejudice to the enjoyment of their rights and in the achievement of women&#8217;s human rights. 
In its general recommendation 21 on equality in marriage and family relations, the 
Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women stated that 
nationality was critical to full participation in society, adding that, without status as 
nationals or citizens, women were deprived of the right to vote or to stand for public office 
and may be denied access to public benefits and a choice of residence.  
</p>
<p>44. According to the main international human rights instruments, everyone is entitled 
to the enjoyment of rights and freedoms recognized in them without distinction of any kind, 
including national origin. Exceptions to this rule generally relate to the right to participate 
in political and public life and freedom of movement. Also regarding economic rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its article 2.3, includes 
the possibility for developing countries, &#8220;with due regard to human rights and their national 
economy&#8221;, to &#8220;determine to what extent they would guarantee the economic rights 
recognized in the present Covenant to non-nationals&#8221;. Many States, however, go far beyond 
these limited exceptions and do not always guarantee basic human rights to non-nationals.

<p>45. Lack of nationality has serious negative implications for the enjoyment of political, 
civil, economic, social and cultural rights of women and their children and husbands.43 
Current State practice reflects the predominant view that the exercise of political rights, 
such as the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, the right to vote and to be 
elected and the right to have access to public service, is an entitlement of citizens alone. 
Women and their children, who later will become adults without nationality, are 
subsequently excluded from political and public life in the country where they reside. 
</p>
<p>46. Non-nationals also see their freedom of movement restricted. They may face severe 
limitations on their ability to travel, to choose a place of residence, and to leave or enter the 
country, given that they have no passport. They might also see their access to medical care, 
education and employment barred.  
</p>
<p>47. Non-nationals may also be confronted with violations of their right to liberty, a fair 
trial and an effective remedy. Fearful of detention or deportation, women, their children or 
husbands may be reluctant to claim their rights. In addition, they do not benefit often from 
services available to nationals, such as free legal aid or interpreters. Sometimes, such as in 
cases of trafficking, women&#8217;s documents are taken away from them, preventing them from 
establishing their identity.  
</p>
<p>48. The right of non-nationals to family life is also curtailed, given that members of the 
family who do not possess the same nationality as that of others are sometimes not allowed 
to freely enter, exit, move, work or study in that country. A mother whose child has a 
nationality different from her own and who has no permit of residence in the State where 
the child resides may face legal obstacles when claiming custody of or access to the child, 
in particular if the marriage has been terminated by divorce or death. If the mother has 
custody of the child, the father may seek possession of the child with the support of his 
State, which is also the State of nationality of the child; in such a case, the State of the 
mother will not be able to exercise its diplomatic protection to recover the child, and its 
capacity to protect the mother&#8217;s interests will be limited. Women are often not allowed to 
take their children out of the country when they do not have the same nationality.  
</p>
<p>49. Women and their husbands and children who are non-nationals also face difficulties 
in their access to work. Some countries restrict the access of non-nationals to certain 
professions or fix quotas for them. Non-nationals are also exposed to poor, dirty or even 
dangerous working conditions; sexual, physical, psychological and verbal abuse and 
violence; racial discrimination and other discriminatory attitudes; intimidating workplace 
environments; low salaries and long working hours; and absence of holidays.44 Limited 
access to social security and other benefits available to nationals often lead to instability for 
and the marginalization of non-nationals.  
</p>
<p>50. Non-nationals also face challenges in their access to health services owing to various 
causes, ranging from formal exclusion from some or all public health-care services through 
to the practical inability to benefit from such services because of the fees charged to non-
nationals or their lack of a regular immigration status or of any basic identity 
documentation.45 This lack of access to health services disproportionately<b> </b>affects women 
who may be unable to receive proper sexual and reproductive health care, including 
maternal and neonatal care. The lack of nationality and statelessness may also have 
psychosocial effects, such as anger, resentment, frustration and depression. 
</p>

 45 A/HRC/19/43, para. 32.  </p>


<p>51. Women and their husbands and children who are non-nationals also face obstacles in 
their access to adequate housing because of the restrictions imposed by States on the 
enjoyment of property rights by non-nationals, the absence of freedom of movement, 
discriminatory practices of housing agencies or lack of access to social housing.  
</p>
<p>52. Not all States ensure the right to education to non-national children as required by 
human rights law. Such children, who may lack the required documentation, are often 
excluded from public schools or have to pay fees to attend school. They may also be 
specifically excluded from certain levels of education, such as higher education, vocational 
training or university.  
</p>
<p>53. Non-national women and children are also exposed to a higher risk of violence, 
including domestic violence and trafficking.46 While waiting to acquire the nationality of 
their husbands or a residence permit, women may suffer from violence and abuse 
perpetrated by their husbands. In other circumstances, women may be reluctant to leave 
their husbands for fear of losing their children who have a different nationality. When 
women lack nationality, they face greater challenges to leave these abusive relationships 
and to seek help from authorities. In some countries, it has also been reported that non-
national parents seek to marry off their daughters at a young age to nationals in order to 
gain security.47  
</p>
<p>54. In situations of conflict, disaster, displacement or emergency, non-nationals, in 
particular those who are stateless, may face difficulties in obtaining food, shelter and other 
assistance required, as well as in tracing their families. Children thus very often remain in 
orphanages or foster care. 
</p>
<p>55. The rights of persons with disabilities and the minority rights of non-nationals are 
also often disrespected; for instance, minority non-nationals may face additional challenges 
to the realization of their right to enjoy their own culture.  
</p>
<p>56. Intimidation and threats to activists involved in nationality-related campaign have 
also been reported. States have an obligation to create an enabling environment for the 
realization of human rights, which includes the protection of the rights of human rights 
defenders involved in such campaigns.  
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>57. In recent years, many countries have repealed or amended discriminatory nationality 
provisions in laws and Constitutions. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child have welcomed various 
instances of such reform or initiation of reform, such as the ones reported in Algeria, 
Bangladesh, Belarus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Fiji, Gabon, the 
Gambia, India, Japan, Kenya, Malawi, Maldives, Malta, Pakistan, Saint Lucia, Samoa, 
Singapore, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Thailand, Uganda and Zambia.48 Law reform to allow 
women to transfer nationality to their children, and in some exceptional cases to their

<p>foreign husbands, has been at least partially made in Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh, 
Botswana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya, Monaco, Morocco, Rwanda, San Marino, 
Sierra Leone, Tunisia, Turkey and Zimbabwe.49  
</p>
<p>58. Reform in nationality laws has often accompanied broader initiatives to reach gender 
equality in various fields. For instance, in Rwanda, women parliamentarians created the 
Forum for Women Parliamentarians in 1996 with the objective of integrating gender at all 
levels through, notably, sensitization, strengthening women empowerment, and integrating 
gender into laws, policies, programmes, projects and budgets.50 Their efforts led to the 
revision of various laws that discriminated against women, in particular the law on 
nationality.  
</p>
<p>59. In addition, certain countries such as Algeria, Morocco, Cyprus, Egypt, Fiji, Ireland, 
Jamaica, Liechtenstein, Malaysia (partially), the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Turkey 
have lifted their reservations to article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women, an important step towards ensuring women&#8217;s equality 
with men in nationality-related matters. The lifting of reservations should be followed by 
appropriate legal and policy reform to ensure the realization of rights in practice.  
</p>
<p>60. Other countries have pledged to reform or are considering reforming their laws on 
nationality.51 For instance, Lebanon reported that it had set up a ministerial commission to 
study claims made by civil society organizations to amend the law on nationality. The 
National Commission for Lebanese Women submitted a project to amend the law on 
nationality to the commission in June 2012. Senegal also reported that it was considering 
reforming its nationality code to allow women to transfer their nationality to their husbands 
and children.  
</p>
<p>61. Various States indicated in their contributions for the present report that they had 
also incorporated safeguards into their nationality laws to prevent or reduce statelessness, 
from which stateless women and their children may benefit such as the conferral of 
nationality to children born of stateless parents, the prohibition of losing nationality if this 
results in statelessness, and facilitated procedures for the naturalization of stateless persons. 
Awareness-raising campaigns to inform the stateless about their options to acquire a 
nationality have also been conducted.  
</p>
<p>62. Discriminatory laws on nationality have been challenged in the courts of many 
countries, as well as before international human rights mechanisms. In some cases, 
following court decisions, discriminatory laws were amended. The arguments used by 
petitioners and in the decisions taken by these courts and mechanisms declaring such laws 
as discriminatory and in violation of human rights provisions could serve as an example of 
a best practice for other countries.  
</p>
<p>63. One of the most relevant cases is <i>Attorney General of the Republic of Botswana v. 
Unity Dow </i>(1992)<i>, </i>where the Botswana High Court ruled that the 1984 Citizenship Act 
violated the Constitution of Botswana in that it discriminated against women on the basis of 
sex. According to the Act, while the children of Botswana men married to foreigners or 
children born out of wedlock were entitled to Botswana nationality by birth, children of 
Botswana women married to foreigners were not. The Court referred in its decision to the

<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The 
Citizenship Act was amended in 1995 to conform to the ruling.  
</p>
<p>64. In the advisory opinion on the<i> Proposed Amendments to the Naturalization 
Provisions of the Constitution of Costa Rica </i>(1984)<i>, </i>the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights stated that the constitutional provision discriminating between men and women in 
the acquisition of nationality through marriage with a citizen of Costa Rica was in violation 
of the right to equal protection recognized in the Inter-American Convention. The Court 
recommended that the Constitution should be amended, which promptly ensued.  
</p>
<p>65. In <i>Genovese v. Malta </i>(2011),52 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that 
nationality fell under the scope of protection of the European Convention of Human Rights 
as part of a person&#8217;s social identity, which in turn is part of that person&#8217;s private life, and 
that discrimination between a child&#8217;s father and mother was not permitted with regard to 
access to nationality.  
</p>
<p>66. Other cases not directly dealing with nationality-related matters have also had an 
important impact in strengthening the prohibition of discrimination based on sex in relation 
to nationality-related matters: discrimination against foreign husbands to attain resident 
status (<i>Shirin Aumeeruddy-Cziffra and 19 other Mauritian women v. Mauritius</i> (1981) 
Human Rights Committee);53 the right to family life (<i>Berrehab v. the Netherlands</i> (1988) 
and <i>Beldjoudi v. France</i>, European Court of Human Rights); and freedom of movement 
(<i>Rattigan and Others v. Chief Immigration Officer</i>, Zimbabwe), among others.  
</p>
<p>67. Some countries in the Middle East and in the North African region offer good 
examples of how Governments have engaged in reforms of their laws on nationality to 
bring greater equality to nationality-related matters. The role of civil society in advocating 
for changes in the region has been also noteworthy. Some of the factors contributing to the 
success of these civil society campaigns included the adoption of a clear vision and strategy 
of action, the strengthening of the campaign through both a regional and a national focus, 
investment in comprehensive research and building broad coalitions, and the effective use 
of the media.54  
</p>
<p>68. One regional campaign, led by the Collective for Research and Training on 
Development &#8211; Action, maintained its focus on documenting the processes, developing 
advocacy skills, undertaking political lobbying, mobilizing women and the general public, 
working with media and maintaining regional linkages and the solidarity aspect of the 
campaign.55 It also provided direct support to women affected by the current nationality 
laws through legal counselling. Various other strategies were then adopted at national level; 
for instance, in Morocco press conferences, protests and other activities targeting 
Government, Parliament, the general public and media were organized by the Association 
d&#233;mocratique des femmes du Maroc and its local allies.56 A network of &#8220;listening centres&#8221; 
was created where women&#8217;s organizations recorded how the discriminatory law had an 
impact on families throughout the country. One of the strengths of the campaign was its 
ability to mobilize Moroccan women married to foreigners able for the first time to speak 
out about their situation. They were also able to capitalize on the momentum when the

<p>Family Code was reformed in 2002. Following the amendments to the nationality code, 
awareness-raising activities were organized to inform women about changes in the law. 
</p>
<p>69. Following the amendments to nationality provisions in Egypt, civil society engaged 
in a variety of activities, including monitoring the implementation of the new code at both 
the executive and judicial levels. Campaign activists also sought and obtained favourable 
court rulings against discriminatory practices in the implementation of the law.57  
</p>
<p>70. Other strategies employed by civil society include establishing broad partnerships; 
bilateral meetings with members of Parliament and the Government; theatre performances, 
roundtables, workshops and petitions; field studies as advocacy tools to provide relevant 
stakeholders with first-hand data on the extent and forms of suffering endured by women 
and their families; protests and sits-in; and using new technologies, sometimes with support 
from international non-governmental organizations, to raise awareness and collect 
signatures.58  
</p>
<p>71. Civil society in countries such as Malaysia and Jordan have also engaged with 
international human rights mechanisms, such as the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, and submitted alternative reports and other relevant 
information to promote their cause when their States were examined.59  
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The right to nationality is a fundamental right for everyone </b>&#8211;<b> women, men and 
children </b>&#8211; <b>and must be regarded as such by all States. Equal nationality rights are an 
essential dimen</b>sion of ensuring women&#8217;s human rights and crucial to preventing 
</p>
<p><b>statelessness. The discretion of States to confer nationality on their citizens is limited 
</b></p>
<p><b>by international law, in particular by international human rights law. Constitutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and nationality laws must therefore ensure the </b>full enjoyment of women&#8217;s equal right 
</p>
<p><b>to nationality and introduce safeguards to prevent statelessness. Despite positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>developments in some countries, nationality laws in many others still discriminate 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women. Women and men do not enjoy equal rights to acquire, change and 
</b></p>
<p><b>retain their nationality, and are not allowed to transfer nationality to their children or 
</b></p>
<p><b>spouses on the same basis. Discrimination against women in nationality-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>matters is still prevalent in law and practice. OHCHR therefore recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>States and other stakeholders: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Withdraw all reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</b></p>
<p><b>Forms of Discrimination against Women</b> <b>that</b> <b>impede </b>women&#8217;s enjoyment of their 
<b>nationality rights on the same basis as men, in particular their reservations to article 
</b></p>
<p><b>9, and ratify relevant international human rights instruments, including the optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>protocols providing for individual complaints.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Remove all provisions in Constitutions and nationality laws that 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminate against women, thereby ensuring full equality between men and women 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding the acquisition, change and retention of their nationality. In particular, 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should ensure that marriage to a foreigner or a change to the husband</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationality during marriage will not automatically change the nationality of the wife,

<p><b>nationality laws should not distinguish between children born in and out of wedlock. 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should also ensure consistency among all laws, policies and regulations dealing 
</b></p>
<p><b>with nationality.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Amend nationality laws and allow women whose marriage has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>dissolved to automatically reacquire their former nationality through a simple 
</b></p>
<p><b>declaration in cases where women automatically lose or have to renounce their 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationality when they marry. States should also raise awareness among women on 
</b></p>
<p><b>how to reclaim their nationality. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Recognize dual nationality for children born to parents from different 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationalities and for spouses married to foreigners and residing in the State of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>spouse who express their wish to acquire the nationality of their spouse without losing 
</b></p>
<p><b>their nationality of origin. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Take the measures necessary to address practices that discriminate 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women in nationality matters as well as indirect discrimination in nationality 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws, so that substantive equality between women and men in nationality matters may 
</b></p>
<p><b>be achieved. States should also address the specific challenges faced by women who 
</b></p>
<p><b>suffer from multiple forms of discrimination, especially in their enjoyment of the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to nationality.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Guarantee the full enjoyment of human rights for non-national family 
</b></p>
<p><b>members, in particular the rights to education, health, work, residence and freedom 
</b></p>
<p><b>from violence. Access to administrative and judicial remedies should be also available 
</b></p>
<p><b>to them. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Improve data collection, research and dissemination of information 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating </b>to women&#8217;s equal right to nationality. <b>This includes information on legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions and the consequences of discrimination against women in nationality-
</b></p>
<p><b>related matters on the enjoyment of their human rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Take all the measures necessary to ensure that all girls and boys are 
</b></p>
<p><b>registered immediately after birth, without discrimination based on sex, race, 
</b></p>
<p><b>disability, social or other status. Marriages should also be registered in a timely 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Ensure equal access to documents used to prove nationality, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular passports, identity documents and birth and marriage certificates. Laws 
</b></p>
<p><b>and practices requiring women to secure the consent and assistance of their husband, 
</b></p>
<p>husband&#8217;s famil<b>y or father in order to obtain nationality documents should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>amended, including those that require the </b>husband&#8217;s consent to add children names <b>to 
</b></p>
<p>the mother&#8217;s passport. <b>Alternative systems of proof of identity in contexts where 
</b></p>
<p><b>documentary evidence is not available or cannot reasonably be obtained should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided.  </b></p>


<p><b>(k) Facilitate the acquisition of nationality for those who do not benefit from 
</b></p>
<p><b>recent reforms in nationality laws because the law is not retroactive or has other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stringent requirements.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Ensure that effective remedies are available and accessible to those 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected by sex discriminatory provisions in nationality laws. States should also widely 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminate all relevant judicial decisions and recommendations of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms on nationality, and ensure their implementation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Implement training programmes for Government officials, the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other relevant stakeholders at all levels on reformed nationality laws. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also raise awareness of the public, in particular women, on their equal right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationality and on recently amended laws and procedures.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Protect women human rights defenders involved in nationality-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>campaigns and ensure effective representation of women in all reforms to nationality 
</b></p>
<p><b>law, whether at national, regional or international level.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Strengthen collaboration between stakeholders working to end 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination against women in nationality laws and those working to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>statelessness. This includes States, international organizations, civil society groups and 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected individuals themselves. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(p) The Human Rights Council, including the universal periodic review, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>special procedures and the treaty bodies should continue to review the laws and 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices of States with respect to discrimination against women in nationality-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>matters, including where this results in statelessness of women or their children. Such 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms should continue to engage with civil society, in particul</b>ar with women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>organizations.  
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
