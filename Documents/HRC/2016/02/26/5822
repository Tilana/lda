<p><b>Resolution 10/14. Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the  
  Child and the Optional Protocols thereto 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that the Convention on the Rights of the Child must constitute the standard in 
the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, and bearing in mind the importance of the 
Optional Protocols to the Convention, as well as other human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions on the rights of the child of the Commission on 
Human Rights, the Council and the General Assembly, the most recent being Council 
resolution 7/29 of 28 March 2008 and Assembly resolution 63/241 of 23 December 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the report of the Secretary-General on the status of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (A/HRC/10/86), 
</p>
<p><i> Celebrating</i> the twentieth anniversary of the Convention in 2009 and taking this 
opportunity to call for its effective implementation by all States parties to ensure that all children 
may fully enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 47 of Council resolution 7/29 and particularly the Council&#8217;s 
decision to consider an omnibus resolution on the rights of the child every four years, and to 
focus on a theme of the rights of the child on an annual basis in the intervening period, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the constructive dialogue on &#8220;20 years of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child: achievements and challenges ahead for its full realization&#8221; on the occasion of the full-day 
annual meeting on the rights of the child on 11 March 2009 and renewed commitment expressed 
on this occasion by States to the implementation of the Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the different initiatives at the international and regional levels to contribute to the 
implementation of the Convention and international events, such as the recent Third World 
Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, held in November 2008 in 
Rio de Janeiro, 
</p>
<p><i> Profoundly concerned</i> that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains 
critical and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is needed, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls on</i> the States that have not yet become States parties to the Convention and the 
Optional Protocols thereto to do so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls on</i> all States parties to withdraw reservations that are incompatible with the 
object and purpose of the Convention or the Optional Protocols thereto, and encourages all States 
parties to the Convention or the Optional Protocols to establish a regular procedure to regularly </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 2 
</p>
<p>evaluate the impact of their reservations to the Convention and the Optional Protocols, with a 
view to withdrawing them in order to ensure the fullest possible respect for the Convention and 
the Optional Protocols in all States parties; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the States parties to take effective measures to ensure that their obligations 
arising from the Convention are given effect and comprehensively implemented through policy 
and legislation within their domestic systems and to review their national legislation with this 
aim; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> all States parties to systematically assess any proposed law, 
administrative guidance, policy or budgetary allocation that is likely to have an impact on 
children and their rights, taking into account the interdependence and indivisibility of the rights 
of the child and ensuring appropriate enforcement of their obligations under the Convention and 
the Optional Protocols thereto; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also</i> <i>calls upon</i> all States to ensure that development and evaluation of States 
policies on children are informed by available, sufficient, reliable and disaggregated data on 
children, covering the whole period of childhood and all the rights guaranteed in the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges </i>all States to develop or renew, as appropriate through a process of 
consultation, including with children and young people and their representatives, as well as those 
living and working with them, comprehensive national strategies for children, taking into 
account the Convention, setting out specific goals, targeted implementation measures and 
allocation of financial and human resources and including arrangements for monitoring and 
regular review, and to endorse this strategy at the highest level of government and ensure its 
comprehensive dissemination, including in child-friendly formats as well as in appropriate 
languages and forms; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recognizing</i> that the sufficient allocation of resources in public spending, including 
in primary education and basic health care, is a fundamental condition for the full realization of 
the rights of the child, calls upon States to make children a priority in their budgetary allocations, 
make resources allocated to children visible in the State budget through a detailed compilation of 
resources allocated to them and to take all necessary measures to ensure that children, including 
in particular marginalized and disadvantaged groups of children, are protected from the adverse 
effects of financial downturns; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls on</i> States to take all appropriate measures, including legal reforms and special 
support measures, to ensure the enjoyment by children of all their human rights and fundamental 
freedoms without discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Recalls</i> the United Nations target for international development assistance 
of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product and the 20/20 initiative,<b>1</b> and calls upon all States to 
ensure that their international development assistance related directly or indirectly to children is 
rights-based and supports the implementation of the Convention;

</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls on</i> all States to establish, maintain, strengthen or designate, in complementarity 
to effective governmental structures for children, independent mechanisms such as national 
human rights institutions in accordance with the Paris Principles, children&#8217;s ombudspersons, 
commissioners or focal points on the rights of the child in national human rights institutions that 
are sufficiently funded and accessible to children, to promote and monitor the implementation of 
the Convention and advance the universal realization of children&#8217;s rights; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also calls on </i>all States to ensure that child-sensitive procedures are made available to 
children and their representatives so that children have access to means of facilitating effective 
remedies for any breaches of any of their rights arising from the Convention through 
independent advice, advocacy and complaint procedures, including justice mechanisms, and that 
their views are heard when they are involved or their interests concerned in justice procedures; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Further calls</i> <i>on</i> States to develop further, as appropriate, effective mechanisms that 
encourage and facilitate expression by children of their views, in particular with regard to the 
formulation of public policies from the local level up to the national level, and to ensure 
meaningful participation of children and reflection of their views in monitoring and reporting on 
the implementation of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon </i>all States to promote and develop, as appropriate, practical and systematic 
education and training for all those involved in the implementation of the Convention, 
government officials, parliamentarians and members of the judiciary, and for all those working 
with and for children as well as continuous specific education for children themselves, with the 
aim of emphasizing the status of the child as a holder of human rights, increasing knowledge and 
understanding of the Convention and encouraging active respect for all its provisions; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Urges</i> States parties to publish and disseminate widely the text of the Convention and 
the Optional Protocols thereto as well as national reports submitted to the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child and concluding observations and recommendations of that Committee to all, 
including children, by effective means, including the Internet, and also in appropriate languages 
and in child-friendly and other accessible formats; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Encourages</i> States parties to take duly into account, in implementing the provisions 
of the Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto, the recommendations, observations and 
general comments of the Committee on the Rights of the Child; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the actions of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to follow up and 
monitor the implementation of its concluding observations and recommendations by the States 
parties and, in this regard, particularly underlines the regional workshops and the Committee&#8217;s 
participation in national-level initiatives; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Also welcomes</i> the role that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights plays in promoting the implementation of the Convention and the Optional 
Protocol thereto and, while noting with satisfaction the recent establishment of the Office-wide 
task force on the rights of the child, encourages the Office of the High Commissioner, in 
collaboration with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and other relevant United Nations 
agencies, to ensure further the systematic integration of child rights into its programmes and 
activities; </p>

Optional Protocols thereto into its work in a regular, systematic and transparent manner, and 
requests the special procedures and other human rights mechanisms of the Council to take into 
account the relevant provisions of the Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto in the 
fulfilment of their mandates;

to take into account the relevant recommendations derived thereof in implementing the 
Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto;
