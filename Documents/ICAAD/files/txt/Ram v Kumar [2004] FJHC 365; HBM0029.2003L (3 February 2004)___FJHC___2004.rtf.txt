(i)

The plaintiffs relied on the affidavit of Sunil Chandra Ram sworn on 8 December 2003 and the defendants relied on the affidavit Lesi Tuiwawa sworn on 2 December 2003. The plaintiffs filed skeleton written submissions and a list of authorities.

Background

The letter dated 15 October 2000 (annexure C to the affidavit of Daya Ram also known as Rajendra Prasad) the 2nd Plaintiff and Roxy Motorparts Limited agreed for the 2nd plaintiff to take over the business Roxy Rentals effective from 1 April 2001. Roxy Motorparts Limited was wound up apparently effective from 11 April 2001. Commencing on 28 November 2001 the plaintiff purchased a total of 17 motor vehicles. The plaintiffs by writ of summons filed on 21 November 2003 in Nadi Magistrates Court commenced action against the defendants.

By Order made on 3 December 2003 as mentioned earlier, those proceedings were removed to this Court and the Orders referred to above were made. 

The Court rules Order 29 Rule 1(2) states and I quote: -

Where the applicant is the plaintiff and the case is one of urgency and the delay caused by proceeding in the ordinary way would entail irreparable or serious mischief such application may be made ex-parte on affidavit but except as aforesaid, such application must be made by Notice of Motion or Summons.

The applicant for an ex-parte order in this instance was the defendant and not the plaintiff. The defendants argued that they can rely on Order 2 Rule 1(1) to overcome the words of Order 29 Rule 1(2). I do not agree, no authority was referred to to support this proposition.

The Law

The defendants submitted that Section 313 of the Companies Act Cap. 247 operates so as to make the acquisition of the business by the plaintiffs a fraudulent preference and that the authorities considering Mareva injunctions can be relied on to overcome the provision of Order 29 Rule 1(2). 

The cases sighted were Chartered Bank v. Daklouche & Anr. [1980] 1 All E.R. at 205 which authority was relied on by Fatiaki J. in Seng Mi Commercial Company v. John Y. Singh & Company Limited and John Yogendra Singh (Civil Action No. HBC0018 of 1997) at Suva.

At page 9 of the judgment His Lordships said and I quote: 

In Chartered Bank v. Daklouche (1980) 1 All E.R. 205 where fraud had been pleaded as a cause of action against the defendant husband alleging inter alia that he was part of a conspiracy to defraud his creditors, Lord Denning M.R. in extending the Mareva injunction in that case against both husband and wife said at p.208:

It is very easy to transfer money from one bank to another at a moments notice.

And later at p.210 the learned Master of Rolls said:

The law should be that there is jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction, even though the defendant may be served here. If he makes a fleeting visit, or if there is a danger that he may abscond or that the assets or moneys may disappear & a Mareva injunction can be granted.

Eveleigh L.J. for his part in supporting the cause of action endorsed a passage in Kerr on Fraud and Mistake (7th edn.) where the learned author wrote:

Civil courts have an original and inherent jurisdiction to relieve against every species of fraud not being relief of a penal nature & Deeds, obligations, contracts & may be the instruments to which parties resort to cover fraud, & but none of such devices (and here I would include a sham company) or instruments will be permitted by a Court of Equity to obstruct the requirements of justice.

The plaintiffs submit that if fraud is relied on by the defendants  Order 5 Rule 2(d) requires proceedings to be commenced by Writ and not by Notice of Motion. 

Section 313 of the Companies Act requires the transfer, conveyance etc to meet the tests required in respect of a bankruptcy petition before it is deemed a fraudulent preference.

Section 46 of the Bankruptcy Act requires the transaction to be undertaken with a view to giving such creditor & a preference over the other creditors& to be deemed fraudulent and void.

I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that the transaction as a whole was undertaken with a view to giving a preference, particularly in view of the consideration paid and the fact that 17 motor vehicles were purchased by the plaintiff after the vendor company was wound up.

Whilst other issues were raised in argument I dont think it is necessary to consider them to determine the matter pursuant to Order 29 Rule 1(2).

Conclusion

The breach of Order 29 Rule 1(2) cannot be remedied. Compliance with the Order is mandatory in my opinion and accordingly the Orders of 3 December 2003 must be discharged. 

The Orders that I propose are 

(a)     
The Orders made by this Court on 3 December 2003 be discharged that the Land Transport Authority be joined as a party to these proceedings.

(b)     
That the Land Transport Authority to transfer the vehicles and permits referred to in Order (e) of the Orders of 3 December 2003 to the 2nd Plaintiff.

(c)     
That all motor vehicles referred to in Order (e) of 3 December 2003 held by the defendants be released to the plaintiffs forthwith.

(d)     
The defendants to pay the plaintiffs costs.
