<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/28 
of 8 October 2013, in which the Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert on 
the situation of human rights in the Sudan and requested him to continue his engagement 
with the Government of the Sudan and to submit a report to the Council at its twenty-
seventh session in September 2014. The Council also urged the Government to continue its 
cooperation with the Independent Expert, including by granting him access to the entire 
country, in particular the States of Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, in order to assess 
and verify the human rights situation in the country, determine the technical assistance 
needs and report on his findings.  
</p>
<p>2. The report covers the period from October 2013 to July 2014. It provides an 
appraisal of the human rights situation in the Sudan during the reporting period, focusing 
principally on the need to enhance the protection of human rights on the ground and the 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the Independent Expert&#8217;s previous 
report (A/HRC/24/31) presented to the Human Rights Council in September 2013. It gives 
a list of communications sent to the Government during the reporting period, assesses the 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the previous report and outlines the 
subsisting human rights challenges in the country. It also identifies necessary technical 
assistance and capacity-building needs and provides a list of recommendations, addressed 
to the Government of the Sudan, the international community, civil society organizations 
and the armed movements in the Sudan, for the improvement of the human rights situation 
in the country.  
</p>
<p>3. In compliance with the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of 
the Human Rights Council, a draft of the report was shared with the Government of the 
Sudan to provide it with the opportunity to comment on the findings and observations of 
the Independent Expert.1  
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert thanks the Government of the Sudan for its cooperation and 
support in the implementation of his mandate. During the reporting period, the Government 
granted access and facilitated the Independent Expert&#8217;s visits to Khartoum, North Darfur, 
East Darfur, Central Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile States. Although the 
Independent Expert requested to visit the Khor Abeche internally displaced person (IDP) 
camp in South Darfur and Kassala State in East Sudan during his mission in June 2014, 
travel authorizations to those areas were not granted by the Government owing to security 
and administrative constraints.  
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert also thanks the Office of the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid 
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 
other United Nations agencies and international relief organizations operating in the Sudan, 
members of the diplomatic community, civil society organizations and all other groups and 
individuals who provided assistance and shared information with him.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology and engagements 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert undertook two missions to the Sudan during the reporting 
period. He visited Khartoum, Kadugli in South Kordofan State, El-Fasher in North Darfur 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See A/HRC/27/69/Add.1. </p>


<p>State, El-Daein in East Darfur State, Zalingei in Central Darfur State and Ed-Damazin in 
Blue Nile State. During the visits, he held meetings with senior government officials, the 
United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, representatives of 
United Nations and international relief agencies, members of the diplomatic community, 
civil society organizations, leaders of different opposition political parties, tribal leaders, 
human rights defenders, professional groups and other interlocutors, and received reliable 
information about the general situation of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Khartoum 
</b></p>
<p>7. In Khartoum, he held meetings with senior government officials including the 
Minister of Justice, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Welfare and Social 
Security, the Minister of Education, the Under-Secretary of the Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs, the Assistant to the President of the Sudan and Head of the Sudan delegation to the 
negotiations on the conflict in the &#8220;Two Areas&#8221; of Blue Nile and South Kordofan, and the 
Government&#8217;s Chief Negotiator for Peace in Darfur. The Independent Expert was briefed 
about the Government&#8217;s efforts to improve the human rights situation in the country and he 
advised the Government to intensity its practical efforts, highlighting the need for the 
Government to fully implement the recommendations made in his previous report. He also 
held meetings with senior officers of relevant institutions including the Advisory Council 
for Human Rights, the judiciary &#8212; including the Constitutional Court, the National 
Intelligence and Security Service, the Humanitarian Affairs Commission, the National 
Commission for Human Rights, the Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly, 
the Commission for Refugees, the Unit for Combating Violence against Women and 
Children, the Family and Child Protection Unit of the Police Force, the General Prosecutor, 
and the Special Prosecutor for Crimes in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>8. The Independent Expert met with professional groups including the Sudanese Bar 
Association, the Union of Sudanese Journalists, the Sudanese Independent Journalists 
Network, the Khartoum International Centre for Human Rights, different independent civil 
society organizations, human rights defenders, and individuals alleging human rights 
violations and their families who shared their personal experiences with him. He also met 
with members of the diplomatic community, leaders and representatives of different 
opposition political parties, the Vice-Chancellor and senior officers of the University of 
Khartoum as well as academics from different universities in the Sudan, who shared with 
him valuable information on the human rights situation in the country. He further visited 
the Al-Huda Prison and Reformatory Centre and the Omdurman Female Prison to assess 
the conditions of the prisons and talk to the inmates therein. Both prisons had excellent 
facilities and reformatory programmes for the inmates. The Al-Huda Prison was of very 
high international standard. 
</p>
<p><b>  Darfur 
</b></p>
<p>9. In North Darfur, the Independent Expert met the Governor of the State and members 
of his Cabinet, the Chairman of the Darfur Regional Authority, the Special Prosecutor for 
Crimes in Darfur, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, and civil society 
organizations. He also met with the Joint African Union-United Nations Special 
Representative and Joint Chief Mediator for Darfur and Head of UNAMID and members of 
the UNAMID senior management team to discuss the human rights and humanitarian 
situation in Darfur. The issue of armed conflicts generally and the consequent civilian 
displacements was identified as a major factor of human rights violations in the State. The 
poor conditions in the IDP camps, the safety of IDPs and returnees, protection of civilians </p>


<p>in the conflict areas, lack of security, general escalation of crime, and the impunity of some 
offenders were also mentioned as serious human rights issues in the State.  
</p>
<p>10. In East Darfur the Independent Expert met with the Deputy Governor of the State 
and members of his cabinet, the Humanitarian Affairs Commission officers in the State, the 
Chief Prosecutor, and civil society organizations. East Darfur is a new State where poverty 
and underdevelopment have had an adverse impact on the human rights situation. There is 
an urgent need to promote economic and social rights in the State, to alleviate poverty and 
enhance the protection of human rights. Civil society groups in the State complained about 
the poor human rights situation, and the lack of an independent human rights office in East 
Darfur. This concerned the need for the establishment of branch offices of the National 
Commission for Human Rights at the grass-roots level. The Independent Expert has advised 
the human rights section of UNAMID in El-Daein, the State capital, to enhance its 
collaboration with local civil society groups in the State, pending the establishment of a 
branch office of the Commission in East Darfur. There is a large number of IDPs in East 
Darfur and the Independent Expert was informed that a village for IDP returnees, with 
facilities to encourage voluntary returns, was being developed near El-Daein with funding 
from the Government of Qatar. 
</p><p>11. In Central Darfur the Independent Expert met the Governor of the State and 
members of his Cabinet, the Chief Prosecutor and the Speaker of the House of Assembly of 
the State. He also visited the Zalingei prison to inspect the facilities and conditions of the 
inmates. The situation in the male section of the prison was deplorable. The inmates 
complained about lack of water and poor sanitary conditions. There were a few apparently 
under-aged inmates in the prison and an inmate who had been awaiting trial for 33 months. 
There was also a young inmate who was held in shackles inside a cell. The female section 
of the prison had, however, been well refurbished to a reasonable standard with the 
assistance of international aid agencies. The Independent Expert raised concerns about the 
deplorable condition of the male section of the Zalingei prison and urged the Government 
to improve the conditions there. Central Darfur State further suffers from the problem of 
armed conflicts, which continues to affect the human rights of civilians. There are a great 
number of IDPs and very large IDP camps in the State, some of which are infiltrated by 
members of armed movements and are, thus, a potential source of conflict. 
</p>
<p>12. The problem of unexploded ordnances exists across the five Darfur States and as a 
result there have been reports of civilian casualties. The Independent Expert received a 
briefing on ordnance disposal operations conducted by UNAMID in different parts of 
Darfur in June 2014, and commends UNAMID for its efforts in that regard. Recorded 
crimes and general insecurity are still very high in Darfur.  
</p>
<p><b>  South Kordofan 
</b></p>
<p>13. In South Kordofan, the Independent Expert met the Governor and other senior 
officials of the State. He also held meetings with the legislative assembly of South 
Kordofan, tribal leaders from the Greater Kadugli locality, the Chief Prosecutor of the 
State, United Nations agencies, international aid organizations, civil society organizations 
and human rights defenders operating in the State. He had discussions with the different 
interlocutors about the human rights challenges in the State. The Governor expressed 
concerns about rebel attacks there and highlighted the need for peace for the realization of 
human rights in the State.  
</p>
<p>14. South Kordofan State has adopted a social peace initiative through which members 
of armed movements who voluntarily laid down their arms were given amnesty and re-
absorbed into their former posts in the civil service of the State. The State is collaborating 
with UNDP for the practical realization of human rights through development projects in </p>


<p>the five areas of education, health, water, poverty alleviation and social peace. This 
initiative of linking development to human rights, particularly in the rural areas of the 
Sudan, is commendable and should be effectively sustained and replicated in other parts of 
the country.  
</p>
<p>15. It was evident that armed conflicts continued to be a major cause of human rights 
violations in South Kordofan State. The problem of unexploded ordnances and the need for 
demining in the conflict areas was emphasized by the United Nations representatives in the 
State, who reported civilian casualties from unexploded ordnances. The Independent Expert 
has called the attention of the Government of the Sudan and relevant United Nations mine 
action teams to help in addressing this problem.  
</p>
<p><b>  Blue Nile 
</b></p>
<p>16. In Blue Nile State, the Independent Expert held meetings with the Governor and 
other State officials, including the head of the Humanitarian Affairs Commission in the 
State. He also had discussions on the humanitarian situation with United Nations agencies, 
international relief organizations, and civil society organizations working in the State. The 
conflicts in Blue Nile State have also adversely affected the situation of human rights there. 
Representatives of civil society organizations emphasized the need for peace to facilitate 
real improvement in the human rights situation in the State. The problem of landmines also 
exists in the conflict areas of Blue Nile State and needs to be urgently addressed.  
</p>
<p>17. Outside the Sudan, the Independent Expert attended the 3rd Civil Society Forum on 
Sudan and South Sudan held in Addis Ababa from 20 to 22 January 2014, where he met 
and discussed the human rights situation in the Sudan with different civil society 
representatives. He also met with representatives of Sudanese civil society and other 
international civil society organizations in London, and had useful engagements with the 
Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations and other international 
organizations in Geneva during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>18. In his engagements with the Government of the Sudan and all other stakeholders, the 
Independent Expert aimed at assessing the Government&#8217;s efforts towards the practical 
improvement of the situation of human rights on the ground, as recommended in his 
previous report. To that end he reiterated the need for the Government to adopt a result-
oriented approach to its human rights obligations, and offered technical advice to the 
Government on the necessary steps it needed to take in that regard.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Appraisal of the human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>19. In his previous report, the Independent Expert mentioned that the Government of the 
Sudan had adopted relevant legislation and policies aimed at improving the human rights 
situation in the country. This remains the case during this reporting period. Two notable 
examples are the passage of a new Human Trafficking Act in January 2014, which is a 
welcome step towards combating the increasing problem of human trafficking in the 
country, and the adoption by the National Commission on Human Rights of a promising 
four-year national strategic plan for 2014 to 2018. However, implementation still remains 
protracted and there have been no significant visible improvements in the protection of 
human rights on the ground since 2013.  
</p>
<p>20. In its engagement with the Independent Expert, the Government insisted that it was 
making every effort, within the prevailing political and conflict situation, to improve the 
practical situation of human rights on the ground. While he acknowledged the 
Government&#8217;s commitment and openness to a constructive dialogue during his visits, the </p>


<p>Independent Expert raised concerns about the subsisting human rights challenges raised in 
his previous report, which the Government has still not addressed. 
</p>
<p>21. There have, regrettably, been many encroachments on human rights in the country 
that have attracted considerable international concern within the reporting period. They 
included fatal shootings and injuries during the September 2013 oil-subsidy demonstrations 
in Khartoum; the fatal shooting of a University of Khartoum student during a rally on the 
university campus on 10 March 2014; the arrests and detentions of opposition political 
leaders and youth activists between March and June 2014; the apostasy case of Meriam 
Ibrahim (aka Abrar al-Hadi) and its effect on the right to freedom of religion in the Sudan; 
confiscation of newspapers by security agents; and escalation of armed conflicts resulting 
in major displacements of civilians in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile States. The 
Independent Expert received written and oral complaints from individuals, civil society 
organizations, international agencies and the diplomatic community about those incidents, 
which he raised in his discussions with the Government of the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>22. In their discussions with the Independent Expert, representatives of possible donor 
States and international institutions continually highlighted the need for the Sudan to 
redress those human rights encroachments to encourage positive responses to requests for 
technical assistance and capacity-building from the international community.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Written communications sent to the Government of the 
Sudan 
</b>23. During the reporting period, the Independent Expert along with other concerned 
special procedures mandate holders sent four jointly signed urgent appeals (on 17 October 
2013, 6 November 2013, 29 November 2013 and 14 May 2014) and two allegation letters 
(on 7 May and 10 July 2014) to the Government of the Sudan with respect to different 
complaints and information received from individuals and groups raising specific human 
rights concerns.  
</p>
<p>24. The Government did not respond formally to any of the above communications 
during the reporting period. The Independent Expert raised concerns with the Government 
about its non-response to those communications. Issuance of urgent appeals and allegation 
letters under the United Nations special procedures system enables mandate holders to 
verify information about specific allegations of human rights violations received, and also 
provides the Government with the opportunity to respond to such allegations. The 
Independent Expert urges the Government to be responsive to future communications as 
required under the special procedures system.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Follow-up on the implementation of previous 
recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>25. As requested by the Independent Expert, in June 2014 the Government submitted to 
him a report listing the steps it had taken towards implementing some of his previous 
recommendations. The report indicated that the Government&#8217;s national plan to implement 
the recommendations of the universal periodic review was ongoing with support from 
UNDP. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 24/28, had encouraged continued 
support by UNDP, but the Government indicated that the support of UNDP for its universal 
periodic review implementation plan was currently being threatened by depletion of its 
funds for that purpose. As UNDP support is indispensable for sustaining the 
implementation plan of the review recommendations by the Government, the Independent </p>


<p>Expert urges the international community to assist UNDP with the necessary funds to 
enable it to continue supporting the Government in that regard.  
</p>
<p>26. The Government has established a National Committee for the implementation of its 
10-year National Action Plan for the Protection of Human Rights, as recommended by the 
Independent Expert. It is now in the process of creating State and local committees for 
coordinating the implementation of the Action Plan at the grass-roots level. A human rights 
adviser has also been assigned to the Minister of Education to advise on the inclusion of 
human rights in the educational curriculum, with a high-level committee established in the 
Ministry of Education to monitor the implementation of the Action Plan at national level. 
The Ministry has requested technical expertise from the international community to take 
that process forward. The Independent Expert commends that positive step by the 
Government and urges the international community to support the Ministry with technical 
assistance in that regard. Inculcating human rights into the educational curriculum in the 
Sudan is imperative for the future and long-term integration of a human rights culture in the 
society.  
</p>
<p>27. Regarding steps taken on the Independent Expert&#8217;s recommendation for 
transparency and inclusiveness in the country&#8217;s constitutional and political process, the 
Government referred to the reform agenda presented by the President of Sudan in January 
2014 proposing a national dialogue including all political groups. This was followed by a 
presidential decree in April 2014 providing for the release of political detainees, permitting 
political parties to operate freely and guaranteeing freedom of the press. However, two 
front-line opposition political party leaders were regrettably arrested and detained in May 
and June 2014 for making public statements considered by the Government as crossing set 
&#8220;red lines&#8221;. The arrests had a negative impact on the national dialogue process, casting 
public doubt on the Government&#8217;s sincerity towards that initiative. The Independent Expert 
raised concerns about that drawback and urged the Government to guarantee essential civil 
liberties to facilitate an enabling environment for a meaningful national dialogue and 
political process.  
</p>
<p>28. In response to the Independent Expert&#8217;s recommendation that the Government 
should ensure that its armed forces complied fully with humanitarian laws in their 
engagement with rebel forces, the Government claimed that it had a duty to defend the 
State against the armed movements which had been targeting the security of the State and 
attacking civilians in cities and villages. Nevertheless, the Government has an obligation to 
abide by the principle of proportionality in its armed response to attacks by the armed 
movements and avoid indiscriminate killing or displacement of civilian populations.  
</p>
<p>29. There is no mention of steps taken by the Government in respect of other 
recommendations of the Independent Expert such as: (a) amend the 2010 National Security 
Act to ensure that the powers of the National Intelligence and Security Service are in 
conformity with international human rights obligations of the Sudan; (b) cease arbitrary 
curtailment of the activities of civil society organizations, press censorship and arbitrary 
arrests and detentions; (c) fully respect the right to freedom of religion without 
discrimination; (d) uphold the guarantee of the rights of women and children, and take 
necessary steps to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. The Government should take the necessary steps to implement all the 
remaining recommendations.  
</p>
<p>30. Regarding the Independent Expert&#8217;s recommendation to the international 
community for technical assistance to the Sudan, it is encouraging to note the recent 
decision of the European Union to enhance its support for projects relating to peacebuilding 
in the Sudan over the next three years. The Independent Expert also acknowledges the 
support provided within the reporting period to the Sudan by other international entities, 
such as UNAMID and UNDP, as outlined in section VII below. </p>


<p><b> VI. Subsisting human rights challenges 
</b>31. The practical human rights challenges identified in the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
previous report are still subsisting to a great extent. The situation was compounded by other 
notable human rights encroachments that occurred during the reporting period. To realize 
the necessary improvements to the human rights situation on the ground, the Government 
needs to fully address all the following human rights challenges effectively.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights violations during the September 2013 demonstrations 
</b></p>
<p>32. In September 2013, there were oil-subsidy demonstrations across Khartoum State, 
which resulted in fatal shootings, injuries and destruction of property, leading to the arrest 
and detention of many demonstrators. The international community called for a thorough 
investigation of the human rights violations that had occurred during the demonstrations. 
On enquiry, the Independent Expert was informed by the Government in December 2013 
that it had set up two committees to investigate the September incidents. During his mission 
to the Sudan in February 2014, the Independent Expert had urged the Government to 
release the report of its investigations on time. Consequently, the Government presented the 
Independent Expert with a written report at the end of his mission to the Sudan in June 
</p><p>2014. A summary of the report is provided below with, for accuracy, specific quotations 
from relevant sections. 
</p>
<p>33. The report was prepared and issued by the Office of the Chief Prosecutor of 
Khartoum State and entitled: &#8220;A brief report on the acts of violence of September 2013&#8221;. It 
consists of an introduction and four main sections entitled, &#8220;What happened?&#8221;, &#8220;How did 
the public prosecution manage the fallouts of the incidents?&#8221;, &#8220;Cases of death&#8221;, &#8220;Why the 
investigation is yet to identify the shooters?&#8221;, and a &#8220;Conclusion&#8221;. The members of the 
investigating committee are not disclosed in the report.  
</p>
<p>34. The introduction states how the prosecutor prepared for possible demonstrations 
following the economic reform measures taken by the Government. Measures taken aimed 
to: (a) &#8220;secure and escort the demonstrations until the end of the manifestations of 
expression of protest&#8221;; (b) &#8220;ensure the protection and safety of public facilities in case of 
any potential threat to such facilities&#8221;; and (c) &#8220;ensure not to resort to the use of force save 
in case of necessity, exercise the utmost self-control and not respond to instances of 
provocation that might be made by some demonstrators&#8221;. In the &#8220;What happened?&#8221; section, 
the report gives information about how the protests started and suddenly turned violent with 
demonstrators attacking and destroying public and private properties. It then states that:  
</p>
<p>The police dealt with those serious developments to the extent that could protect the 
individual and private and public property. The result of that was as follows: 
(1) Occurrence of loss of lives amounted to 85 dead. (2) Infliction of heavy damage 
on public and private ownerships. (3) Many injuries amongst individuals and 
security organs personnel. (4) A big number of suspects were arrested under charges 
of criminal mischief and theft (sections 69, 77, 182, and 174 of the Criminal Act 
1991). 
</p>
<p>35. The section entitled &#8220;How did the pubic prosecution manage the fallouts of the 
incidents?&#8221; provides information on the visit of prosecution attorneys to the two mortuaries 
in Khartoum &#8220;to assume the exercise of the preliminary procedures which include issuing 
orders of post-mortem, delivery of bodies of the deceased to their kindred and examining 
complainants and witnesses, where applicable&#8221;. The prosecution attorneys also visited 
places of custody to supervise the situation of detainees who were classified into three 
categories:  </p>


<p>Category One, which includes minors under the age of 18, were immediately 
released on personal guarantees by their guardians. They were all released within a 
few hours following their arrest. Category Two, includes adults against whom no 
adequate evidence was available in relation to acts of sabotage and looting. They 
were released on ordinary bail. Category Three, which includes the persons against 
whom there was prima facie evidence to their involvement in acts of theft, looting 
and sabotage. The public prosecution decided to keep them in custody pending 
completion of investigation and estimation of the financial bail for their release. 
</p>
<p>36. The section on &#8220;Cases of death&#8221; consists of 10 paragraphs and is fully reproduced 
for accuracy as follows:  
</p>
<p>(1) The public prosecution immediately initiated preliminary investigations pursuant 
to section 51 of the Criminal Procedure Act (death in mysterious circumstances) for 
each case. (2) Post-mortem order forms were issued for all of the dead bodies, and 
the public prosecution received the reports of the two mortuaries in relation to all the 
bodies. (3) The public prosecution examined the complainants and some witnesses 
who were present at the time of the incident or who helped in the ambulance 
operation. (4) The public prosecution designed a uniformed formula in which all the 
information pertaining to the deceased persons, places of the incidence, causes of 
death &#8230; etc. were registered. Such forms were consolidated in one report to the 
Prosecutor-General. (5) The public prosecution summoned the relatives of deceased 
persons to appear before the investigating authorities and to submit any information 
which might assist in the investigation. (6) Through the review of the death cases it 
is evident that the deceased persons represented 31 ethnical groups from the various 
Sudanese tribes. Deceased women were three. One security officer was among the 
deceased. (7) The number of bodies taken to hospitals and mortuaries without 
identifying the circumstances surround[ing] their death or being availed of medical 
service were 25. (8) In 5 cases witnesses have identified the persons who fired at 
deceased persons. Though the testimony of those witnesses was hearsay, the public 
prosecution gave it considerable attention. (9) During post-mortem, firearm bullets 
were found in 7 bodies of the deceased. The bullets were sent to the criminal 
laboratory for inspection. (10) There was one case in which investigation was 
concluded and referred to trial by the competent court. The court, after hearing the 
case, made its judgement acquitting the accused for lack of sufficient evidence. The 
prosecutor in charge filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal. 
</p>
<p>37. The section on &#8220;Why the investigation is yet to identify the shooters?&#8221; answers that 
question in three paragraphs as follows:  
</p>
<p>(1) In all the cases there is no any eyewitness who could specifically identify the 
person who fired, whether by recognizing [t]his person, the plate number of his 
vehicle, the number of the patrol or the force commander, where regular forces were 
allegedly the shooter. What complicated the matter even more was that the police 
and security forces were moving throughout sporadic areas of Khartoum State 
according to the need for dealing with cases of violence, looting and sabotage, 
therefore, we have been encountered by a difficulty in identifying the forces 
operating in the location concerned. (2) There were about 25 casualties found in 
hospitals and mortuaries most of them had been transferred there by demonstrators 
who did not wait to be questioned. (3) There were certain cases of persons who did 
not take part in the demonstrations but were hit by stray bullets.  
</p>
<p>38. The conclusion of the report was that:  
</p>
<p>(a) The demonstrations referred to, cannot be described as peaceful protests because 
the demonstrations targeted public and private property causing damages, </p>


<p>destruction and looting incidents. (b) The intervention of the police was limited to 
the protection of the people and only where there are possible or actual damage to 
the individuals or the property of the State or the citizen and where there is a threat 
to the national security and stability in the country. (c) Accordingly, numbers of 
suspects were arrested not because of being part of the demonstrations but because 
of committing acts that constitute crimes under the Criminal Act 1991. (d) The legal 
proceedings pertaining to deceased persons are ongoing, and the Prosecutor General 
appealed to every individual who has information concerning the incidents to 
provide it to any prosecution office.2 
</p>
<p>39. During his missions to the Sudan in February and June 2014, the Independent Expert 
received representations from some of the family members of deceased victims of the 
September demonstrations, who expressed hopelessness in their quest for justice in respect 
of their deceased relatives. It is imperative that justice must be seen to be done in this case 
in order to deter arbitrary violations with impunity of the fundamental right to life. 
</p>
<p>40. After careful consideration, the Independent Expert is of the view that the report 
does not provide evidence of a thorough and independent investigation of the human rights 
violations that occurred during the September demonstrations. The finding in the report that 
it was difficult to locate any of those who shot and killed so many people in broad daylight 
during the demonstrations is unacceptable both morally and legally. While the 
Government&#8217;s report put the number of lives lost at 85, there are alternative reports from 
within the Sudan listing a higher number of deaths and injuries from gunshots during the 
demonstrations. The report gives no indication of how the shooters would be brought to 
justice or how the serious human rights violations would be redressed. Considering the high 
number of lives lost during the demonstrations and the need for accountability, it is both 
morally and legally imperative that there should be an independent judicial enquiry into the 
killings and other human rights violations that occurred during the September 2013 
demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>41. In the interest of accountability, justice, prevention of impunity and respect for 
human rights, the Independent Expert urges the Government of the Sudan to quickly 
institute an independent judicial public enquiry into the killings and other human rights 
violations that occurred during the September 2013 demonstrations in Khartoum. It is 
recommended that the public enquiry should be chaired by a retired senior Sudanese judge 
with a panel of independent experts selected from academia, civil society, forensic experts 
and other relevant professional bodies in the Sudan and a nominee each from the African 
Union and the League of Arab States as regional members of the panel.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Fatal shooting of a third-year University of Khartoum student 
</b></p>
<p>42. On 10 March 2014, Ali Abakar Musa Idris, a third-year economics student at the 
University of Khartoum, was killed by gunshot and several other people were arrested 
during a students&#8217; rally on the university campus in protest against attacks on civilians in 
Darfur. In his meeting with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Khartoum, the 
Independent Expert raised concerns and requested information about the incident. The 
Vice-Chancellor confirmed that the University had completed its investigations into the 
incident and had submitted its findings to the Sudanese police for further investigation. The 
Independent Expert urges the Government of the Sudan to ensure that the incident is fully 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 A similar report was presented by the Government of the Sudan when it was reviewed by the Human 
Rights Committee in July 2014, as part of the additional information to its fourth periodic report on 
the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  </p>


<p>investigated and its findings made public in the interest of protecting the fundamental right 
to life and ending impunity for arbitrary deprivation of lives in the country.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Meriam Ibrahim (aka Abrar al-Hadi) apostasy case 
</b>43. The case of Meriam Ibrahim (aka Abrar al-Hadi) who was convicted on allegations 
of apostasy under article 126 of the Sudanese Criminal Act (1991) by a criminal court in 
Khartoum on 15 May 2014 attracted a lot of international attention during the reporting 
period. The Independent Expert received numerous complaints about the case, which he 
raised with the Government during his mission to the Sudan in June. At his request, the 
Independent Expert was granted permission by the Government to visit Ms. Ibrahim on 
21 June in Omdurman Female Prison where she had been detained while awaiting the 
decision of the appeal lodged against her conviction. During the prison visit the 
Independent Expert had a private meeting with Ms. Ibrahim to discuss her case and 
concerns. The Independent Expert had earlier raised questions about the handling of the 
case in his meeting with the Advisory Council for Human Rights. After meeting with 
Ms. Ibrahim, he had further discussions with relevant senior government officers and 
received assurances that the judicial consideration of her appeal against her conviction 
would be expedited in the interest of justice. The conviction was subsequently overturned 
by a Court of Appeal in Khartoum on 23 June and Ms. Ibrahim was released from prison. 
The Court of Appeal&#8217;s ruling overturning the decision of the lower court in this case is 
commendable in the interest of justice from the perspective of both Islamic law and that of 
international human rights. 
</p>
<p>44. It must be recalled that in its second periodic report on its implementation of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights submitted to the Human Rights 
Committee in 1997, the Government of the Sudan had stated with reference to article 126 
of the Sudanese Criminal Act (1991) that the &#8220;Act does not make conversion from Islam an 
offence, but only the manifestation of such conversion if such manifestation adversely 
affects public safety&#8221;.3 Both the National Commission for Human Rights and the Sudanese 
Bar Association declared in their statements issued on 17 and 18 May 2014 respectively, 
that Ms. Ibrahim&#8217;s case raised important legal questions about the scope of the right to 
freedom of religion and belief in the Sudan, which needed to be re-examined. The 
Independent Expert urges the Government to review, as a matter of priority, article 126 of 
the Act in the light of its constitutional and international human rights obligations. He also 
commends, and recommends international support for, the proposal of the Sudanese Bar 
Association to organize workshops to debate the scope of article 126 of the Act in order to 
address its apparent conflict with the Sudanese Constitution and the international human 
rights obligations of the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>45. The Government has an obligation to uphold the right to freedom of religion and 
belief as guaranteed both in the Sudanese Constitution and in article 18 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of which the Sudan is a State party. The Meriam 
case highlights the need for appropriate judicial training in the Sudan especially at the 
lower bench of the judiciary, which is closer to the population. The Independent Expert 
urges the international community to help in providing the necessary technical assistance 
for appropriate training of the Sudanese judiciary in relevant human rights jurisprudence. 
</p>

<p> 3 CCPR/C/75/Add.2 of 13 March 1997, para. 127. </p>


<p><b> D. Arrests and detentions of political opponents and youth activists 
</b></p>
<p>46. On 17 May and 8 June 2014 respectively, two leading opposition political figures, 
Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of the National Umma Party, and Ibrahim al-Sheikh, leader of the 
Sudanese Congress Party, were arrested and detained by the Government for making public 
statements against attacks conducted in Darfur by the Government&#8217;s Rapid Support Force. 
The Independent Expert raised concerns about the arrest and detention of the two political 
leaders with the Government during his mission in June and requested that they should 
either be released or charged to court. Subsequently, Mr. Al-Mahdi was released on 15 June 
without charges, while Mr. Al-Sheikh and other members of the Sudanese Congress Party 
are currently still being detained. In compliance with the State&#8217;s obligation to respect and 
ensure the right to liberty and freedom of individuals, the Independent Expert urges the 
Government to release Mr. Al-Sheikh and all other political detainees forthwith or charge 
them to court if there are any legitimate charges against them. 
</p>
<p>47. Some youth activists, including Muhammad Salah, Taj Elsir Jaafar and Muammer 
Musa Muhamed, were arrested and detained by the National Intelligence and Security 
Service for months without charges. On the basis of reports received by the Independent 
Expert alleging torture of the detained youths, he requested, during his mission in June, to 
see Mr. Salah in prison to verify his condition. Regrettably, his request was refused by the 
Service. In a briefing note to the Independent Expert on 24 June, the Service alleged that 
Mr. Salah was being detained and investigated for &#8220;instigating hatred and abetting the 
breach of order and advocating for toppling the constitutional regime by use of force and 
violence&#8221;. The Independent Expert then urged the Service to either charge him to court or 
release him forthwith. The three youth activists were subsequently released on 11 July 
without any charges. The Independent Expert urges the Government to order the release of 
all other youth activists currently being detained by the Service or charge them to court if 
there are any established charges against them. 
</p>
<p>48. The fear of arbitrary arrests and detentions by the National Intelligence and Security 
Service continues to be a major cause of intimidation of political opponents and other civil 
activists in the Sudan. This creates an impediment to the full enjoyment of the right to 
liberty and security as guaranteed under article 29 of the Sudanese Constitution and article 
9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which the Sudan is a State 
party. The Independent Expert urges the Government and its security agents to desist from 
arbitrary arrests and detentions and to fully respect and ensure the right to liberty and 
freedom of individuals.  
</p>
<p><b> E. National dialogue and constitutional/political process 
</b></p>
<p>49. The President of the Sudan issued a reform document on 27 January 2014 which 
specified a four-point national agenda, focusing on: (a) peace and security &#8212; aimed at 
reaching a sustainable peace agreement with rebel groups through dialogue that would be 
incorporated in the new constitution; (b) political reforms and democratization &#8212; aimed at 
pursuing democratic reforms to ensure civil liberties; (c) economic reforms &#8212; aimed at 
poverty reduction to eliminate claims of marginalization; and (d) national identity &#8212; aimed 
at resolving the country&#8217;s identity problem and making citizenship the basis of all rights. 
This document led to the so-called &#8220;national dialogue&#8221; to move the constitutional and 
political process in the Sudan forward. 
</p>
<p>50. During the Independent Expert&#8217;s mission to the Sudan in February 2014, the 
Minister of Justice and other senior government officials stressed that the national dialogue 
and four-point agenda proposed by the President would be effectively pursued by the 
Government as a means of improving the political, social and human rights situation in the </p>


<p>country. The main opposition political parties also expressed support for the national 
dialogue, but emphasized the need for a transparent and fully inclusive process to make it 
sustainable. This raised general optimism for an open all-inclusive national dialogue 
towards finding a lasting solution to the political, social and human rights problems facing 
the country. 
</p>
<p>51. The leaders of the National Umma Party and the Sudanese Congress Party, who 
were supposed to be front-line participants in the proposed national dialogue, were 
regretfully arrested in May and June 2014 respectively. Consequently, the various 
opposition political parties and other stakeholders developed distrust of the Government&#8217;s 
proposed national dialogue. Nevertheless, it was acknowledged by most stakeholders that a 
meaningful national dialogue still needed to take place subject to necessary assurances that 
the Government would allow an enabling environment, free of intimidation, arbitrary 
arrests and detentions. Civil society organizations also requested their formal recognition 
by the Government as legitimate participants in the proposed national dialogue.  
</p>
<p>52. The Independent Expert supports the need for effective confidence-building 
measures and assurances by the Government to demonstrate its good faith in taking the 
national dialogue forward transparently. A recommended option would be to have regional 
observers from the African Union and the League of Arab States to support the national 
dialogue process. Almost all relevant stakeholders supported such a measure, when asked 
by the Independent Expert during his mission to the Sudan in June 2014.  
</p>
<p>53. Apart from registered political parties, it is also necessary to include representatives 
of armed movements, civil society organizations, academia, women and youth groups as 
formal participants in the national dialogue to ensure maximum inclusiveness of all relevant 
stakeholders. The University of Khartoum has already established a Forum for National 
Dialogue and Policies, which can contribute beneficially to the success of the national 
dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Continued curtailment of activities of civil society organizations  
</b></p>
<p>54. There is commendable commitment on the part of local civil society organizations 
towards the improvement of the human rights situation in the Sudan, but the Government&#8217;s 
curtailment of their activities remains a matter of serious concern. The Independent Expert 
received complaints of continued intimidation of civil society organizations by government 
security agents. On 24 June 2014, while winding down his second mission to the Sudan, the 
Independent Expert received information about the Government&#8217;s closure, without giving a 
reason, of Salmmah Women&#8217;s Resource Centre, a women&#8217;s civil society organization in 
Khartoum focusing on gender-related issues. Since then, the Independent Expert has 
received expressions of concern from other organizations in the Sudan who are 
apprehensive of also being closed down by the Government for their work on the 
promotion of women&#8217;s rights in the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>55. The promotion of women&#8217;s rights is one of the most important aspects of human 
rights globally today, so civil society organizations working on the promotion of women&#8217;s 
rights should be protected and encouraged by the State rather than being restricted. It would 
be difficult for civil society organizations to operate under intimidating conditions and 
apprehension. The Independent Expert reiterates his call on the Government to grant civil 
society organizations the necessary space to operate legitimately and to ensure that its 
security agents stop curtailing the legitimate activities of civil society organizations in the 
country. </p>


<p><b> G. Continued press censorship 
</b></p>
<p>56. Direct closure of newspaper houses by government security agents declined 
relatively during the reporting period. It was confirmed that only one newspaper, <i>Al-Sayha</i>, 
remained suspended as at June 2014. The Independent Expert raised this with the National 
Intelligence and Security Service during his mission in June and the suspension was 
subsequently lifted on 23 June.  
</p>
<p>57. The Sudanese Constitutional Court declared in March 2014 that a National 
Intelligence and Security Service order that had suspended the <i>Al-Tayyar</i> newspaper since 
June 2012 was illegal, and thus revoked the order. In the same month, the Sudanese Court 
of Intellectual Property acquitted a reporter from the <i>Al-Sudani</i> newspaper on charges of 
&#8220;harming the morale of the armed forces&#8221;, brought against him for critiquing activities of 
the Sudanese Armed Forces in a newspaper article. 
</p>
<p>58. Despite those commendable judicial decisions, post-publication censorship 
continued unabated and government security agents seized printed newspapers for allegedly 
crossing publication &#8220;red lines&#8221; set by the National Intelligence and Security Service. 
Between March and June 2014 printed editions of different newspapers, such as <i>The 
Citizen</i>, <i>Al-Hurra</i>, <i>Al-Sudani</i>, <i>Al-Watan</i>, <i>Al-Youm Al-Tali</i>, <i>Al-Jareeda</i> and <i>Al-Aswaq</i>, were 
confiscated by government security agents without them stating specific reasons. Also, 
some journalists have been banned permanently by the Service from writing. Such press 
censorship continues to create fear of arrest for journalists and publishers, which 
consequently impedes on press freedom and the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
in the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>59. As the guarantee of press freedom is essential for facilitating the national dialogue 
proposed by the Government, the Independent Expert urges the Government to ensure that 
its security agents stop press intimidation to enable a conducive environment for the 
national dialogue and ensure a vibrant constitutional and political process for the country. 
</p>
<p><b> H. National Security Act of 2010 
</b></p>
<p>60. The National Security Act of 2010 continues to be an enabling legislation for the 
National Intelligence and Security Service to encroach on civil and political rights in the 
Sudan. The Act empowers security officers to detain individuals for a maximum period of 
four and half months without judicial authority,4 which is often used to justify the detention 
of individuals by the Service. To ensure that the Service operates in compliance with the 
human rights obligations of the Sudan, the Government should either revoke or amend the 
Act to bring it into conformity with the country&#8217;s constitutional and international human 
rights obligations.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Escalation of armed conflicts and increase in civilian displacements 
</b></p>
<p>61. There was a significant upsurge in armed conflicts perpetrated by both State and 
non-State actors in the conflict areas during the reporting period, leading to further 
displacement of civilians in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile States, particularly 
between February and June 2014. This contributed to the deterioration of the humanitarian 
and human rights situation in conflict areas. The activities of rebel movements and the 
response of government forces, particularly the Rapid Support Force, led to many human 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 See National Security Act (2010), art. 50, para. 1 (c), (f), (g) and (h). </p>


<p>rights violations in those States, including killings, sexual and gender-based violence, 
rampaging of villages as well as destruction of property.5 UNAMID reported large-scale 
attacks by the Rapid Support Force on armed groups and villages in South and North 
Darfur States in February and March. There were continued reports of aerial bombings by 
the Sudanese Air Force in the conflict areas and of their consequential adverse impact on 
the civilian population in those areas. There were reports of civilians killed from such aerial 
bombings in Draib Al Reih and Um Gunya in South Darfur in February, in Uzban village 
East of El-Daein in Blue Nile State on 15 March and in Thabit in North Darfur on 28 April. 
A hospital run by M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res in the village of Farandalla in South Kordofan 
was bombed by the Air Force on 16 June. Such indiscriminate aerial strikes, which are a 
clear violation of the basic principles of international human rights and humanitarian law, 
must stop.  
</p>
<p>62. The trajectory of the armed conflicts has been at three interconnected levels: tribal 
violence over land and natural resources, attacks by armed movements against government 
positions and vice versa, and aerial bombardments of areas under rebel control by the 
Sudanese Air Force. All that led to the destruction of life and property and seriously 
undermined the security of civilians during the reporting period, particularly in different 
parts of Darfur and South Kordofan. The upsurge in conflict in the Darfur region generated 
an estimated 250,000 new civilian IDPs between February and April 2014, which was 
higher than the total number of IDPs for 2011 and 2012. The total number of IDPs in 
Darfur was estimated at over 2 million in April 2014.6 
</p>
<p>63. In Darfur, there were reported rebel attacks on UNAMID peacekeeping forces and 
carjacking of UNAMID vehicles during the reporting period, as well as robberies and 
attacks on humanitarian agencies such as the World Food Programme. 
</p>
<p>64. The Independent Expert emphasized the need for proportionality and respect for 
humanitarian and human rights principles in the Government&#8217;s engagements with rebel 
forces. He also had discussions with the Chairman of the Darfur Regional Authority on 
efforts to encourage the non-signatory armed movements to join the peace process. The 
Independent Expert commends the Authority&#8217;s efforts and the instrumental role of the Head 
of UNAMID in mediating with non-signatory armed movements to broker a solution that 
will bring lasting peace to Darfur. He also met with the tribal leaders in South Kordofan 
who emphasized that the use of traditional peace settlement mechanisms and adequate 
consultation with tribal leaders was an important factor for success in the peace initiatives. 
The Independent Expert&#8217;s efforts to meet with representatives of some of the armed 
movements during the reporting period were unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>65. It is imperative to intensify efforts towards ending the armed conflicts in the Sudan, 
which are a major cause of human rights violations. The Government&#8217;s effort to set up 
social peace workshops across the five States in Darfur aimed at culminating in a Social 
Peace Conference in November is commendable in that regard. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Violence against women and children 
</b></p>
<p>66. Although the Unit for Combating Violence against Women and Children as well as 
the Family and Child Protection Unit of the Sudanese police force are doing very good 
work, the problem of violence against women and children remains of grave concern, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See Report of the Secretary-General on the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in 
Darfur (S/2014/279 of 15 April 2014), paras. 7&#8211;11. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6 Ibid., para. 14.  </p>


<p>especially in the conflict areas. During the reporting period, there were incidents of sexual 
and gender-based violence including rape, mainly targeting IDPs in conflict-affected areas. 
Among cases reported was the shooting and killing of five women including a minor 
following a failed attempted rape, while the victims were fleeing the attacks on Hajer and 
surrounding villages in South Darfur in February 2014. In addition, on 9 April a United 
Nations peacekeeper was gang-raped in El-Fasher, North Darfur. Four suspects were 
arrested and charged to court.  
</p>
<p>67. There is increased reluctance on the part of victims to formally report incidents of 
sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, for fear of social stigma or reprisals and 
also due to the absence of government security forces in some localities where those crimes 
are prevalent. There are no government police forces in Kalma IDP camp (South Darfur), 
Abusurug (West Darfur), and Korma, Saraf Omra and Tawilla (North Darfur), which 
fosters a culture of impunity for such crimes in those areas. UNAMID has made 
commendable efforts to provide training and capacity-building to civil society groups and 
IDPs on the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence and referral pathways, as well 
as to collaborate with relevant government departments on addressing information-sharing 
gaps on the problem. 
</p>
<p>68. The Independent Expert urges the Government to establish effective security and 
police presence in the areas where sexual and gender-based violence is prevalent. He also 
urges the international community to help with technical assistance and capacity-building to 
strengthen community policing and enhance the protection of women and children in the 
conflict areas. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Humanitarian access and Government&#8217;s suspension of the activities of 
the International Committee of the Red Cross 
</b></p>
<p>69. While the Humanitarian Affairs Commission claims its coordination of 
humanitarian aid has improved significantly, the question of timeliness and unhindered 
access continues to be raised by different humanitarian agencies. It is reported that 
humanitarian access to Jebel Marra areas (North Darfur) remains problematic, and that 
Adillah and Abu Karina localities (East Darfur) have not been reached since August 2013. 
The Commission needs to look into these access problems and allow humanitarian 
protection activities in these areas.  
</p>
<p>70. Due to non-access to areas under the control of armed movements since 2011, it is 
estimated that 160,000 children under the age of 5 have not received necessary routine 
immunization in South Kordofan and Blue Nile States, leaving them at risk of contracting 
polio and other vaccine preventable diseases. The Independent Expert joins the call made 
by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund to the Government of the Sudan and the armed 
movements to allow vaccination access to the conflict areas to save children from 
preventable diseases. 
</p>
<p>71. Since 1 February 2014 the Government has suspended the activities of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the Sudan for &#8220;technical and 
administrative reasons&#8221;. Being a neutral humanitarian agency with unique experience in 
assisting victims in situations of conflicts and natural disasters, ICRC is indispensable in 
providing humanitarian assistance particularly to civilians in rebel-controlled areas of 
conflict. The Independent Expert discussed the suspension of ICRC activities with the 
Director of the Humanitarian Affairs Commission and was assured that the issue was being 
looked into with ICRC to find a quick resolution to it. The suspension of ICRC activities in 
the Sudan has resulted in humanitarian deficits in the face of the effect of the escalation of 
the conflict on civilians, as highlighted in paragraphs 61 to 70 above. The Independent </p>


<p>Expert urges the Government to lift the suspension on ICRC activities so that it can resume 
its humanitarian services in the country without further delay. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Ministry of Welfare and Social Security of the Sudan is doing very good work 
in pursuance of its mandate to reduce poverty and provide welfare for the people, especially 
through its Zakat Chambers and other initiatives for the economic empowerment of women, 
the disabled and the very poor. Nevertheless, poverty continues to be an issue of concern, 
especially for IDPs in conflict-affected areas. There are noticeable inequalities in terms of 
access to education, sanitation, clean water and a wide gap in income opportunities between 
people living in rural settings and those in urban settings. People in rural settings 
continually complained about their limited access to basic needs and services as well as 
their limited ability to provide for themselves and their families.  
</p>
<p>73. Based on academic research linking deprivation of economic, social and cultural 
rights to escalation of conflict,7 it is important that the problem be addressed. With regard 
to Darfur, there is a need for the effective and timely implementation of the development 
projects under the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, which are currently hampered by 
the financial constraints and limited technical capacity of the Darfur Regional Authority. 
Effective implementation of the grass-roots development projects under the Doha 
Document would go a long way to alleviate poverty and improve the situation of economic, 
social and cultural rights in the Darfur region.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Technical assistance and capacity-building  
</b></p>
<p>74. During the reporting period, UNAMID and UNDP provided different forms of 
technical assistance and capacity-building to government institutions such as the police, the 
justice sector, the legislature, the Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission, as well as 
civil society organizations in different parts of the Sudan. In view of the subsisting human 
rights challenges, there is a need for continued technical assistance and capacity-building 
for the different institutions and civil society organizations in the country. 
</p>
<p>75. It is necessary to continue strengthening and working with relevant institutions such 
as: the Advisory Council for Human Rights; the National Commission for Human Rights; 
the Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly; the Unit for Combating Violence 
against Women and Children; the National Council for Child Welfare; the Family and 
Child Protection Unit of the Police Force; the Women&#8217;s Centre for Human Rights in the 
Ministry of Welfare and Social Security; the Committee on Human Rights Education in the 
Ministry of Education; the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Crimes in Darfur; the 
judiciary &#8212; including the Constitutional Court; the police; the Truth, Justice and 
Reconciliation Commission; the Commission for Refugees, as well as the different local

</p>
<p>76. In view of the important role of peace in the realization of practical improvements to

<p>over the next three years to support local peace processes in the conflict areas of the Sudan. 
The European Union has also budgeted one million euros to be spent in 2014 under the 
European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights project to support, inter alia, 
capacity-building for local civil society organizations in promoting human rights and 
democratic reform in the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>77. The Independent Expert encourages other donor States, international institutions and 
agencies to assist the Government of the Sudan as well as national and local civil society 
organizations, with the technical assistance and capacity-building needed to address the 
subsisting human rights challenges in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>78. <b>Within the reporting period, the Government of the Sudan has sustained its 
efforts in respect of policies aimed at improving the situation of human rights in the 
country, but the effective and practical implementation of those policies on the ground 
still remains protracted. This report has evidently identified that major human rights 
challenges still persist, and the Government of the Sudan must take practical steps to 
redress them. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Despite the subsisting human rights challenges in the Sudan, the situation is not 
totally bleak as the Government&#8217;s human rights policy orientation has relatively 
improved over the past two years. The mandate of the Independent Expert is 
therefore making an impact and the international community should continue 
engaging with and supporting the Sudan towards realizing the practical improvement 
of its human rights situation. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>On the basis of the appraisal and candid assessment of the subsisting human 
rights challenges in the Sudan during this reporting period, the Independent Expert 
makes the following recommendations.
