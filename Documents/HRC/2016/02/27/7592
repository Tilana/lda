<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 20/1, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to organize, in close cooperation 
with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
consultations with States, intergovernmental bodies and civil society organizations to 
further discuss the draft basic principles on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked 
persons , and to submit a summary thereon to the Council at its twenty-sixth session. 
Resolution 20/1 came as a positive response to the report presented by the Special 
Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council at its seventeenth session,1 in which she examined 
the conceptual basis of the right to an effective remedy in the context of trafficking in 
persons, and made recommendations on how States could better fulfil their obligations. The 
Special Rapporteur submitted the draft basic principles in an annex to the report with the 
aim of providing Member States with useful guidance in operationalizing the right to an 
effective remedy for victims of trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>2. OHCHR and the Special Rapporteur convened the following regional consultations: 
for Western Europe and Others and Eastern Europe, in Geneva in March 2013); for Latin 
America and the Caribbean, in Santiago, in July 2013; for Asia, in Bangkok ,in September 
2013; for Africa, in Abuja, in November 2013; and for the Middle East and North Africa, in 
Amman, in January 2014. They also organized two global consultations &#8211; in New York and 
in Vienna, in October and November 2013 &#8211; to engage with Member States, 
intergovernmental organizations, experts and non-governmental actors and to solicit 
suggestions and input for the draft basic principles (see annex).2 
</p><p>3. The basic principles represent the culmination of the focus and work of the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to an effective remedy for victims of trafficking. She has 
consistently highlighted the fact that effective remedies are often not accessible to victims 
of trafficking owing to a gap between the enactment and implementation of national laws 
and international standards. The lack of adequate and comprehensive remedies for victims 
of trafficking persists despite their crucial role in ensuring the restoration of victims&#8217; human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>4. At the consultations, the Special Rapporteur stressed that, in order to realize fully 
victims&#8217; rights to effective remedies, States had to meet both substantive and procedural 
obligations. International human rights standards clearly provide that States have an 
obligation to provide for remedies to victims of gross violations of international human 
rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including by ensuring 
equal and effective access to justice and prompt and adequate reparation for any harm 
suffered. Remedies include restitution, rehabilitation, compensation, satisfaction and 
guarantees of non-repetition.3 The procedural obligations may be conceived as the range of 
measures needed to guarantee access to an effective remedy. Consequently, discussions 
were structured around this dual track of obligations.

  See the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of 
</p>
<p>  Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
  Humanitarian Law. </p>


<p><b> II. International legal framework of the right to an effective 
remedy  
</b></p>
<p>5. The right to an effective remedy for victims of human rights violations is recognized 
under several major international human rights instruments. In the case of victims of 
trafficking, the obligation to provide remedies stems from the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (the 
Palermo Protocol). Articles 2, 6, 7 and 9 of the Protocol highlight the role of the State in 
ensuring that victims are treated with full respect for their human rights and offered a 
comprehensive range of remedies. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women recognizes trafficking as a human rights violation and 
therefore sets State obligations in this regard (art. 6). The Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking4 refer to access to remedies, while 
the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims 
of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law elaborate on the various forms of reparations, including 
restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. 
</p>
<p>6. Alongside provisions that directly address trafficking in persons, other instruments 
address the rights of victims of human right violations, such as article 2 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and various conventions 
of the International Labour Organization (ILO), in particular ILO conventions 181 and 189.  
</p><p>7. According to the presentations made on the international legal framework at the 
various consultations, under international law, the duty of the States to provide remedies is 
invoked in three particular circumstances: 
</p>
<p>(a) In the case of violations that are the result of an act of or omission by a State 
actor;  
</p>
<p>(b) In the case of violations that are committed by non-State actors but with the 
acquiescence, collaboration, knowledge or acknowledgment of the State;  
</p>
<p>(c) In the event of failure by the State to exercise due diligence to prevent, 
investigate or prosecute a violation by private actors.5  
</p>
<p>In the case of trafficking in persons, the responsibility of the State to provide remedies 
always arises and should be extended to all individuals, whether citizens or non-citizens, 
under its jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Regional frameworks and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>8. Different regions have developed legal frameworks and policy initiatives that 
reaffirm the right to remedy codified in international human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>9. In its articles 12 to 16, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings contains comprehensive provisions with regard to effective 
remedies for victims. Article 12 enshrines the obligation of Member States to secure 
</p>
<p>

  E/2002/68/Add. 1.

</p>
<p>5 See also Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 
(A/56/10), para. 77.  </p>


<p>shelter, medical and material assistance and counselling, while article 15 requires States to 
provide victims with free legal aid. The Convention is the only international legally binding 
instrument that contains an obligation to grant a minimum recovery period of 30 days. 
Article 15 of the Convention also calls upon States to guarantee compensation for victims 
in their national laws, while article 29 calls upon them to create anti-trafficking in persons 
coordinating mechanisms involving all relevant public bodies and civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>10. In its article 25, the American Convention on Human Rights, to which 23 States of 
the Americas are parties, provides an important base for the protection of victims of human 
rights abuse. In 2010, the Organization of American States adopted the Work Plan against 
Trafficking in Persons in the Western Hemisphere, a non-binding document that sets 
guidelines to help States to fulfil their obligation to provide victims with restitution, 
recovery (rehabilitation), compensation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. 
</p><p>11. In the Asia region, several important initiatives ensure the right to an effective 
remedy. The human rights mechanisms of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) include the anti-trafficking initiatives conducted by means of the Commission on 
the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children and the Criminal 
Justice Responses to Trafficking in Persons: ASEAN Practitioner Guidelines (2007). 
ASEAN has also developed a set of guidelines for the protection of the rights of trafficked 
children. Moreover, the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and 
Related Transnational Crime has promoted efforts to combat trafficking, including through 
workshops, seminars and meetings for technical experts, government officials and civil 
society organizations on the ratification and implementation of the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.  
</p>
<p>12. In the Africa region, the human rights instruments of the African Union, such as the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Protocol to the African Charter on the 
Rights of Women in Africa and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, 
guarantee individuals and peoples&#8217; rights and impose correlating duties, including specific 
forms of protection for women and children from forced labour, sexual exploitation and 
abuse, sale, trafficking and abduction, as well as remedies for redress in the event of human 
rights violations. In 2006, the African Union adopted the Ouagadougou Action Plan to 
Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children, which is part of 
the African Union Commission&#8217;s Initiative against Trafficking Campaign aimed at 
enhancing the joint efforts of the African Union and the European Union to fight 
trafficking. At the subregional level, the Economic Community of West African States has 
also made efforts to address trafficking, including through the establishment of an anti-
trafficking unit, and the development in 2009 of the Policy on Protection and Assistance to 
Victims of Human Trafficking in West Africa. 
</p>
<p>13. In the Middle East and North Africa region, the League of Arab States has addressed 
the issue of human trafficking in three conventions: in (a) a treaty on combating 
transnational organized crime (2012); (b) a convention on combating cybercrimes (2010); 
and (c) the Arab Charter on Human Rights (2004). Although the Arab Charter on Human 
Rights does not refer explicitly to the protection of and assistance to victims of trafficking, 
it does provide for the right to seek legal remedy (art. 12) and the right to compensation 
(arts. 8 (2), 14 (7) and 19 (2)), and requires States parties to ensure effective remedies for 
any person whose rights or freedoms have been violated. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Common trends and issues 
</b>14. In all consultations, there was general agreement that effective remedies remained 
largely inaccessible, despite the existence of international and regional frameworks. The </p>


<p>main obstacles identified included poor implementation and interpretation of existing 
national legal frameworks, limited resources, capacities and infrastructure dedicated to the 
issue, and also gaps in identification and the tendency to criminalize victims, coupled with 
restrictive immigration policies.  
</p>
<p>15. During discussions on the substantive components of the right to an effective 
remedy, Member States and stakeholders highlighted the importance of a victim-centred 
and human rights-based approach, as well as the need to develop holistic, comprehensive 
and integrated services for victims of trafficking. Discussions on compensation triggered 
questions on and requests for a better conceptual definition of compensation and 
identification of channels through which victims can obtain compensation, delineating the 
responsibilities of both State and non-State actors while taking the specificities of judicial 
systems (common law as against the civil law system) into consideration.  
</p><p>16. With regard to the procedural components of the right to a remedy, participants 
highlighted the fact that citizenship and residency status should not be determining factors 
in the provision of assistance, and that States must move from a national security approach 
to a human rights- and victim-centred perspective to combat trafficking. Greater security 
and protection must be systematically offered to victims of trafficking so that they may 
have access to redress and recovery, through non-criminalization, the granting of 
unconditional assistance, the provision of temporary residence status and subsistence 
support. Some also stressed that the realization of procedural preconditions depended 
heavily on the capacity-building and training of all relevant stakeholders, including law 
enforcements agents and legal practitioners, as well as social services providers and civil 
society partners.  
</p>
<p>17. Another common theme that emerged during the consultations was the importance 
of cooperation and partnership at both the national and international levels with regard to 
mutual legal assistance and victim care. It was stressed that, at the national level, 
cooperation between Governments and non-governmental organizations was vital in the 
identification of victims and the implementation of recovery, rehabilitation and 
reintegration measures. At the same time, cross-border cooperation between States was also 
identified as necessary to ensure redress through mutual legal assistance in investigations 
and prosecutions, safe repatriation, guarantees of non-repetition and compensation of 
victims by means of joint efforts in tackling the root causes of vulnerability in countries of 
origin.  
</p>
<p>18. Member States referred to the ongoing challenges in prosecuting trafficking offences 
and the high degree of impunity for such violations, and requested guidance in reconciling 
the right to an effective remedy, including unconditional support for victims, with the 
effective prosecution of traffickers, which is possible only with the cooperation of victims.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Substantive components of the right to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Restitution and recovery (rehabilitation) 
</b>19. The aim of restitution was outlined at different consultations; it was suggested that 
the concept of the&#8220;best interest of the trafficked person&#8221; should be clearly defined to avoid 
different interpretations.  
</p>
<p>20. The non-obligatory nature of recovery in the Palermo Protocol was identified as an 
obstacle to the effective realization of the right to restitution and recovery, since it generally 
uses exhortative rather than prescriptive language with regard to provisions on victims&#8217; 
rights. </p>


<p>21. A recurring recommendation in all consultations was the provision of a non-
conditional reflection period during which victims of trafficking would be assisted in their 
physical, psychological and social recovery through the provision of essential services, such 
as adequate shelter; counselling and information about their situation and legal rights in a 
language that they understand; medical, psychological and material assistance; and 
employment, educational and training opportunities. The reflection period was described as 
being essential for victims to overcome psychological and physical trauma and to gain 
enough confidence to engage in legal proceedings, if they so wished. In order to achieve 
restitution and rehabilitation, suggestions were made to establish and strengthen 
multidisciplinary anti-trafficking coordinating committees, one-stop centres offering a 
comprehensive range of services, funds for victim compensation, exemption from court 
fees, and legal counselling.  
</p>
<p>22. Safe repatriation was also identified as a form of restitution that is preferred by a 
large number of identified victims. It should be provided by countries of destination and 
origin alike, unless not in the best interests of the victim, when it could lead to reprisals or 
further human rights violations. In this regard, it was underlined that States should increase 
their efforts to provide victims with appropriate residence status as a form of remedy. One 
major obstacle to this aspect of restitution was identified as differing domestic requirements 
for granting such residency permits. Suggestions were however made to inscribe these 
measures within the obligation of the State to provide humanitarian protection for 
individuals in a position of vulnerability, as requested in article 7 of the Palermo Protocol. 
</p>
<p>23. Participants also pointed out that another major obstacle to achieving effective 
restitution was the practice in many States whereby assistance, including the granting of 
residency permits, is dependant on the cooperation of the victim in legal proceedings; to be 
effective, however, assistance should be unconditional and accessible to all victims. 
</p>
<p>24. The need to take into due consideration the diverse backgrounds, experiences, 
traditions and cultures of victims was also flagged as being vital when restoring what has 
been lost by victims, ensuring that they are not subjected to discriminatory treatment in law 
or in practice, and also ensuring that the individual circumstances of victims are taken duly 
into account. 
</p>
<p>25. Addressing the root causes of trafficking in the long term was underlined as an 
important aspect of restitution to ensure that victims of trafficking in persons were not 
returned to their pre-existing positions or put at risk of being re-trafficked. This included 
eradicating poverty, combating discrimination and gender-based discrimination and 
violence, and enhancing the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>26. It was noted that reintegration could comprise vocational placement, support for 
parents for child care, and micro grants to victims. These reintegration efforts could help to 
empower victims, address stigma, reduce vulnerability and allow victims to readjust to their 
communities of origin. It was suggested that, for effective reintegration in the country of 
origin, it is necessary to inform victims about work opportunities in their home countries in 
order to reduce the incidence of re-trafficking. Another recommendation was that long-term 
support programmes be secured so that victims may still have access to socio-psychological 
support well after completing reintegration. Rehabilitation programmes should also contain, 
when appropriate, elements of family mediation in the event that the victim is returning to 
the community of origin.  
</p>
<p>27. Non-governmental organizations were also recognized as key partners in realizing 
rehabilitation through reintegration, given that they can readily gather information on the 
victim&#8217;s family and social context and actively follow up on the victim&#8217;s situation over 
time. Rehabilitation was also recognized as a key factor in empowering victims so that they </p>


<p>are able to reintegrate into communities and act as advocates to prevent future trafficking of 
others from their communities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>28. Compensation was widely recognized as an important element of the right to 
effective remedies for victims of trafficking but lacking. Numerous elements of 
compensation were identified, including wages from uncompensated or undercompensated 
labour, the cost of physical and psychological medical treatment, and recognizing the moral 
and emotional harm inflicted, together with collateral harm committed by the State, such as 
re-victimization. 
</p>
<p>29. Participants in the consultations underlined the fact that access to compensation 
remains limited owing to, inter alia, not only the lengthy judicial processes involving both 
criminal and civil proceedings but also the exclusion of victims with an irregular 
immigration status and victims of sex exploitation from having access to civil recourse to 
seek compensation for unpaid wages. Some also pointed out that victims of commercial 
sexual exploitation had great difficulty in obtaining financial compensation owing to 
stigmatization,. Economic inequalities and gender-based discrimination were identified as 
factors disproportionately affecting the ability of women victims to recover lost wages. 
</p>
<p>30. The widespread obstacle of insufficient funds allocated to supporting victims of 
trafficking was also underlined. Participants stressed that, in addition to the establishment 
of victims&#8217; funds, a State-funded compensation scheme could be an important restitution 
mechanism and an effective means for the provision of compensation. Concerns were 
nonetheless expressed with regard to generating and managing fund resources. Participants 
stressed the need to unify the scheme for the confiscation of proceeds from crimes, stating 
that proceeds should go directly towards support for victims, while a specific proportion of 
proceeds should be allocated to compensation. While appreciating that each State may have 
its own strategy for implementation, participants noted that a consensus on generally 
accepted standards for compensation and assistance for victims was needed. In this regard, 
it was also suggested that resources for victims&#8217; funds should not solely result from the 
seizure and forfeiture of traffickers&#8217; assets, but rather that States should develop alternative 
means to raise funds for victim support and compensation.  
</p>
<p>31. It was suggested that compensation should be considered an important means of 
combating trafficking that serves restorative, punitive and preventive purposes, insofar as it 
provides victims with the financial autonomy necessary to escape from situations of 
vulnerability and from the risk of being re-victimized. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Procedural preconditions in realizing the right to effective 
remedies  
</b></p>
<p>32. Participants in the consultations generally agreed that victims of trafficking had not 
had access to the substantive components of the right to an effective remedy, mainly 
because they are hardly ever identified. Victim identification is the first precondition for 
realizing the right to remedy. Besides the matter of identification, the issue of 
criminalization relating to the victim&#8217;s immigration status was also widely recognized as a 
major obstacle in the access to effective remedies. Moreover, capacity gaps were described 
as an important factor that affectsed both the identification and the provision of adequate 
support services.  </p>


<p>33. The Special Rapporteur emphasized the need for victims to receive information on 
their right to obtain remedies, and pointed out that the availability of adequate information 
remained a challenge, given that free legal aid was often not available in many countries, 
while language often constituted a barrier in victims&#8217; access to information. In the regional 
discussions, participants also emphasized that resources and capacities were still broadly 
insufficient to cater for victims of trafficking adequately. The limited knowledge of 
prosecutors and judges about trafficking issues was identified as a major obstacle. Capacity 
gaps were also identified as an impediment to the proper prosecution of trafficking offences 
and the awarding of compensation to victims. In this regard, the need for increased 
capacity-building efforts and technical cooperation was stressed in all discussions.  
</p>
<p>34. According to participants, restrictive immigration policies were a major impediment 
in the access to remedies, because many States imposed eligibility criteria for assistance 
that often extended to citizenship or immigration status; victims of trafficking were 
therefore frequently indirectly denied justice, because they were misidentified and 
criminalized as irregular migrants. As a result, they were not given adequate assistance and 
protection, but rather faced arrest, detention, deportation or charges for immigration-related 
offences, solicitation of prostitution, engagement in irregular work or forgery of identity 
documents, thus leaving them without any opportunity to seek redress or compensation. 
Such restrictive policies also favour the insidious nature of trafficking, as victims are too 
fearful to report to the authorities. Participants stressed that, although the principle of non-
criminalization was not reflected in the Palermo Protocol, it was an important issue that had 
to be taken into full consideration when implementing anti-trafficking policies. Other 
factors that discouraged victims from approaching the authorities included the fear of 
retribution, social stigma and the possibility of re-traumatization during legal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur recommended that victims be provided with residency status 
in the country of destination for the duration of their period of reflection, criminal, civil or 
administrative proceedings, or even longer if return is not in the best interest of the victim. 
In this regard, the issue of victims of trafficking from populations in an emergency or crisis, 
such as refugees and displaced persons, was raised, in particular during one consultation; 
some participants requested that refugee status or permanent relocation to third countries be 
granted to victims in need of international humanitarian protection.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Special considerations for trafficked children  
</b>36. It was widely recognized that children should be offered special protection and 
rehabilitation as victims of trafficking, or as minors under the care of parents or guardians 
who are themselves victims of trafficking. In this context, the vulnerability of children and 
their legal status should be at the centre of measures developed to cater for this category of 
victims.  
</p>
<p>37. Participants recognized that children were especially vulnerable to intimidation by 
traffickers and to the social stigma that can accompany trafficking in persons. These factors 
should be taken into consideration in the development and implementation of restitution 
initiatives. A longer period of reflection for child victims was recommended, as it is 
important to ensure their informed consent through access to information in a medium 
accessible and appropriate for them. With regard to compensation, a suggestion was made 
that any compensation awarded to child victims should remain partially under the control of 
the State so that it may be used by the victims once they reach the age of majority in order 
to give them an opportunity to build their future. 
</p>
<p>38. Specific recommendations were made with regard to the protection of child victims, 
including extending immigration relief to members of the immediate family of victims, the </p>


<p>provision of support to parents for child care, access to school and the introduction of free 
and compulsory basic education programmes as part of rehabilitation and reintegration 
initiatives. Participants also stressed that, in cases of voluntary repatriation, it was vital to 
ensure safe return by monitoring and evaluating the victim&#8217;s environment of origin, and 
also to ensure that the family was not a direct actor in the trafficking of the child.  
</p>
<p>39. Participants in the consultations further highlighted the fact that greater awareness of 
existing gender biases was needed in the rescue and rehabilitation of girl child victims. 
They pointed out that girls trafficked for sex work often did not receive sufficient attention 
or care from social workers, and that their cases had often been handled as cases of juvenile 
delinquency rather than of victims of human rights violations. Proposed ways to counter 
such biases included giving equal weight to the testimonies of women and girls and the 
sustained fight against biases and inequalities, which foster the vulnerability of female 
victims. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Revision process  
</b></p>
<p>40. The draft basic principles were revised on the basis of existing international human 
rights law and standards, as well as oral inputs and some 30 written submissions received 
during the consultative process from a large range of stakeholders, including Member 
States, experts, participants, inter-governmental bodies and organizations and civil society. 
While a more detailed explanatory note on the revision process is forthcoming, some of the 
key changes are summarized below.  
</p>
<p>41. The term &#8220;trafficked persons&#8221; was replaced with &#8220;victims of trafficking in persons&#8221;, 
for the sake of consistency with the scope of the right to remedy under international law, 
such as when a right to remedy is due to the family of a deceased victim of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>42. In response to requests by States for greater clarity on when international law 
mandates the right to remedy, section I (rights and obligations) clarifies the obligation of 
the State to provide a right to remedy &#8211; including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation 
and recovery, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition &#8211; when it commits an 
internationally wrongful act, meaning either that the harm is attributed to the State or it has 
failed to exercise due diligence. States have also an international obligation to provide 
and/or facilitate remedies if mandated by binding international law, such as in the treaties to 
which it is party. These obligations exist independently of any finding of State 
responsibility for the original harm and include, for example, the obligation of States parties 
to provide the possibility of compensation under article 6 (6) of the Palermo Protocol.  
</p><p>43. In response to a number of submissions, the basic principles also emphasize the 
importance of bilateral and multilateral State cooperation, enabling States thereby to meet 
their obligations on the right to a remedy, as well as of the principle of non-refoulement and 
access to asylum procedures as components of the right to an effective remedy.  
</p>
<p>44. Section II (on access to the right to a remedy) defines other procedural elements of 
the right to remedy and, in response to the submissions received, further clarifies areas such 
as the nature of assistance necessary for access to remedies, the scope of the reflection and 
recovery period, and ensuring equal access to the right to remedy, including through 
gender-sensitive mechanisms. The principle of non-punishment of victims of trafficking in 
persons and the rights to safety, privacy and confidentiality were also added as a result of 
the consultative process.  
</p>
<p>45. Section III (on forms of the right to remedy) addresses the substantive elements of 
the right to remedy, and now incorporates international law definitions of each of the forms 
of the right to remedy, further detail on operationalizing the remedies of restitution, </p>


<p>compensation, rehabilitation and recovery, and new paragraphs on the remedies of 
satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition.

<p><b> IX. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>47.<b> The Office of the High Commissioner thanks the Special Rapporteur on 
Trafficking in persons for the fruitful collaboration in convening and organizing the 
regional consultations, in fulfilment of the mandate provided by Human Rights 
Council resolution 20/1.  
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> In the light of the interest raised among Member States and the numerous 
inputs received during the consultation process, OHCHR welcomes the basic 
principles and encourages the Human Rights Council to consider endorsing them with 
a view to Member States incorporating the principles into their domestic legal 
framework so that these can become a living tool for practitioners in their daily anti-
trafficking work. </b></p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Basic principles on the right to an effective remedy for 
victims of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Rights and obligations 
</b></p>
<p>1. Victims of trafficking in persons, as victims of human rights violations, have the 
right to an effective remedy for any harm committed against them.  
</p>
<p>2. All States, including countries of origin, transit and destination, shall provide 
adequate, effective and prompt remedies to victims of trafficking in persons, including non-
citizens, within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction, when the State is legally 
responsible for any harm committed against them; this includes when harm is attributable to 
the State or when the State has failed to exercise due diligence to prevent trafficking, to 
investigate and prosecute traffickers, and to assist and protect victims of trafficking in 
persons. The right to effective remedy includes restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, 
satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. 
</p>
<p>3. Regardless of whether a State is responsible for the original harm, the State shall 
provide and/or facilitate access to remedies as required by binding international law, 
including anti-trafficking instruments and international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>4. The right to an effective remedy shall be provided to victims of trafficking in 
persons without discrimination in law or in practice on any ground, such as race, colour, 
sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
disability, birth or other status, including their age, their immigration status, their status as 
victims of trafficking in persons, their occupation or the types of exploitation to which they 
have been subjected.  
</p><p>5. The right to an effective remedy encompasses both the substantive right to remedies 
and the procedural rights necessary to secure access to them. The right to an effective 
remedy reflects a victim-centred and human rights-based approach that empowers victims 
of trafficking in persons and respects fully their human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. Bilateral and multilateral State cooperation is an important means enabling States to 
meet their obligations with regard to the right to an effective remedy for victims of 
trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Access to the right to a remedy 
</b></p>
<p>7. Whether States are legally responsible for harm or otherwise have an obligation to 
provide and/or facilitate access to remedies under international law, procedural rights and 
preconditions for remedies include that victims of trafficking in persons: 
</p>
<p>(a) Have a legally enforceable right to have access to 
remedies, including through criminal, civil, labour or 
administrative proceedings, irrespective of the victim&#8217;s 
immigration status, return to his or her country of origin or 
absence from the jurisdiction. This includes the right of victims 
of trafficking in persons to have effective access to asylum 
procedures; </p>


<p>(b) Are promptly and accurately identified, including through adequate 
procedures and appropriate training for State officials and cooperation between relevant 
authorities and non-governmental organizations;

presumed victims, with access to such services as housing and psychological, medical,

any residence status necessary, such as to allow the victim of trafficking to exercise his or 
her right to remain during proceedings or as a form of restitution;  
</p>
<p>(e) Are provided with assistance necessary to have access to remedies, regardless 
of their immigration status, including medical, psychological, social, administrative and 
qualified linguistic and legal assistance, such as free legal aid; 
</p>
<p>(f) Are not detained, charged or prosecuted for activities that are a direct 
consequence of their situation as victims of trafficking in persons, including for violations 
of immigration law; 
</p>
<p>(g) Have a right to remain lawfully in the country in which the remedy is being 
sought for the duration of proceedings, without prejudice to any claim they may have to the 
right to remain on a more permanent basis as a remedy in itself; 
</p>
<p>(h) Have equal access to the right to remedy, including by ensuring that all 
investigations, prosecutions and other mechanisms are gender-sensitive; take into full 
account the different assistance and protection needs of women, men, girls and boys; 
address sexual and gender-based violence appropriately; ensure that victims are able to 
come forward to seek and obtain redress; prevent discriminatory evidence and afford equal
