</p>
<p><b>Administrative and programme budget implications of resolutions  
and decisions adopted by the Council at its third session 
</b></p>
<p><b>3/2.  Preparations for the Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of operative paragraphs 1 and 2 of draft resolution A/HRC/3/L.2, the 
Human Rights Council would decide: 
</p>
<p>(i) To establish a Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference which 
shall be open to the participation of all Member States of the United Nations and 
members of the specialized agencies and also with the participation of observers in 
accordance with the established practice of the General Assembly; and 
</p>
<p>(ii) Also that the Preparatory Committee shall hold an organizational session of 
one week in May 2007, at the level of personal representatives of the Heads of State 
or Government or other appropriate high-level representatives designated for this 
purpose by Governments and two substantive sessions of 10 working days each 
during 2007 and 2008 in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, requirements would 
arise to implement the activities called for in operative paragraphs 1 and 2 to provide for 
conference services and general temporary assistance for the 2006-2007 biennium, estimated 
at US$ 441,600 and for the 2008-2009 biennium estimated at US$ 303,300 as follows: 
</p>
<p>2006-2007 United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs 
   and conference management 
</p>
<p>377 700 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human rights 54 000 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva 9 900 
     Total 441 600 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2008-2009 United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs 
   and conference management 
</p>
<p>242 700 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human rights 54 000 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva 6 600 
     Total 303 300 
</p>
<p>3. No provisions have been included under the programme budget for the 2006-2007 
biennium for these additional activities, therefore, additional resources will be required under:  
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference 
management ($377,700); Section 23, Human rights ($54,000) and Section 28E, Administration, 
Geneva ($9,900). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4. With regard to the requirements for the 2008-2009 biennium, they are indicative and will 
be considered in the context of the proposed programme budget for the 2008-2009 biennium. 
</p>
<p>5. It will be recalled that under the procedures established by the General Assembly in its 
resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987, a contingency fund 
is established for each biennium to accommodate additional expenditures derived from 
legislative mandates not provided for in the programme budget.  Under this procedure, if 
additional expenditures are proposed that exceed the resources available from the contingency 
fund, the activities concerned can be implemented only through the redeployment of resources 
from low-priority areas or the modification of existing activities.  Otherwise, such additional 
activities must be deferred to a later biennium. 
</p>
<p>6. The additional provisions cannot be met from the contingency fund as other activities in 
the 2006-2007 biennium charged against the fund will have exhausted the fund during the main 
part of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  It is not possible at this stage to identify 
activities under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and 
conference management, section 23, Human rights, and section 28E, Administration, Geneva, of 
the programme budget for the 2006-2007 biennium that could be curtailed, deferred, terminated 
or modified in order to meet the additional requirements of US$ 441,600, although preliminary 
review leads the Secretariat to assume that some absorption of the estimated requirements is 
possible.  The Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to 
meet the requirements arising from the draft resolution in the 2006-2007 biennium.  At the time 
the General Assembly reviews at its sixty-first session the question of the revised estimates 
resulting from decisions of the Human Rights Council it is anticipated that the Secretariat would 
be in a position to inform the General Assembly on how to meet the additional requirements. 
</p>
<p><b>3/103. Global efforts for the total elimination of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and the comprehensive follow-up 
to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance and the effective implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (i) and (j) of draft decision 
A/HRC/3/L.3, the Human Rights Council would decide: 
</p>
<p>(i) &#8220;To heed the decision and instruction of the 2001 World Conference against 
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance by 
establishing an Ad-Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the 
Elaboration of Complementary Standards with the mandate to elaborate, as a 
matter of priority and necessity, complementary standards in the form of either a 
convention or additional protocol(s) to the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, filling the existing gaps in the 
Convention and also providing new normative standards aimed at combating all 
forms of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial and religious hatred; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(ii) To recommend that the Ad-Hoc Committee shall convene annual sessions 
of 10 working days commencing after its sixth session and report regularly to the 
Council on progress in the actual process of the elaboration of complementary 
standards; 
</p>
<p>(iii) To welcome the recent appointment of the Five Experts on Complementary 
Standards by the High Commissioner for Human Rights with the mandate to 
produce a base document outlining the substantive gaps in the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination;  
</p>
<p>(iv) To request the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action to invite the Five Experts to 
its fifth session with the view of having a one day preliminary exchange of views 
and vision on complementary standards as a provisional measure pending the 
completion of their report; 
</p>
<p>(v) To recommend that the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action convene its 
sixth session in July 2007 and that this sixth session mark the conclusion and 
closure of the Working Group&#8217;s debates and deliberations on the question of 
complementary standards; 
</p>
<p>(vi) To request that the Ad-Hoc Committee convene its first session during 
September 2007 and use all the documents presented to it as background material 
for commencing its process of elaborating complementary standards, and that one 
of its main priorities be to ensure that draft instrument(s) is/are produced for 
negotiations; 
</p>
<p>(vii) To request that the High Commissioner give visibility and a high profile to the 
Anti-Discrimination Unit within her Office and provide it with all the necessary and 
additional resources to ensure its effectiveness, particularly in view of the current 
challenges of racial and religious discrimination, so that the Unit ensures that the 
High Commissioner make a positive contribution and play a leadership role in the 
global efforts to combat all the resurgent scourges of racism.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that requirements for conference services, in the amount of US$ 607,100 would arise for 
the 2006-2007 biennium and US$ 451,800 for the 2008-2009 biennium as follows: 
</p>
<p>2006-2007 United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs 
   and conference management 
</p>
<p>594 100

</p>
<p>Section 28E, Administration, Geneva 12 700 
     Total 451 800

<p>3. No provisions have been included under the programme budget for the 2006-2007 
biennium for these additional activities, therefore, additional resources will be required under:  
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference 
management (US$ 594,100); and Section 28E, Administration, Geneva (US$ 13,000). 
</p>
<p>4. With regard to the requirements for the 2008-2009 biennium, they are indicative and will 
be considered in the context of the proposed programme budget for the 2008-2009 biennium.  
With regard to paragraph 1 (vii) herein, the attention of the Council is also drawn to the 
provisions of resolution 45/248 B, Section VI, in which the General Assembly reaffirmed that 
the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the General Assembly entrusted with 
responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and also reaffirmed the role of the 
Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p>5. It will be recalled that under the procedures established by the General Assembly in its 
resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987, a contingency fund 
is established for each biennium to accommodate additional expenditures derived from 
legislative mandates not provided for in the programme budget.  Under this procedure, if 
additional expenditures are proposed that exceed the resources available from the contingency 
fund, the activities concerned can be implemented only through the redeployment of resources 
from low-priority areas or the modification of existing activities.  Otherwise, such additional 
activities must be deferred to a later biennium.   
</p>
<p>6. The additional provisions cannot be met from the contingency fund as other activities in 
the 2006-2007 biennium charged against the fund will have exhausted the fund during the main 
part of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  It is not possible at this stage to identify 
activities under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and 
conference management, and section 28E, Administration, Geneva, of the programme budget for 
the 2006-2007 biennium that could be curtailed, deferred, terminated or modified in order to 
meet the additional requirements of US$ 607,100, although preliminary review leads the 
Secretariat to assume that some absorption of the estimated requirements is possible.  The 
Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the 
requirements arising from the draft resolution in the 2006-2007 biennium.  At the time the

<p><b>3/4. Implementation of General Assembly resolution 60/251:  agenda, 
annual programme of work, methods of work and rules of  
procedure of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of operative paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 of draft resolution A/HRC/3/L.6, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p>(i) Decide to establish an open-ended intergovernmental, intersessional working group 
to formulate concrete recommendations on its agenda, its annual programme of 
work, its methods of work as well as its rules of procedure in accordance with 
General Assembly resolution 60/251, to undertake transparent, well scheduled and 
inclusive consultations, with the participation of all stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Further decide that the working group shall have at its disposal 10 days of fully 
serviced meetings, half of them to be scheduled before the fourth session of the

sufficient time and flexibility for the fulfilment of its mandate; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Request the working group to report to the Council at its fourth session on progress 
made. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, total full costs for

</p>
<p>Section 28E, Administration, Geneva 6 400 
     Total 241 400 
</p>
<p>3. Provisions have not been made under the 2006-2007 programme budget for the 
above-mentioned activity, under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council 
affairs and conference management, nor section 28E, Administration, Geneva.  Should the draft 
resolution be adopted, additional resources would be required as reflected in paragraph 3 above. 
</p>
<p>4. It will be recalled that under the procedures established by the General Assembly in its 
resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987, a contingency fund 
is established for each biennium to accommodate additional expenditures derived from 
legislative mandates not provided for in the programme budget.  Under this procedure, if 
additional expenditures are proposed that exceed the resources available from the contingency 
fund, the activities concerned can be implemented only through the redeployment of resources 
from low-priority areas or the modification of existing activities.  Otherwise, such additional 
activities must be deferred to a later biennium. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. The additional provisions cannot be met from the contingency fund as other activities in 
the 2006-2007 biennium charged against the fund will have exhausted the fund during the main 
part of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  It is not possible at this stage to identify 
activities under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and 
conference management, and section 28E, Administration, Geneva, of the programme budget for 
the 2006-2007 biennium that could be curtailed, deferred, terminated or modified in order to 
meet the additional requirements of US$ 241,400.  The Secretariat will seek to identify areas 
from which resources can be redeployed to meet the requirements arising from the draft 
resolution in the 2006-2007 biennium.  At the time the General Assembly reviews at its 
sixty-first session the question of the revised estimates resulting from decisions of the Human 
Rights Council it is anticipated that the Secretariat would be in a position to inform the 
General Assembly on how to meet the additional requirements. </p>
