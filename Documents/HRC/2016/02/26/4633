<p><b>  15/&#8230;  Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that no one 
shall be held in slavery or servitude and that slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited 
in all their forms,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the Slavery Convention of 1926, the Supplementary Convention on the 
Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 
1956 and the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), of the International Labour 
Organization, as well as other relevant international instruments which prohibit all forms of 
slavery and call upon Governments to eradicate such practices, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action strongly 
condemned the fact that slavery and slavery-like practices still exist today in parts of the 
world and urged States to take immediate measures as a matter of priority to end such 
practices, which constitute flagrant violations of human rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>Council resolution 6/14 of 28 September 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Condemning</i> contemporary forms of slavery, while acknowledging that it is a global 
issue that affects all continents and most countries of the world, and calling upon States to 
take appropriate measures as a matter of priority to end such practices, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that the minimum estimate of the number of people in slavery is 
over 12 million and that the problem appears to be increasing,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that broad international cooperation among States as well as between 
States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations is essential for 
effectively countering contemporary forms of slavery,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Council resolution 5/1 entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations 
Human Rights Council&#8221;  Council resolution 5/2 entitled &#8220;Code of Conduct for special 
procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council&#8221;, of 18 June 2007, and stressing 
that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions 
and the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that the issue of contemporary forms of slavery continues to require the 
attention of the Council,

Slavery and its importance for addressing the issues raised by the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery,

Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956, as well 
as all other issues covered previously by the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of 
Slavery; in the discharge of his/her mandate, the Special Rapporteur shall:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Promote the effective application of relevant international norms and 
standards on slavery; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Request, receive and exchange information on contemporary forms of slavery 
from Governments, treaty bodies, special procedures, specialized agencies, 
intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and other relevant 
sources, including on slavery practices and, as appropriate, and in line with the current 
practice, respond effectively to reliable information on alleged human rights violations with 
a view to protecting the human rights of victims of slavery and preventing violations;  
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Recommend actions and measures applicable at the national, regional and 
international levels to eliminate slavery practices wherever they occur, including remedies 
which address the causes and consequences of contemporary forms of slavery, such as 
poverty, discrimination and conflict as well as the existence of demand factors and relevant 
measures to strengthen international cooperation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Focus principally on aspects of contemporary forms of slavery which are not 
covered by existing mandates of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>

<p> 5. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out his/her mandate, to 
continue: 
</p>

mandate and to include examples of effective practices as well as relevant 
recommendations;  
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To take account of the gender and age dimensions of contemporary forms of 
slavery;  
</p>

national legislation relating to the prohibition of slavery and slavery-like practices in order 
to assist States in their national efforts to combat contemporary forms of slavery; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon </i>all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special 
Rapporteur in the performance of the tasks and duties mandated, to supply all necessary 
information requested by him/her and to give serious consideration to responding 
favourably to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s requests to visit their countries, so as to enable 
him/her to fulfil his/her mandate effectively;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, regional 
intergovernmental organizations, Governments, independent experts, interested institutions 
and non-governmental organizations to cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the 
Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his/her mandate;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate fully and 
effectively with all other relevant existing human rights mechanisms, taking full account of 
their contribution while avoiding duplication of their work;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to submit annual reports on the activities of 
the mandate to the Council, together with recommendations on measures that should be 
taken to combat and eradicate contemporary forms of slavery and slavery-like practices and 
to protect the human rights of victims of such practices;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to give the Special Rapporteur all necessary

his/her mandate.
