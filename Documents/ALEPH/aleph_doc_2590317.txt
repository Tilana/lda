CAUTIONARY INFORMATION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Throughout this Form 10-Q, we make statements that may be deemed “forward-looking”
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  These forward-looking
statements include, among others, statements concerning our outlook with regard to timing and
amount of future production of oil and gas, price realizations, amounts, nature and timing of
capital expenditures for exploration and development, plans for funding operations and capital
expenditures, drilling of wells, operating costs and other expenses, marketing of oil, gas, and
NGLs and other statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated
events or trends, and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  The
forward-looking statements in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in the price we receive
for our oil and gas production, full cost ceiling impairments to the carrying values of our oil and
gas properties, reductions in the quantity of oil and gas sold due to decreased industry-wide
demand and/or curtailments in production from specific properties or areas due to mechanical,
transportation, marketing, weather or other problems, operating and capital expenditures that are
either significantly higher or lower than anticipated because the actual cost of identified projects
varied from original estimates and/or from the number of exploration and development
opportunities being greater or fewer than currently anticipated, and increased financing costs due
to a significant increase in interest rates.  In addition, exploration and development opportunities
that we pursue may not result in economic, productive oil and gas properties.  There are also
numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, projecting future
rates of production and the timing of development expenditures.  These and other risks and
uncertainties affecting us are discussed in greater detail in this report and in our other filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
1.Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by Cimarex Energy Co.
(“Cimarex,” “we” or “us”) pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).  Accordingly, certain disclosures required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and normally included in Annual Reports on Form 10-K have been
omitted.  Although management believes that our disclosures in these interim financial
statements are adequate, they should be read in conjunction with the financial statements,
summary of significant accounting policies and footnotes included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the
periods and as of the dates shown.  We have evaluated subsequent events through the date of
this filing.
Use of Estimates
Areas of significance requiring the use of management’s judgments include the estimation of
proved oil and gas reserves, the use of proved reserves in calculating depletion, depreciation
and amortization (DD&A), estimates of future net revenues in computing ceiling test limitations
and estimates of future abandonment obligations used in recording asset retirement obligations
and the assessment of goodwill.  Estimates and judgments also are required in determining
allowance for bad debt, impairments of undeveloped properties and other assets, purchase price
allocation, valuation of deferred tax assets, fair value measurements and contingencies.
Oil and Gas Well Equipment and Supplies
Our oil and gas well equipment and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value, where net realizable value is a defined estimated selling price.  An analysis of our oil and
gas well equipment and supplies was performed and no impairment was required.   However, the
continued industry-wide decline in drilling operations has put downward pressure on the price of
oil and gas well equipment and supplies.  Further declines in future periods could cause us to
recognize impairments on these assets. An impairment would not affect cash flow from operating
activities, but would adversely affect our net income and stockholders’ equity.
Oil and Gas Properties
We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations.  Accounting
rules require us to perform a quarterly ceiling test calculation to test our oil and gas properties for
possible impairment.   If the net capitalized cost of our oil and gas properties subject to
amortization (the carrying value) exceeds the ceiling limitation, the excess is charged to
expense.  The ceiling limitation is equal to the sum of the present value discounted at 10% of
estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, the cost of properties not being amortized,
the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being
amortized and all related tax effects.  Estimated future net cash flows are determined by
commodity prices and proved reserve quantities.
At June 30, 2016, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties subject to the test exceeded the
calculated value of the ceiling limitation, and we recognized an impairment of $399.2 million
($253.6 million, net of tax).   Year-to-date 2016 impairments totaled $629.3 million ($400.0
million, net of tax).  These impairments resulted primarily from the continued impact of decreases
in the 12-month average trailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs utilized in determining the
future net cash flows from proved reserves.   If pricing conditions stay at current levels or decline
further, or if there is a negative impact on one or more of the other components of the calculation,
we will incur full cost ceiling impairments in future quarters.  The ceiling calculation is not
intended to be indicative of the fair market value of our proved reserves or future
results.  Impairment charges do not affect cash flow from operating activities, but do adversely
affect our net income (loss) and various components of our balance sheet.   Any recorded
impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  In July 2015, the
FASB deferred the effective date by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is
permitted, but not before the original effective date of reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016.  We do not intend to early adopt this standard.  At this time we do not expect that the
adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lease assets and lease
liabilities for most leases to be recognized on the balance sheet and disclosing key information
about leasing arrangements.  The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this
new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  We anticipate
that we will not early adopt this standard.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which will change how companies account for
certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the
statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same
period.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.  We do not intend to early adopt this standard.

 $1,500,000 $ 14,380
All of our long-term debt is senior unsecured debt and is, therefore, pari passu with other
unsecured debt with respect to the payment of both principal and interest.
Bank Debt
We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) that matures October 16,
2020.  The Credit Facility has aggregate commitments of $1.0 billion, with our option to increase
aggregate commitments to $1.25 billion at any time.  There is no borrowing base subject to the
discretion of the lenders based on the value of our proved reserves under the Credit Facility.  As
of June 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.  We had letters
of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility of $2.5 million, leaving an unused borrowing
availability of $997.5 million.
At our option, borrowings under the Credit Facility may bear interest at either (a) LIBOR plus
1.125 – 2.0% based on the credit rating for our senior unsecured long-term debt, or (b) a base
rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 0.125 – 1.0%, based on the credit rating for our
senior unsecured long-term debt.  Unused borrowings are subject to a commitment fee of 0.125 –
0.35%, based on the credit rating for our senior unsecured long-term debt.
The Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that are
customary for investment grade, senior unsecured bank credit agreements, including a financial
covenant for the maintenance of a defined total debt-to-capital ratio of no greater than 65%.  As of
June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the financial and non-financial covenants.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $5.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, of
unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our Credit Facility, which were recorded as
deferred assets and included in Other assets, net in our balance sheet.  These costs are being
amortized to interest expense ratably over the life of the Credit Facility.
Senior Notes
Each of our senior notes is governed by an indenture containing certain covenants, events of
default and other restrictive provisions with which we were in compliance as of June 30,
2016.  Interest on each of the senior notes is payable semi-annually.  The effective interest rate
on the 4.375% notes and the 5.875% notes, including the debt issuance cost, is 4.50% and
6.04%, respectively.
3.Derivative Instruments/Hedging
We periodically use derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in commodity prices. While the
use of these instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price changes, their use may also
limit future revenues from favorable price changes. Depending on changes in oil and gas futures
markets and management’s view of underlying supply and demand trends, we may increase or
decrease our hedging positions.

A three-way collar is a combination of three options: lower floor (sold put), upper floor (bought
put) and ceiling (sold call).  If the published index price is below the lower floor, we receive the
difference between the two floors.  If the index price is between the two floors, we receive the
difference between the upper floor and the index price.  If the index price is between the upper
floor and the ceiling, we do not receive or pay any amounts.  If the index price is above the
ceiling, we pay the excess over the ceiling price.
Under a collar agreement, we receive the difference between the published index price and a
floor price if the index price is below the floor. We pay the difference between the ceiling price
and the index price if the index price is above the contracted ceiling price. No amounts are paid
or received if the index price is between the floor and the ceiling price.
We have elected not to account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges.  Therefore, we
recognize settlements and changes in the assets or liabilities relating to our open derivative
contracts in earnings.  Cash settlements of our contracts are included in cash flows from
operating activities in our statements of cash flows.
The following table presents the aggregate net (gain) loss from settlements and changes in fair
value of our derivative contracts and the (gains) losses only from settlements during the periods

Our derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on our balance sheet using Level 2 inputs
and are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow us to offset recognized
asset and liability fair value amounts on contracts with the same counterparty. Our policy is to not
offset asset and liability positions in our accompanying balance sheets.

Liability
We are exposed to financial risks associated with our derivative contracts from non-performance
by our counterparties. We mitigate our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with a
number of financial institutions, each of which have a high credit rating and is a member of our
bank credit facility. Our member banks do not require us to post collateral for our hedge liability
positions. Because some of the member banks have discontinued hedging activities, in the future
we may hedge with counterparties outside our bank group to obtain competitive terms and to
spread counterparty risk.
4.Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).  The FASB
has established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value.  This hierarchy consists of three broad levels.  Level 1 inputs are the highest
priority and consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities.  Level 2 are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.  Level 3 are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability.

Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment,
including the consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.  The fair value (Level 1) of
our 4.375% and 5.875% fixed rate notes was based on their last traded value before period end.
The fair value of our derivative instruments (Level 2) was estimated using option pricing models.
These models use certain variables including forward price and volatility curves and the strike
prices for the instruments.  The fair value estimates are adjusted relative to non-performance risk
as appropriate.  See Note 3 for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments.
Other Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturities and/or liquid nature
of these assets and liabilities.
Most of our accounts receivable balances are uncollateralized and result from transactions with
other companies in the oil and gas industry.  Concentration of customers may impact our overall
credit risk because our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other
conditions within the industry.
We routinely assess the recoverability of all material accounts receivable to determine their
collectability.  We accrue a reserve to the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable
that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably
estimated.  At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts was
$1.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

In May 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share.  The dividend is
payable on September 1, 2016, to stockholders of record on August 15, 2016.  Dividends
declared are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings to the extent retained earnings are
available at the close of the period prior to the date of the declared dividend.  Dividends in
excess of retained earnings are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.  For the
dividends declared in May 2016, all of the dividends declared ($7.6 million) were recorded as a
reduction of additional paid-in capital.  Future dividend payments will depend on our level of
earnings, financing requirements, and other factors considered relevant by the Board of
Directors.
6.Stock-based Compensation
We have recognized stock-based compensation cost as shown below.  Expense associated with
stock compensation will fluctuate based on the grant-date fair value of awards, the number of
awards and the timing of the awards.  Historical amounts may not be representative of future
amounts as the value of future awards may vary from historical amounts.

During the second quarter of 2016, a voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program (ERIP) was
offered to certain employees and completed in June.  In addition to those who participated in the
ERIP, other individuals also retired in June.   The retirement agreements included accelerated
vesting of performance and service-based restricted stock awards and stock option awards.  The
effect of the accelerated vesting on our total stock compensation cost for the second quarter and
six months ended June 30, 2016 was an increase of $2.6 million over the same periods from
2015.

7.Asset Retirement Obligations
We recognize the fair value of liabilities for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-
lived assets in the period in which there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of
such assets and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  The associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.  This liability includes
costs related to the plugging and abandonment of wells, the removal of facilities and equipment,
and site restorations.  Subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement liability is required
to be accreted each period.  If the fair value of a recorded asset retirement obligation changes, a
revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement capitalized
cost.  Capitalized costs are included as a component of the DD&A calculations.
The following table reflects the components of the change in the carrying amount of the asset
retirement obligation for the six months ended June 30, 2016:

carryforward will be utilized before it expires.  The amount of U.S. net tax operating loss
carryforward that will be recorded to equity when utilized to reduce taxes payable is $77.2
million. We also had an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $6.0 million.

At June 30, 2016, we had no unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our effective tax rate
and have made no provisions for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  The tax
years 2012 through 2014 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service of the
United States.  We file tax returns with various state taxing authorities, which remain open to
examination for tax years 2011 through 2014.
Our provision for income taxes differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state
income taxes and non-deductible expenses.
10.Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
We have commitments of $222.4 million to finish drilling and completing wells in progress at
June 30, 2016.  We also have various commitments for drilling rigs.  The total minimum
expenditure commitments under these agreements are $3.8 million.
At June 30, 2016, we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately 46.7 Bcf of natural gas
over the next 28 months.  If this gas is not delivered, our financial commitment would be
approximately $116.9 million.  This commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual
volumes delivered.  However, we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our
current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations.
In connection with gas gathering and processing agreements, we have volume commitments
over the next ten years.  If no gas is delivered, the maximum amount that would be payable under
these commitments would be approximately $190.2 million.  However, we believe no financial
commitment will be due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which
we can fulfill these obligations.
We have minimum volume delivery commitments in connection with agreements to reimburse
connection costs to various pipelines.  The maximum amount that would be payable if no gas is
delivered would be approximately $12.5 million.  Of this total, we have accrued a liability of $10.6
million.  Due to reduced drilling activity in 2015 and projected for 2016, we may have additional
liabilities associated with these delivery commitments in the future.
We have other various transportation, delivery and facilities commitments in the normal course of
business, which approximate $35.7 million.  We anticipate meeting these obligations.
We have various commitments for office space and equipment under operating lease
arrangements totaling $101.5 million.
All of the noted commitments were routine and made in the ordinary course of our business.
Litigation
We have various litigation matters related to the ordinary course of our business.  We assess the
probability of estimable amounts related to those matters in accordance with guidance
established by the FASB and adjust our accruals accordingly.  Though some of the related
claims may be significant, we believe the resolution of them, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations after
consideration of current accruals.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Cimarex is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.  Our operations are
entirely located in the United States, mainly in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.  Currently our
operations are focused in two main areas: the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent region.  Our
Permian Basin region encompasses west Texas and southeast New Mexico.  Our Mid-Continent
region consists of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
Our principal business objective is to profitably grow proved reserves and production for the long-
term benefit of our stockholders through a balanced and deep drilling inventory.  Our strategy
centers on maximizing cash flow from producing properties and profitably reinvesting that cash
flow in exploration and development.  We consider property acquisitions, dispositions and
occasional mergers to enhance our competitive position.
We believe that detailed technical analysis, operational focus and a disciplined capital
investment process mitigates risk and positions us to continue to achieve increases in proved
reserves and production.  Our drilling inventory and limited long-term commitments provide the
flexibility to respond quickly to industry volatility.
Our investments are generally funded with cash flow provided by operating activities together
with bank borrowings, sales of non-strategic assets and occasional public financing. 
Conservative use of leverage has long been a part of our financial strategy.  We believe that
maintaining a strong balance sheet mitigates financial risk and enables us to withstand low
prices.
Market Conditions
The oil and gas industry is cyclical and commodity prices can be volatile.  In the second half of
2014, oil prices began a rapid and significant decline as global supply began to outpace
demand.  During 2015, global oil supply continued to outpace demand resulting in further
deterioration in realized oil prices.  Thus far in 2016, oil prices have been erratic but have shown
improvement during the second quarter of 2016.  It is likely that oil prices will remain erratic due
to the ongoing global supply and demand imbalance, high inventories and geopolitical factors.
Due to an imbalance between supply and demand across North America, prices for domestic
natural gas and NGLs began to decline during the third quarter of 2014 and continued to be weak
through the first quarter of 2016.  While prices were stronger in the second quarter of 2016, future
prices will likely continue to fluctuate.
Our revenue, profitability and future growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our
oil and natural gas production.  For the first six months of 2016 our realized oil price fell 27% to
$33.94 per Bbl from the same period of 2015.  Similarly, our realized natural gas price dropped
29% to $1.87 per Mcf and our realized price for NGL declined 21% to $11.98 per Bbl.  See
Revenues below for further information regarding our realized commodity prices.
The U.S. oil and gas industry continues to confront weak commodity prices, which has adverse
effects on our business and financial position.  Our ability to access capital markets may be
restricted, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and
business conditions.  Further, oversupply and high inventory storage levels could put downward
pressure on commodity prices and have an adverse impact on our business partners, customers
and lenders, potentially causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.
Based on current economic conditions, our 2016 exploration and development expenditures are
now estimated to be approximately $750 million, up from our previous expectation of $650-$700
million.  Investments in gathering and processing infrastructure and other fixed assets are
expected to approximate an additional $50 million.
See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015, for a discussion of risk factors that affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.  Also see CAUTIONARY INFORMATION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS in this report for important information about these types of statements.

Summary of operating and financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
the same period of 2015:
·Average production declined 1% to 973.7 MMcfe per day.
·Oil production declined by 16% to 45,267 barrels per day, gas volumes increased by 2% to
467.4 MMcf per day and NGL volumes rose 13% to 39,112 barrels per day.
·Production revenues declined 32% to $524.1 million.
·Cash on hand at June 30, 2016 was $641.7 million.
·Cash flow provided by operating activities declined 42% to $213.7 million.
·We incurred a net loss of $456.4 million ($4.91 per diluted share) versus a net loss of $1.02
billion ($10.94 per diluted share) in 2015.
In response to continued weak commodity prices we significantly reduced our 2016 exploration
and development expenditures to $285.7 million compared to $470.5 million in 2015.
Total debt at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of $1.5 billion of senior notes, with
$750 million maturing in 2022 and $750 million maturing in 2024.
Revenues
Almost all of our revenues are derived from sales of our oil, natural gas and NGL
production.  Increases or decreases in our revenue, profitability and future production growth are
highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive.  Prices are market driven and we expect
that future prices will continue to fluctuate due to supply and demand factors, seasonality and
geopolitical and economic factors.
Oil sales contributed 54% of our total production revenue for the first six months of 2016. Gas
sales accounted for 30% and NGL sales contributed 16%. A $1.00 per barrel change in our
realized oil price would have resulted in a $8.2 million change in revenues. A $0.10 per Mcf
change in our realized gas price would have resulted in a $8.5 million change in our gas
revenues. A $1.00 per barrel change in NGL prices would have changed revenues by $7.1
million.
The following table presents our average realized commodity prices and certain major U.S. index
prices.  Our average realized prices do not include settlements of commodity derivative
contracts.

During the first half of 2016 and 2015, approximately 79% and 85%, respectively, of our oil
production was in the Permian Basin, the sale of which is tied to the WTI Midland benchmark
price.  The majority of the remaining oil production is from our Mid-Continent region.  The impact
of changes in realized prices is discussed below under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Operating costs and expenses
Costs associated with producing oil and natural gas are substantial.  Some of these costs vary
with commodity prices, some trend with the type and volume of production and others are a
function of the number of wells we own.
We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations.  Accounting
rules require us to perform a quarterly ceiling test calculation to test our oil and gas properties for
possible impairment.  If the net capitalized cost of our oil and gas properties subject to
amortization (the carrying value) exceeds the ceiling limitation, the excess is charged to
expense.  The ceiling limitation is equal to the sum of the present value discounted at 10% of
estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, the cost of properties not being amortized,
the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being
amortized, and all related tax effects.  Estimated future net cash flows are determined by proved
reserve quantities and commodity prices net of operating costs and capital expenditures.  We
recognized ceiling test impairments in each quarter of 2015, totaling $3.7 billion ($2.4 billion, net
of tax) for the year.  For the first quarter of 2016 we recognized a ceiling test impairment of $230.1
million ($146.2 million, net of tax).
At June 30, 2016, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties subject to the ceiling test
exceeded the calculated value of the ceiling limitation, resulting in an impairment of $399.2
million ($253.6 million, net of tax).  The impairment resulted primarily from the impact of
decreases in the 12-month average trailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs utilized in
determining the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves. If pricing conditions stay at
current levels or decline further, we will incur full cost ceiling impairments in future quarters, the
magnitude of which will be affected by one or more of the other components of the ceiling test
calculations, until prices stabilize or improve over a twelve-month period.
Commodity prices used in the June 30, 2016 ceiling calculation, based on the required trailing
12-month average prices, were $2.24 per Mcf of gas and $43.12 per barrel of oil.  To demonstrate
the impact of commodity prices on the ceiling calculation, had average prices of $2.28 per Mcf of
gas and $42.91 per barrel of oil been used instead, we would not have incurred any additional
impairment for the second quarter of 2016.  The commodity prices for this assumption were
calculated based on a 12-month simple average of the commodity prices on the first day of the
month for the 10 months ended July 2016 and the prices for July 2016 were used for the
remaining two months in the 12-month average.
The above calculation of the impact of lower commodity prices was prepared based on the
assumption that all other inputs and assumptions are held constant with the exception of oil and
natural gas prices.  Therefore, this calculation strictly isolates the potential impact of commodity
prices on our ceiling test limitation.  An amount of any future impairment is difficult to reasonably
predict and will depend upon not only commodity prices but also other factors that include, but
are not limited to, incremental proved reserves that may be added each period, revisions to
previous reserve estimates, capital expenditures, operating costs, and all related tax
effects.  There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of proved reserves and
accounting for oil and natural gas properties in future periods and the estimate described above
should not be construed as indicative of our development plans or future results.
The ceiling limitation calculation is not intended to be indicative of the fair market value of our
proved reserves or future results. Impairment charges do not affect cash flow from operating
activities, but do adversely affect our net income (loss) and various components of our balance
sheet.  Any recorded impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) of our producing properties is computed using
the units-of-production method.  The economic life of each producing well depends upon the
estimated proved reserves for that well, which in turn depend upon the assumed realized sales
price for future production.  Therefore, fluctuations in oil and gas prices will impact the level of
proved reserves used in the calculation.  Higher prices generally have the effect of increasing
reserves, which reduces depletion expense.  Conversely, lower prices generally have the effect
of decreasing reserves, which increases depletion expense.  The cost of replacing production
also impacts our DD&A rate.  In addition, changes in estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of
operating and future development costs, reclassifications of properties from unproved to proved
and impairments of oil and gas properties will also impact depletion expense.  DD&A is
calculated quarterly before the ceiling test impairment calculation.  The
21
Table of Contents
impairments of our oil and gas properties in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 resulted in lower
DD&A rates in each quarter following the impairment.
Production expense generally consists of costs for salt water disposal, labor, equipment,
maintenance, compression, power, treating and miscellaneous other costs.  Production expense
also includes well workover activity necessary to maintain production from existing wells.
Transportation, processing and other operating costs principally consist of expenditures to
prepare and transport production from the wellhead, together with gas processing costs and
costs to transport production to a specified sales point.  These costs vary by region and will
fluctuate with increases or decreases in production volumes, contractual fees and changes in
fuel and compression costs.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits,
office rent, legal fees, consultants, systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our
offices and not directly associated with exploration, development or production activities.  Our
G&A expense is reported net of amounts reimbursed to us by working interest owners of the oil
and gas properties we operate and net of amounts capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of
accounting.
A discussion of changes in operating costs and expenses is included in RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS, below.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 vs. June 30, 2015
In the second quarter of 2016, we had a net loss of $270.3 million ($2.91 per diluted share)
compared to a net loss of $600.2 million ($6.47 per diluted share) for the same period of
2015.  For the first six months of 2016, we had a net loss of $456.4 million ($4.91 per diluted
share) down from a net loss of $1.02 billion ($10.94 per diluted share) in 2015.
Both 2016 and 2015 periods were adversely affected by low realized commodity prices, which
also brought about impairments of our oil and gas properties.  Although the 2016 periods had
lower production revenue than the same periods of 2015, this decrease was more than offset by
lower impairment, DD&A and other operating costs in the 2016 periods.  Period-over-period
changes are discussed further in the analysis that follows.

As reflected in the table above, for the second quarter of 2016, our production revenues were
30% lower than those in the same period of 2015.  In the second quarter of 2016, lower realized
prices accounted for 60% of the $124.6 million quarter-over-quarter decline in production
revenue.  The remaining decrease resulted primarily from lower oil production in the second
quarter of 2016.
Production revenues for the first six months of 2016 were 32% lower than the same period of
2015.  Lower realized commodity prices accounted for 79% of the $243.7 million period-over-
period decrease.  The remaining $50.6 million decrease resulted as increased revenue from
natural gas and NGL production was more than offset by lower revenue from oil production.
See Revenues above for a discussion regarding realized prices.  The decreases in 2016 oil
production were attributable to lower production from our Permian region.  In the second quarter
of 2016, lower oil production resulted from normal production declines, a slow-down in well
completion activity and declines related to certain plant shut-ins.  Production in the first six
months of 2016 was also negatively impacted by capacity curtailments in the first quarter of 2016,
due to force majeure and other events beyond our control.

Analysis of Operating Costs and Expenses
Total operating costs and expenses for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were
48% lower than those for the same periods of 2015.  Most of the 2016 decreases resulted from
lower ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties and lower DD&A expense.  See
Operating costs and expenses above for a discussion of the ceiling limitation and DD&A
calculations.  Period-over-period differences are discussed below.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, DD&A expense was 43% and 42% lower,
respectively, compared to the same periods of 2015.  The decreases were primarily due to lower
DD&A rates in 2016.  Impairments of our oil and gas properties during each quarter of 2015 and
the first quarter of 2016 have resulted in lower DD&A rates in each quarter following the
impairment. DD&A is calculated quarterly before the ceiling test impairment calculation.  We
expect our DD&A rate during the remainder of 2016 to fluctuate depending on average realized
prices and production volumes.  Continued lower realized prices will result in further impairments
of our oil and gas properties which would likely result in a lower DD&A rate in the quarter
following an impairment.

Lease operating expense in the second quarter of 2016 declined 24% compared to the same
quarter of 2015.  Lease operating expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 declined by
21% compared to the same period of 2015.  The 2016 periods benefited from lower salt water
disposal costs attributable to implementation of operational efficiencies.  The 2016 periods also
had reduced costs for rental equipment, labor and lower costs due to property divestitures.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, workover expenses were 13% and 11%
higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2015.  Generally, these costs will fluctuate based
on the amount of maintenance and remedial activity planned and/or required during the period.
Transportation, processing and other operating costs in the second quarter of 2016 were
relatively flat compared to the same period of 2015.  For the first six months of 2016, these costs
were 9% greater than the first six months of 2015.  These costs will vary by product type and
region.  Approximately 12% of the increase in the first six months of 2016 relates to accruals for
expected minimum volume agreement shortfalls.  See Contractual Obligations and Material
Commitments below for further information.
Gas gathering and other includes costs associated with operating our gas gathering and
processing infrastructure, including product costs, operating and maintenance expenses.  The
2016 period-over-period decreases were primarily related to higher repair and maintenance
activity in the 2015 periods.
Taxes other than income are assessed by state and local taxing authorities on production,
revenues or the value of properties.  Revenue based production and severance taxes are our
largest component of these taxes.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, these
taxes decreased by 46% and 42%, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2015.  The
decreases were primarily a result of period-over-period declines in production revenue due to
lower realized commodity prices.

During the second quarter of 2016, a voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program (ERIP) was
offered to certain employees and completed in June.  Severance payments made to the
participants in June resulted in higher G&A expense for the second quarter and first six months of
2016 compared to 2015.  Going forward these departures are expected to result in lower G&A.
26
Table of Contents
G&A expense in the second quarter of 2016 was 52% higher than the same period of
2015.  Approximately 65% of the increase resulted from the ERIP severance payments.  The
remaining increase resulted from an additional $3.6 million of incentive based compensation and
other benefits which was partially offset by lower salaries of $1.4 million due to fewer employees
quarter-over-quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, G&A expense exceeded that of the prior year by
18%.  Severance payments associated with the ERIP accounted for approximately 89% of the
increase.  The rest of the increase resulted from higher incentive based compensation and other
benefits which were mostly offset by lower consulting fees and other charges.
Stock compensation expense consists of non-cash charges resulting from the amortization of the
cost of restricted stock and stock option awards, net of amounts capitalized to oil and gas
properties.  We have recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows:

Expense associated with stock compensation will fluctuate based on the grant-date fair value of
awards, the number of awards and the timing of the awards.  Historical amounts may not be
representative of future amounts as the value of future awards may vary from historical amounts.
During the second quarter of 2016, certain individuals retired in addition to those who
participated in the ERIP described above in the G&A analysis.  The retirement agreements
included accelerated vesting of performance and service-based restricted stock awards and
stock option awards.  The accelerated vesting accounted for $2.0 million of the 2016 period-over-
period increases in stock compensation expense.
Net gains and losses on our derivative instruments are a function of fluctuations in the underlying
commodity prices and the monthly settlement (if any) of the instruments. We have chosen not to
apply hedge accounting treatment to our derivative instruments.  Therefore, settlements on the
contracts are included as a component of operating costs and expenses as either a net gain or
loss on derivative instruments.
The following table presents the aggregate net (gain) loss from settlements and change in the fair
value of our derivative contracts and the (gains) losses only from settlements during 2016 and
2015.  See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report for additional

The majority of our interest expense relates to interest on debt and amortization of financing
costs.  See Long-term Debt below for further information regarding our debt.
We capitalize interest on non-producing leasehold (NPL) costs, the in-progress costs of drilling
and completing wells and constructing qualified assets.  Capitalized interest will fluctuate based
on the current rate of interest and the amount of costs on which interest is calculated.  During the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, capitalized interest decreased by 34% and 41%,
respectively, compared to the same periods of 2015.  The decreases were primarily due to lower
average NPL costs in the 2016 periods.
Components of “Other, net” consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary
from period to period, including gain or loss related to the sale or value of oil and gas well
equipment and supplies, income and expense associated with other non-operating activities,
miscellaneous asset sales and interest income.  For the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, Other, net decreased by 48% and 51%, respectively, compared to the same periods of
2015.  The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to lower net gains from sales of oil
and gas well equipment and supplies in 2016.  The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower
net gains from sales of oil and gas well equipment and supplies which were partially offset by
higher interest income.
An analysis of our oil and gas well equipment and supplies was performed as of June 30, 2016
and no impairment was required.  However, the industry-wide decline in drilling operations has
put downward pressure on the price of oil and gas well equipment and supplies.  Further
declines in future periods could cause us to recognize impairments on these assets. An
impairment would not affect cash flow from operating activities, but would adversely affect our net
income and stockholders’ equity.

Table of Contents
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview
We strive to maintain an adequate liquidity level to address volatility and risk.  Sources of
liquidity include our cash flow from operations, cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under
our revolving credit facility, proceeds from sales of non-core assets and occasional public
financings.
Our liquidity is highly dependent on prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we
produce.  Prices we receive are determined by prevailing market conditions and greatly influence
our revenue, cash flow, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth.  See Market
Conditions, Revenues and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS above for further information and
analysis of the impact realized prices have had on our 2016 earnings.
We deal with volatility in commodity prices primarily by maintaining flexibility in our capital
investment program.  We have a balanced and deep drilling inventory and limited long-term
commitments, which enables us to respond quickly to industry volatility.  See Capital
Expenditures below for information regarding our 2016 exploration and development investment
program.
From time to time we enter into hedging agreements.  We currently have derivative contracts
covering a portion of our 2016 and 2017 production.  See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of this report for information regarding our derivative instruments.  Management will
decide whether to enter into derivative contracts depending on their view of underlying supply
and demand trends, changes in the oil and gas futures markets and other considerations.
We believe our conservative use of leverage and strong balance sheet will mitigate our exposure
to lower commodity prices.  Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 totaled $641.7
million.  Our long-term debt consisted of $1.5 billion of senior notes, with $750 million due in
2022 and $750 million due in 2024.  We had letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility
of $2.5 million, leaving an unused borrowing availability of $997.5 million.
Our debt to total capitalization at June 30, 2016 was 39% compared to 35% at December 31,
2015.  The reconciliation of debt to total capitalization, which is a non-GAAP measure, is:  long-
term debt of $1.5 billion divided by the sum of long-term debt of $1.5 billion plus stockholders’
equity of $2.3 billion.  Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful information as it is
a common statistic used in the investment community to assist with analysis of the financial
condition of an entity.
We expect our operating cash flow and other capital resources to be adequate to meet our needs
for planned capital expenditures, working capital, debt service and dividend payments for the
remainder of 2016 and beyond.
Analysis of Cash Flow Changes (See the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
Net cash flow provided by operating activities (operating cash flow) for the first six months of
2016 was $213.7 million, down 42% from $370.5 million in the same period of 2015.  The $156.8
million decrease resulted primarily from a period-over-period decrease in revenues, which was
partially offset by net decreases in certain operating expenses and increased cash settlements of
derivative instruments.    See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS above for information regarding the
2016 changes in revenue, operating expenses and derivative settlements.
For the first six months of 2016, net cash flow used for investing activities was $330.0 million, a
decrease of $295.9 million (47%) from $625.9 million for the same period of 2015. In 2016, oil
and gas and other capital expenditures were $292.3 million lower than the 2015 expenditures.  In
response to continued weak commodity prices we significantly reduced our 2016 oil and gas
expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities during the first six months of 2016 was $21.4 million,
compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $706.3 million for the same period of
2015.  In 2016, dividend payments of $22.7 million were offset by $1.3 million of proceeds from
issuance of common stock from employee option exercises and other.  In 2015, cash provided by
financing activities included approximately $729.5 million of net

proceeds from the sale of common stock and $4.9 million of proceeds from issuance of common
stock from employee option exercises and other.  The 2015 proceeds were partially offset by
dividend payments of $28.1 million.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of adjusted cash flow from operations is
useful information for investors.  It is accepted by the investment community as a means of
measuring a company’s ability to fund its capital program and dividends without reflecting
fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities (which are included in the GAAP
measure of cash flow from operating activities).  It is also used by professional research analysts
in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration
and production industry.

made or received.
Our 2016 E&D capital investment is estimated to be approximately $750 million, up from our
previous estimate of 650-$700 million.  Our expectation is that 56% of our 2016 capital
investment will be in the Permian Basin with the remainder in the Mid-Continent region.

Table of Contents
As has been our historical practice, we regularly review our capital expenditures throughout the
year and will adjust our investments based on increases or decreases in commodity prices,
service costs and drilling success.  We have the flexibility to adjust our capital expenditures
based upon market conditions.  Due to the uncertainty of the duration of a low commodity price
environment, with the possibility of further declines in prices, our current plan for the pace of
development of our proved undeveloped reserves could change in the future.
We intend to continue to fund our capital investment program with cash on hand and cash flow
from our operating activities.  Sales of non-core assets and borrowings under our credit facility
may also be used to supplement funding of capital expenditures.  The timing of capital
expenditures and the receipt of cash flows do not necessarily match, which may cause us to
borrow and repay funds under our Credit Facility from time-to-time.  See Bank Debt below for
further information regarding our credit facility.

As of June 30, 2016, we had 100 gross wells awaiting completion: 26 Permian Basin and 74
Mid-Continent.  We also had six operated rigs running: three in the Permian Basin and three in
the Mid-Continent region.
We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental and safety
regulations and requirements.  These costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our
ongoing operations.  We do not anticipate that we will be required to expend amounts that will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations, nor are we aware of any
pending regulatory changes that would have a material impact, based on current laws and
regulations.  While we expect pending or new legislation or regulations to increase the cost of
business, at this time it is not possible to quantify the impact on our business.  Compliance with
pending or new legislation or regulations could increase our costs or adversely affect demand for
oil or gas and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations.
Financial Condition
During the first six months of 2016, our total assets decreased $711.5 million (14%) to
$4.5 billion, compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2015.  The decrease was mainly
attributable to the $629.3 million of impairments to our oil and gas properties and a $137.6 million
decrease in cash and cash equivalents.
Total liabilities declined by $260.6 million (11%) to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2016, compared to
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2015.  The decrease is primarily due to a $260.3 million decrease in
deferred income taxes stemming from our net loss for the first six months of 2016.
Stockholders’ equity totaled $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, down 16% from $2.8 billion at
December 31, 2015.  The decrease was mainly attributable to our net loss of $456.4 million for
the first six months of 2016.
The decreases in our total assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity and our net loss during the
first six months of 2016 resulted primarily from the continued impact of lower realized commodity
prices which resulted in lower production revenues and impairments of our oil and gas
properties.  See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS above for further information.

At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no bank debt outstanding.  All of our long-term
debt is senior unsecured debt and is, therefore, pari passu with other unsecured debt with
respect to the payment of both principal and interest.
Bank Debt
Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) has an aggregate commitment from
the lenders of $1.0 billion and matures on October 16, 2020.  We have the option to increase the
commitment to $1.25 billion at any time.  The Credit Facility is not a borrowing base facility
subject to the discretion of the lenders and is not based on the value of our proved reserves.
At June 30, 2016, we had letters of credit outstanding of $2.5 million under the Credit Facility,
leaving an unused borrowing availability of $997.5 million.  We did not have any bank debt
outstanding during the first six months of 2016.  During the first six months of 2015 we had
average daily bank debt outstanding of $55.2 thousand and the highest amount of bank
borrowings outstanding during that period was $10.0 million, occurring in May.
The Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that are
customary for investment grade, senior unsecured bank credit agreements, including a financial
covenant for the maintenance of a defined total debt-to-capital ratio of no greater than 65%.   As
of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the financial and non-financial
covenants.  For further information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility see Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.
Senior Notes
Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.  Each of the senior notes is governed by
an indenture containing customary covenants, events of default and other restrictive provisions
with which we were in compliance at June 30, 2016.
Working Capital Analysis
Our working capital fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in our cash and cash equivalents,
increases or decreases in our realized commodity prices and production volumes, changes in
receivables and payables related to our operating and E&D activities and changes in our oil and
gas well equipment and supplies.
At June 30, 2016, we had working capital of $514.3 million, a decrease of $153.6 million
compared to working capital of $667.9 million at December 31, 2015.
Working capital decreases consisted of the following:
·Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $137.6 million.
·Net derivative instruments decreased by $38.0 million.
·Oil and gas well equipment and supplies decreased by $16.7 million.
32
Table of Contents
Decreases in working capital were partially offset by the following increases:
·Operations-related accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $25.2 million.
·Accrued liabilities related to our E&D expenditures decreased by $10.0 million.
·Operations-related accounts receivable increased by $4.3 million.
Accounts receivable are a major component of our working capital and include a diverse group of
companies comprised of major energy companies, pipeline companies, local distribution
companies and other end-users.  The collection of receivables during the periods presented has
been timely. Historically, losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been
significant.
Dividends
A quarterly cash dividend has been paid to stockholders every quarter since the first quarter of
2006.  In February 2016, the quarterly dividend was decreased to $0.08 per share from $0.16 per
share.  In May 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share.  The
dividend is payable on September 1, 2016 to stockholders of record on August 15, 2016.  Future
dividend payments will depend on our level of earnings, financing requirements, and other
factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.
Dividends declared are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings to the extent retained
earnings are available at the close of the period prior to the date of the declared
dividend.  Dividends in excess of retained earnings are recorded as a reduction of additional
paid-in capital.  For the dividends declared in May 2016, all of the dividends declared ($7.6
million) were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material
off-balance sheet obligations.  As of June 30, 2016, our material off-balance sheet arrangements
included operating lease agreements, which are customary in the oil and gas industry and are
included in the table below.
Contractual Obligations and Material Commitments

regarding fixed and variable rate debt.
(2)We have drilling commitments of approximately $222.4 million consisting of obligations to
finish drilling and completing wells in progress at June 30, 2016.  We also have various
commitments for drilling rigs. The total minimum expenditure commitments under these
agreements are $3.8 million.
(3)We have not included the long-term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to
precisely predict the timing of these amounts.
(4)Other liabilities include the estimated value of our commitment associated with our benefit
obligations, the fair value of our liabilities associated with our derivative contracts and other
miscellaneous commitments.

At June 30, 2016, we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately 46.7 Bcf of natural gas
over the next 28 months.  If this gas is not delivered, our financial commitment would be
approximately $116.9 million.  This commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual
volumes delivered.  However, we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our
current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations.
In connection with gas gathering and processing agreements, we have volume commitments
over the next ten years.  If no gas is delivered, the maximum amount that would be payable under
these commitments would be approximately $190.2 million.  However, we believe no financial
commitment will be due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which
we can fulfill these obligations.
We have minimum volume delivery commitments in connection with agreements to reimburse
connection costs to various pipelines.  The maximum amount that would be payable if no gas is
delivered would be approximately $12.5 million.  Of this total, we have accrued a liability of $10.6
million.  Due to reduced drilling activity in 2015 and projected for 2016, we may have additional
liabilities associated with these delivery commitments in the future.
We have other various transportation, delivery and facilities commitments in the normal course of
business, which approximate $35.7 million.  We anticipate meeting these obligations.
All of the noted commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business.
Taking into account current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production, we believe
that our net cash flow generated from operations and our other capital resources will be adequate
to meet future obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We consider accounting policies related to oil and gas reserves, full cost accounting, goodwill,
contingencies, asset retirement obligations and income taxes to be critical policies and
estimates.  These are summarized in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
Recent Accounting Developments
Please refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation – Recently Issued Accounting Standards, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements and their anticipated effect on our business.
ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and
interest rates.  The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses,
but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses.
Price Fluctuations
Our major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil, gas and NGL production.  The prices we
receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many
factors that are beyond our control.  Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production has been volatile and
unpredictable. Oil sales contributed 54% of our total production revenue for the first six months of
2016. Gas sales accounted for 30% and NGL sales contributed 16%. A $1.00 per barrel change
in our realized oil price would have resulted in a $8.2 million change in revenues. A $0.10 per
Mcf change in our realized gas price would have resulted in a $8.5 million change in our gas
revenues. A $1.00 per barrel change in NGL prices would have changed revenues by $7.1
million.

Table of Contents
We periodically enter into financial derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our price risk
associated with our future oil and gas production. At June 30, 2016, we have gas collars in place
for the years 2016 and 2017 with a net total fair value liability of $11.6 million. We have oil collars
in place for the years 2016 and 2017 with a net total fair value liability of $18.9 million.  See
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information
regarding derivative instruments.
While these contracts limit the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit
future revenues from favorable price movements. For the gas contracts described above, a
hypothetical $0.10 change in the price below or above the contracted price applied to the
notional amounts would cause a change of $4.3 million in our gain (loss) on mark-to-market
derivatives in 2016.  For the oil contracts described above, a hypothetical $1.00 change in the
price below or above the contracted price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change
of $4.3 million in our gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives in 2016.
Interest Rate Risk
At June 30, 2016, our long-term debt consisted of $750 million in 5.875% senior notes that will
mature on May 1, 2022 and $750 million in 4.375% senior notes that will mature on June 1, 2024.
   Because all of our long-term debt is at a fixed rate, we consider our interest rate exposure to be
minimal.  This sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities because of the short-term maturity of such instruments.   See
Note 2 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional
information regarding debt.
ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Cimarex management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), have evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of June 30, 2016.  Based on that
evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports
filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.  The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow such persons to make timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
