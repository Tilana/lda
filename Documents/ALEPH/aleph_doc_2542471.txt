Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
(1)   Basis of Presentation of Financial Statements
The following interim consolidated financial statements of Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the
“Company”) are unaudited and prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for Form 10-Q. Such rules and regulations allow the omission of certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles as long as the statements are not misleading. In the opinion of management, these financial
statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the periods
presented. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements of the Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2004, filed March 31, 2005.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions
relate to coal reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units-of-production depreciation, depletion
and amortization calculations; environmental and reclamation obligations; asset impairments; post-employment, post-
retirement and other employee benefit liabilities; valuation allowances for deferred taxes; reserves for contingencies
and litigation; and the fair value and accounting treatment of certain financial instruments. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. In addition, different
assumptions or conditions could reasonably be expected to yield different results. The operating results for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 may not necessarily be indicative of the results to be expected in
the fourth quarter or for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. and its indirect subsidiary, Foundation Coal Corporation (“FCC”), were formed to
acquire the North American coal mining assets of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
RAG Coal International AG (“RAG”), which acquisition closed on July 30, 2004 (the “acquisition”). The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
were recorded at their fair market values as of the date of acquisition. The Company performed the purchase price
allocation based on the results of an independent appraisal performed by a reputable consulting firm well known in the
industry, actuarial valuations of employee benefits performed by consulting actuaries and other internal analysis.
Certain judgments and estimates by the Company regarding future cash flows from individual mine sites, employee
benefit assumptions and other plans were integral to the valuations performed by the valuation specialists. During the
quarter ended September 30, 2005, the purchase price accounting allocations related to the acquisition were finalized
as described in Note 3.
RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. had two primary operating units: Riverton Coal Production, Inc. and subsidiaries
(“RCP”) and RAG American Coal Company, LLC and subsidiaries (“RACC”). On February 29, 2004, RACC signed a
definitive Stock Purchase Agreement to sell RAG Coal AG’s Colorado operations which included Twentymile Coal
Company, RAG Empire Corporation, RAG Shoshone Coal

Corporation and Colorado Yampa Coal Company (collectively referred to as the RAG Colorado Business Unit) to a
subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation. This transaction closed on April 15, 2004. Accordingly, all references to
Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc., exclude the RAG Colorado Business Unit which is accounted for and presented in the
accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations. Prior period financial statements have also been
restated to reflect the RAG Colorado Business Unit as a discontinued operation.
The following provides a description of the basis of presentation during all periods presented:
“Successor”—represents the consolidated financial position of Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. and consolidated
subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the period from February 9, 2004 (date of formation) through September 30, 2004, and the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2005. Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. had no significant activities until the
acquisition on July 30, 2004. Therefore, the results of operations and cash flows for the period from February 9, 2004
(date of formation) through September 30, 2004 reflect only the activity for the two month period ended September 30,
2004.
“Predecessor”—represents the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc.
and subsidiaries for all periods prior to the acquisition. This presentation reflects the historical basis of accounting.
The consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 and
the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting, in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 141, Business Combinations.
Unless otherwise indicated, “the Company” as used throughout the remainder of these notes to the consolidated
financial statements refers to both the Successor and the Predecessor.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.
(2)   Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-
Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123R”), which replaces SFAS No. 123, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB No. 25”). SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements
based on their fair value at the grant date. SFAS No. 123R generally requires companies to measure the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (such as stock options and restricted
stock) based on the grant-date fair value of the award, and to recognize that cost over the period during which the
employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period of the award). FAS 123R also requires the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as
an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and
increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under
SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement
8

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
recognition. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) delayed the implementation of
SFAS No. 123R from its original implementation date by six months for most registrants, requiring all public
companies to adopt FAS 123R no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. The
Company expects to adopt this standard on January 1, 2006. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R cannot be
reasonably predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future.
However, had the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R during the prior period, the results are expected to be consistent
with the pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123, except that forfeitures will be considered in the calculation of
compensation expense under SFAS No. 123R. When adopted, the Company may elect to change the valuation
method or assumptions and such changes could have a material impact on the amount of stock-based compensation
the Company records.
In March 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached consensus on Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping
Costs in the Mining Industry (“EITF Issue 04-6”) concluding that post-production stripping costs are a component of
mineral inventory costs subject to the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing,
(“ARB No. 43”). The FASB ratified the EITF consensus. Based upon this consensus, post production stripping costs
are considered costs of the extracted minerals under a full absorption costing system and are recognized as a
component of inventory to be recognized in costs of coal sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the
inventory. In addition, capitalization of such costs would be appropriate only to the extent inventory exists at the end
of a reporting period. The guidance in this consensus will be effective for financial statements issued for the first
reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. At a June EITF
meeting, the Task Force modified the transition provisions of EITF Issue 04-6, indicating that companies that adopt in
periods beginning after June 29, 2005 may utilize a cumulative effect adjustment approach where the cumulative
effect adjustment is recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption. Alternatively, a company may
recognize this change in accounting by restatement of its prior-period financial statements through retrospective
application. The Company expects to adopt EITF Issue 04-6 on January 1, 2006 and expects to utilize the cumulative
effect adjustment approach and record an adjustment directly to retained earnings upon adoption. Historically, the
Company recorded stripping costs associated with in-process production as a separate component of inventory
described as deferred overburden in Note 4. At September 30, 2005, such stripping costs associated with coal that
has not been extracted was $46,089. Applying the requirements of this EITF as of September 30, 2005 would have
resulted in a maximum decrease of $46,089 in inventory with the off-set recorded to retained earnings, net of tax. The
effect on the financial statements upon adoption on January 1, 2006 will depend on the balance of deferred
overburden included in the Company’s inventory at December 31, 2005.
The FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” in
March 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair
value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. This interpretation also clarifies the circumstances under which
an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This
Interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company does
not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its financial statements.

(3)   Acquisition of RAG
On July 30, 2004, the Company, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary FCC, acquired 100% of the outstanding
common shares of all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of RAG engaged in coal mining in North America for a
purchase price of $986,918 including associated transaction costs of approximately $19,618. The purchase price
along with the associated transaction costs were funded by $196,000 of cash from shareholder’s equity contributed to
the Company and its subsidiaries FC2 Corp. and FCC by Foundation Coal Holdings, LLC (“LLC”); $300,000 of cash
proceeds from 71¤4% Senior Notes due 2014 issued by Foundation PA Coal Company
(“Foundation PA”); and $530,000 of cash proceeds from a senior secured credit facility consisting
of a term loan facility and revolving credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit
Facility issued by Foundation PA, consisted of $470,000 from the term loan and $60,000 draw
from the revolving credit facility.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair market values as of the date of acquisition. The allocation of the
purchase price for the acquisition has been finalized and recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements as of and for the period subsequent to July 30, 2005.
The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation based on the fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
Accounts receivable
Materials and supplies inventories
Coal inventory
Other current assets
Owned surface lands
Plant, equipment, mine development, asset retirement costs

The purchase price allocation was completed based upon analysis provided by an independent appraisal performed by
a reputable consulting firm well known in the industry, actuarial valuations of employee benefits performed by
consulting actuaries and other internal analysis. Certain judgments and estimates by the Company regarding future
cash flows from individual mine sites, employee benefit assumptions and other plans were integral to the valuations
performed by the valuation specialists.
Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses
were stated at historical carrying values. Given the short-term nature of these assets and
10
Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
liabilities, it was determined that these historical carrying values approximate fair value. The Company’s projected
pension, post-retirement and post-employment benefit obligations and assets have been reflected in the allocation of
purchase price at the projected benefit obligation less plan assets at fair market value, based on independent
actuaries engaged by the Company. Deferred income taxes have been provided in the consolidated balance sheet
based on the Company’s estimated tax versus book basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as adjusted
to estimated fair values. Owned surface lands, inventory, plant, equipment, mine development costs, owned and
leased mineral rights and coal supply agreements have been recorded at estimated fair value based on work
performed by the independent valuation specialists as of the date of the acquisition, subsequently adjusted by
management to reflect the final accounting allocation of the purchase price.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the Company completed the purchase price allocation and recorded
final purchase accounting adjustments that reduced the fair value of total assets acquired and liabilities assumed by
$59,568, respectively, or approximately 3% of the fair value assigned. The most significant component of this
decrease related to a revision in deferred income tax liabilities associated with projected post-retirement benefit
obligations resulting from changes in the assumptions regarding the impact on these obligations of the Medicare
Part D prescription drug benefits. The effect of the reduction between the preliminary and final purchase price
allocation on assets acquired was a decrease in the fair value assigned to owned and leased mineral rights assets of
$59,320, a decrease in coal supply agreement assets of $4,384, offset by an increase in the fair value of land and
other assets of $4,136. The effect of the reduction between the preliminary and final purchase price allocation on
assumed liabilities was a decrease in coal supply agreement liabilities of $10,533, a decrease in accounts payable
and accrued expenses of $1,042 and a decrease in deferred income taxes and other noncurrent liabilities of $47,993.
Coal supply agreement assets or liabilities are amortized over the term of the contracts based on the tons of coal
shipped under each contract. Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, amortization of the asset for above
market contracts was anticipated to be approximately $20,000, $11,000, $7,000 and $6,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Subsequent to the final purchase accounting adjustments
discussed above, amortization of the asset for above market contracts is anticipated to decrease by approximately
$1,700, $700, $600 and $500 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Based on
the preliminary purchase price allocation, amortization of the liability for below market contracts was anticipated to be
approximately ($42,000), ($15,000), ($4,000) and ($1,000) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008 and
2009, respectively. Subsequent to the final purchase accounting adjustments discussed above, amortization of the
liability for above market contracts is anticipated to decrease by approximately $3,600, $1,100, $200 and $100 for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the Company’s Northern Appalachia business unit took delivery of one
hundred new longwall shields to remedy a warranty issue associated with shields currently used in their underground
mining operations. The Company entered into a purchase commitment for the shields in the amount of $21,685, and in
accordance with the payment terms related to the purchase commitment, periodic progress payments to the
manufacturer are not scheduled to start until the fourth quarter of 2007, with scheduled completion within one year. As
a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a deferred purchase commitment liability of $17,826 representing
the present value of the future payments due in accordance with the terms of the purchase commitment. Interest
expense will be imputed and recognized in a manner consistent with the established payment terms, ultimately
increasing the liability to its full value of $21,685.

(13)   Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records compensation expense for all employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
(“APB No. 25”) and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recorded over the vesting
period to the extent that the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeds the exercise or acquisition
price of the stock or stock-based award. We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, (“SFAS No. 123”), as amended by SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 (“SFAS No. 148”).

Had compensation expense for stock option grants been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates
consistent with the method required by SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net income available to common shareholders
and earnings per common share would have been changed to the pro forma amounts as indicated in the following
table. The Predecessor had no stock option plans; therefore, no Predecessor information is presented.

The Company granted restricted stock performance unit awards (“performance units”) to certain key employees in
March 2005. All of the performance units granted are subject to continued employment and vest on each
December 31, beginning December 31, 2005 and ending on December 31, 2007 contingent upon the achievement of
certain annual performance targets. Shares of common stock are then awarded in March of the year following the final
vesting period. Compensation expense of approximately $655 and $1,025 (pretax) were recorded for the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 for the initial year’s performance units that management expects will
vest on December 31, 2005.
(14)   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Predecessor entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective June 20, 1999 to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates relating to its outstanding variable rate debt. The interest rate swap agreement was
designated as a cash flow hedge, and was designed to be entirely effective by matching the terms of the swap
agreement with the debt. The base rate for both the debt and the swap is LIBOR and the instruments have the same
renewal dates over the lives of the instruments. The contract’s notional amount was $434,000 at inception, and
declined semi-annually over the life of the contract in proportion to the Predecessor’s outstanding balance on its
related debt. The Predecessor paid a fixed rate of 6.55% and received six-month LIBOR which reset every 180 days.
The maturity date of the contract was July 30, 2009. However, in connection with the definitive Stock Purchase
Agreement for the sale of the RAG Colorado Business Unit entered into on February 29, 2004, the Predecessor
notified the holders of the variable rate
18
Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
notes of their intention to repay the notes. Accordingly, the interest rate swaps no longer qualified for hedge
accounting treatment and in the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the full amount of unrealized loss included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was recognized in net income. The Predecessor settled the interest rate
swaps in April 2004. Between February 29, 2004 and April 27, 2004, mark-to-market gains on the interest rate swaps
were $5,804 and were included in other income.
On September 30, 2004, the Successor entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements on a
notional amount of $85,000. The term of these swaps is for three years. Under these swaps, the Company receives a
variable rate of three month US dollar LIBOR and pays a fixed rate of 3.26%. Settlement of interest payments occurs
quarterly. The Company was required to enter into these swaps in order to maintain at least 50% of its outstanding
debt at a fixed rate as required by the Senior Credit Facility. These swap agreements essentially convert $85,000 of
the Company’s variable rate borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility to fixed rate borrowings for a three year period
beginning September 30, 2004. Effective January 1, 2005, the Company designated these interest rate swaps as
cash flow hedges of the variable interest payments due on $85,000 of its variable rate date through September 2007
under SFAS No 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities upon completion of the
effectiveness testing and related documentation. As of September 30, 2005, the fair value of this cash flow hedge
was $1,987 which was recorded as a noncurrent asset and the offsetting unrealized gain of $873, net of tax expense
was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of these swaps was
$530 which was recorded as a noncurrent asset.
(15)   Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company’s mining activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection
of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive.
The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations
are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company has made, and expects to make in the
future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the amount of such future
expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements.
The following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) liability from December 31,
2004 through September 30, 2005:
Asset retirement obligation, December 31, 2004
Accretion expense

Revisions in estimated cash flows and liabilities incurred relate specifically to a recent annual review and increase in
the final reclamation bond amount associated with our open pit operations in the Powder River Basin.

The current portions of the asset retirement obligation liabilities of $4,411 and $4,398 at September 30, 2005 and
December 31, 2004, respectively, are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as illustrated in Note
8. There were no assets that were legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations at
September 30, 2005 or December 31, 2004, respectively.
(16)   Stockholders’ Equity and Earnings Per Share
Stockholder’s Equity
On December 8, 2004, the Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO” or “Offering”) of 23,610,000 shares of
common stock. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were
approximately $481,100. On December 8, 2004 immediately preceding the IPO, the Board of Directors (the “Board”)
approved, authorized and declared a 0.879639 for one reverse stock split of all the 19,600,000 common shares issued
and outstanding thereby reducing common shares outstanding to approximately 17,240,900 shares. The Board also
approved the declaration of two separate cash dividends of $0.058 and $25.41 per share, respectively, of common
stock issued and outstanding for shareholders of record. The Company used approximately $434,000 of the net
proceeds from the Offering to pay the dividends to its stockholders. The Company used the remaining net proceeds of
approximately $47,100 to repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. The
Underwriting Agreement provided for up to 3,541,500 shares of common stock to be reserved for the satisfaction of an
over-allotment option allowing the underwriters an option to purchase additional shares. Pursuant to this underwriters’
option 511,900 shares were sold generating net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated
offering expenses, of approximately $10,560. The Company used these proceeds and cash on hand to pay an
additional dividend to its existing stockholders in January 2005 in the amount of $11,142. The Board declared a stock
dividend for the remaining over-allotment shares not purchased by the underwriters to the stockholders of record
immediately prior to the IPO. All per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and related notes
reflect the stock dividend.
On December 8, 2004, the Board declared a stock dividend of 3,029,600 shares which was distributed in
January 2005 to all shareholders of record on December 8, 2004. Additionally, the Board declared a stock dividend of
231,621 shares distributed in January 2005 to members of management. In the aggregate, these stock dividends were
valued at $71,747 or $22 per share, representing the price at which all shares were sold in conjunction with the
December 8, 2004 IPO. The dividends were accounted for as stock dividends distributable in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004. All earnings per share information in the consolidated financial
statements and notes have appropriately reflected these stock dividends.
On February 15, 2005, the Board declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of $0.04 per share to shareholders of
record on March 7, 2005. The $1,785 dividend was paid on March 28, 2005. On May 20, 2005, the Board declared a
cash dividend for the second quarter of $0.04 per share to shareholders of record on June 14, 2005. The $1,785
dividend was paid on June 28, 2005. On August 9, 2005, the Board declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of
$0.05 per share to shareholders of record on September 14, 2005. The $2,232 dividend was paid on September 30,
2005.

At September 30, 2005, the Company’s accruals for reclamation and mine closure totaled $116,250. The portion of
the costs expected to be incurred within a year of $4,411 at September 30, 2005 is included in accrued expenses and
other current liabilities. At September 30, 2005, these regulatory obligations are secured by surety bonds in the
amount of $229,176. These surety bonds are partially collateralized by letters of credit issued by the Company.
Guarantees
One of our former parent companies, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, remains a guarantor with regard to future
minimum royalties payable under leases through the first quarter 2006 to Blackhawk Coal Company, an affiliate of
American Electric Power. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated May 12, 1999 between RAG Coal
International AG and Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, the Predecessor guaranteed Cyprus Amax performance under
this obligation by issuing an irrevocable letter of credit to secure the minimum royalty payments still due. The
Company assumed this guarantee in the acquisition. The amount of this letter of credit is reduced as the Company
makes the scheduled payments. At September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the letter of credit amount was
$3,000 and $6,000, respectively.
Neweagle Industries, Inc. (“Neweagle”) is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company. Starting in early 2001,
Neweagle supplied and sold coal to Arch Coal Sales Company, Inc. (“Arch Sales”) pursuant to a Conditional Coal
Supply Agreement dated October 1, 1996 (CCSA). This coal was in turn

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
resold by Arch Sales under a separate and distinct Coal Sales Agreement dated October 1, 1989 (“Rocky Mount
Contract”) with Cogentrix of Rocky Mount, Inc. (“Cogentrix”) as the buyer which expires December 31, 2013. On
March 23, 2003, the Predecessor (now known as Foundation American Coal Holding, LLC) conditionally issued to
Arch Sales a Guaranty and Indemnity (“Guaranty”) of Neweagle’s performance under the CCSA, and also agreed to
indemnify Arch Sales and its affiliates and other parties for any liability related to the Rocky Mount Contract. As part
of a global settlement of litigation relating to numerous issues between affiliates of the Predecessor and Arch Sales, a
Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (“MRSA”) was executed effective November 12, 2004. Pursuant to the
MRSA, the CCSA and the Guaranty were terminated. Also pursuant to the MRSA, Neweagle agreed to continue
selling and supplying coal to Arch in the quantities required under the Rocky Mount Contract for re-sale by Arch to
Cogentrix thereunder. The MRSA also was executed by the Predecessor (now known as Foundation American Coal
Holding, LLC) As a signatory to the MRSA, Foundation American Coal Holding, LLC and Neweagle agreed to
indemnify, defend, and save harmless Arch and its affiliates from any non-performance, default or breach of
(i) Neweagle’s obligation to supply coal to Arch Sales under the MSRA and (ii) for so long as the MRSA remains in
force, any default, breach, or non-fulfillment of Arch Sales contract obligations under the Rocky Mount Contract as a
result of acts or omissions (other than by Cogentrix) occurring on or after November 12, 2004.
Neweagle Industries, Inc., Neweagle Coal Sales Corp., Laurel Creek Co., Inc. and Rockspring Development, Inc.
(“Sellers”) are wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company. The Sellers sell coal to Birchwood Power Partners,
L.P. (“Birchwood”) under a Coal Supply Agreement dated July 22, 1993 which expires November 15, 2021 (Birchwood
Contract). Laurel Creek Co., Inc. and Rockspring Development, Inc. were parties to the Birchwood Contract since its
inception, at which time those entities were not affiliated with Neweagle Industries, Inc., Neweagle Coal Sales Corp.,
or the Company. Effective January 31, 1994, the Birchwood Contract was assigned to Neweagle Industries, Inc. and
Neweagle Coal Sales Corp. by AgipCoal Holding USA, Inc. and AgipCoal Sales USA, Inc., which at the time were
affiliates of Arch Coal, Inc. Despite this assignment, Arch Coal, Inc. (“Arch”) and its affiliates have separate
contractual obligations to provide coal to Birchwood if Sellers fail to perform. Pursuant to an Agreement & Release
dated September 30, 1997, the Predecessor (now known as Foundation American Coal Holding, LLC) agreed to
defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Arch and its subsidiaries from and against any claims arising out of any failure
of Sellers to perform under the Birchwood Contract. By acknowledgement dated February 16, 2005, the Predecessor
and Arch acknowledged the continuing validity and effect of the Agreement & Release dated September 30, 1997.
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to guarantees and financial instruments with off-balance
sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, performance or surety bonds and other guarantees and indemnities, which
are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such financial instruments are valued based on
the amount of exposure under the instrument and likelihood of performance being required. In the Company’s past
experience, no claims have been made against these financial instruments. Management does not expect any
material losses to result from these guarantees or off-balance-sheet instruments and, therefore, is of the opinion that
their fair value is zero.
Contingencies
Several of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in several separate complaints filed in Raleigh and
Wyoming Counties, West Virginia, starting in late 2001, alleging personal injury and property
25
Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
damage caused by flooding on or about July 8, 2001. Similar suits may be filed in the future based on this or
subsequent weather events. The general alleged basis for the lawsuits is that coal mining, oil and gas drilling and
timbering operations altered the topography in the area to such an extent that flooding resulting from heavy rains
caused more severe damage than would have otherwise resulted. Numerous similar complaints were filed by
hundreds of plaintiffs against over 100 defendants, in a total of seven southern West Virginia counties. All such civil
actions have been referred by the West Virginia Supreme Court to a three-judge panel, sitting in Raleigh County,
pursuant to the Court’s Mass Litigation Rule.
On December 9, 2004, the West Virginia Supreme Court issued an opinion addressing certain questions of law
certified to it by the three-judge panel. Among other rulings, the Supreme Court decision held that plaintiffs may not
proceed under a strict liability theory, as had been asserted in their complaints. The court also held that where
damages can be shown to have been caused by an unusual act of nature combined with the conduct of a defendant,
the defendant should be given an opportunity to show by clear and convincing evidence that it caused only a portion
of those damages, in order to avoid incurring liability for all damages.
In March 2005 the three judge panel issued a scheduling order indicating that six different trials will be held, one for
each watershed impacted. Each trial will be held in two phases with the liability phase being held first, and then a
damages phase. The first trial is currently scheduled to commence in March 2006. This will relate to flooding in the
Upper Guyandotte River watershed in which our affiliates do have operations. Discovery and other pretrial proceedings
associated with this first trial are now underway.
We believe the claims against our entities are fully covered by insurance. Common defense counsel and experts are
representing numerous defendants and costs are being shared. While the outcome of litigation is subject to
uncertainties, based on our preliminary evaluation of the issues and the potential impact on us, we believe this matter
will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Extensive regulation of the impacts of mining on the environment and related litigation has had and may have a
significant effect on our costs of production and competitive position. Further regulations, legislation or litigation may
also cause our sales or profitability to decline by hindering our ability to continue our mining operations, by increasing
our costs, or by causing coal to become a less attractive fuel source.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in various claims and other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Overview
We are the fifth largest coal company in the United States operating nine mining complexes that consist of thirteen
individual coal mines. Our mining operations are located in southwest Pennsylvania, southern West Virginia, southern
Illinois and the southern Powder River Basin region of Wyoming. Three of our mining complexes are surface mines,
two of our complexes are underground mines using highly efficient longwall mining technology and the remaining four
complexes are underground mines that utilize continuous miners. In addition to mining coal, we also purchase coal
from other producers and utilize it with our own production in coal brokering and trading activities.
Our primary product is steam coal, sold primarily to electric power generators located in the United States.
Approximately 9% of our coal sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 8% of our pro-forma
sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was made from the sale of metallurgical coal to the
domestic and export metallurgical coal markets where it is used to make coke for steel production.
While the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of coal, we also realize revenues from coal production
royalties, override royalty payments from a coal supply agreement now fulfilled by another producer, fees from the
processing of our production by a synfuel facility, fees to transload coal through our Rivereagle facility on the Big
Sandy River and revenues from the sale of coalbed methane.
From July 1, 1999 through July 29, 2004, we were a stand-alone wholly owned subsidiary of RAG Coal International
AG (“RAG”) headquartered in Essen, Germany. In October 2003, RAG announced its intention to divest its
international mining subsidiaries. In addition to RAG American Coal Holding, Inc., these international mining
subsidiaries consisted of operations in Australia and Venezuela. On February 29, 2004, RAG announced the sale of
four of our subsidiaries, collectively known as the RAG Colorado Business Unit, to a third party. The subsidiaries
comprising the RAG Colorado Business Unit owned an underground longwall mine located in Routt County, Colorado,
an idled underground longwall mine located in Moffat County, Colorado and surface lands located in northwest
Colorado and southern Wyoming. The transaction closed on April 15, 2004. In the financial statements of the
Predecessor for the first quarter of 2004, the RAG Colorado Business Unit was classified as a discontinued operation.
On May 24, 2004, RAG, entered into a definitive agreement with Foundation Coal Corporation, which was owned by
affiliates of First Reserve, Blackstone and AMCI, to sell all of its operations except the RAG Colorado Business Unit
which was sold on April 15, 2004. The transaction closed on July 30, 2004.
Results of Continuing Operations
Basis of Presentation:
RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding the subsidiaries comprising the RAG Colorado
Business Unit which were sold on April 15, 2004, were acquired by a subsidiary of Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. on
July 30, 2004. Due to the change in ownership, and the resultant
28
application of purchase accounting, the historical financial statements of the Predecessor and the Successor included
in this Form 10-Q have been prepared on different bases for the periods presented and are not comparable.
The following provides a description of the basis of presentation during all periods presented:
Successor—represents the consolidated financial position of Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. as
of December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2005, our consolidated results of operations for the
quarter ended September 30, 2005 and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for
the nine months ended September 30, 2005. Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. had no significant
activities until the acquisition on July 30, 2004. Our consolidated financial position at
September 30, 2005, and our consolidated results of operations for the quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 2005 reflect the final purchase price allocation based on appraisals
prepared by independent valuation specialists, employee benefit valuations prepared by
independent actuaries and other internal analysis. Deferred income taxes have been provided in
the consolidated balance sheet based on the tax versus book basis of the fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, we
completed the purchase price allocation, and recorded final purchase accounting adjustments
that reduced the fair value of the total assets acquired by approximately $60 million, or
approximately 3%, of the preliminary value assigned to the assets acquired. The most significant
final purchase accounting adjustment reduced deferred income tax liabilities, with corresponding
changes to the values assigned to owned and leased mineral rights and coal supply agreements,
due to a change in assumption as to how Medicare Part D will be implemented with regard to
retiree health care obligations. The preliminary valuation of deferred income taxes assumed that
Medicare Part D would be coordinated with the Company’s retiree health care plans. Additional
information obtained and analysis performed prior to the finalization of purchase accounting
caused this assumption to change to an expectation that the Company will utilize the income tax
free subsidy offered under Medicare Part D. Our consolidated financial position at December 31,
2004 reflected our preliminary estimates of purchase price allocation before the final purchase
accounting adjustments described above. The application of purchase accounting to the
acquired assets of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. resulted in increases to owned and leased
mineral rights, surface lands, coal inventories, and the asset arising from recognition of asset
retirement obligations. It resulted in decreases to plant and equipment and current deferred taxes.
In addition, the historical cost assigned to deferred overburden in the acquired asset balance
sheet was eliminated. The values assigned to uncovered and partially covered coal lands
considered the stage of the mining process in which these two groups of coal lands were at the
acquisition date. The application of purchase accounting to the acquired liabilities of RAG
American Coal Holding, Inc. resulted in increases to postretirement health care obligations,
pension obligations, black lung obligations, asset retirement obligations and noncurrent deferred
taxes. Separate assets or liabilities were established to reflect the valuation of above or below
market coal supply agreements in relation to market price curves. With regard to consolidated
results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005, the
principal effects of the application of purchase accounting, in comparison to reporting for
historical periods, were to decrease the cost of coal sold due to lower expenses for
postretirement health care and pensions, to decrease the cost of coal sold for net deferrals of
deferred overburden costs, to decrease net amortization expense for coal supply agreements
which is now a credit because our contracts at acquisition represented a net liability, and to
increase the cost of depletion expense for owned and leased mineral rights.
Predecessor—represents the results of operations for RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. for the
one and seven months ended July 29, 2004 and cash flows for RAG American Coal Holding, Inc.
for the seven months ended July 29, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are based
on the historical assets, liabilities, sales and expenses of the Predecessor for these periods.
Pro forma—To facilitate the three and nine month period comparisons throughout management’s
discussion and analysis, we discuss “pro forma” results for the quarter and nine month periods
ended
29
September 30, 2004. The pro forma results present the third quarter and first nine months of 2004 as if Foundation
Coal Holdings, Inc.: (a) acquired RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. on January 1, 2004; (b) completed the Initial Public
Offering on January 1, 2004; and transacted the sale of the RAG Colorado Business Unit and associated repayment
of Predecessor bank debt and settlement of Predecessor interest rate swaps on December 31, 2003. Pro-forma
amounts are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP operating
measures. Management believes that the discussion of pro forma operating results is important to the readers of the
financial statements to understand key operating trends in comparing the third quarter of 2005 to the third quarter of
2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005 to the nine months ended September 30, 2004. In the following
sections tables present unaudited results of operations for the Successor for the quarter ended September 30, 2005,
unaudited results of operations for the Predecessor on a pro forma basis as described above for the quarter ended
September 30, 2004, unaudited results of operations for the Successor for the nine months ended September 30,
2005, and unaudited results of operations for the Predecessor on a pro forma basis as described above for the nine
months ended September 30, 2004.
Quarter ended September 30, 2005—Successor compared to period July 1 through July 29, 2004—
Predecessor and period February 9 (date of formation) through September 30, 2004 (two month operating
period)—Successor
As previously described there are significant differences in the basis of financial reporting between the Successor and
Predecessor periods as a result of the purchase of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. by Foundation Coal Corporation
on July 30, 2004, and the resultant application of purchase accounting to the assets and liabilities acquired. The
Successor reported income from continuing operations of $21.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005
whereas the Predecessor reported a loss from continuing operations of $42.3 million for period July 1 through July 29,
2004 and the Successor reported income from continuing operations of $10.3 million for the two month operating
period ended September 30, 2005.
During the period July 1 through July 29, 2004, the Predecessor recorded a non-cash pre-tax loss related to a coal
contact settlement in the amount of $26.0 million and $21.7 million of pre-tax expenses for early debt extinguishment.
These non-recurring charges, net of income tax benefits, were the main reasons for the loss from continuing
operations.
During the third quarter of 2005, the Successor achieved stronger production and tons sold and enjoyed significantly
higher per ton sales realizations. Year-over-year increases in cost of coal sales, selling general and administrative
expenses and depreciation, depletion and amortization were more than absorbed by higher coal sales revenues. The
operating trends discussed in the following section, Historical quarter ended September 30, 2005 compared to pro
forma quarter ended September 30, 2004, also apply to comparisons of the two Successor periods and the
Predecessor period July 1 through July 29, 2004.

Coal sales realization per ton sold
Coal sales revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased by 32.8% compared to the pro forma coal
sales revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 as a result of an 11.2% increase in tons sold and a 19.9%
increase in average coal sales realization per ton.
Coal sales volumes in Northern Appalachia increased by 0.6 million tons (21%) as a result of increased production
from both Cumberland and Emerald mines. During the third quarter of 2004 production from the Emerald mine was
reduced due to adverse mining conditions experienced while mining the last portion of a longwall panel prior to a
scheduled longwall move that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2004. Coal sales volumes in Central Appalachia
increased by 0.4 million tons (21%) primarily due to higher shipments of purchased coal utilized on a steam coal
contract to increase the availability of our production for sale to higher margin industrial markets plus additional
volumes of coal purchased from an independent synfuel operation. Production was comparable between the two
periods as higher production at the Kingston and Pioneer/Pax complexes offset reduced production at the Laurel
Creek complex and from the Rockspring mine. The Pax surface mine has been increasing its production as the mine
becomes more fully developed. The Pax mine, which replaces the Simmons Fork mine that depleted its reserves in
2004, produced at an annualized rate of 0.7 million tons during the third quarter of 2005. When fully developed in 2006,
it is expected to produce approximately 1 million tons per year. Coal sales volumes in the Powder River Basin
increased by 0.9 million tons (8%) to a record quarterly shipment level of 11.5 million tons despite ongoing
maintenance to the UP/BNSF joint line, a rail line that we utilize to ship coal. During the third quarter of 2004, we
experienced less than expected levels of rail service in the Powder River Basin. The repair program on the joint line is
expected to impact rail service through November 2005. Coal sales volumes from the Illinois Basin increased by 0.1
million tons (21%) reflecting shipments made to fulfill new contract obligations. Purchased coal activities by our
trading group decreased by approximately 0.2 million tons, compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year, due
to the timing of purchased coal transactions.
Coal sales realization per ton sold in Northern and Central Appalachia increased by 25% and 31%, respectively, in
2005 due to substitution of higher priced contracts which took effect in late 2004 and early 2005 for lower priced
contracts that expired. An additional factor in Northern Appalachia was higher coal quality premiums for sulfur content
as a result of record prices for sulfur dioxide allowances and lower sulfur content of shipped coal. In the Powder River
Basin, coal sales realizations per ton declined by 3% due to the expiration at the end of 2004 of higher priced
contracts signed during the 2001 market increase, partly offset by higher sulfur premiums. The weighted average coal
sales realization per ton sold of $18.66 for the third quarter of 2005 also benefited from a larger proportion of higher
priced Northern Appalachia and Central Appalachia tons sold relative to the lower priced tons from the Powder River
Basin.
32
Other revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased by $3.4 million compared to the pro forma other
revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The increase was mainly due to charges totaling $4.1 million
during the 2004 period for settlement of future coal sales commitments that did not recur in 2005.

Cost of coal sales.   The cost of coal sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased
from the pro forma cost of coal sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 due to:
(a) increases in labor costs as a result of both compensation increases and hiring of additional
personnel ($3.6 million); (b) increases in many categories of materials and services as a result of
significantly higher commodity prices particularly for steel products and diesel fuel ($14.7
million); (c) increases in royalties and coal production taxes as a result of higher revenues ($7.9
million); (d) increases in purchased coal costs as a result of higher volumes and prices ($7.2
million); partly offset by additional credits to work-in process inventory for uncovered coal ($2.9
million). Cost of coal sales per ton were $13.50 for the quarter ended September 30, 2005
compared to a pro forma figure of $13.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, an increase
of 3.8%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses for the
quarter ended September 30, 2005 totaled $14.5 million compared to pro forma expense of $11.2
million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Year-over-year increases are due to additional
expenses incurred in the areas of: (a) directors and officers’ insurance premiums ($0.2 million),
(b) audit fees, including Sarbanes Oxley 404 compliance, ($0.8 million), (c) information
technology costs ($0.4 million), (d) health care costs ($0.7 million); (e) non-cash stock
compensation expense ($0.3 million), (f) various miscellaneous administrative expenses ($0.5
million) and (g) professional services fees and printing costs ($1.2 million), associated with the
secondary stock offering completed in September 2005, partly offset by lower legal fees ($0.8
million).
Accretion on asset retirement obligation.   Accretion on asset retirement obligation is a component of
accounting for asset retirement obligations under SFAS No. 143. Accretion represents the
increase in the asset retirement liability to reflect the change in the liability for the passage of
time. Higher accretion expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was attributable to
increased production volumes particularly in the Powder River Basin.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization.   Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes
depreciation of plant and equipment, cost depletion of amounts assigned to coal lands and
mining rights and amortization of mine development costs and leasehold improvements.
Expense increased in the quarter ended September 30, 2005 compared to the pro forma
expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 due to higher cost depletion ($5.3 million),
resulting from a combination of increased
33
production and purchase accounting adjustments subsequent to September 30, 2004 which increased depletion of
purchase accounting values assigned to partially and fully uncovered coal at the Powder River Basin surface mines,
and higher depreciation and amortization ($6.0 million) due to capital additions to plant & equipment during the fourth
quarter of 2004 and the first nine months of 2005 and higher production at the Northern Appalachia mines where
longwall equipment is depreciated on a units of production basis.
Coal supply agreement amortization.   Application of purchase accounting resulted in recognition of a
significant liability for below market priced coal supply agreements as well as a significant asset
for above market priced coal supply agreements, both in relation to market prices at the
acquisition date. Amortization of the liability for below market priced coal supply agreements
during the quarter ended September 30, 2005 totals $26.7 million of credit to expense.
Amortization of the asset for above market priced coal supply agreements during the same period
totals $6.2 million of charges to expense. The decrease in the net credit for amortization of coal
supply agreements compared to the pro forma amount for the quarter ended September 30, 2004
is primarily due to reduced amortization of below market priced coal supply agreements due to
the expiration of lower priced contracts in Northern and Central Appalachia.

Powder River Basin—Income from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $6.9
million. The pro forma income from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 was
$4.8 million. The increase in operating income is primarily due to higher tons sold of 0.9 million
partly offset by lower average per ton sales realizations as a result of the expiration of several
above market contracts at year-end 2004. Cost of coal sales per ton sold decreased
approximately 5% year over year as fixed operating costs were spread over more tons shipped.
Northern Appalachia—Income from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was
$45.8 million compared with pro forma income from operations of $26.7 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2004. The significant improvement is primarily due to increased revenues
of $40.0 million resulting from a 21% increase in tons sold and a 25% increase in average sales
realization per ton. Production and shipments increased from both Cumberland and Emerald
mines during the third quarter
34
of 2005. During the third quarter of 2004 production from the Emerald mine was reduced due to adverse mining
conditions experienced while mining the last portion of a longwall panel prior to a scheduled longwall move that
occurred in the fourth quarter of 2004. During the third quarter of 2004, the Cumberland mine experienced periodic hard
cutting on the longwall face and lost several shifts of longwall production due to an inability to load barges because of
high river levels brought on by the rains of hurricane Ivan. Higher revenues were partly offset by increases in labor and
employee benefit costs ($1.7 million), materials and supplies ($3.2 million), depreciation depletion and amortization
($3.0 million), insurance premiums ($0.3 million), charged in selling, general and administrative ($0.1 million) and a
reduced credit for amortization of coal supply agreements ($12.2 million). Cost of coal sales per ton decreased
approximately 10% year over year.
Central Appalachia—Income from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was
$10.8 million compared with pro forma operating income of $5.1 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2004. Revenues increased by $46.2 million primarily due to a 21% increase in
tons sold and a 31% increase in average sales realizations per ton. Tons sold increased due to
higher production from the Kingston, and Pax mines partly offset by lower production from the
Pioneer and Laurel Creek mines. Higher revenues were partly offset by increased expenses for:
(a) labor and fringe benefits ($2.1 million); (b) materials and supplies, led by increases for roof
control materials and diesel fuel ($8.9 million); (c) purchased coal ($13.7 million); (d) royalties
and severance taxes driven by higher sales revenues ($6.1 million); (e) depreciation, depletion
and amortization ($2.5 million); and (f) amortization of coal supply agreements, representing a
smaller net credit due to the expiration of lower priced sales contracts valued in the purchase
accounting ($5.7 million). Cost of coal sales per ton increased approximately 20% year over year.

Debt related interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was higher than the pro forma debt related
interest expense for quarter ended September 30, 2004 due to: (a) an approximate 180 basis point increase in the
interest rate on variable rate debt and (b) an additional month of imputed interest charges that began in August 2004.
These factors were partly offset by the impact of repaying approximately $39 million of variable rate debt from cash
on hand at December 31, 2004. The remaining portion of the $85 million prepayment made on December 31, 2004 was
funded by proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and has been considered in calculating the pro forma
interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Amortization of deferred financing fees for the quarter
ended September 30, 2005 increased from the pro forma amortization of deferred financing fees for the corresponding
prior year quarter due to a charge-off of deferred financing fees because of a prepayment of $20 million of bank term
debt on August 4, 2005. Surety bond and letter of credit fees were comparable between the two quarters.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2005, income taxes are provided at an effective rate of 40.9% based on
projected full year taxable income and projected full year temporary differences. We are providing a full valuation
allowance against deferred tax assets attributable to AMT tax credits which has the effect of significantly increasing
the effective book income tax rate. For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, pro forma income tax benefit was
recognized at an effective rate of approximately 62% which is the combined mathematical result of recognizing pro
forma income tax benefits on the pro forma loss from continuing operations for the period July 1 through July 29, 2004
at an effective income tax rate of 48.3% and recognizing income tax expense for the two month operating period
ended September 30, 2004 at the same effective income tax rate of 48.3%. The prior year effective income tax rate of
48.3% is the same rate used to provide income taxes on the Successor’s pre-tax income for the five month operating
period ended December 31, 2004.
Nine months ended September 30, 2005—Successor compared to period January 1 through July 29, 2004—
Predecessor and period February 9 (date of formation) through September 30, 2004 (two month operating
period)—Successor
As previously described there are significant differences in the basis of financial reporting between the Successor and
Predecessor periods as a result of the purchase of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. by Foundation Coal Corporation
on July 30, 2004, and the resultant application of purchase accounting to the assets and liabilities acquired. The
Successor reported income from continuing operations of $60.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005
whereas the Predecessor reported a loss from continuing operations of $90.6 million for period January 1 through
July 29, 2004 and the Successor reported income from continuing operations of $10.3 million for the two month
operating period ended September 30, 2004.
During the period January 1 through July 29 the Predecessor incurred approximately $26.7, net of income taxes, of
non-cash charges related to termination of hedge accounting for interest rate swaps, partly offset by a net mark-to-
market gain on the interest rate swaps The predecessor also incurred charges for early extinguishment of debt of
$18.8 million, net of income taxes and a coal contract settlement of $16.5 million, net of income taxes. These one-
time charges total $62.0 million, net of income taxes. These charges in combination with below normal coal
production from our Northern Appalachia mines were the primary reason for the significant loss from continuing
operations.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the Successor achieved stronger production and tons sold,
enjoyed significantly higher per ton sales realizations and received the benefit of a net credit from amortization of coal
supply agreements, reflecting amortization of a liability established for below market contracts in purchase
accounting. Year-over-year increases in cost of coal sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and
depreciation, depletion and amortization were more than absorbed by higher coal sales revenues. The operating trends
discussed in the following section, Historical nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared to pro forma nine
months ended September30, 2004, also apply to comparisons of the two Successor periods and the Predecessor
period January 1 through July 29, 2004.

Coal sales revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased by 32.1% compared to the pro forma
coal sales revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 as a result of an 8.2% increase in tons sold and a
22.1% increase in average coal sales realization per ton.
Coal sales volumes in Northern Appalachia increased by 2.3 million tons (29%) primarily as a result of increased
production from the Cumberland Mine. Coal sales volumes in Northern Appalachia in the nine months of 2004 were
decreased by interruptions to operations caused by the idling of the Cumberland Mine longwall for approximately
eleven weeks during the prior year period, an extended duration longwall move at the Emerald Mine during the first
quarter of 2004 and adverse mining conditions at Emerald during the third quarter of 2004. The scheduled longwall
move at Emerald during the second quarter of 2005 was of shorter duration than the move during the first quarter of
2004. From February 17 through May 7, 2004, the longwall mining equipment at the Cumberland Mine was idled due to
alleged violations
38
resulting from a revised interpretation of regulations issued by MSHA regarding the ventilation system at the Mine. In
response, we revised the ventilation system to minimize any future business disruption and on May 7, 2004 we
resumed longwall operations at the Cumberland Mine. There was no interruption of production due to ventilation issues
during the first nine months of 2005.
Coal sales volumes in Central Appalachia increased by 0.8 million tons (14%) due to higher production at the
Kingston, Rockspring and Pax Mines plus increased sales of purchased coal partly offset by lower production from
the Laurel Creek complex. Production capacity at Kingston was expanded in early 2005 by the addition of a
continuous miner unit. Production from the Pioneer/Pax surface mine complex increased the prior year as the closure
of the Simmons Fork Mine was more than offset by production from the developing Pax Mine. The Pax Mine
produced at an annualized rate of 0.7 million tons during the third quarter of 2005. When fully developed in 2006, it is
expected to produce approximately one million tons of coal per year. Coal sales volumes in the Powder River Basin
increased by 1.2 million tons (4%) as a higher level of committed sales was partly offset by worse than expected
levels of rail service brought on by unusually inclement weather during May and resultant repairs to the rail lines,
particularly the UP/BNSF joint line south of Gillette. The repair program on the joint line is expected to impact rail
service through November 2005. However, our Powder River Basin mines shipped at a record level in the third quarter
of 2005 and made up part of the shortfall from the second quarter. Coal sales volumes from the Illinois Basin
increased by 0.2 million tons (15%) reflecting shipments made to fulfill new contract obligations. Purchased coal
activities by our trading group decreased by approximately 0.6 million tons, compared to the comparable nine months
of the prior year due to the timing of purchased coal transactions.
Coal sales realization per ton sold in Northern and Central Appalachia increased by 27% and 33%, respectively, in
2005 due to substitution of higher priced contracts which took effect in late 2004 and early 2005 for lower priced
contracts that rolled off. An additional factor in Northern Appalachia was higher coal quality premiums for sulfur
content as a result of record prices for sulfur dioxide allowances and lower sulfur content of shipped coal. In the
Powder River Basin, coal sales realizations per ton declined by 2% due to the expiration at the end of 2004 of higher
priced contracts signed during the 2001 market increase, partly offset by higher sulfur premiums. The weighted
average coal sales realization per ton sold of $18.68 for the nine months of 2005 also benefited from a larger
proportion of higher priced Northern Appalachia and Central Appalachia tons sold relative to the lower priced tons from
the Powder River Basin.
All of our 2005 projected production is committed and priced. As of October 25, 2005, uncommitted and unpriced
tonnage was 5%, 26% and 51% of planned production in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Eastern coals account
for the majority of uncommitted tonnage as 12%, 36% and 62% of the Company’s planned eastern production remains
uncommitted and unpriced in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.
In 2006 through 2008, Foundation Coal expects coal production within the following ranges:

Based on its committed and priced planned production as of October 25, 2005, the Company expects its committed
and priced production from its Eastern mines, encompassing Northern Appalachia, Central Appalachia and the Illinois
Basin, to realize in the range of $39.32 to $39.72 per ton in 2006. The Company also expects its committed and
priced production from the Powder River Basin to realize in the range of $7.90 to $8.10 per ton in 2006. These ranges
of expected per ton average realizations include forecast sulfur

dioxide and btu premiums based on contract terms, projected coal qualities and historical realized premiums. The
above tonnages and expected per ton average realizations exclude coal that may be purchased and resold during
2006.
Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased by $10.3 million compared to the pro forma
other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The increase was partly due to charges totaling $7.9
million during the 2004 period for settlement of future coal sales commitments compared to $0.7 million of such
charges in 2005, combined with higher revenues for synfuel fees ($2.3 million) and higher coal bed methane sales
($1.2 million) during the 2005 period.

Cost of coal sales.   The cost of coal sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2005
increased from the pro forma cost of coal sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2004
due to: (a) increases in labor costs as a result of both compensation increases and hiring of
additional personnel ($26.3 million); (b) increases in many categories of materials and services
as a result of significantly higher commodity prices particularly for steel products and diesel fuel
($48.8 million); (c) increases in royalties and coal production taxes as a result of higher revenues
($13.5 million); (d) increases in purchased coal costs due to both higher prices and higher
volumes ($13.0 million) partly offset by additional credits to work-in-process inventory for
uncovered coal ($3.4 million). Cost of coal sales per ton were $13.61 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005 compared to a pro forma figure of $12.57 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2004, an increase of 8.3%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2005 totaled $35.3 million compared to pro forma expense of
$29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. Year-over-year increases in the
first nine months of 2005 are due to additional expenses incurred in the areas of: (a) directors and
officers’ insurance premiums ($1.1 million), (b) audit fees, including Sarbanes Oxley 404
compliance, ($1.8 million), (c) information technology costs ($0.8 million), (d) salaries and cash
incentive compensation ($2.1 million) (e) non-cash stock compensation expense ($0.5 million),
(f) various miscellaneous administrative expenses ($0.5 million) and (g) professional services
fees and printing costs ($1.2 million), associated with the secondary stock offering completed in
September 2005, partly offset by lower legal fees ($1.6 million) and reduced health care costs
($.7 million).
40
Accretion on asset retirement obligation.   Accretion on asset retirement obligation is a component of
accounting for asset retirement obligations under SFAS No. 143. Accretion represents the
increase in the asset retirement liability to reflect the change in the liability for the passage of
time. Higher accretion expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was attributable to
increased production volumes.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization.   Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes
depreciation of plant and equipment, cost depletion of amounts assigned to coal lands and
mining rights and amortization of mine development costs and leasehold improvements.
Expense increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared to the pro forma
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 due to higher cost depletion ($8.9
million) resulting from a combination of increased production and purchase accounting
adjustments subsequent to September 30, 2004 which increased depletion of purchase
accounting values assigned to partially and fully uncovered coal at the Powder River Basin
surface mines, and higher depreciation and amortization ($6.2 million) due to capital additions to
plant & equipment during the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first nine months of 2005 and higher
production at the Northern Appalachia mines where longwall equipment is depreciated on a units
of production basis.
Coal supply agreement amortization.   Application of purchase accounting resulted in recognition of a
significant liability for below market priced coal supply agreements as well as a significant asset
for above market priced coal supply agreements, both in relation to market prices at the
acquisition date. Amortization of the liability for below market priced coal supply agreements
during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 totals $86.3 million of credit to expense.
Amortization of the asset for above market priced coal supply agreements during the same period
totals $19.3 million of charges to expense. The decrease in the net credit for amortization of coal
supply agreements compared to the pro forma amount for the nine months ended September 30,
2004 is primarily due to reduced amortization of below market priced coal supply agreements
due to the expiration of lower priced contracts in Northern and Central Appalachia.

Powder River Basin—Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was
$10.2 million compared to pro forma income from operations of $6.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2004. The increase in operating income is primarily due to higher
revenues as increased shipments and higher coal quality premiums were partly offset by lower
sales realizations per ton reflecting the expiration of several above market contracts at year end
2004. Lower amortization of coal supply agreements ($16.9 million) as a result of the expiration
of above market contracts was largely offset by a 4% year-over-year increase in per ton cost of
coal sales and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2005, the Company estimates that worse than expected levels of rail service,
during the second quarter, resulted in reduced shipments of approximately 1.0 million tons and
reduced income from operations in the range of $0.8 million to $1.3 million.
Northern Appalachia—Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was
$127.7 million compared to pro forma income from operations of $60.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2004. The significant improvement is primarily due to increased revenues
of $141.6 million resulting from a 29% increase in tons sold and a 27% increase in average sales
realization per ton. Production from the Cumberland Mine increased substantially during the first
nine months of 2005. During the first half of 2004, Cumberland’s longwall was idle from
February 17 to May 7 for reasons previously described. Emerald had longwall moves in both
nine month periods, but the 2005 longwall move was of shorter duration and its impact on
revenues was mitigated by shipments from inventories. Higher revenues were partly offset by
increases in labor and employee benefit expenses ($17.1 million), materials and supplies
($20.1 million), coal production taxes ($2.1 million), depreciation, depletion and amortization
($5.9 million) and a reduced credit for amortization of coal supply agreements ($31.5 million).
Cost of coal sales per ton decreased approximately 7% year over year.
Central Appalachia—Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was
$43.0 million compared to pro forma operating income of $29.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2004. Revenues increased by $110.6 million primarily due to a 14% increase in
tons sold, driven by higher production at the Kingston, Rockspring and Pax mines, and a 33%
increase in average sales realizations per ton. Higher revenues were partly offset by increased
expenses for: (a) labor and fringe benefits ($8.7 million); (b) materials and supplies, led by
increases for roof control materials and diesel fuel ($18.6 million); (c) purchased coal ($32.8
million); (d) royalties and severance taxes driven by higher sales revenues ($9.8 million);
(e) depreciation, depletion and amortization ($4.4 million); and (f) amortization of coal supply
agreements, representing a smaller net credit due to the expiration of lower priced sales
contracts valued in the purchase accounting ($24.0 million). Also, the pro forma operating income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 included a $1.5 million charge for settlement of
litigation. Cost of coal sales per ton increased approximately 21% year over year.

Debt related interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was higher than the pro forma debt
related interest expense for nine months ended September 30, 2004 due to: (a) about a 160 basis point increase in the
interest rate on variable rate debt; (b) imputed interest charges that began in the second half of 2004 and (c) greater
utilization of the revolving credit agreement. These factors were partly offset by the impact of repaying approximately
$39 million of variable rate debt from cash on hand at December 31, 2004 and an additional $20 million from cash on
hand at August 4, 2005. The remaining portion of the $105 million of total prepayments since July 30, 2004 was
funded by proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and has been considered in calculating the pro forma
interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. Pro forma amortization of deferred financing fees for
the nine months ended September 30, 2004 includes $1.7 million of accelerated amortization from the repayment of
variable rate debt with IPO proceeds; there is $0.7 million of accelerated amortization from repayment of variable rate
debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2005. The decrease in surety bond and letter of credit fees in the nine
month period of 2005 is due to reductions in the amounts of these financial assurance instruments compared to the
period immediately following the purchase of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. The reduction in interest income
between nine month periods is primarily due to lower cash balances available for investment in the nine months ended
September 30, 2005.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, income taxes are provided at an effective rate of 39.8% based on
projected full year taxable income and projected full year temporary differences. Current tax expense, which
represents taxes currently payable on operations, was approximately 29% of pre-tax income. We are providing a full
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets attributable to AMT tax credits. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2004, pro forma income tax expense was recognized at an effective rate of 48.3%, the same effective
rate used to provide taxes on the Successor’s pre-tax income for the five months ended December 31, 2004.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of cash have been sales of our coal production and purchased coal to customers, plus cash from
sales of non-core assets and miscellaneous revenues.
Our primary uses of cash have been our cash costs of coal production, the cash cost of purchased coal, capital
expenditures, interest costs, cash payments for employee benefit obligations such as defined benefit pensions and
retiree health care benefits, cash outlays related to post mining asset retirement obligations and support of working
capital requirements such as coal inventories and trade accounts receivable. Our ability to service our debt (principal
and interest) and acquire new productive assets for use in our operations has been and will be dependent upon our
ability to generate cash from our operations. We normally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash
generated from operations. Historically, we have engaged in minimal financing of assets such as through operating
leases.
In the Predecessor periods, cash balances in excess of our day-to-day operating requirements were placed on deposit
with RAG where cash balances could be aggregated to earn better investment returns. This cash on deposit was
available to us on a one day turn-around. Increases in the cash on deposit with RAG have been classified under
financing activities as uses of cash in the consolidated cash flow
43
statements. Decreases in cash on deposit with RAG have been classified under financing activities as cash provided.
The following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated categories of activities during nine

(1)          Represents the decrease in the balance of cash on deposit with RAG.
(2)          The borrowings and repayments during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 in the
amount of $76.0 million represent use of the Revolving Credit facility to maintain day-to-day
liquidity and a $20.0 million repayment of long term debt in advance of maturity in August 2005.
(3)          Cash used in investing activities by the Successor for the two months ended
September 30, 2004 include $912.9 million, net of cash acquired to acquire RAG American Coal
Holding, Inc. and subsidiaries from RAG Coal International AG.
Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in the nine months ended September 30,
2005 as compared to the pro forma combined results of the Successor for the two months ended September 30, 2004
and the Predecessor for the seven months ended July 29, 2004 are primarily due to higher net income from continuing
operations partly offset by increases in working capital, mainly trade accounts receivable and inventories.
Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations, excluding the purchase of RAG American Coal
Holding, Inc., increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2005 as compared to the combined pro forma
results of the Successor for the two months ended September 30, 2004 and the Predecessor for the seven months
ended July 29, 2004 due to higher capital expenditures in the 2005 period. Capital expenditures for the nine months
ended September 30, 2005 totaled $102.2 million, including $42.3 million of expenditures related to the expansion of
the Belle Ayr Mine in the Powder River Basin, development of the Pax surface mine and related rail loading facility in
Central Appalachia, addition of a continuous mining unit to the Kingston Mine in Central Appalachia, the widening of
the Emerald Mine longwall face to 1,450 feet from 1,250 feet and upgrades to the rail loading facility at Emerald. Pro
forma combined
44
capital expenditures of the Successor for the two months ended September 30, 2004 and for the Predecessor for the
seven months ended July 29, 2004 of $65.4 million were mainly for replacement of equipment and other expenditures
necessary to sustain mine operations.
Cash used in financing activities by the Successor for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 includes the
payment of $449.9 million of cash dividends, including $444.1 million of cash dividends related to the IPO that were
accrued as of December 31, 2004 and paid on January 4, 2005. The remaining $5.8 million in cash dividends were a
quarterly dividend of $.04 per share paid in March and June 2005 and a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share paid in
September 2005. Cash used in financing activities by the Successor for the nine months ended September 30, 2005
also includes a $20.0 million repayment of our Senior Notes in advance of their scheduled maturity. This payment was
voluntary and consistent with management’s strategy to deleverage the Company as funds are available from excess
working capital generated by the business.
Cash used in financing activities of the Predecessor for the seven months ended July 29, 2004 represents repayment
of all long-term debt of the Predecessor including cash prepayment penalties coupled with the settlement of the
Predecessor’s interest rate swaps. These repayments utilized the proceeds from the sale of the RAG Colorado
Business Unit, cash previously reported as cash on deposit with Parent, cash pledged and $306.0 of cash advanced
by RAG Coal International AG that the Predecessor repaid from a portion of the cash acquisition price that Foundation
Coal paid to RAG.
The cash acquisition price including transaction costs of $912.9 million paid by Foundation for RAG American Coal
Holding, Inc and subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, was funded by $830.0 million of Successor long-term debt,
consisting of $470.0 of senior secured term Loan B, $300.0 million of senior unsecured long-term notes, $60.0 of
drawings under the $350.0 million revolving credit facility and $196.0 million of cash equity contributed by the
shareholders. The $60.0 million of drawings under the revolving credit facility were fully repaid on the first business
day after the Transactions utilizing cash of the acquired subsidiaries. The $27.7 million other cash used in financing
activities was for costs associated with arranging long-term debt used to fund the acquisition which are accounted for
as deferred financing fees and amortized over the lives of the senior secured Loan B and the senior unsecured long-
term notes.
Our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash from sales of our coal production and purchased coal to
customers. We have borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, subject to certain conditions.
As of September 30, 2005, we have outstanding $665.0 million in aggregate indebtedness, with an additional
$165.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to $185.0 million of letters
of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2005). Our liquidity requirements will be significant, primarily due to debt
service requirements. Of the $43.1 million of interest expense, net of interest income, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005, approximately $39.0 million has or will be paid in cash.
Based on our current levels of operations, we believe that remaining cash on hand, cash flow from operations and
available borrowings under the revolving credit portion of our Senior Credit Facilities will enable us to meet our working
capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements for at least the next twelve months.
45
As a regular part of our business, we review opportunities for, and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning,
the acquisition of coal mining assets, including LBA bids, and acquisitions of, or combinations with, coal mining
companies. When we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria,
we will make bids or proposals and/or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements, which may be binding
or nonbinding, that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the
discussions and any related agreements if, among other things, we are not satisfied with the results of our due
diligence investigation. Any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital
resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both.
Covenant Compliance
We believe that our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding 71¤4% Senior Notes are
material agreements, that the covenants are material terms of these agreements and that
information about the covenants is material to an investor’s understanding of our financial
condition and liquidity. The breach of covenants in the Senior Credit Facilities that are tied to
ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, could result in a default under the Senior
Credit Facilities and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable.
Any such acceleration would also result in a default under our indenture. Additionally, under the
Senior Credit Facilities and indenture, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring
additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based
on Adjusted EBITDA.
Covenant levels and Adjusted EBITDA ratios for the four quarters ended September 30, 2005 are as follows:
Senior Credit Facilities(1)
Minimum Adjusted EBITDA to cash interest ratio
Maximum total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio
Indenture(2)
Minimum Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charge ratio required to incur
additional debt pursuant to ratio provisions

(1)          The Senior Credit Facilities require us to maintain an Adjusted EBITDA to cash interest
ratio starting at a minimum of 1.75x and a total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio starting at a
maximum of 6.0x in each case for the most recent four quarter period. Failure to satisfy these ratio
requirements would constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities. If lenders under the
Senior Credit Facilities failed to waive any such default, repayment obligations under the Senior
Credit Facilities could be accelerated, which would also constitute a default under the indenture.
(2)          Our ability to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under our
indenture, subject to specified exceptions, is tied to an Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charge ratio of
at least 2.0 to 1.
46
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude non-recurring items, non-cash items and other
adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture, and the Senior Credit Facilities, as
shown in the table below. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in
presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance
with financing covenants.

(a)           Includes $48.9 million of expense resulting in the four quarters ended December 31, 2004
from loss on termination of hedge accounting for interest rate swaps less $6.3 million mark-to-
market adjustment.
(b)          Represents incremental cost of sales recorded in the period arising from the preliminary
estimate of manufacturing profit added to inventory in purchase accounting.
(c)           In purchase accounting, the fair value of partially and fully uncovered coal included
consideration of the effort spent prior to the purchase date to remove overburden and get the coal
to its partially or fully uncovered state. Therefore, the fair value assigned to partially or fully
uncovered coal reserves was higher than that assigned to other coal reserves. Depletion of coal
reserves, including the incremental fair value related to pre-acquisition overburden removal
efforts, is included in depreciation, depletion and amortization. Subsequent to the acquisition
date, the costs associated with removal of overburden to uncover coal reserves is inventoried as
work-in-process until the related coal is mined and the inventoried cost charged to cost of coal
sales when the coal is sold. Until coal valued as partially or fully uncovered at the acquisition
date is fully depleted, depreciation, depletion and amortization will include the value of
overburden removal performed prior to the acquisition date which if incurred subsequent to the
acquisition date would have been included in cost of coal sales.
(d)          Represents an accrual for compensation expense attributable to restricted stock
performance units and restricted stock awarded to certain directors.
(e)           Represents the portion of pension, other postretirement and black lung expense resulting
from the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition
obligations. Unrecognized actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition obligations were
eliminated when the pension, other postretirement and black lung obligations were fair valued in
purchase accounting.

the sale of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc.
(c)          Represents the cost of a long-term incentive plan instituted by RAG American Coal
Holding, Inc. in 2001 that was terminated prior to closing as required by the change in control
provisions in the plan agreement. We have implemented a management equity program that will
not result in a cash cost to us.
(d)         Represents $2.0 million from a sponsor monitoring fee and $1.8 million from a tax
allowance related to the IPO in the four quarters ended December 31, 2004.
(4)          Represents the adjustment required for the estimated impact of the temporary idling of our
Cumberland Mine in the first half of 2004 as a result of a revised interpretation of mine ventilation
laws by MSHA. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” for additional information.
(5)          We are also required to make adjustments to EBITDA for items such as incremental
insurance costs and franchise taxes not included in income tax expense.
Pro-forma cash interest for the four quarters ended September 30, 2005 is calculated as follows (unaudited, in
millions):
Cash interest expense for nine months ended September 30, 2005
Interest expense for three months ended September 30, 2005
Less: Amortization of deferred debt issuance costs for three month period ended

In future periods, adjustments to EBITDA that could be used to calculate compliance with the debt covenants are:
(a) accretion on asset retirement obligations, (b) credits from deferral of overburden
49
removal costs, (c) any non-cash expenses or charges arising as a result of the application of purchase accounting in
acquisitions, (d) business optimization expenses or other restructuring charges, (e) non-cash impairment charges
resulting from the application of SFAS No. 142 or SFAS No. 144, (f) amortization of intangibles pursuant to SFAS
No. 141, and (g) any long term incentive plan accruals or any non-cash compensation expense realized from grants of
stock appreciation or similar rights, stock options or other rights to officers, directors and employees.
In future periods, cash interest is expected to be calculated by adding back amortization of deferred debt issuance
costs and deducting cash interest income from the interest expense reported in the Statement of Operations.
Contractual Obligations
The following is a summary of our significant future contractual obligations by year as of December 31, 2004 updated
for the repayment of $20 million of bank debt in August 2005. In addition to the amounts shown in the table, we are
committed to: (a) forward contracts to purchase approximately $22.9 million of diesel fuel for 2006 delivery at our
Powder River Basin mines; (b) forward contracts to purchase approximately $5.4 million of diesel fuel for 2006
delivery at our Pioneer/Pax mines in Central Appalachia; (c) purchase orders and construction contracts covering
approximately $12.0 million of 2006 capital expenditures.

We expect to invest in the range of $150.0 to $160.0 million in capital expenditures during calendar year 2005 of which
approximately $100.0 million is to maintain production and replace mining equipment. The additional $50.0 to
$60.0 million is expected to be directed toward selective expansions of production and improvements in productivity.
Approximately $34 million of expected 2005 capital expenditures are included in unconditional purchase commitments
shown above. The remaining 2005 unconditional purchase commitments and $3 million of the 2006-2007 unconditional
purchase commitments relate to forward contracts to purchase diesel fuel and explosives in normal quantities for use
at our surface mines. The remaining unconditional purchase commitments, totaling $4.4 million in 2006-2007 and
$17.2 million in 2008-2009, relate to a contractual commitment to purchase underground mining equipment. We expect
to contribute approximately $7.7 million to our defined benefit retirement plans and to pay approximately $23.0 million
of retiree health care benefits in calendar year 2005. We also expect to incur approximately $9.0 million per year for
surety bond premiums and letters of credit fees. We believe that cash balances plus cash generated by operations
will be sufficient to meet these obligations plus fund requirements for working capital and capital expenditures without
incurring additional borrowings.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements
include guarantees, indemnifications and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of
credit and performance or surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated
balance sheets. However, the underlying obligations that they secure,
50
such as asset retirement obligations, self-insured workers’ compensation liabilities, royalty obligations and certain
retiree medical obligations, are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
We are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post-mining reclamation required by our mining
permits, pay our federal production royalties, pay workers’ compensation claims under self-insured workers’
compensation laws in the various states, pay federal black lung benefits, pay retiree health care benefits to certain
retired UMWA employees and perform certain other obligations.
In order to provide the required financial assurance, we generally use surety bonds for post-mining reclamation and
royalty payment obligations and bank letters of credit for self-insured workers’ compensation obligations and UMWA
retiree health care obligations. Federal black lung benefits are paid from a dedicated trust fund that has sufficient
assets to fund these obligations for the next several years. Bank letters of credit are also used to collateralize a
portion of the surety bonds.
We had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of $251.8 million as of September 30, 2005, of which
$229.2 million secured reclamation obligations, $10.7 million secured coal lease obligations and $9.6 million secured
self-insured workers’ compensation obligations. In addition, we had $185.0 million of letters of credit in place for the
following purposes: $33.4 million for workers’ compensation, including collateral for workers’ compensation bonds;
$23.4 million for UMWA retiree health care obligations; $121.5 million for collateral for reclamation surety bonds,
$3.0 million for minimum royalty payment obligations for a closed mine in Utah; and $3.7 million for other
miscellaneous obligations. Recently, surety bond costs have increased, while the market terms under which surety
bonds can be obtained have generally become less favorable to all mining companies. In the event that additional
surety bonds become unavailable, we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit, cash deposits or
other suitable forms of collateral.
Certain Trends and Uncertainties
Our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal. The current pricing environment for United
States coal is strong. Any decrease in coal prices due to, among other reasons, the supply of domestic and foreign
coal, the demand for electricity and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation could
adversely affect our revenues and our ability to generate cash flows. In addition, our results of operations depend on
the cost of coal production. We are experiencing increased operating costs for fuel and explosives, steel products,
health care, wages, salaries, contract labor, and increased interest expenses for surety bonds and letters of credit. In
addition, historically low interest rates have had a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined
employee-related liabilities.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-
Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123R”), which replaces SFAS No. 123, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB No. 25”). SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements
based on their fair value at the grant date. SFAS No. 123R generally requires companies to measure the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (such as stock options and restricted
stock) based on the grant-date fair value of the award, and to recognize that cost over the period during which the
employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period of the award). FAS 123R also requires the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as
an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and
increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under
SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement
51
recognition. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) delayed the implementation of
SFAS No. 123R from its original implementation date by six months for most registrants, requiring all public
companies to adopt FAS 123R no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. The
impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based
payments granted in the future. However, had the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R during the prior period, the
results are expected to be consistent with the pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123, except that forfeitures will
be considered in the calculation of compensation expense under SFAS No. 123R. When adopted, the Company may
elect to change the valuation method or assumptions and such changes could have a material impact on the amount
of stock-based compensation the Company records.
In March 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached consensus on Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping
Costs in the Mining Industry (“EITF Issue 04-6”) concluding that post-production stripping costs are a component of
mineral inventory costs subject to the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing,
(“ARB No. 43”). The FASB ratified the EITF consensus. Based upon this consensus, post production stripping costs
are considered costs of the extracted minerals under a full absorption costing system and are recognized as a
component of inventory to be recognized in costs of coal sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the
inventory. In addition, capitalization of such costs would be appropriate only to the extent inventory exists at the end
of a reporting period. The guidance in this consensus will be effective for financial statements issued for the first
reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. At a June EITF
meeting, the Task Force modified the transition provisions of EITF Issue 04-6, indicating that companies that adopt in
periods beginning after June 29, 2005 may utilize a cumulative effect adjustment approach where the cumulative
effect adjustment is recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption. Alternatively, a company may
recognize this change in accounting by restatement of its prior-period financial statements through retrospective
application. The Company expects to adopt EITF Issue 04-6 on January 1, 2006 and expects to utilize the cumulative
effect adjustment approach and record an adjustment directly to retained earnings upon adoption. Historically, the
Company recorded stripping costs associated with in-process production as a separate component of inventory
described as deferred overburden in Note 4. At September 30, 2005, such stripping costs associated with coal that
has not been extracted was $46,089. Applying the requirements of this EITF would have resulted in a maximum
decrease of $46,089 in inventory with the off-set recorded to retained earnings, net of tax. The effect on the financial
statements upon adoption on January 1, 2006 will depend on the balance of deferred overburden included in the
Company’s inventory at December 31, 2005
The FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” in
March of 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the
fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. This interpretation also clarifies the circumstances under
which an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation. This Interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The
Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its financial statements.
52
ITEM 3.                QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Commodity Price Risk
We manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of long-term coal supply agreements rather than
through the use of derivative instruments. As of September 30, 2005, we had sales commitments for approximately
100% of our planned 2005 production. As of October 25, 2005, uncommitted and unpriced tonnage was 5%, 26% and
51% of planned production in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Eastern coals account for the majority of
uncommitted tonnage as 12%, 36% and 62% of the Company’s planned eastern production remains uncommitted and
unpriced in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.
Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel, explosives, steel products and electricity, are
subject to price volatility. Through our suppliers, we utilize forward purchase contracts to manage the exposure related
to this volatility. As of November 14, 2005, the Company has entered into forward purchase commitments for
approximately 90% of the diesel fuel that it expects to consume during calendar year 2006 at prices ranging from
$1.73 per gallon for our Powder River Basin mines to $2.04 per gallon for our Central Appalachian mines. The
Company has designated these contracts as normal purchase normal sale contracts, and, therefore, they are not
deemed to be derivative financial instruments for financial reporting purposes. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2005, the cost of diesel fuel represents approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated cost of coal
sales.
Credit Risk
Our credit risk is primarily with electric power generators and, to a lesser extent, steel producers. Most electric power
generators to whom we sell have investment grade credit ratings. Our policy is to independently evaluate each
customer’s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts
receivable against established credit limits. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we
have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit
has deteriorated. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for
shipments or establishing customer trust accounts held for our benefit in the event of a failure to pay.
Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swaps is not considered to be significant based upon the
creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions.
Interest Rate Risk
Historically, we have had exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our existing level of indebtedness
under the Predecessor. This exposure had been completely hedged for the life of the debt using pay-fixed, receive-
variable interest rate swaps. From July 30, 2004 forward, we have exposure to changes in interest rates through our
bank term loan and our revolving credit facility. As described below, we have used interest rate swaps to manage this
risk.
We entered into swap contracts for the purpose of complying with certain financial covenants in our senior secured
credit facility that require fixing the interest rate for at least three years on a minimum of 50% of our total outstanding
debt. The swap contracts cover $85 million through September 2007. The following table summarizes our outstanding
swap contracts at September 30, 2005.

As of September 30, 2005, after giving effect to the $85 million of interest rate swaps that were entered into, we had
$280 million of variable rate indebtedness, representing approximately 44% of our outstanding indebtedness. A 1%
change in interest rates would affect the interest expense on such indebtedness by $2.8 million per year. At
September 30, 2005, the fair value of these swap agreements was an unrealized gain of $2.0 million. Effective
January 1, 2005, these swaps were designated as hedges. The increase in the unrealized gain of $1.5 million pre-tax
($0.9 million, net of tax) for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was reported as a component of
comprehensive income (loss).
ITEM 4.                CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
evaluated, summarized and reported accurately within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (SEC) rules and forms. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. An evaluation was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation as of the end of the period
covered by this report, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. The conclusions of the
CEO and CFO from this evaluation were communicated to the Audit Committee. In connection with this evaluation,
there were no breaches of such controls that would require disclosure to the Audit Committee or our auditors.
In conjunction with the September 1, 2005 implementation of our sales and revenue system, changes were made to
the Company’s internal controls in order to adapt to the SAP environment. Management believes that the new controls
are equally effective as those that were in place prior to the implementation.
Changes in Disclosure Controls
There were no significant changes in our disclosure controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
disclosure controls in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005. Management is not aware of any material
weaknesses; therefore, there were no corrective actions to be taken.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404
During the year ended December 31, 2004, we did not meet the definition of an Accelerated Filer because we have
been a public company subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, for less than twelve months and we have not previously filed an Annual Report on Form 10-
K. We are required to comply with the final Section 404 Rule of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.
