<p>Agenda item 3 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 2 October 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>30/28. The right to development 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Charter of the United Nations and the core human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 4/4 of 30 March 2007 and 9/3 
</p>
<p>of 17 September 2008, and recalling all Commission on Human Rights, Council and 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolutions on the right to development, the most recent being Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 27/2 of 25 September 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the renewed commitments to achieve the remaining Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals, as set out in the outcome document adopted at the high-level plenary 
</p>
<p>meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals,<footnote name="1">General Assembly resolution 65/1. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>the urgent need to make the right to development a reality for 
</p>
<p>everyone, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing also</i> that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the 
</p>
<p>right to development, can only be enjoyed in an inclusive and collaborative framework, at 
</p>
<p>the international, regional and national levels, and in this regard underlining the importance 
</p>
<p>of engaging the United Nations system, including United Nations funds, programmes and 
</p>
<p>specialized agencies, within their respective mandates, relevant international organization 
</p>
<p>including financial and trade organizations, and relevant stakeholders, including civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, development practitioners, human rights experts and the public at all 
</p>
<p>levels, in discussions on the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,<footnote name="2">General Assembly resolution 70/1.  </footnote> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> that achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including 
</p>
<p>the Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable development goals, requires 
</p>
<p>effective policy coherence and coordination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that extreme poverty and hunger are one of the greatest global 
</p>
<p>threats and require the collective commitment of the international community for its 
</p>
<p>eradication, and therefore calling upon the international community to contribute towards 
</p>
<p>achieving that goal in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining </i>the imperative need for raising awareness of the progress made, still 
</p>
<p>existing difficulties and accelerating action towards the achievement of the unmet 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals and the transition to the Sustainable Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to 
</p>
<p>development, are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that the successful implementation of the sustainable development 
</p>
<p>goals will require the strengthening of a new, more equitable and sustainable national and 
</p>
<p>international order, as well as the promotion and protection of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the right to development should be central to the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the commitment declared by a number of United Nations specialized 
</p>
<p>agencies, funds and programmes and other international organizations to make the right to 
</p>
<p>development a reality for all, and in this regard urging all relevant bodies of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system and other international organizations to mainstream the right to 
</p>
<p>development into their objectives, policies, programmes and operational activities, as well 
</p>
<p>as into development and development-related processes, including the follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the primary responsibility of States for the creation of national and 
</p>
<p>international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that Member States should cooperate with each other in ensuring 
</p>
<p>development and eliminating lasting obstacles to development, that the international 
</p>
<p>community should promote effective international cooperation, in particular a global 
</p>
<p>partnership for development, for the realization of the right to development and the 
</p>
<p>elimination of obstacles to development, and that lasting progress towards the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the 
</p>
<p>national level as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic 
</p>
<p>environment at the international level, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> all Member States to constructively engage in the discussions for the 
</p>
<p>full implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development with a view to 
</p>
<p>overcoming the existing political impasse within the Working Group on the Right to 
</p>
<p>Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to 
</p>
<p>Development presents a unique opportunity for the international community to demonstrate 
</p>
<p>and reiterate its unequivocal commitment to the right to development, recognizing the high 
</p>
<p>profile it deserves, and redoubling its efforts to implement this right, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that, in General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, the 
</p>
<p>Assembly decided that the responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights shall be, among others, to promote and protect the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>development and to enhance support from relevant bodies of the United Nations system for 
</p>
<p>that purpose, </p>
