PERMIAN BASIN ROYALTY TRUST
PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 1. Financial Statements
The condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by Southwest Bank as
Trustee for the Permian Basin Royalty Trust (the “Trust”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Effective August 29, 2014, Southwest
Bank (the “Trustee”) became the new trustee for the Trust. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Trustee believes that the disclosures are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these
condensed interim financial statements and notes thereto be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Trust’s latest annual report on Form 10-
K. In the opinion of the Trustee, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary to present fairly the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Permian Basin Royalty
Trust at June 30, 2016, the distributable income for the three-month and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the changes in trust corpus for the six-month periods ended June
30, 2016 and 2015, have been included. The distributable income for such interim periods is not
necessarily indicative of the distributable income for the full year.
The condensed interim financial statements as of June 30, 2016 and for the three-month and six-
month periods ended June 30, 2016, included herein, have been reviewed by Weaver and
Tidwell, L.L.P., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
appearing herein.
The condensed interim financial statements for the three-month and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2015, included herein, were previously reviewed by an independent registered public
accounting firm.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Unit Holders of Permian Basin Royalty Trust and
Southwest Bank, Trustee
Dallas, Texas
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus
of Permian Basin Royalty Trust (the “Trust”) as of June 30, 2016 and the related condensed
statements of distributable income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and changes in trust corpus for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. These interim
financial statements are the responsibility of the Trustee.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of
applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective
of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
As described in Note 2 to the condensed interim financial statements, these condensed interim
financial statements have been prepared on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is a
comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to
such condensed interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with the basis of
accounting described in Note 2.

PERMIAN BASIN ROYALTY TRUST
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
1. TRUST ORGANIZATION AND PROVISIONS
The Permian Basin Royalty Trust (“Trust”) was established as of November 1, 1980. Southwest
Bank (“Trustee”) is Trustee for the Trust. The net overriding royalties conveyed to the Trust
include (1) a 75% net overriding royalty in Southland Royalty Company’s fee mineral interest in
the Waddell Ranch in Crane County, Texas (the “Waddell Ranch properties”) and (2) a 95% net
overriding royalty carved out of Southland Royalty Company’s major producing royalty properties
in Texas (the “Texas Royalty properties”). The net overriding royalty for the Texas Royalty
properties is subject to the provisions of the lease agreements under which such royalties were
created. The net overriding royalties above are collectively referred to as the “Royalties.”
On November 3, 1980, Units of Beneficial Interest (“Units”) in the Trust were distributed to the
Trustee for the benefit of Southland Royalty Company’s shareholders of record as of November
3, 1980, who received one Unit in the Trust for each share of Southland Royalty Company
common stock held. The Units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP (“BROG”), a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, is the
interest owner for the Waddell Ranch properties and Riverhill Energy Corporation (“Riverhill
Energy”), formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Riverhill Capital Corporation (“Riverhill Capital”)
and formerly an affiliate of Coastal Management Corporation (“CMC”), is the interest owner for
the Texas Royalty properties. BROG currently conducts all field, technical and accounting
operations with regard to the Waddell Ranch properties. Riverhill Energy currently conducts the
accounting operations for the Texas Royalty properties.
In February 1997, BROG sold its interest in the Texas Royalty properties to Riverhill Energy.
The Trustee was advised that in the first quarter of 1998, Schlumberger Technology Corporation
(“STC”) acquired all of the shares of stock of Riverhill Capital. Prior to such acquisition by STC,
CMC and Riverhill Energy were wholly owned subsidiaries of Riverhill Capital. The Trustee was
further advised that in connection with STC’s acquisition of Riverhill Capital, the shareholders of
Riverhill Capital acquired ownership of all of the shares of stock of Riverhill Energy. Thus, the
ownership in the Texas Royalty properties referenced above remained in Riverhill Energy, the
stock ownership of which was acquired by the former shareholders of Riverhill Capital.
8
On January 9, 2014, Bank of America, N.A. (as successor to the First National Bank of Fort
Worth) gave notice to Unit holders that it would be resigning as Trustee subject to certain
conditions that included the appointment of Southwest Bank, an independent state bank
chartered under the laws of the State of Texas and headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas
(“Southwest Bank”), as successor trustee. At a Special Meeting of Trust Unit holders, the Unit
holders approved the appointment of Southwest Bank as successor trustee of the Trust once the
resignation of U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management took effect and also
approved certain amendments to the Trust Indenture. The effective date of Bank of America
N.A.’s resignation and the effective date of Southwest Bank’s appointment as successor trustee
was August 29, 2014.
The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that:
•  the Trust shall not engage in any business or commercial activity of any kind or acquire
any assets other than those initially conveyed to the Trust;
•  the Trustee may not sell all or any part of the Royalties unless approved by holders of
75% of all Units outstanding in which case the sale must be for cash and the proceeds
promptly distributed;
•  the Trustee may establish a cash reserve for the payment of any liability which is
contingent or uncertain in amount;
•  the Trustee is authorized to borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust; and
•  the Trustee will make monthly cash distributions to Unit holders (see Note 3).
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following basis:
•
Royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid to the Trustee on
behalf of the Trust by the interest owners. Royalty income consists of the amounts
received by the owners of the interest burdened by the Royalties from the sale of
production less accrued production costs, development and drilling costs, applicable
taxes, operating charges and other costs and deductions multiplied by 75% in the case of
the Waddell Ranch properties and 95% in the case of the Texas Royalty properties.
9
•
Trust expenses, consisting principally of routine general and administrative costs,
recorded are based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established out of cash received
or borrowed funds for liabilities and contingencies.
•
Distributions to Unit holders are recorded when declared by the Trustee.
•
Royalty income is computed separately for each of the conveyances under which the
Royalties were conveyed to the Trust. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any
conveyance (“excess costs”), such excess costs cannot reduce royalty income from other
conveyances, but is carried forward with accrued interest to be recovered from future net
proceeds of that conveyance.
The financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) because
revenues are not accrued in the month of production and certain reserves may be established for
contingencies which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP and expenses are recorded when liabilities are paid. Amortization of the Royalties
calculated on a unit-of-production basis is charged directly to trust corpus. This comprehensive
basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic
12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the basis of accounting described
above requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of
certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as of and for the reporting periods. Actual
results may differ from such estimates.
Impairment
The Trustee routinely reviews its royalty interests in oil and gas properties for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If an impairment event occurs and it is determined that the carrying value of the
Trust’s royalty interests may not be recoverable, an impairment will be recognized as measured
by the amount by which the carrying amount of the royalty interests exceeds the fair value of
these assets, which would likely be measured by discounting projected cash flows. There was
no impairment of the assets as of June 30, 2016.
Contingencies
10
Contingencies related to the underlying properties that are unfavorably resolved would generally
be reflected by the Trust as reductions to future royalty income payments to the Trust with
corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit holders.
Distributable Income Per Unit
Basic distributable income per Unit is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted
average of Units outstanding. Distributable income per Unit assuming dilution is computed by
dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units and equivalent Units
outstanding. The Trust had no equivalent Units outstanding for any period presented. Therefore,
basic distributable income per Unit and distributable income per Unit assuming dilution are the
same.
New Accounting Pronouncements
There are no new accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on
the Trust’s financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 Condensed Statements of Distributable
Income to conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on distributable
income for the prior periods reported.
3. NET OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTERESTS AND DISTRIBUTION TO UNIT HOLDERS
The amounts to be distributed to Unit holders (“Monthly Distribution Amounts”) are determined on
a monthly basis. The Monthly Distribution Amount is an amount equal to the sum of cash
received by the Trustee during a calendar month attributable to the Royalties, any reduction in
cash reserves and any other cash receipts of the Trust, including interest, reduced by the sum of
liabilities paid and any increase in cash reserves. If the Monthly Distribution Amount for any
monthly period is a negative number, then the distribution will be zero for such month. To the
extent the distribution amount is a negative number, that amount will be carried forward and
deducted from future monthly distributions until the cumulative distribution calculation becomes a
positive number, at which time a distribution will be made. Unit holders of record will be entitled
to receive the calculated Monthly Distribution Amount for each month on or before 10 business
days after the monthly record date, which is generally the last business day of each calendar
month.
The cash received by the Trustee consists of the amounts received by owners of the interest
burdened by the Royalties from the sale of production less the sum of applicable taxes, accrued
11
production costs, development and drilling costs, operating charges and other costs and
deductions, multiplied by 75% in the case of the Waddell Ranch properties and 95% in the case
of the Texas Royalty properties.
4. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
For federal income tax purposes, the Trust constitutes a fixed investment trust that is taxed as a
grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to federal income tax at the trust level. The Unit holders
are considered for federal tax purposes to own the Trust’s income and principal as though no
trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by
each Unit holder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust and not when
distributed by the Trust.
5. STATE TAX CONSIDERATIONS
All revenues from the Trust are from sources within Texas, which has no individual income tax.
Texas imposes a franchise tax at a rate of .75% on gross revenues less certain deductions, as
specifically set forth in the Texas franchise tax statutes. Entities subject to tax generally include
trusts and most other types of entities that provide limited liability protection, unless otherwise
exempt. Trusts that receive at least 90% of their federal gross income from designated passive
sources, including royalties from mineral properties and other non-operated mineral interest
income, and do not receive more than 10% of their income from operating an active trade or
business, generally are exempt from the Texas franchise tax as “passive entities.” The Trust has
been and expects to continue to be exempt from Texas franchise tax as a “passive entity.”
Because the Trust should be exempt from Texas franchise tax at the Trust level as a passive
entity, each Unit holder that is considered a taxable entity under the Texas franchise tax will
generally be required to include its portion of Trust revenues in its own Texas franchise tax
computation. This revenue is sourced to Texas under provisions of the Texas Administrative
Code providing that such income is sourced according to the principal place of business of the
Trust, which is Texas.
Unit holders should consult their tax advisors regarding state tax requirements, if any, applicable
to such Unit holder’s ownership of Trust units.
6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies related to the Underlying Properties that are unfavorably resolved would generally
be reflected by the Trust as reductions to future royalty income payments to the Trust with
corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit holders.
7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
12
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Trust declared a distribution on July 19, 2016 of $0.040122 per
Unit payable on August 12, 2016 to Unit holders of record on July 29, 2016.

Item 2. Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis
Forward Looking Information
Certain information included in this report contains, and other materials filed or to be filed by the
Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as well as information included in oral
statements or other written statements made or to be made by the Trust) may contain or include,
forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Such forward
looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, capital expenditures, drilling
activity, development activities, production efforts and volumes, hydrocarbon prices and the
results thereof, and regulatory matters. Although the Trustee believes that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such expectations are subject to
numerous risks and uncertainties and the Trustee can give no assurance that they will prove
correct. There are many factors, none of which are within the Trustee’s control, that may cause
such expectations not to be realized, including, among other things, factors such as actual oil and
gas prices and the recoverability of reserves, capital expenditures, general economic conditions,
actions and policies of petroleum-producing nations and other changes in the domestic and
international energy markets. Such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by
words such as “estimate,” “expect,” “predict,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “should,” “assume,” “believe,” or
other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, royalty income received by the Trust amounted to
$4,379,766 compared to royalty income of $4,121,910 during the second quarter of 2015. The
increase in royalty income is primarily attributable to a reduction of capital expenditures and an
increase in oil and gas production, offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices for the quarter
ending June 30, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Average oil and gas
prices were $30.02 and $1.79 for the quarter ending June 30, 2016 compared to $48.47 and
$2.63 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
Interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, was $232 compared to $17 during the
second quarter of 2015. The increase in interest income is primarily attributable to substantially
increased amounts of funds available for investment, primarily the reserve of $800,000 in the
Trust account. Total expenses during the second quarter of 2016 amounted to $565,013
compared to $450,958 during the second quarter of 2015. The increase in total expenses can be
primarily attributed to increased expense for professional services.
14
These transactions resulted in distributable income for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, of
$3,664,985 or $0.08 per Unit of beneficial interest. Distributions of $0.010037, $0.034016 and
$0.034538 per Unit were made to Unit holders of record as of April 29, 2016, May 31, 2016, and
June 30, 2016, respectively. For the second quarter of 2015, distributable income was
$3,520,969 or $.08 per Unit of beneficial interest.
Royalty income for the Trust for the second quarter of the calendar year is associated with actual
oil and gas production for the period of February, March and April 2016 from the properties from
which the Trust’s net overriding royalty interests (“Royalties”) were carved. Oil and gas sales
attributable to the Royalties and the properties from which the Royalties were carved are as
follows:
Royalties:
Oil sales (Bbls)
Gas sales (Mcf)
Properties From Which The Royalties
Were Carved:

The average received price of oil decreased to an average price per barrel of $32.71 per Bbl in
the second quarter of 2016, compared to $48.47 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2015 due to
worldwide market variables. The Trustee has been advised by ConocoPhillips that for the period
of August 1, 1993, through June 30, 2016, the oil from the Waddell Ranch properties was being
sold under a competitive bid to a third party. The average price of gas (including natural gas
liquids) decreased from $2.63 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.81 per Mcf in the
second quarter of 2016 due to change in overall market variables.
15
Since the oil and gas sales attributable to the Royalties are based on an allocation formula that is
dependent on such factors as price and cost (including capital expenditures), the production
amounts in the Royalties section of the above table do not provide a meaningful comparison. Oil
sales volumes increased and gas sales volumes increased from the Underlying Properties (as
defined in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015) for
the applicable period in 2016 compared to 2015.
Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch
properties during the second quarter of 2016 totaled $710,000 as compared to $3.4 million for the
second quarter of 2015. ConocoPhillips has informed the Trustee that the 2016 capital
expenditures budget has been approved at $2.45 million (gross) for the Waddell Ranch
properties. The total amount of capital expenditures for 2015 with regard to the Waddell Ranch
properties totaled $27 million (gross).
The Trustee has been advised that there were no workover wells completed, no new wells
completed, no new wells in progress and no workover wells in progress during the three months
ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 4 workover wells completed, 0 new wells completed, 5
new wells in progress and 0 workover wells in progress for the three months ended June 30,
2015, on the Waddell Ranch properties. There were various facility projects in progress for the
second quarter of 2016.
Lease operating expenses and property taxes totaled $5.5 million (gross) for the second quarter
of 2016, compared to $6.9 million (gross) for the same period in 2015 on the Waddell Ranch
properties due to decreased activities on the Waddell Ranch.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, royalty income received by the Trust amounted to
$7,149,802 compared to royalty income of $8,752,016 for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease in royalty income is primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in oil and
gas prices for the six months ending June 30, 2016, as compared to the six months ended June
30, 2015. Average oil and gas prices were $33.61 and $1.95 for the six months ending June 30,
2016 compared to $52.13 and $3.12 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2016, was $316 compared to $49 during the
six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income is primarily attributable to
substantially increased amounts of funds available for investment, including the reserve for
expense. Total expenses during the six months ending June 30, 2016, amounted to $879,847
compared to $847,051 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in total
expenses can be primarily attributed to increased professional expenses.
16
The Trust has reserved $300,000 for for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 for possible
administrative expenditures which could be needed in the future.
These transactions resulted in distributable income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of
$5,970,271, or $.13 per Unit. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, distributable income was
$7,705,014, or $.17 per Unit.
Royalty income for the Trust for the six months ended June 30, 2016, is associated with actual oil
and gas production for the period November 2015 through April 2016 from the properties from
which the Royalties were carved. Oil and gas production attributable to the Royalties and the
properties from which the Royalties were carved are as follows:

The average received price of oil decreased during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to
$33.61 per barrel compared to $52.13 per barrel for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the
average price of oil is primarily due to worldwide market variables. The decrease in the average
price of gas (including natural gas liquids) from $3.12 per Mcf for the six months ended June 30,
2015, to $1.95 per Mcf for the six months ended June 30, 2016, is primarily the result of a
decrease in the spot prices of natural gas.
17
Since the oil and gas sales volumes attributable to the Royalties are based on an allocation
formula that is dependent on such factors as price and cost (including capital expenditures), the
production amounts in the Royalties section of the above table do not provide a meaningful
comparison. Both oil and gas sales volumes from the properties from which the Royalties are
carved have increased for the applicable period of 2016 compared to 2015.
Capital expenditures for the Waddell Ranch properties for the six months ended June 30, 2016
totaled $3.3 million (gross) compared to $13.6 million (gross) to the Trust for the same period in
2015. ConocoPhillips has previously advised the Trust that the 2016 capital expenditures budget
for the Waddell Ranch properties is $2.45 million (gross).
The Trustee has been advised that no workover wells were completed and no new wells were
completed (no vertical, no horizontal) on the Waddell Ranch properties during the six months
ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 10 workover wells completed and 3 new wells (2 vertical,
1 horizontal) completed on the Waddell Ranch properties during the six months ended June 30,
2015.
Lease operating expenses and property taxes totaled $12.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to $13.7 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in lease
operating expense is primarily attributable to decreased spending on facilities and maintenance.
Calculation of Royalty Income
The Trust’s royalty income is computed as a percentage of the net profit from the operation of the
properties in which the Trust owns net overriding royalty interests. These percentages of net
profits are 75% and 95% in the case of the Waddell Ranch properties and the Texas Royalty
properties, respectively. Royalty income received by the Trust for the three months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were computed as shown in the table below:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
A disclosure of critical accounting policies and the more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of the Trust’s financial statements is included in Item 7 of the Trust’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no
significant changes to the critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Distributable Income Per Unit
Basic distributable income per Unit is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted
average of Units outstanding. Distributable income per Unit assuming dilution is computed by
dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units and equivalent Units
outstanding. The Trust had no equivalent Units outstanding for any period presented. Therefore,
basic distributable income per Unit and distributable income per Unit assuming dilution are the
same.
New Accounting Pronouncements
There are no new accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on
the Trust’s financial statements.
Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes in the Trust’s market risk, as disclosed in the Trust’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
On May 14, 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
issued an updated version of its Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the “2013 Framework”)
which helps organizations design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control
concepts and simplify their use and application. As of the end of the period covered by this report,
the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15
based on the criteria established in the 2013 Framework. Based upon that evaluation, the
Trustee concluded that the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording,
processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by
the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are
effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to
the Trustee to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In its evaluation of
20
disclosure controls and procedures, the Trustee has relied, to the extent considered reasonable,
on information provided by Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company LP, the owner of the
Waddell Ranch properties, and Riverhill Energy Corporation, the owner of the Texas Royalty
properties. There has not been any change in the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting
during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting.
