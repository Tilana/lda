<p><b>  Piloting principles for effective company/stakeholder grievance 
mechanisms: A report of lessons learned</b>* **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> This report sets out key lessons learned from a pilot project conducted in 2009-2010 
to test the practical applicability of a set of principles for effective non-judicial grievance 
mechanisms that address complaints or disputes involving businesses and their 
stakeholders. The principles were developed by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises and set out in his reports to the Human Rights Council in 2008 
(A/HRC/8/5) and 2009 (A/HRC/11/13). 
</p>
<p> The project was conducted on behalf of the Special Representative to help refine 
these principles in advance of their incorporation into a wider set of Guiding principles on 
business and human rights (A/HRC/17/31), which the Special Representative will present 
to the Human Rights Council in June 2011. The project focused on operational-level 
grievance mechanisms &#8211; that is, mechanisms developed by companies with/for 
stakeholders affected by their operations. The companies involved in the four main pilots to 
design or revise grievance mechanisms in line with the Special Representative&#8217;s principles 
were Carbones del Cerrej&#243;n, a coal mine in Colombia; Esquel Group, a Hong Kong-based

Investment Corporation, an oil and gas company in the Russian Federation; and Tesco 
Stores Ltd, a United Kingdom-based multinational supermarket chain, working with 
suppliers in South Africa.  An adjunct project with Hewlett-Packard and two of its 
suppliers in China retrospectively analyzed their collaborative efforts to enhance suppliers&#8217; 
grievance mechanisms and reviewed them in light of the Special Representative&#8217;s 
principles. 
</p>
<p> The purpose of the pilot project was to test the benefits of grievance mechanisms 
that are aligned with the Special Representative&#8217;s principles, and to learn lessons about how 
the principles could be further refined to reflect operational realities and enable their 
practical application. The extensive time spent in the process of designing or revising the 
grievance mechanisms meant that there was little time to monitor their operation in 
practice. Any such review will require further work in future. However, substantial lessons 
were gained from the processes undertaken. Those that are of most general relevance are

(the methodology of the adjunct project is described in that specific report2). Section III

(adjustments were limited to the extent that they had to be applicable, not only to 
operational-level mechanisms, but also to other kinds of non-judicial mechanisms covered 
by the principles). Section IV offers a brief conclusion, and sets out the principles as 
revised.

<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Project background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In his work as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie 
has set out a range of guiding principles designed to help prevent and address any human 
rights harms that business enterprises may cause or contribute to, or which may be linked 
via a business relationship to their operations, products and services.3 The guiding 
principles underline that where such human rights harms nevertheless occur, those affected 
must have access to effective remedy. Effective judicial systems must be at the core of any 
such system of remedy, yet they are not always available, accessible, appropriate, or the 
desired avenue of those impacted. Non-judicial grievance mechanisms therefore provide an 
important complement and supplement for such situations.  
</p>
<p>2. In his 2008 report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/8/5), and following 
extensive research and consultation, the Special Representative set out<b> </b>six criteria or 
principles (para. 92) that should underpin any non-judicial grievance mechanism: 
legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, equitability, rights-compatibility and transparency. 
For mechanisms at the operational level &#8211; that is, at the level where business enterprises 
interface with the individuals or groups they may impact (affected stakeholders) &#8211;, he 
added the principle that these should operate through direct or mediated dialogue (para. 95), 
rather than through unilateral decisions (quasi-adjudication) on the part of the company. 
</p>
<p>3. As noted, these principles are applicable to any non-judicial grievance mechanism. 
They have been taken up already by a number of organizations in reviewing or developing 
their own mechanisms.4 The Special Representative decided to pilot their application 
specifically with regard to operational-level mechanisms. This decision reflects a number of 
factors: 
</p>
<p>(a) Numerous existing standards that companies commit to meet already require 
that those companies have operational-level grievance mechanisms in place.5 Clarity is 
needed on what makes such grievance mechanisms meaningful in practice; 
</p>
<p>(b) Operational-level grievance mechanisms face particular challenges given that 
companies themselves are closely involved in their design and administration, which can 
make the mechanisms vulnerable to critiques of being biased or illegitimate sources of 
remedy for harms. Robust criteria for effectiveness are important in addressing this risk; 
</p>
<p>  
 3 See Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, 
</p>
<p>Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework (A/HRC/17/31), 21 March 2011. 
 4 For example, the principles have been drawn on in the review process of the Guidelines for 
</p>
<p>Multinational Enterprises of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, with 
regard to the role of OECD National Contact Points in handling complaints; they are reflected in the 
ISO 26000 standard on corporate social responsibility; and they have been referred to by various 
companies, international, industry and multi-stakeholder organizations that are developing their own 
grievance mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> 5 These include the Performance Standards of the International Finance Corporation, which are 
mirrored in the Equator Principles followed by 70 financial institutions; the ISO 14000 standard; and 
initiatives such as Social Accountability International, the Fair Labor Association and Ethical Trading 
Initiative. The International Council on Mining and Metals has also developed guidance for its 
members on the development of grievance mechanisms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>(c) The corporate responsibility to respect human rights set out in the guiding 
principles requires that business enterprises should establish or participate in effective, 
operational-level grievance mechanisms for affected stakeholders. Enterprises need clarity 
on how to achieve this in a manageable and sustainable way. 
</p>
<p>4. In light of these particular needs, the Special Representative decided to pilot the 
grievance mechanism principles with companies and their stakeholders at the operational 
level, in order to test their practical applicability in a range of contexts.  
</p>
<p>5. In March 2009, the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), International 
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) 
to the OECD announced their readiness to collaborate with the Special Representative on 
this project. Four companies volunteered to take part in the full pilot project: 
</p>
<p>(a) Carbones del Cerrej&#243;n Ltd. in Colombia &#8211; a coal mining joint venture of 
Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Xstrata Coal; 
</p>
<p>(b) Esquel Group in Hong Kong &#8211; piloting a mechanism at its apparel facility in 
Viet Nam; 
</p>
<p>(c) Sakhalin Energy Investment Corporation in the Russian Federation &#8211; an oil 
and gas joint venture of Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi 
Corporation; 
</p>
<p>(d) Tesco Stores Ltd<b>. &#8211;</b> a major United Kingdom supermarket working with a 
group of its fruit suppliers in South Africa; 
</p>
<p>6. These four pilot projects involved collaboration with the companies and, through 
them, with their local stakeholders to design or amend grievance procedures in line with the 
principles. The purpose of the pilots was twofold:  
</p>
<p>(a) To test the benefits that mechanisms aligned with the principles can have as a 
means of remedy for impacted stakeholders, and as a means of risk management and 
accountability for companies; 
</p>
<p>(b) To learn how the principles can be further refined to reflect operational 
realities and enable their practical application by companies. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, an adjunct project was conducted in collaboration with the technology 
company Hewlett-Packard (HP) to review its recent efforts to help two of its suppliers in 
China enhance their grievance procedures for workers. This project involved a research 
team of students and faculty from the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program 
at Harvard Law School. It aimed to review the suppliers&#8217; grievance mechanisms; consider 
how adjustments made to them in collaboration with HP relate to the principles; and draw 
lessons for HP, the suppliers and the principles themselves.  
</p>
<p><b> B. What are operational-level grievance mechanisms? 
</b></p>
<p>8. As noted, operational-level grievance mechanisms are those that operate at the 
interface between a business enterprise and its affected stakeholders. They are therefore 
directly accessible to those who may be impacted. Typically, they are administered by the 
business enterprise either alone or in collaboration with others, including the affected 
stakeholders or their legitimate representatives. They may also be provided through 
recourse to a mutually acceptable external expert or body, such as an externally 
administered hotline. They can engage the company directly in assessing the issues and 
seeking remediation of any harm. They do not require that those bringing a complaint first 
access other means of recourse, and they must not preclude access to State-based judicial or 
non-judicial mechanisms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>9. Operational-level grievance mechanisms perform two key functions regarding the 
corporate responsibility to respect human rights: 
</p>
<p>(a) First, they support the identification of adverse human rights impacts as a 
part of an enterprise&#8217;s ongoing human rights due diligence.6 They do so by providing a 
channel for those directly impacted by the company&#8217;s operations to raise concerns when 
they believe they are being or will be harmed. By analyzing trends and patterns in 
complaints, companies can also identify systemic problems and adapt their practices 
accordingly; 
</p>
<p>(b) Second, these mechanisms make it possible for grievances, once identified, to 
be addressed, and for harms to be remediated early and directly by the company, whether 
alone or in collaboration with others involved, thereby preventing harms from 
compounding, and grievances from escalating. 
</p>
<p>10. Such mechanisms need not require that a complaint or grievance amount to an 
alleged human rights abuse before it can be raised. Rather, they aim to identify any 
legitimate concerns of those who may be adversely impacted. If these concerns are not 
identified and addressed, they may over time escalate into more major disputes and human 
rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>11. It is also important to note that while operational-level grievance mechanisms can be 
important complements to wider stakeholder engagement and collective bargaining 
processes, they cannot, and should not, be used to substitute for either. Equally important, 
they should not be used to undermine the role of legitimate trade unions in addressing 
labour-related disputes, or to preclude access to judicial or non-judicial grievance 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>Box A: Principles tested in the pilot project</b> 
The seven principles being piloted consist of the six principles for all non-judicial 
</p>
<p>grievance mechanisms, first set out in the Special Representative&#8217;s report to the Human 
Rights Council in 2008 (A/HRC/8/5, para. 92), plus the additional principle for operational-
level grievance mechanisms specified in his 2009 report (A/HRC/11/13, para. 99). Taken 
together, they specify that operational-level grievance mechanisms should be: 
</p>
<p>(a)<b> Legitimate:</b> having a clear, transparent and sufficiently independent 
governance structure to ensure that no party to a particular grievance process can interfere 
with the fair conduct of that process;  
</p>
<p>(b)<b> Accessible:</b> being publicized to those who may wish to access it and 
providing adequate assistance for aggrieved parties who may face barriers to access, 
including language, literacy, awareness, finance, distance, or fear of reprisal; 
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Predictable:</b> providing a clear and known procedure with a time frame for 
each stage and clarity on the types of process and outcome it can (and cannot) offer, as well 
as a means of monitoring the implementation of any outcome; 
</p>
<p>  
 6 The Special Representative has articulated the process of &#8220;human rights due diligence&#8221; as a key 
</p>
<p>process that business enterprises need to have in place in order to know and show that they are 
meeting their responsibility to respect human rights.  Human rights due diligence was reflected in the 
Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework that the Human Rights Council unanimously welcomed in 
</p><p>2008. It is further elaborated in the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights that the 
Special Representative submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2011 
(document A/HRC/17/31).  Identifying and assessing the adverse impacts with which a business 
enterprise may be involved is the first step in human rights due diligence. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>(d) <b>Equitable:</b> ensuring that aggrieved parties have reasonable access to sources 
of information, advice and expertise necessary to engage in a grievance process on fair and 
equitable terms; 
</p>
<p>(e) <b>Rights-compatible:</b> ensuring that its outcomes and remedies accord with 
internationally recognized human rights standards; 
</p>
<p>(f) <b>Transparent:</b> providing sufficient transparency of process and outcome to 
meet the public interest concerns at stake and presuming transparency wherever possible; 
non-State mechanisms in particular should be transparent about the receipt of complaints 
and the key elements of their outcomes; 
</p>
<p>(g) <b>Based on</b> <b>dialogue and engagement</b>: focusing on processes of direct and/or 
mediated dialogue to seek agreed solutions, and leaving adjudication to independent third-
party mechanisms, whether judicial or non-judicial. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> II. Project methodology 
</b></p>
<p>12. For each of the main pilots, a project facilitator was appointed to work with the 
participating companies and liaise with the project director.7 The participating companies 
agreed: 
</p>
<p>(a) To participate in full collaboration toward the project&#8217;s objectives of devising 
and testing a grievance mechanism in line with the principles;  
</p>
<p>(b) To share with the facilitator and project director, on a confidential basis, all 
information necessary to understand existing grievance-handling mechanisms or processes, 
and relevant systems and data;  
</p>
<p>(c) To take the lead in design of the grievance mechanism, building on their 
existing systems and experience. 
</p>
<p>13. The project facilitators acted as advisers and coaches in the process of devising the 
new or revised grievance mechanisms, monitoring their performance and responding to 
developments in the course of the pilot projects. They undertook three visits to each of the 
pilots and liaised with the companies regularly between visits. The project director provided 
support and oversight. She visited each pilot site once with the facilitator in order to assist 
the learning processes and draw out comparative lessons across the four pilots.  
</p>
<p>14. In order to have fuller background and guidance on which to draw, the project used 
the Guidance Tool for Rights-Compatible Grievance Mechanisms developed by the 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, which 
also resulted from the research conducted on behalf of the Special Representative&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>  
 7 The project director was Caroline Rees of the Corporate Social Responsibility at Harvard Kennedy 
</p>
<p>School.  The facilitator for the pilots with Sakhalin Energy Investment Corporation and Carbones del 
Cerrej&#243;n was Luc Zandvliet, formerly with CDA Collaborative Learning Projects and now Triple R 
Alliance. The facilitator for the pilots with Esquel Group and Tesco was Doug Cahn of The Cahn 
Group. The adjunct project was led by Stephan Sonnenberg, Clinical Instructor and Lecturer in Law 
at the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program.  The separate methodology for this 
adjunct project, which was a retrospective review of processes that had been completed, is described 
in the specific report on that project, which can be accessed at http://www.business&#8211;
humanrights.org/SpecialRepPortal/Home; and http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m&#8211;
rcbg/CSRI/pub_reports.html. </p>

</p>
<p>mandate. For more on the relationship between the Special Representative&#8217;s grievance 
mechanism principles and the guidance tool, see box B below. 
</p>
<p>15. At the first site visit, the project facilitator and the participating company 
representatives worked through the Special Representative&#8217;s principles together with the 
guidance tool to build a shared view of the objectives in piloting the principles and to assess 
where the challenges would lie. Initial exchanges also explored the company&#8217;s existing 
systems and processes for handling grievances, any relevant baseline data, past experience 
with disputes, relevant stakeholder groups and the conflict/dispute environment. There was 
an early discussion with relevant staff from each project about the grievance mechanism 
principles.  In light of these exchanges, the participating companies identified how they 
wished to take forward the process of aligning their grievance procedures with the 
principles.  Subsequent visits and exchanges focused on discussing the progress, challenges 
and learning, with the project team providing support and advice. 
</p>
<p><b>Box B: Relationship between the Special Representative&#8217;s grievance 
mechanism principles and the Guidance Tool for Rights-Compatible 
Grievance Mechanisms 
</b>The Guidance Tool for Rights-Compatible Grievance Mechanisms focuses exclusively on 
operational-level grievance mechanisms. The principles it sets out are broadly the same as 
those put forward by the Special Representative, as they resulted from the same research 
processes. They vary only to the extent that they were developed with this focus in mind 
and did not need to address other forms of non-judicial mechanism. In the context of the 
pilot projects, they provided the participants with additional guidance points for thinking 
through how to implement the Special Representative&#8217;s principles in practice.  
</p>
<p>There are two substantive differences between the guidance tool and the Special 
Representative&#8217;s principles, which are highlighted here as they are relevant to the conduct 
and outcomes of this pilot work.  
</p>
<p>The first is that the guidance tool does not include a principle on rights-compatibility since 
the entire tool is framed in terms of designing rights-compatible grievance mechanisms; 
that is, mechanisms that can provide processes and outcomes that are in line with human 
rights standards. The pilot projects were not in a position to assess the rights-compatibility 
of individual outcomes from the grievance mechanisms developed. However, discussions 
of other principles frequently reviewed their role in ensuring that the mechanisms should 
(a) be capable of delivering rights-compatible outcomes; and (b) provide processes that 
reflect rights-based principles such as inclusion, participation, non-discrimination, 
transparency, accountability and attention to vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>The second substantive distinction is that the guidance tool contains a principle that 
operational-level grievance mechanisms should be a source of continuous learning. This 
specifies that the effectiveness of a mechanism should be measured, and cumulative lessons 
from complaints should be reviewed, in order to identify systemic changes needed to either 
company practices or the workings of the grievance mechanism itself.  The principles set 
out by the Special Representative do not include this provision. One of the points of 
learning was just how important this element is in the context of operational-level grievance 
mechanisms.  Given its applicability to other forms of non-judicial grievance mechanism, it 
is reflected in the revised version of the principles (or effectiveness criteria) included in the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
 
</p>
<p>16. The pilots were conducted first and foremost in collaboration with the participant 
companies. Discussions of how they were involving local stakeholders in the mechanism </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>design or review processes were a constant feature of the collaboration; however, the 
project team did not directly engage those stakeholders other than: 
</p>
<p>(a) During visits, with those stakeholders formally involved in the process; and 
</p>
<p>(b) Through ad hoc conversations with wider stakeholders, where this was 
possible and offered a good chance of getting open and honest feedback (language, cultural 
and other barriers were considered in making this assessment). 
</p>
<p>17. When third parties requested information about the pilots, the project team directed 
them towards the participant companies and the local stakeholders who were formally 
involved, given the importance of their ownership of the processes. 
</p>
<p>18. The project had initially envisaged a period of monitoring and evaluation once the 
aligned or new mechanisms were in place. In practice, the design process, including the 
need for extensive engagement with both external and internal stakeholders, delayed the 
launch of the mechanisms in three of the four pilots and therefore limited the extent to 
which they could be monitored and evaluated in practice. However, the work done revealed 
extensive learning about the design process in widely varied situations, which is set out in 
the individual pilot reports together with any findings that did emerge from the early stages 
of their implementation.  
</p>
<p>19. Individual reports on each of the four main pilots and on the adjunct project with HP 
and its suppliers are available as annexes to this report on the Special Representative&#8217;s web 
portal and the website of the CSR Initiative.8 The reports were written by the project 
facilitators and the HP project team respectively. They were sent to the participating 
companies for fact-checking only. Their aim is not to rate the work done by the 
participating companies nor the resulting grievance mechanisms, but to set out the mutual 
learning gained from the process; that is, learning for the participating companies, which 
will also be relevant for many other companies seeking to implement the principles in their 
own operations, and learning for the Special Representative&#8217;s mandate. The learning for the 
Special Representative&#8217;s mandate is set out in this overarching report and is reflected 
directly in the revision of the grievance mechanism principles themselves. 
</p>
<p>20. The terms of reference for the projects were set out in memoranda of understanding 
between the CSR Initiative and the companies involved, reflecting also the independent role 
of the facilitators. Basic costs of the facilitators&#8217; time and expenses in the four main pilots 
were covered by the companies involved. The CSR Initiative covered the costs of its own 
involvement, including site visits. HP contributed towards the project costs of both the 
Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Project and the CSR Initiative in the adjunct 
project involving its suppliers.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>21. This section of the report draws together some of the key lessons learned from all 
the pilots in terms of the Special Representative&#8217;s principles for non-judicial grievance 
mechanisms. The lessons are organized under the various principles. Each begins by 
restating the principle that was being tested. This is followed by an overview of some of the 
key learning points that emerged from across the various pilots with regard to that principle.  
Given the inter-relatedness of the principles themselves, some learning points are inevitably 
relevant to more than one principle. The closing box summarizes the lessons that have led 
to specific revisions to the principle, and then sets out the principle, as revised.

<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> A. Legitimacy 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle tested 
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Legitimate</b>: having a clear, transparent and sufficiently independent governance structure 
to ensure that no party to a particular grievance process can interfere with the fair conduct 
of that process. 
 
</p>
<p>22. The summary of the legitimacy principle focuses on formal governance as the means 
to ensure a fair and accountable process. In non-judicial grievance mechanisms 
administered by agencies of a State or industry or multi-stakeholder organizations, formal 
accountability structures of this kind are essential. In the context of operational-level 
grievance mechanisms, such structures may also play an important role. For instance, there 
are formal provisions for the accountability of Sakhalin Energy&#8217;s mechanism to the 
company&#8217;s investors.  
</p>
<p>23. At the same time, for a smaller company, like Esquel Garment Vietnam (EGV), the 
opportunities for upwards accountability structures independent of the EGV management 
are more constrained. EGV provided for oversight through the involvement of a senior 
manager from its Hong Kong corporate office and a representative of the State-endorsed 
trade union (a member of EGV&#8217;s management), but clearly, the independence of both could 
be open to challenge.   
</p>
<p>24. Experience from the pilots underlined that while upwards accountability for an 
operational-level grievance mechanism could provide formal legitimacy and important 
incentives to ensure that the mechanism worked effectively, the ultimate test was whether 
its intended end-users trusted it enough to use it. In other words, the perception of its 
legitimacy among those users was the more essential factor.  
</p>
<p>25. Tesco worked with local stakeholders in the Western Cape (supplier and exporter 
organizations, NGOs and trade unions) to create an Oversight Stakeholder Body (OSB) that 
oversaw the design of the grievance mechanisms for participating farms.  If this remains in 
place, it will provide for some upwards accountability for the mechanisms as they are 
applied at the farm level. Its broad membership also holds opportunities to reassure the 
workers for whom the mechanisms are intended that they are worth using.  
</p>
<p>26. The OSB therefore provided a way for Tesco and its local stakeholders to build the 
actual and the perceived legitimacy of the mechanisms that were developed. It also held 
challenges. Some of the farms approached to participate in the project declined due to 
distrust of the union and NGO involvement. It is hoped that with time, positive results from 
those farms that did participate will be seen by those who did not and will build their 
confidence in joining this particular endeavour. 
</p>
<p>27. Other pilots tried different approaches to building perceived legitimacy of the 
mechanism among affected stakeholders. At Sakhalin Energy, surveys suggested that the 
main challenge for the perceived legitimacy of the mechanism was among indigenous 
populations rather than the main communities, where trust appeared to be high. The 
company therefore focused on developing, together with indigenous leaders, distinct 
structures tailored to provide appropriate processes to address grievances related to the 
Sakhalin Indigenous Minorities Development Plan.   
</p>
<p>28. Cerrej&#243;n held multiple discussions with internal and external stakeholders to try to 
ensure that the procedures they developed would be seen as legitimate and trustworthy. 
Recognizing that the perception of legitimacy is built over time, Cerrej&#243;n also planned for 
other ways of involving affected stakeholders in the conduct of the mechanism. For </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>instance, the company provided for joint fact-finding<b> </b>during the first investigation phase 
after a grievance is raised, in which the aggrieved person joins the investigator during his or 
her first visit.  
</p>
<p>29. In the adjunct project involving suppliers to HP, the review team highlighted the 
extent to which one of the suppliers has both involved workers in the design and 
implementation of the system and welcomed support from outside actors &#8211; including HP, a 
local NGO focused on the rights of women workers, and subsequently the lead facilitator; 
the latter was invited back to help HP strengthen its consensus-building approaches.  
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
</b></p>
<p>Trust among intended users of a mechanism is of paramount importance if the mechanism 
is to achieve legitimacy. Formal and independent oversight structures may well play a role 
in achieving this trust in operational-level grievance mechanisms, just as they typically do 
in other non-judicial mechanisms.  But other factors &#8211; including other effectiveness criteria 
discussed in this report, not least, transparency, dialogue and engagement &#8211; may be equally, 
or more, important. Understanding what engenders trust, and building that trust, requires 
engagement with the affected stakeholders. Involving them in the design or review of the 
mechanism or in providing feedback on its performance can be particularly important for 
the perceived legitimacy of mechanisms of this kind. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, the focus of this principle has shifted towards the objective of achieving trust &#8211; 
or perceived legitimacy &#8211; rather than suggesting that formal, independent oversight is 
always a necessary and sufficient means to gain legitimacy. Nevertheless, the provision of 
accountability &#8211; internal and, where appropriate, external &#8211; for the mechanism&#8217;s 
performance remains important and relates also to other principles, including predictability 
and transparency. 
</p>
<p><b>Revised principle 
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Legitimate</b>: enabling trust from the stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended, 
and being accountable for the fair conduct of grievance processes. 
 
</p>
<p><b> B. Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle tested 
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Accessible</b>: being publicized to those who may wish to access it and providing adequate 
assistance for aggrieved parties who may face barriers to access, including language, 
literacy, awareness, finance, distance, or fear of reprisal. 
 
</p>
<p>30. Operational-level grievance mechanisms often have the advantage of being close to 
those whose grievances they are designed to address. In these cases, it is typically easier to 
ensure that the intended user groups are aware of the mechanism than in the case of more 
remote mechanisms, for instance those run by a government agency or international 
organization.9  
</p>
<p>  
 9 The concept of closeness as used here does not simply indicate physical proximity, though that may 
</p>
<p>be the case, in particular with regard to employees or communities around a company&#8217;s operations.  It 
refers more generally to a relative ease of direct interaction between the administrators of the 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>31. In practice, challenges remain. For Cerrej&#243;n, the communities affected by its 
operations are not just around its mine but also along the 150-km railroad it owns between 
the mine and the port. There are around 25,000 individuals in nearly 250 affected 
communities. Although the Grievance Office now has five full-time staff members, the 
ratio of staff to community members is still challenging. However, the company has 
developed multiple access points for contractors, employees and communities to raise 
complaints by phone, email or in person. Its main innovation has been to train Cerrej&#243;n 
staff who are in constant contact with communities to receive complaints. Cerrej&#243;n has 
engaged Wayu&#8217;u advisors who can communicate with indigenous communities in their own 
language, and the company&#8217;s new processes for social engagement with communities along 
the railroad will provide further access points for the mechanism. These measures in part 
respond to a wish on the part of the indigenous Wayu&#8217;u communities to have access points 
to the mechanism in the community rather than at a Cerrej&#243;n-associated facility, and their 
preference for in-person communication over other means.  
</p>
<p>32. There are also many communities along the 800-km length of Sakhalin Energy&#8217;s 
pipeline, which runs along most of the island. The company had already put in place 
extensive measures to publicize its grievance mechanism at the start of the project. These 
included community liaison officers, flyers, billboard advertisements and community 
librarians trained to receive complaints, among others. Despite all these efforts, the project 
team found that many people in its communities did not know of the mechanism when 
asked on the street, even when interviewed under an enormous poster advertising the 
mechanism in the town square. However, these individuals also expressed no concerns 
about what to do if they had a complaint&#8211; they would either go to the company or to the 
local authorities.  By contrast, separate work to monitor the success of the Sakhalin 
Indigenous Minorities Development Plan showed that although many indigenous 
individuals did have concerns, they were both unaware of the mechanism and lacked 
channels they trusted through which to register their complaints. The company therefore 
focused on addressing those issues of accessibility in cooperation with representatives of 
indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>33. The pilots highlighted the fact that people are unlikely to retain knowledge provided 
to them about a grievance mechanism when they have no grievances. It is rather dry 
information and seems of little relevance in their busy lives. Making sure that individuals 
can find the information at the time a grievance arises is most important. The human 
resources department at Sakhalin Energy has information on the company intranet about its 
employee grievance mechanism and periodically makes it part of the pop-up on the login 
page for employees each morning. The community relations team explains recourse options 
to complainants if no agreed solution can be found.  
</p>
<p>34. At Sakhalin Energy and Cerrej&#243;n, there are various ways in which individuals can 
access the grievance mechanisms, including community liaison officers or roving grievance 
officers. At EGV &#8211; a much smaller enterprise &#8211; management had also made efforts to 
broaden the range of avenues of access. While workers indicated in a survey that the 
favoured person to whom to take complaints was often their immediate supervisor, the 
management is adding monthly Open Talk sessions with groups of workers and is opening 
a notice board specifically for grievances by the bicycle parking area, outside the factory &#8211; 
an area where workers typically spend their leisure time. At one of the HP supply factories 
involved in the adjunct project, the use of a counsellor as a trusted individual that workers 
</p>
<p>  
mechanism and the affected stakeholder groups for whose use it is intended.  This could be the case, 
for example, where an information and communications technology company has the ability to use 
the same technologies it provides to users in order to receive and respond to many of their concerns or 
complaints.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>could go to with problems, including grievances, about the workplace, seemed to be 
working well. The other HP supplier is now putting a similar system in place, but had also 
developed a hotline process as part of its collaboration with HP. While a local NGO 
initially ran the hotline, it has now been handed over to a mix of workers and managers and 
has become a centrepiece of the factory&#8217;s revised grievance process.  
</p>
<p>35. In the case of the three Tesco pilot farms, providing trusted avenues was particularly 
challenging for very small operations. There were fewer possible intermediaries if a worker 
had a complaint against the manager himself. On one participant farm with fewer than 50 
permanent workers and no union, workers have now elected representatives to serve as 
communication channels for grievances. To help them in this role, they will receive special 
training on conflict resolution, on legal requirements regarding labour rights, and on basic 
organizational skills, such as how to run a meeting.  This is being funded by Tesco. 
</p>
<p>36. A particular challenge for EGV lies in the fact that it pays workers on a piece-rate 
system and therefore needs to avoid workers risking the loss of wages if they take time out 
to access the grievance mechanism or engage in dialogue with the management as part of 
the grievance handling process.  The management is aware of the issue and its importance 
in ensuring that workers are not deterred from accessing the mechanism.  
</p>
<p>37. One issue for a number of pilots was the distinction between grievance mechanisms 
for employees, contractors&#8217; workers and community members. Sakhalin Energy&#8217;s initial 
focus was on its community mechanism, which is also available to contractors&#8217; workers.  
Yet in the course of the pilot, the human resources department joined the project, 
recognizing the importance of ensuring the same quality of mechanism to all groups, even 
if the processes were different. For Tesco and its stakeholders, the focus was on the farm 
labour force. This raised two questions: first, it was much easier to ensure that permanent 
employees knew about a grievance mechanism and trusted it, than to provide the same for 
seasonal and migrant workers; second, some permanent employees live on the farms where 
they work, such that work issues and community issues often become entangled. There was 
discussion of how to handle community issues as well, particularly when they had 
implications for the workplace, but without crossing important boundaries. Initial 
discussions focused on the role that external mediators and training for all parties in conflict 
resolution could play in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
  
</b>There is a distinction between a mechanism being publicized and being known, albeit the 
former is necessary to the latter. Ensuring that publicity is targeted in part at those moments 
when grievances are most likely to arise helps ensure that the information gets to 
individuals when they are most likely to be looking for it.  
</p>
<p>The pilots confirmed the importance of hearing from a mechanism&#8217;s intended user groups 
about what kind of access points they are most likely to use, and recognizing that these may 
vary between indigenous and non-indigenous communities, men and women, permanent 
and migrant workers and so on. It can be important to look creatively at different access 
points, which need not be highly formal or onerous to be effective. 
</p>
<p><b>Revised principle  
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Accessible</b>: being known to all stakeholder groups for whose use they are intended, and 
providing adequate assistance for those who may face particular barriers to access. 
[Note: the commentary to this principle will retain the list of barriers previously included in 
the principle itself, to give clarity on the kind of barriers that require attention.] 
 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. Predictability 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle tested 
 
</b>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Predictable</b>: providing a clear and known procedure with a time frame for each stage and 
clarity on the types of process and outcome it can (and cannot) offer, as well as a means of 
monitoring the implementation of any outcome. 
 
</p>
<p>38. Providing predictable procedures for a grievance mechanism is easier in principle 
than in practice.  Vietnamese law provides for strict timelines for the handling of grievances 
and for their escalation through to the courts. However, it was only when EGV organized 
the data on how the company had actually performed against the timelines that it realized it 
had typically been missing the targets by quite a large margin. Once this was clear, steps to 
address the shortfall could be taken, and the performance in meeting deadlines improved 
dramatically. This also showed the importance of tracking the mechanism&#8217;s performance to 
enable continuous learning and improving.  
</p>
<p>39. Sakhalin Energy already had in place a sophisticated database for the handling of 
community grievances that created a certain automaticity in how they proceeded through 
the system. Once a grievance is registered, the department responsible for the subject of the 
complaint is identified and the name of an individual responsible for investigating it is 
entered. If he or she has not responded by the designated deadline, the system automatically 
sends a notification to the senior management. This creates interesting incentives for all 
departments not only to keep to the timelines, but also to understand that the handling of 
grievances is something that the management takes seriously. It avoids grievances being 
pigeon-holed as something that the external relations department has to resolve, and makes 
them the responsibility of the department whose activities allegedly lie at the source of the 
grievance. In this way, it mirrors the approach that leading companies apply to health and 
safety issues, such that avoiding and addressing grievances becomes everybody&#8217;s 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>40. A particular challenge for Cerrej&#243;n was to marry the requirements of an 
investigation with the cultural traditions of the Wayu&#8217;u indigenous communities in handling 
disputes. In Wayu&#8217;u traditions, an aggrieved party claims immediate compensation, 
traditionally in the form of goats, but increasingly often in cash. The matter is transacted 
through an intermediary, and once the compensation is agreed upon and delivered, the 
matter is considered to be resolved. This approach clashes with the assumption of the 
company and wider Colombian society that there should be independent investigations to 
look at the physical evidence and reach conclusions, which can take weeks to complete.  
The challenge for Cerrej&#243;n has been to find a balance between the two approaches, 
combining clear and reasonably limited time frames that allow for appropriate investigation 
with interim updates to aggrieved parties, in order to help reduce frustrations at perceived 
delays. 
</p>
<p>41. For a number of participant companies, the question arose as to when a grievance 
needs to be entered into a formal mechanism and when it can be handled informally and 
immediately. There can clearly be disadvantages to over-formalizing the resolution of 
simple issues, including unnecessary bureaucracy and delayed solutions. There can also be 
disadvantages to de-formalizing processes to the extent that there is no accountability for 
the appropriateness of solutions, and no ability to identify patterns of repeat complaints and 
address any systemic problems they reflect. 
</p>
<p>42. Sakhalin Energy&#8217;s human resources department had recently moved to a more 
informal process to address concerns through dialogue before employees decided whether </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>they wanted to file a formal grievance. Discussions revolved around whether they could 
retain this flexibility &#8211; and the benefits of better solutions that it seemed to be delivering for 
everyone &#8211; while still keeping track of any patterns or trends in the issues being raised.  
Ultimately, the department decided to start tracking potential grievances, defined as those 
cases where employees reached out to the human resources department for support but 
without logging a formal grievance. Doing so highlighted that the volume of such cases was 
higher than expected. By analysing patterns in the issues raised, the department has been 
able to put some new preventative measures in place. 
</p>
<p>43. With a number of companies, there were discussions about the importance of good 
communications between those dealing with day-to-day minor complaints &#8211; be it line 
managers or community liaison officers. This could help ensure that the lessons to be drawn 
from the small issues were not lost.  Managers at EGV acknowledged that apparently &#8220;non-
serious&#8221; complaints could actually be indicative of widespread or serious issues, and that 
ways were needed to capture them as well. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
</b></p>
<p>There are challenges to achieving the right balance between formalization and flexibility in 
a grievance mechanism. Feedback from the groups using the mechanism will likely be 
important in testing whether the right balance is being struck. Having time frames and 
adhering to them can be extremely important in building trust that a mechanism will 
deliver. Where more time is needed than the time frame provides, the key is to 
communicate this and give as much explanation as possible. When complaints disappear 
into a black hole, frustrations and grievances can increase, regardless of how rigorous the 
investigations going on behind the scenes may be. (This relates also to the principle on 
transparency.) 
</p>
<p>The revised principle reflects that timeframes are indicative rather than absolute. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Revised principle  
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Predictable</b>: providing a clear and known procedure with an indicative time frame for each 
stage, and clarity on the types of process and outcome available and means of monitoring 
implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Equitability 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle tested 
 
</b>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Equitable</b>: ensuring that aggrieved parties have reasonable access to sources of 
information, advice and expertise necessary to engage in a grievance process on fair and 
equitable terms. 
 
</p>
<p>44. Initially, for most pilot companies, the idea of ensuring access to sources of 
information, advice and expertise for complainants was a challenge conceptually, and 
therefore difficult to justify internally as a financial proposition. However, affected 
stakeholders are often at a considerable disadvantage dealing with a company in terms of 
the expertise they have available to them on issues, such as their rights, scientific data, and 
other relevant information. If individuals accept the outcome of a grievance process 
because they are ignorant of key information, that outcome is unlikely to be sustainable and 
may lead to even greater grievances and protest in the future. At the same time, the 
proposition is not that the company must itself fund extensive advisory services; indeed, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>those services may be seen as compromised if it were to do so in situations where 
relationships are somewhat distrustful. The ideal is that the providers of advice, training or 
expertise to affected stakeholders should be respected and trusted by the company as well 
as by the beneficiaries.  
</p>
<p>45. For Sakhalin Energy, the strength and credibility of the regional Labour Department 
meant that it could be a legitimate source of advice to employees or contractors&#8217; workers on 
their labour rights. The Tesco pilot conducted a needs analysis which identified key areas 
where training would be necessary, including on the respective rights and obligations of 
workers and managers, the grievance mechanism itself, disciplinary procedures and conflict 
management. Conflict management training was provided to workers and managers, and it 
received universally positive feedback and calls for others to have the same opportunity. In 
the case of Cerrej&#243;n, the company is exploring the possibility of funding independent, 
expert support to complainants if issues cannot be readily resolved.  
</p>
<p>46. With EGV, there were discussions of the role that the (State-sanctioned) trade union 
should be able to play in ensuring that workers know about their rights, and of the 
challenges posed by the lack of credible external actors that can do the same, in part due to 
the weakness of civil society. The ongoing work of Better Work Vietnam (an initiative of 
the International Labour Organization and the International Finance Corporation to improve 
compliance with labour standards in Viet Nam&#8217;s garment sector) will hopefully enable 
progress in this regard, as it builds the capacity of representation through specially created 
Performance Improvement Consultative Committees.  
</p>
<p>47. Meanwhile, in the HP project, it was apparent that while labour rights training for 
workers by independent NGOs could be one legitimate approach, it required an 
understanding of whether the training would be repeated and sustained among the 
workforce. With a worker turnover percentage frequently in double digits, the benefits of 
one-off training on rights can be quickly reduced or even lost. The review team in that 
project has suggested that written information for workers on their rights or &#8220;train the 
trainers&#8221; approaches that leave training capacity within the factory could be useful 
additional or alternative approaches.  
</p>
<p>48. Feedback from some of the stakeholder groups for which the pilot mechanisms were 
intended reflected the importance of being treated with respect in the process of addressing 
grievances. This was distinct from the question of specific outcomes. A number of the 
mechanisms have practices in place, or plan to do so, to seek views from those who use the 
mechanisms on their experience of the process as well as the results. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
  
</b>This can be one of the most challenging principles for companies, particularly where they 
have to make an internal case for the allocation of resources to support assistance to 
complainants. To many within a company, this seems counterintuitive; however, experience 
suggests that it can be fundamentally important in achieving sustainable solutions to 
problems. It helps ensure that the company has informed counterparts with which to engage 
and prevents a situation where a complainant may later believe he or she has been duped 
into agreeing to an inadequate outcome, thereby renewing and even escalating the 
grievance.  
</p>
<p>The providers of this external assistance may include NGOs, academic institutions or state 
or statutory agencies, and funding from companies themselves may or may not be 
necessary. It is ideal when the sources of advice and expertise to affected stakeholders are 
not only trusted by those stakeholders but also respected by the company. Where this is 
achieved, the benefits can be striking.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>The revised principle reflects the reality that it is not always in the gift of the company to 
ensure absolutely that aggrieved parties have reasonable access to this kind of resource. 
However, companies should recognize that fair, informed and respectful conversations can 
only be had where such access is available, and should therefore seek to ensure this as far 
as they reasonably can.  
</p>
<p><b>Revised principle  
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Equitable</b>: seeking to ensure that aggrieved parties have reasonable access to sources of 
information, advice and expertise necessary to engage in a grievance process on fair, 
informed and respectful terms. 
 
</p>
<p><b> E. Rights-compatibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle tested  
 
</b>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Rights-compatible</b>: ensuring that its outcomes and remedies accord with internationally 
recognized human rights standards. 
 
</p>
<p>49. As noted in section II, box B above, it was not possible within the constraints of this 
pilot to assess whether the outcomes of individual grievance-handling processes were 
compatible with human rights standards. This reflected both the fact that most companies 
were only reaching the implementation stage at the end of the pilot period, and the reality 
that making the project team privy to individual grievances, grievance processes and 
outcomes would have required a different type of engagement.  
</p>
<p>50. That said, a great deal of the work through the pilot projects was aimed at putting the 
necessary procedural provisions in place to enable and ensure rights-compatible outcomes 
to individual grievances. These included extensive discussions about how to engage 
affected stakeholder groups in providing input into the design or revision of the grievance 
mechanisms and feedback on their performance; how to ensure the mechanisms&#8217; 
accessibility to all affected stakeholder groups, including those that might otherwise be 
culturally marginalized or excluded; and how to enable aggrieved parties to engage on an 
equitable basis in the mechanisms, including provisions for the confidentiality of 
complainants where requested.  
</p>
<p>51. At Cerrej&#243;n, prior to the pilot project, grievances were being received by a relatively 
new human rights office. As it became increasingly well known outside the company, the 
office soon became a conduit for many complaints, including those that did not raise human 
rights issues. The effect within the company was that many departments became anxious, 
since any complaint handled under the rubric of human rights implied serious 
consequences.  
</p>
<p>52. In order to enable departments across the company to recognize the value of the new 
grievance mechanism developed through this pilot, and to engage with it constructively, it 
was important initially to separate it from purely human rights issues. The new mechanism 
comes under the Social Standards and International Engagement Department. While issues 
that come to it may indeed reflect human rights concerns, they do not necessarily do so and, 
in fact, can capture any manner of complaint. Indeed, the mechanism aims ideally to 
identify problems before they arise to the level of human rights impacts. Confidence-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>building within the company, in the interim, has enabled the team handling grievances to 
work better with other departments in getting grievances addressed, whatever the issues are. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
  
</b>This principle remains pivotal to the effectiveness of these grievance mechanisms.  In 
practice, many of the issues raised through the mechanisms are not presented in terms of 
human rights and do not represent allegations of human rights abuse. However, it is by 
addressing them seriously, and in line with all the other principles, that a company can help 
ensure that they are sustainably resolved and do not escalate, leading potentially to serious 
human rights impacts.  
</p>
<p>The principle is unchanged.  
</p>
<p><b>Revised principle  
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Rights-compatible</b>: ensuring that outcomes and remedies accord with internationally 
recognized human rights. 
 
</p>
<p><b> F. Transparency 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle tested  
 
</b>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Transparent</b>: providing sufficient transparency of process and outcome to meet the public 
interest concerns at stake and presuming transparency wherever possible; non-State 
mechanisms in particular should be transparent about the receipt of complaints and the key 
elements of their outcomes. 
 
</p>
<p>53. A number of questions arose among participant companies as to how this principle 
was different from the predictability principle. The focus of predictability is on general 
knowledge of how the mechanism will work, should one choose to use it. In the case of 
transparency, there are two issues in play: first, the provision of information to aggrieved 
parties about how their complaint is being handled; and second, the provision of 
information to affected stakeholder groups more widely, and sometimes to other 
stakeholders, about how well the mechanism is working.  
</p>
<p>54. At the same time, the provision of confidentiality can be essential to protect an 
individual from retaliation. It is also important in enabling dialogue between the company 
and complainants in an atmosphere of sufficient mutual confidence for real interests to be 
raised and options for solutions discussed. It can also be inappropriate to provide 
transparency about the specific detail of some outcomes; for instance, where doing so can 
lead to the identification of complainants who wish to remain anonymous, or when 
revealing levels of financial compensation would compromise individuals and legitimate 
processes. 
</p>
<p>55. The primary issue here is transparency to the aggrieved individual. Cerrej&#243;n&#8217;s 
mechanism provides for meetings with a complainant to explain investigation processes, it 
involves complainants in the investigation, and it provides for meetings to discuss proposed 
solutions and seek agreement. Sakhalin Energy&#8217;s mechanism provides for similar </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>processes, with grievance officers and community liaison officers engaging directly and 
often extensively with complainants over time.   
</p>
<p>56. EGV recognizes the importance for its mechanism of transparency about outcomes 
to the wider workforce, as a means to building trust that the mechanism is effective and that 
workers should use it if they have a concern. The company posts information about actions 
taken in response to grievances on notice boards in and around the factory. In the Tesco 
pilot, the template for the farm-level grievance mechanisms, as agreed by the Oversight 
Stakeholder Body, states that complainants should be allowed confidentiality if they request 
it, but that everyone should be able to see that the mechanism is working. While the detail 
of how this works at the farm level will only be worked out in the implementation phase, 
the balance aimed for is promising.  
</p>
<p>57. Some issues clearly go beyond the concern of a particular complainant or group of 
complainants. For Cerrej&#243;n, one example is the issue of goats being killed by trains on their 
railroad. Having moved away from a policy of compensation some years ago, when goats 
were found tied to the railroad tracks on a number of occasions, the company has responded 
to a pattern of more recent complaints by identifying the need for a more systemic and 
sustainable policy.  The new policy is still being developed with a view to ensuring it is 
culturally appropriate and may include in-kind compensation. It will be combined with 
dialogue with communities on how they will seek to avoid goats getting onto the railroad 
tracks (and provide incentives for doing so). A couple of specific complaints on this issue 
have therefore provided the impulse for identifying an outcome that could be acceptable not 
just to the complainants, but to communities in general, and which will therefore be widely 
publicized.  
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
  
</b>The first priority must be transparency to the aggrieved individual or group about how the 
complaint is being handled as well as any proposed solutions. Beyond this, the wise 
company will recognize that the more information it can provide about outcomes &#8211; even if 
anonymized and generalized &#8211; the more it can demonstrate that the mechanism is working, 
effective and can be trusted. While legitimate considerations may limit the provision of 
transparency in some cases, where public interests are at stake it is particularly important 
that outcomes be made public in an appropriate form. 
</p>
<p><b>Revised principle  
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Transparent</b>: keeping parties to a grievance informed about its progress, and providing 
sufficient information about the mechanism&#8217;s performance to build confidence in its 
effectiveness and meet any public interest at stake. 
 
</p>
<p><b> G. Dialogue and engagement 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle tested 
 
</b>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Based on dialogue and engagement</b>: focusing on processes of direct and/or mediated 
dialogue to seek agreed solutions, and leaving adjudication to independent third-party 
mechanisms, whether judicial or non-judicial. 
 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>58. It is natural and right that, as part of a grievance mechanism&#8217;s process, the company 
should conduct investigations into complaints it receives and arrive at its own view of what 
should be done. However, this principle requires that the company distinguish between 
proposing a solution to a grievance and decreeing unilaterally that this must be the 
outcome. While in some cases such unilateral decisions might be accepted or even 
welcomed by a complainant, where this is not the case, the perception that the company is 
acting as both &#8220;accused&#8221; and &#8220;judge&#8221; compromises trust in the specific grievance handling 
process and potentially in the mechanism as a whole.  
</p>
<p>59. Where a company conducts its own investigation, its results should be discussed 
with the complainant. Where a complainant disagrees with the investigation results or a 
proposed outcome to a complaint, there should be room for dialogue in an effort to reach 
agreement, including, where appropriate, through facilitated discussions (such as 
mediation). And if no agreed outcome can be reached between the company and 
complainant, it should be clear where either or both parties can turn for further recourse, 
including any community-based conflict resolution mechanisms or non-judicial 
mechanisms, as well as adjudication through relevant courts or tribunals.  
</p>
<p>60. All of the pilot project mechanisms provide for dialogue with complainants as part 
of the process, albeit some more so than others. In the case of the HP suppliers in the 
adjunct project, the fact that the counselor, in one case, and the worker-run hotline, in the 
other, are the main points of access to the two mechanisms appears to have helped make 
dialogue and engagement the default approach to addressing complaints.  
</p>
<p>61. Some of the pilot mechanisms provide a means to check whether there is a shared 
understanding with complainants on what has been discussed or agreed. Sakhalin Energy 
provides for complainants to fill in a form either confirming that certain outcomes have 
been agreed or noting their concerns. Cerrej&#243;n provides a record of conversations for 
complainants to sign if the complainants agree that the records are accurate. 
</p>
<p>62. There were various discussions in the course of the pilots about providing clarity on 
what the appropriate points of recourse would be if the grievance mechanisms did not lead 
to agreed solutions and a complainant wished to take the matter further.  
</p>
<p>63. For EGV, Vietnamese law provides for the escalation of unresolved grievances from 
the factory level through the provincial trade union to the Labour Conciliation Council to 
the Courts. At Sakhalin Energy, the judicial system was seen as the next point of recourse, 
although the mechanism provided for mediation where the company considered there to be 
legitimate grounds for a lawsuit. There were discussions about widening the availability of 
mediation, given that it could help address real grievances or conflicts that may not be 
grounds for a lawsuit and that it did not bind parties unless they reached agreement.  
</p>
<p>64. For the Tesco pilots, the ultimate recourse under the law is to the Commission for 
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration of South Africa (CCMA). However, the Oversight 
Stakeholder Body&#8217;s members all agreed that it would be preferable to have an interim point 
of recourse before going to the CCMA. They are exploring the possibility of having 
recourse to mediation through the Africa Centre for Dispute Settlement at the University of 
Stellenbosch as a first default before the CCMA. 
</p>
<p>65. The foregoing discussion focuses on dialogue in the process of handling individual 
grievances. The pilot projects individually and collectively underlined the equal importance 
of engagement with affected stakeholder groups in the design or review of grievance 
mechanisms. As the comments under other principles indicate, this is essential in order to 
know how these groups would wish to register their grievances; what modes of handling 
grievances they consider culturally appropriate; whether they trust a mechanism enough to 
use it and what would make them do so; what levels of knowledge and understanding of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>their rights and other relevant issues they have; and what kinds of support they may need to 
engage in the mechanism on a fair basis.  
</p>
<p>66. The remarks on other principles in this report and in the reports on the individual 
pilots also indicate the various ways in which the pilot projects sought this kind of 
engagement with stakeholders.  It was not always easy, and those leading the engagement 
often had to work to win the support of others within the company to whom the benefits 
were less apparent.  
</p>
<p>67. There was considerable discussion during the development of the Tesco pilot as to 
whether, and to what extent, it is necessary to have good stakeholder engagement before a 
grievance mechanism can be built and succeed. In practice, the company&#8217;s engagement 
with local stakeholders &#8211; suppliers, unions and NGOs &#8211; through the Oversight Stakeholder 
Body became a first and important means of building relations.  Even though the 
discussions in the pilot had to focus on the grievance mechanism itself, it became an entry 
point for dialogue with regional stakeholders that may hold wider potential.  
</p>
<p>68. At Cerrej&#243;n as well, the grievance mechanism promised to be the first systematized 
means for the company to engage with local communities. The risk in this case was that it 
might end up being the primary means of engagement; the company&#8217;s wider consultations 
with communities had previously been limited to particular problems, though its 
engagement with international stakeholders had been considerable. The company&#8217;s 
welcome decision to undertake systematized engagement with all communities is therefore 
significant. It should help, over time, to ensure that a balance is struck between general 
engagement on the one hand and the handling of specific grievances on the other, avoiding 
too great a burden being placed on the grievance mechanism alone. 
</p>
<p>69. Sakhalin Energy already had processes in place to get feedback from those who had 
used the community grievance mechanism about its performance. Discussions focused on 
the question of whether those who were not using the mechanism would have a different 
perspective. A survey of indigenous peoples showed that they did, in fact, have a less 
positive view, and the company was able to start addressing that issue.   
</p>
<p>70. For EGV, involving workers&#8217; perspectives in the review and redesign of the 
grievance mechanism was a particular challenge since the State-recognized union 
representative is herself part of management. EGV also conducts exit interviews with 
workers leaving the factory. The challenge is that the incentive for such workers to be open 
about their reasons for leaving is often limited. EGV has therefore looked for other ways to 
get additional feedback. For instance, Esquel Group was able to benefit from its 
membership in the Fair Labor Association (FLA), and the FLA&#8217;s employment of a Viet 
Nam representative around the start of the pilot, in order to use its independent processes 
for surveying workers&#8217; perceptions of the existing grievance mechanism. EGV plans to 
conduct periodic surveys in future to test workers&#8217; perceptions over time. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
  
</b>The pilots reinforce the importance of operational-level mechanisms focusing on dialogue 
in the search for solutions to grievances and avoiding the fact or appearance of unilateral 
decisions by the company itself. The crucial distinction for a company is between the 
legitimate process of arriving at an informed view of what it considers the optimal response 
or solution to a grievance, and taking the position that that will and must be the end of the 
matter.  
</p>
<p>The pilots also underlined that this principle should be widened to reflect the parallel 
importance of engaging stakeholder groups in the design or review of the grievance 
mechanism.  While some aspects of design will rightly be internal to the company (such as 
the allocation of staff responsibilities or the management of complaints logs), stakeholder </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>perspectives are important to its public-facing aspects, such as the choice of access points, 
modes of dispute resolution and transparency provisions. Where initial trust levels are low, 
this involvement of affected stakeholders will likely have a particular influence over 
whether they trust the mechanism enough to use it, and therefore whether it achieves 
legitimacy in their eyes.  
</p>
<p><b>Revised principle 
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>Based on dialogue and engagement</b>: consulting the stakeholder groups for whose use they 
are intended on their design and performance, and focusing on dialogue as the means to 
address and resolve grievances. 
[Note: the commentary to this principle retains the specific point that where adjudication is 
needed, it should be provided by a legitimate, independent third-party mechanism.] 
 
</p>
<p><b> H. Continuous learning 
</b></p>
<p>71. Although the Special Representative&#8217;s principles did not mention continuous 
learning, the CSR Initiative&#8217;s guidance tool specific to the operational-level grievance 
mechanism included a principle on this issue. It was therefore part of the discussions with 
participant companies.  
</p>
<p>72. Discussions under previous principles have reflected learning about the importance 
of getting feedback from affected stakeholder groups on a mechanism&#8217;s performance.  
Other measures of performance were also significant. For EGV, it was only in assessing 
systematically whether the company was meeting the timeframes for addressing grievances 
that it realised how far these were being missed. EGV were then able to address the 
problems and improve performance.  
</p>
<p>73. For Sakhalin Energy, the dramatic drop-off in registered community grievances 
seemed to be readily explained by the shift from the construction phase of the project to the 
operational phase. That said, the evidence was lacking to support this interpretation of the 
numbers. Once more research was done as part of the pilot project, it appeared that indeed 
this shift was a major reason for the drop-off, but also that indigenous peoples were not 
aware of or choosing to use the mechanism for their grievances. The company was then 
able to address that specific problem and work with indigenous community representatives 
to design a related but separate mechanism that the community felt was appropriate to its 
needs.  
</p>
<p>74. For the Tesco pilots, the lengthy time needed for the design phase, given that it was 
a greenfield mechanism, meant that implementation was only about to begin as the pilots 
ended. The metrics for success of the mechanisms may vary depending on whether it is the 
perspective of the farm management and workers or the perspective of Tesco. If the 
mechanisms are successful for the former, then they undoubtedly represent an asset to 
Tesco as well. But the pilots represent only three farms in a region where Tesco sources 
from 600.  For Tesco, the metrics of success will include the extent to which other farms 
see the advantage of adopting similar mechanisms. This will be key to making the model 
scalable more widely in order to cover more workers in Tesco&#8217;s supply chain. While there 
were some discussions during the pilot about the challenges and opportunities for scaling 
this kind of grievance mechanism, further experience and exploration is required to test 
these out.  
</p>
<p>75. The review team looking at the grievance mechanisms at the two HP suppliers noted 
the strong learning culture at one of them in particular. Managers ask departing employees 
to share ideas for how the factory might improve, and monthly lunch meetings with both </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>existing and outgoing employees are used for a similar purpose with regard to improving 
the grievance procedures. This was judged to be one significant factor in the relative 
sophistication of their grievance mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of learning 
</b> 
Some pilots had identified key performance indicators by the end of the pilot period, while 
others were in the process of doing so. Three key points emerged: 
</p>
<p>First, a reduction in the number of grievances was only meaningful if other indicators 
showed that this reduction was due to stakeholders having fewer grievances and not due to 
a lack of trust in, or access to, the mechanism. Indeed, an increase in registered grievances, 
at least initially, was seen as a positive sign that people trusted it and chose to use it over 
other means of expressing their concerns. 
</p>
<p>Second, it was clear that feedback from the intended user groups was extremely valuable in 
interpreting numerical indicators and needed to include both individuals who had used the 
mechanism and some who had not, including groups or populations who might feel 
excluded, such as indigenous peoples and women. Taken together, this feedback helped the 
companies understand how to meet the Special Representative&#8217;s principles in a manner 
tailored to their own operations and operating context.  
</p>
<p>Third, in a couple of instances, tracking the performance of the mechanism already brought 
to light certain learning that suggested a need to adjust wider company policies and 
procedures.  
</p>
<p>In light of this learning and its significance to the effectiveness of grievance mechanisms 
over time, the Special Representative has decided to add a new principle that is applicable 
both to operational-level and to other non-judicial grievance mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>New principle  
</b></p>
<p>An operational-level grievance mechanism should be: 
<b>A source of continuous learning</b>: drawing on relevant measures to identify lessons for 
improving the mechanism and preventing future grievances and harms. 
 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The range of sectors (oil and gas, mining, garment manufacturing, food, 
electronics), geographical and political contexts (Russian Federation, Colombia, Viet 
Nam, South Africa, China) and the scale of companies (major transnationals, factory 
with around 3,400 workers, supply farm with less than 50) in which these pilot 
projects took place was extremely valuable in ensuring that the Special 
Representative&#8217;s principles for non-judicial grievance mechanisms were well tested.  
Clearly, there are other contexts in which the principles could also usefully be tested, 
including pharmaceutical and ICT companies, and there are still lessons to be gained 
from how the mechanisms in this pilot work in practice in the months and years to 
come.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>However, the pilot projects have generated valuable learning. They repeatedly 
confirmed the value and importance of the overarching concepts represented in the 
principles themselves. They also added some clarifications and nuances to how those 
principles should be understood and applied in practice, regardless of the situation. 
Most of those points of learning are reflected in the revised one-sentence summaries 
that follow the principles, as set out at the end of each section above and summarized </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p><b>below. Where they are not, it is because they cannot reasonably be applied to all of the 
other kinds of non-judicial grievance mechanism to which these principles are 
designed to be applicable.  Additional points of learning that were relevant to the 
context of individual pilots but did not suggest any general amendments to the 
principles are reflected in the reports on the individual pilots.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Representative and the project team are indebted to the 
participant companies for their commitment to this project and to its twin objectives 
of helping them make their own grievance processes more effective and generating 
learning on how the Special Representative&#8217;s principles can be improved to reflect 
practical realities. This commitment was apparent throughout the pilot process from 
all those involved. The CEOs and/or senior management of each company were 
personally involved at key stages and lent their full support. This top-level 
commitment was of fundamental importance to the successes that were achieved. The 
individuals leading the collaboration on behalf of the companies contributed insight, 
energy and a readiness to think openly and creatively in meeting the challenges that 
arose and in capitalizing on the opportunities.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>All of the pilots demonstrated the considerable time and effort needed to reach 
out to external stakeholders in building an effective grievance mechanism. They also 
showed that significant outreach is needed within the company to ensure that those 
responsible for a whole range of relevant business functions understand and embrace 
the mechanism&#8217;s relevance and significance to their own work and to the company&#8217;s 
success over time. The support and engagement of senior management and relevant 
internal departments is crucial for a grievance mechanism to meet its objectives; so is 
the allocation of resources for its administration proportionate to the range and 
complexity of the stakeholder relationships involved and the type of issues with which 
the mechanism is likely to have to deal.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>For all of the participant companies, the pilot process was only the start of a 
longer process. The project team looks forward to seeing how their efforts, and those 
of their stakeholders in these projects, develop in the future. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Box C: Principles for effective grievance mechanisms, as revised 
following the pilot project
