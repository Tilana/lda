3. I  have been continuously  and  actively  engaged  in the assessment, development, and operation of mineral 
projects  since  my  graduation  from  university  in  2001.  During  my  professional  career  I  have  gained  a  wide 
range  of  experience  in  resource  estimation  techniques  including  at  least  5  years  actively  working  in 
metasomatic  sedimentary  type  deposits  which  have  similar  styles  of  mineralisation  to  the  Mineral  Resource.  
This  experience  includes  working  and  estimating  resources  both  in  underground  and  open  pit  operations  in 
Western  Australia,  including  the  Saint  Barbara  gold  operations  at  Southern  Cross  from  2001-2006,  the  gold 
Leonora operations in 2006 and the Jaguar mine (Pb-Zn-Ag) during his work with Jabiru mines in 2007.  During 
this time Jeremy completed internal estimations (not public release) which have similar style of mineralisation 
to the mineralisation within the Project. As a RungePincockMinarco employee since 2007 to the present, I have 
worked  on  numerous  epithermal  base  and  precious  metals  deposit  throughout  the  world  including  China, 
Central  Asia,  Europe,  Africa,  and  North  and  South  America.    This  work  has  included  resource  estimation  of 
deposits  which  have  similar  styles  of  mineralisation  to  the  Sawayaerdun  deposit.  All  of  these  deposits  were 
estimated  in  accordance  with  the  JORC  Code  (Australia,  Africa,  Europe  and  Asia)  or  the  NI-43.3-101 
Standards of Disclosures (Canada, and South America) and resulted in public releases or Technical Reports,

1  Executive Summary
1.1
Introduction
Runge  Asia  Limited  (“RAL”),  trading  as  RungePincockMinarco  (“RPM”),  was  requested  by  GobiMin  Inc. 
(“GobiMin”, the “Client”) and Xinjiang Tongyuan Minerals Limited (“Tongyuan” or the “Company”) to prepare a 
Mineral Resource Technical Report (the “Technical Report”) of the Sawayaerdun Gold Project (the “Project” or 
“Relevant  Asset”)  in  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region,  People‟s  Republic  of  China,  in  line  with  the 
requirements  of  the  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101  (“NI  43-101”)  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral 
Projects.  The  purpose  of  the  Technical  Report  is  for  filing  with  the  System  for  Electronic  Document  Analysis 
and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) operated by the Canadian Securities Administration.
The  Relevant  Asset  is  a  gold  (“Au”)  project  known  as  the  Sawayaerdun  Gold  Project  (the  “Project”).  The 
Project  is  located  in  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  of  the  People‟s  Republic  of  China,  and  is 
contained  within  one  Exploration  Licence  (see  Section  4)  and  one  Mining  Licence.  A  significant  number  of 
surface  trenches  and  diamond  drill  holes  as  well  as  numerous  underground  channel  samples  have  been 
undertaken on the Project since the early 1990‟s.
No mining has been undertaken on the Project to date. The exploration results of 2013 have further increased 
the  confidence  and  understanding  of  the  mineralisation  and  thus  provides  more  reliable  data  for  the  mining 
plan for the Project.
1.2  Scope and Terms of Reference
This  Technical  Report  includes  a  Mineral  Resource  estimate  as  defined  in  the  NI  43-101  Standards  of 
Disclosure  for  the  Project.  RPM‟s  technical  team  (“the  Team”)  consisted  of  Principal  Geologists  and  Senior 
Geologists. Geologists Mr. David Allmark and Mr. Andy Liu undertook a site visit to the Project for a period of 
four days beginning on the 10th of October 2013 to familiarise themselves with site conditions.  During the site 
visit,  RPM  had  open  discussions  with  the  Company  personnel  on  technical  aspects  relating  to  the  Project. 
RPM found the personnel to be cooperative and open in facilitating RPM‟s work.
In  addition  to  work  undertaken  to  generate  an  independent  estimate  of  Mineral  Resources,  this  Technical 
Report and the Statement of Mineral Resources contained within relies largely on information provided by the 
Company  or  the  Client,  either  directly  from  the  site  and  other  offices,  or  from  reports  by  other  organisations 
whose  work  is  the  property  of  the  Company  or  the  Client  and  RPM  has  found no reasons  not  to rely  on  this 
information.  The Report specifically excludes all aspects of legal issues, marketing, commercial and financing 
matters, insurance, land titles and usage agreements, and any other agreements/contracts that the Company 
may have entered into.
RPM does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of information provided by the Company, which has been 
used in the preparation of this Technical Report.
In RPM‟s opinion, the information provided by the Company was reasonable and nothing discovered during the 
preparation of the Report suggested that there was any significant error or misrepresentation in respect of that 
information and hence RPM has found no reason not to rely on this information.
RPM  has  independently  assessed  the  Relevant  Asset  by  reviewing  historical  technical  reports,  drill  hole 
databases, original sampling data, sampling methodology and metallurgical test work. All of this data supports 
the Mineral Resource estimate.  All opinions, findings and conclusions expressed in the  Technical Report are 
those of RPM and its specialist advisors.

1.3  Statement of Mineral Resources
RPM  has  independently  estimated  the  Mineral  Resources  contained  within  the  Project,  based  on  the  data 
collected  by  the  Company  as  at  31st  January,  2014.    The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  and  underlying  data 
complies  with  the  guidelines  provided  in  the  NI  43-101,  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects,  dated 
June  30th,  2011.  Therefore  RPM  believes  it  is  suitable  for  public  reporting.    The  Mineral  Resources  were 
completed by or under the supervision of Mr. Jeremy Clark of RPM and are reported at a 1 g/t Au grade cut-off.  
The results of the resource estimate for the Project are tabulated in Table 1-1.

RPM notes that the cut-off grade applied to report the Mineral Resources is based on the currently  available 
information and is for a given point in time (January, 2014) and the likely mining method which is expected to 
be a typical Chinese style underground mining method.  RPM considers that the completion of mining studies 
to support  the assumed costs and mining factors will  greatly  increase the understanding of the potential cost 
profiles of any operation which will impact the cut-off grade applied to report the Mineral Resources.
1.4  Project Summary
  The  Project  is  located  in  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  of  the  People‟s  Republic  of  China, 
immediately  adjacent  to  the  international  border  with  Kyrgyzstan.  Urumqi,  the  capital  of  Xinjiang  is 
approximately 1,000 km northeast of the property with the nearest major centre being the city of Kashi 
located 200 km southeast.  The Project is accessed by a series of regional tarred roads and highways 
to major city centres.  The major city centre connects to Urumqi via daily commercial flights.
  The Sawayaerdun Gold Project has a relatively short exploration history however mineralisation in the 
region was first identified in the 1950‟s.  Regional exploration in the Sawayaerdun area was completed 
in  1952  and  1953;  however  no  additional  work  was  completed  until  the  early  1980s.    This  work 
included  a  stream  geochemical  survey  which  led  to  the  discovery  of  the  deposit  in  1985.    A 
breakthrough  was  made  in  1993  when  the  No.2  Geological  Brigade  of  the  Xinjiang  Geological  and 
Mineral Bureau Team No.4 identified the main mineralisation zone which forms the western portion of 
the  current  Mineral  Resource.  Subsequent  to  this,  four  generations  of  exploration  works  have  been 
undertaken along with exploration adits.
  Four  phases  of  exploration  work  occurred  between  1994  and  2013.    During  „Phase  1‟,  8  surface 
diamond drill holes for a total of 2,866.69 m, and 84 surface trenches, for a total of 5,070 samples were 
completed in 2000. Between 2000 and  2010  „Phase  2„,  a further  60 surface diamond drill holes for a 
total of 10,590.58 m were completed.  These drill holes were generally designed to define the extents 
of  the  mineralisation  along  strike  from  the  Phase  1  drilling.  Between  2010  and  2012,  „Phase  3‟,  the 
Company  completed  an  additional  194  surface  drill  holes  for  a  total  of  69,398.19  m.    These  holes 
included both infill drilling and extension holes along strike and down dip.  Following a review of these 
holes  the Company  completed  an  additional  13  infill  drill  holes  in  2013  „Phase  4‟.    These 13 surface 
diamond  holes  resulted  in  a  total  of  8,637.89  m  being  drilled  and  were  aimed  at  defining  down  dip 
continuity of the main zone and defining the controls on mineralisation.
  The Sawayaerdun Gold Project is located in the eastern Kokshaal region of the Tian Shan Mountains. 
The oldest unit exposed on the property is the Silurian-age Taertekuli Formation which is comprised of 
sericite phyllite, sandstone, siliceous mudstone, carbonaceous siliceous phyllite, slate and calcareous

breccia.  The  unit  is  thought  to  be  of  turbiditic  origin.  The  Taertekuli  Formation  is  overlain  by  the 
Devonian-age  Sawayaerdun  Formation  and  is  subdivided  into  lower  and  upper  units,  both  turbiditic, 
and  comprised  of  thin  laminae  of  phyllite  and  siltstone.  The  phyllites  in  the  upper  member  are 
carbonaceous.    The  Lower  Carboniferous  Bashisuogong  Formation  which  includes  clastic  units  and 
limestone overlies the Sawayaerdun Formation.  Each of the units on the Sawayaerdun Property strike 
northeast  and  most  dips  are  to  the  northwest.  Schistosity  is  developed  parallel  to  bedding.  The 
contacts between the various units are structural.  The project geology is depicted in  Figure  7-2. The 
structural  nature  of  the  contact  between  the  upper  Sawayaerdun  Formation  and  the  overlying 
Taertekuli  Formation  can  be  seen  clearly  from  the  discordance  of  folded  beds  in  the  Sawayaerdun 
Formation against the Taertekuli Formation along the line of mineralisation.
  Mineralisation is separated into two main areas, a western zone and an eastern zone, known as “Zone 
IV”  and  “Zone  I”  respectively,  which  form  two  distinct  mineralised  zones.  Both  areas  contain  multiple 
veins or mineralised bodies which have strike and dip extensions however all strike NE-SW, crosscut 
the stratigraphy at a low angle and generally dip steeply (60° to 80°) to the northwest.  The bulk of the 
currently  defined  mineralisation  is  contained  within  two  very  continuous  mineralised  bodies,  one  in 
Zone IV and one in Zone I.  The body within Zone IV has a continuous strike extent of over 3 km and 
down dip continuity of up to 650 m from surface. The body is open at depth, has widths ranging from a 
few  metres  to up  to 50  m  in part, and  contains  approximately  65%  of  the  currently  defined resource.  
The  body  within  Zone  I  has  a  strike  of  up  1.2  km  and  a  dip  extent  of  300  m.  The  remainder  of  the 
resources are contained within smaller, discontinuous parallel lenses in the hanging wall of the deposit.
  The  hanging  wall  rocks  of  the  mineralisation  are  predominately  sandstone  with  some  interbeds  of 
shale  however  the  foot  wall  is  more  variable,  with  sandstone  occurring  with  significant  amounts  of 
interbedded  siltstone.    Gold  mineralisation  occurs  within  the  crystal  lattices  of  the  sulphides  such  as 
pyrite; however native gold is also known to occur.  Pyrite is the main alteration mineral recognized in 
the wall rocks, however sericite and other muscovite minerals have been identified.
  The  geometry  of  the  mineralisation  is  typical  of  fault  controlled  mineralisation  where  the  faults  have 
been subjected to strike and dip movement which has opened dilational jogs at locations where there 
are  local  changes  of  fault  strike or  dip. The  sigmoidal  envelopes  of  mineralisation  as  seen in section 
are  characteristic  of  these  types  of  dilational  environments.  The  movement  along  the  structure  has 
created the permeability for mineralising solution ingress and the space for deposit formation.
  RPM reviewed documentation for the sampling procedures, preparation, analysis, and security during 
their  site  visit  in October,  2013.    From  the  review  of  the  literature  and  documentation on  the  Project, 
RPM finds acceptable results from analytical work completed by previous operators who collected their 
samples according to standards and accepted practices at the time of the campaigns.  Data has been 
reviewed  by  RPM  by  visiting  a  number  of  sampled  locations  in  the  field  and  evaluating  the  reported 
results against the mineralised rock observed in the field.
  The  results  of  the  data  verification  and  data  quality  review  indicate  that  the  digital  database  used  as 
the  basis  for  the  Statement  of  Mineral  Resources  is  supported  by  verified certified  assay  certificates, 
original  drill  logs,  QAQC,  independent  external  assays  and  verified  survey  data.    As  such,  RPM 
believes there is sufficient data to enable the use of this data (except that which was excluded denoted 
in Section 12.1) in a Mineral Resource estimate and resultant classification following that set by the NI 
43-101 Standards.
1.5  Recommendations
The  recommendations  are  based  on  observations  made  by  RPM  during  the  completion  of  this  Technical 
Report and review of the associated documentation.  These include:
  Prior  to any  further  exploration  works  being  undertaken,  RPM recommends  that  a conceptual  mining 
study  be  undertaken  to  determine  the  economic  potential  of  the  Project  within  the  currently  defined 
resource with particular focus on the mining methods employed.  This conceptual study will enable an 
analysis  of  the  likely  areas  of  economic  profit  of  the  Project  as  well  as  identify  the  potential  area  of 
interest that should be drilled.  Importantly a conceptual study will highlight the areas of highest priority 
for further exploration, whether that be infill drilling or extensional drilling and in addition determine the 
likely mining method which could be successfully employed within the Project.  RPM notes that given

mineralisation  occurs  at surface there is  the  potential  that  open  cut mining  methods  could be utilised 
prior to an underground method being employed.   RPM estimates this study would cost approximately 
USD 100K.
  Limited  bulk  density  values  have  been  undertaken  for  the  project.    RPM  recommends  all  future 
exploration work include a systematic bulk density determination.  In addition RPM recommends that 
bulk density be undertaken on the remaining core material from the 2012 and 2013 drilling to enhance 
the  accuracy  of  the  tonnage  estimates  on  a  local  scale.    RPM  considers  the  cost  will  likely  be 
approximately USD 10K to complete an additional 500 determinations.
  RPM  considers  that  the  QA/QC  data  indicates  that  the  primary  laboratory  during  the  2012  and  2013 
drilling programs showed no evidence of systematic bias and the samples taken from these programs 
are  representative.    While  RPM  considers  the  drilling  results  suitable  for  inclusion  in  a  Mineral 
Resource estimate  for  the classification  applied,  it  recommends  that  further  studies  be  undertaken  to 
ensure the reasonably high nugget does not result in any material bias during the sample preparation.  
Of particular note is ensuring that crushing and grinding sizes are suitable for liberating the gold whilst 
no accumulations are occurring which may result in potential bias.  This type of analysis is commonly 
undertaken with gold projects with high nugget to customize the sample preparation techniques. RPM 
envisages this program will likely cost approximately USD 25K.
  Subsequent to  the  successful  completion of  a conceptual  mining  study  RPM recommends  upgrading 
the existing Inferred mineral resources to Indicated category in areas identified as potentially economic. 
RPM  recommends  the  Client  conduct  infill  drilling  to  50  m  sample  spacing  to  further  constrain  and 
delineate the boundaries of the mineralised lenses. Infill drilling would reduce the inherent uncertainty 
associated  with the geological model, increasing the level  of confidence in the  data  and the resulting 
Mineral  Resource  estimate.    The  cost  associated  with  this  drilling  would  vary  depending  on  the 
outcome and requirements of the next stage of project development however RPM envisages that it is 
likely costs would range from USD 1 million to USD 2 million.

Introduction and Terms of Reference
2.1  Background
Runge  Asia  Limited  (“RAL”),  trading  as  RungePincockMinarco  (“RPM”),  was  requested  by  GobiMin  Inc. 
(“GobiMin”, the “Client”) and Xinjiang Tongyuan Minerals Limited (“Tongyuan” or the “Company”) to prepare a 
Mineral Resource Technical Report (the “Technical Report”) of the Sawayaerdun Gold Project (the “Project” or 
“Relevant  Asset”)  in  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region,  People‟s  Republic  of  China,  in  line  with  the 
requirements of the National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The 
purpose  of  the  Technical  Report  is  for  filing  with  the  System  for  Electronic  Document  Analysis  and  Retrieval 
(“SEDAR”) operated by the Canadian Securities Administration.
The  Relevant  Asset  is  a  gold  (“Au”)  project  known  as  the  Sawayaerdun  Gold  Project  (the  “Project”).  The 
Project  is  located  in  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  of  the  People‟s  Republic  of  China,  and  is 
contained  within  one  Exploration  Licence  (see  Section  4)  and  one  Mining  Licence.  A  significant  number  of 
surface  trenches  and  diamond  drill  holes  as  well  as  numerous  underground  channel  samples  have  been 
undertaken on the Project since the early 1990‟s.
No mining has been undertaken on the Project to date. The exploration results of 2013 have further increased 
the  confidence  and  understanding  of  the  mineralisation  and  thus  provides  more  reliable  data  for  the  mining 
plan for the Project.

4  Property Description and Location
The Project is a large, multiple vein style gold deposit and is considered to be an advanced exploration project. 
Although  no  commercial  mining  has  been  undertaken  within the  Project  to  date,  exploration  adits  have  been 
completed on a small scale. The Project has had numerous phases of exploration which included a significant 
number  of  surface  trenches,  surface  diamond  drilling  and  adit  development  with  the  support  of  geological 
mapping, geophysics and geochemistry.
4.1  Project Location
The  Sawayaerdun  Property  is  located  in  Wuqia  County,  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region,  People‟s 
Republic of China immediately adjacent to the international border with Kyrgyzstan. The geographical centre of 
the Project is located within the coordinates:
  Latitude - 40˚ 03‟ 30” to 40˚ 06‟ 45” East;
  Longitude - 74˚ 15‟ 45” to 74˚ 19‟ 45” North.
Urumqi,  the  capital  of  Xinjiang  is  approximately  1,000  km  northeast  of  the  property  with  the  nearest  major 
centre  being  the  city  of  Kashi  located  200  km  southeast.  This  is  illustrated  in  in  the  general  location  map  in 
Figure 4-1.
4.2  Property Ownership
RPM  has  not  conducted  land  status  evaluations,  although  has  sighted  the  copies  of  the  original  certificates 
regarding  property  status  and  legal  title for  the  Project.  RPM  has  not  completed  a legal  review  of  any  claims 
record or any agreement regarding mineral claims of the Project and the information here presented is based 
solely on information provided by the Client or the Company and is provided for reference only, and should not 
be relied upon.
The property is contained within a single mining licence that lies within a larger exploration licence as seen in 
Figure  4-2.    The  licences  and  permits  of  the  Project  are  currently  held  by  Tongyuan  which  is  70%  owned 
through a subsidiary of the Client.  Details of the mining and exploration licences are provided for reference in 
Table 4-1 through Table 4-4, while the licences are shown graphically in Figure 4-2 and Figure 10-1.

Pm‘eum ADVMKWM Detailed Location Plan


5  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
5.1  Project Access
The property is located in the southern portion of the Tian Shan Mountains and can be accessed through the 
provincial road S309 from Kashi via Wuqia County and Wuluqiaketi Village. A paved highway  connects Kashi 
to Wuluqiaketi while the remaining 38 km to the property is via a mountainous unpaved road.
5.2  Geography and Climate
Being located in a mountainous region the properties‟ geography is dominated by deep valleys and moderate 
to steep topography. Elevation ranges between 3,100 m up to 4,318 m above sea level with a general trend of 
the area that increases from north to south.
5.2.1  River System
The  Sawayaerdun  River  is  the  major  river  in  the  region  and  the  largest  catchment  area  flowing  through  the 
project  area.  Numerous  streams  such  as  Xiaoerbulake,  Qiakashi,  Yuqikanpen  and  Nazhaerjiayiluo  feed  into 
the Sawayaerdun river system which then flows from north to south into the Kezilesu River. River water comes 
from precipitation, springs and melting snow during the summer months, however the river flows all year round 
with  overflowing  occurring  around  September  to  October  and  the  dry  season  occurring  around  November  till 
March.  In  2010,  river  flow  rates  were  measured  showing  12.1cu.m/s  during  overflowing  and  0.0272  cu.m/s 
during the dry season.
5.2.2  Climate
The climate is characterised by long winters and short summers with rainfall  generally occurring between May 
and July. The annual temperature averages around 6 ˚C  with reported temperatures ranging between  -39  ˚C 
and  30  ˚C.  A  snow  pack  of  0.5  to  1.0  m  generally  occurs  between the  months  of  October  to  April  each  year 
which curtails all exploration activities.
5.2.3  Earthquakes
The Project is located within an active earthquake zone. Over the last 100 years, more than 100 earthquakes 
measuring  above  4.7  magnitude  and  10  measured  above  6  magnitude  on  the  Richter  scale  have  been 
recorded.  Therefore future mining design and construction should take into account the frequent earthquakes 
experienced in order to ensure mine safety and operation.
5.3
Local Resources and Infrastructure
5.3.1  Economy
Wuqia  is  a  developing  county  in  the  western  region  of  southern  Xinjiang.  The  county  has  a  population  of 
around 51,000 consisting of people mainly from the Kyrgyz minority and smaller number from the Uygur, Hui 
and Han groups. Agriculture is the main industry with residents owning livestock and farming small amounts of 
barley and vegetables. Grain and other vegetables are supplied from Atushi and Kashi.
Wuqia  County  is  rich  in  mineral  resources  and  mining  prospects  with  24  economic  mineral  types  being 
identified with  coal,  iron,  gold,  limestone, gypsum,  pyrite,  lead,  zinc  and copper  being  the  main commodities. 
Since the Chinese economic reforms, mining development has been continuous, becoming a major industry in 
Wuqia County and as a result improved the living standards for residents around the area.

ADV-HK-03752_GobiMin_Sawayaerdun_Gold_Project Technical_Report_FINAL.docx
5.4
Infrastructure
There are currently no mining operations being undertaken on the Project as the infrastructure for the Project is 
limited.  An  exploration  camp  and  permanent  buildings  have  been  constructed  that  are  appropriate  for  the 
present  work  program.    The  Sawayaerdun  River  flows  through  the  property  and  can  sufficiently  supply  any 
proposed mining and treatment facilities that may be constructed in the future.
In 2010, a 110 kV power transmission station was constructed to Wulukeqiati Village for providing electricity to 
90,000 farmers, herdsmen and also for mining purposes. A 38 km power line will need to be constructed from 
the mine site to this station in order to connect the property onto the local power grid.

6  History
6.1  Exploration History
The  Sawayaerdun  Gold  Project  has  a  relatively  short  systematic  exploration  history  however  numerous 
regional  exploration  programs  in  the  Sawayaerdun  area  have  been  completed  since  1952.  Follow-up  in  the 
early 1980‟s including a stream geochemical survey, led to the discovery of the  gold mineralisation within the 
Project  area  in  1985.    During  1993  the  No.2  Geological  Brigade  of  Xinjiang  Geological  and  Mineral  Bureau 
Team  No.4  identified  the  main  mineralisation  zone  which  forms  the  western  portion  of  the  current  Mineral 
Resource.  Subsequent  to  this  four  generations  of  exploration  works  have  been  undertaken  including 
exploration adits.
Exploration within the Project area has been completed in four separate Phases.  These include:
  Phase 1 – Up to 2000,
  Phase 2 – 2000 to 2010,
  Phase 3 – 2010 to 2012, and
  Phase 4 – 2013
Phase 1 – Up to 2000
Exploration  works  prior  to  1993  included  only  regional  exploration  works  and  geochemical  surveys. 
Subsequent  to  the  discovery  of  the  main  mineralisation  zone  more  detailed  exploration  was  commenced 
involving,  8  drill  holes,  trenching,  adit  development,  topographic  and  geological  mapping,  magnetic  and 
geochemical mapping and initial hydrological survey. See exploration Section 9 of this report for details.
Phase 2 2002 to 2010
This  phase  covers  a  period  when  the  Project  was  under  a  joint  venture  with  Majestic  Gold  Corporation  of 
Canada. Majestic Gold Corporation undertook exploration work with the assistance of No.2 Geological Brigade 
of Xinjiang Geological and Mineral Bureau. The exploration works include drilling of 60 holes as well as several 
surface  trenches,  geological  mapping,  Induced  Polarisation  Surveys  and  magnetic  profiling.  Re-survey  of 
earlier work was completed.
Phase 3 2010 to 2012
In the period between 2010 and 2011 survey work was completed by the No.2 Geological Brigade of Xinjiang 
Geological and Mineral Bureau which was funded by the Company and included 68 surface holes, 31 surface 
trenches,  and  detailed  geological  mapping,  hydrology  and supporting  survey  control.  In 2012  work  continued 
with additional drill holes, trenches, hydrology work and detailed mapping.
Phase 4 2013
The  Client  made  a  decision  that  the  main  focus  in  2013  would  be  deep  drilling  to  define  the  down  dip 
extensions and the resource base. The work included 13 holes and completion of hydrological surveys.
6.2  Mining History
Although  no  commercial  mining  has  been  undertaken  within the  Project  to  date,  exploration  adits  have  been 
completed on a small scale

6.3  Studies
Several studies have been completed on the Project to date, these include a Metallurgical Study.  RPM has not 
completed a detailed review of these reports or studies, which include:
1.
2.
In  1993-1996,  Ore  Deposit  Geology  Institute  of  Chengdu  Science  and  Technology  University 
completed  geological  site  reconnaissance  and  research  upon  the  mineralisation  belt,  ranging  south 
from Mt. Tianshan, west from Kashi, east to Korla, and identified Sawayaerdun gold deposit for the first 
time  and  documented  its  discovery  “Xinjiang  South  Mt.  Tianshan  Muruntau  Type  Gold  Deposit 
Geological Mineralisation Conditions and Prospecting Target Area Research”.
In  1998-1999  the  Geomechanical  Research  Institute  of  Geological  Ministry  directed  the  project 
“Xinjiang Wuqia County Sawayaerdun Gold Deposit Minefield Structure Research” and pointed out that 
Sawayaerdun gold deposit is located in a ductile shear zone. The mineralisation belt was developed in 
a weak deformation area of secondary ductile crushing.
3.
In  1996-1997  the  Xinjiang  Geological  Prospecting  Bureau  Experimental  Institute  undertook  research 
for Sawayaerdun  gold deposit mineral components and metallurgical properties, and issued “Xinjiang 
Wuqia County Sawayaerdun Gold Ore Material Component and Processing Test Studying Report”.

7  Geological Setting and Mineralisation
RPM  is  aware  several  publically  available  documents  and  Technical  Reports  have  been  completed  on  the 
Project previously.  RPM does not present a detailed interpretation of the regional and project geology, rather 
refers  the  reader  to  the  previous  reports.    RPM  agrees  with  the  previous  interpretation  of  the  regional  and 
project geology as such the information presented below is a summary of the previous reports as well as the 
inclusion of the RPM site visit observations and interpretations.
7.1  Regional Geology
The following section is quoted from Wardrop (2011).
“The tectonic framework of China is dominated by three global orogenic systems: the Central-Asian or Palaeo-
Tethyan,  the  Circum-Pacific,  and  the  Tethys-Himalaya.  Relevant  to  the  Sawayaerdun  property  area,  the 
Tethys-Himalaya system in south western China is the result of subduction of the Pacific Ocean floor beneath 
China,  and  the  indentation  of  the  Indian  continent  into  Eurasia.  Fold  belts  are  predominantly  the  products  of 
subduction  and  accretion  of  orogenic  complexes  and  were  the  focus  of  deformation  in  the  Palaeozoic-
Mesozoic cratonic collisions during final ocean closures.
The  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  is  underlain  by  part  of  the  Altaid  orogenic  complex,  situated  in  the 
south-central part of the Eurasian Plate, immediately north of the Himalayan collision zone and the south of the 
Angara  Craton  that  underlies  eastern  Russia.  The  region  is  comprised  of  several  independent  Precambrian 
continental  blocks;  Palaeozoic  accretionary  complexes  and  extensional  basins  define  the  sutures  between 
these blocks. Permian extensional tectonics formed deep basins, including the Tarim, within the Altaid complex.
The  Tarim  Basin  is  the  largest  inland  basin  in  China  and  is  the  product  of  late  Palaeozoic  rifting  that  led  to 
passive-margin  sedimentation  through  the  Cambrian  and  Ordovician  periods,  as  well  as  accumulation  of 
several kilometres of terrestrial sediments from the mid-Palaeozoic through the Mesozoic.
The  Tian  Shan  mountain  range,  located  immediately  north  of  the  Tarim  Basin,  is  comprised  of  two  partly-
amalgamated  Palaeozoic  sequences  of  allochthonous  terranes,  and  forms  the  south-central  portion  of  the 
Altaid orogenic zone”.
The  near  project  regional  geology  is  depicted  in  Figure  7-1  which  shows  the  dominant  NE-SW  trending 
Devonian and Carboniferous rock units which host the gold mineralisation. The Devonian Sawayaerdun Group 
is variably carbonaceous phyllite with metasandstone while the Carboniferous Bashisuogong Group is similarly 
carbonaceous phyllite but with thin limestone and calcic siltstone interlayered.
7.2  Project Geology
The following section is also quoted from Wardrop (2011).
“The Sawayaerdun Property is located in the eastern Kokshaal region of the Tian Shan Mountains. The oldest 
unit  exposed  on  the  property  is  the  Silurian-age  Taertekuli  Formation  which  is  comprised  of  sericite  phyllite, 
sandstone,  siliceous  mudstone,  carbonaceous  siliceous  phyllite,  slate  and  calcareous  breccia.  The  unit  is 
thought  to  be  of  turbiditic  origin.  The  Taertekuli  Formation  is  overlain  by  the  Devonian-age  Sawayaerdun 
Formation is subdivided into lower and upper units, both turbiditic, and comprised of thin laminae of phyllite and 
siltstone. The phyllites in the upper member are carbonaceous.
The  Lower  Carboniferous  Bashisuogong  Formation  which  includes  clastic  units  and  limestone  overlies  the 
Sawayaerdun Formation.
Each of the units  within the Sawayaerdun Project strike northeast and  dips  predominately predominantly NW 
parallel  to  the schistosity  which  is  developed parallel  to bedding. The  contacts  between the  various  units  are 
structural.”
The  project  geology  is  depicted  in  Figure  7-2.  The  structural  nature  of  the  contact  between  the  upper 
Sawayaerdun Formation  and  the  overlying  Taertekuli  Formation  can  be  seen clearly  from  the  discordance  of 
folded beds in the Sawayaerdun Formation against the Taertekuli Formation along the line of mineralisation.

7.3  Mineralisation
Mineralisation is separated into two main areas; a western zone and an eastern zone known as “Zone IV” and  
“Zone I”  respectively (Figure 7-2) which form two distinct mineralised zones. Both areas contain multiple veins 
or mineralised bodies which have strike and dip extension however all strike NE-SW, crosscut the stratigraphy 
at a low angle and generally dip steeply (60° to 80°) to the northwest Figure 7-2 and Figure 7-3.  The bulk of 
the currently defined mineralisation is contained within two continuous mineralised bodies, one in Zone IV and 
one in Zone I.  The body within Zone IV has a continuous strike extent of over 3 km and down dip continuity of 
up to 650 m from surface. The body is open at depth, has widths ranging from a few metres to up to 50 m in 
parts, and contains approximately 65% of the currently defined resource.   Mineralisation in Zone IV is hosted 
within the upper member of the  Sawayaerdun Formation  and is  in a fault  that forms the contact between the 
upper  Sawayaerdun  Formation  and  the  structurally  overlying  Taertekuli  Formation.    The  controlling  structure 
and the mineralisation are continuous and extend into Kyrgyzstan where mining has occurred.  The body within 
Zone I has a strike of up to 1.2 km and a dip extent of 300 m. The remainder of the resources  are contained 
within smaller, discontinuous parallel lenses in the hanging wall of the deposit.
The  hanging  wall  rocks  of  the  mineralisation  are  predominately  sandstone  with  some  interbeds  of  shale 
however  the  foot  wall  is  more  variable,  with  sandstone  occurring  with  significant  amounts  of  interbedded 
siltstone.  Gold mineralisation occurs within the crystal lattices of the sulphides such as  pyrite; however native 
gold is also known to occur.  Pyrite is the main alteration mineral recognized in the wall rocks, however sericite 
and other muscovite minerals have been identified.
The  geometry  of  the  mineralisation  is  typical  of  fault  controlled  mineralisation  where  the  faults  have  been 
subjected  to  strike  and  dip  movement  which  has  opened  dilational  jogs  at  locations  where  there  are  local 
changes  of  fault  strike  or  dip.  The  sigmoidal  envelopes  of  mineralisation  as  seen  in  Figure  7-2  in  plan  and 
Figure  7-3  in  section  are  characteristic  of  these  types  of  dilational  environments.  The  movement  along  the 
structure has created the permeability for mineralising solution ingress and the space for deposit formation.

8  Deposit Type
Mineralisation within the Sawayaerdun gold deposit is hosted in carbonaceous black metamorphic clastic rocks 
with mineralisation structurally controlled within brittle faults and ductile shear zones. The mineralisation forms 
in plate-like lenticular bodies which are continuous along strike and down dip.
The  orogenic  shear  zones  associated  with  the  deposit  controlled  migration  of  the  gold  bearing  minerals  and 
resulted  in  the  hydrothermal  precipitation  as  well  as  providing  access  and  space  for  the  deposition.  A 
concealed deep pluton is inferred to provide heat for the generation and circulation of ore-forming fluids. Some 
authors  regard  the  deposit  as  being  similar  to  the  Muruntau  deposit  in  the  Kyzyl  Kum  Desert  of  Uzbekistan 
however RPM notes the Sawayaerdun gold deposit also has a strong ductile shear zone complex overprint.
The gold mineralisation identified to date within the Project appears to be structurally controlled and there is a 
strong  localization  along  major  faults  and  splays  and  ductile  shears.  Mineralisation  is  likely  controlled  by  the 
dilation  of  these  structures.  The  Sawayaerdun  deposit  fits  most  closely  to  the  Sediment-hosted  Intrusion-
related  group  of  deposits  within  reduced  clastic  but  distal  intrusion  related  deposits. While  the  Sawayaerdun 
deposit has many of the features of this group there are no immediate granitic intrusions. The type examples 
for  the  deposit  type  may  include  Muruntau,  Kumtor,  and  Telfer.  RPM  notes  that  there  are  also  similarities  to 
some of the variants of gold mineralisation in the Carlin area of Nevada, USA.

9  Exploration
A significant amount of exploration has been  undertaken within the  Project to date.  These works can broadly 
be separated into four Phases.  These are detailed below.
9.1  Phase 1 – Up to 2000
The No.2 Geological Brigade of Xinjiang Geological and Mineral Bureau undertook the geological survey work 
and completed the exploration  as shown in Table  9-1.  Soil geochemical surveys at 1:10,000 scale  identified 
22 alteration zones including Zone IV and Zone I. The Zone IV mineralisation zone is the largest in scale and is 
considered  to  be  the  major  breakthrough  for  gold  prospecting  in  the  area.    Through  general  survey  worked 
completed  between  1995  and  1998,  the  geological  conditions  and  mineralisation  controlling  factors  of  the 
deposit together with mineralised body features were defined.

In  2003  Xinjiang  Geological  and  Mineral  Bureau  and  Majestic  Tianshan  Company  signed  an  agreement  for 
cooperation in exploration and development covering the Project.  Limited activity occurred until 2004 when re-
survey work for Sawayaerdun Goldfield was undertaken by Xinjiang Majiasi Mining Limited.  This survey work 
focused on the area 100 to 300 m below the surface within the Zone IV mineralisation belt using surface drilling 
and trenching. A summary of the completed physical work is shown in Table 9-2.

RPM understands drilling was undertaken using similar procedures for each Phase in accordance with Chinese 
Standards.  Due  to  the  local  terrain  road  construction  was  difficult.  In  order  to  accelerate  the  drilling  smaller 
sites and access were used and therefore holes were no greater than 800 meters deep and some drilling (and 
hydrological holes) were drilled vertical. The remainder of the holes were drilled with inclinations between 60° 
to 85° from horizontal.
Tungsten  carbide  drill  bits  were  used  to  penetrate  through  the  overburden  and  bedrock  fracture  zones.  The 
holes were cased with 89 mm casing, sealed with cement and subsequently drilled using 75 mm double barrel 
diamond drilling resulting in a core diameter of 48 mm.

11  Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security
All exploration works were completed in accordance with Chinese regulatory requirements and design for the 
sample collecting methodologies, assays and various tests. This was reported up to 2012 and includes most of 
the  data  underpinning  the  Resource  estimate.  2013  data  was  supplied  by  the  Client  while  the  recent  drilling 
was inspected during RPM‟s site visit. This section reports the details of the sample preparation, analyses and 
security  for  the  exploration  data  up  to  2012.  Commentary  on  the  2013  drilling  data  is  in  Section  12  of  this 
report.
11.1  Sampling Approach and Method
11.1.1  Drill Core Samples
For  all  the  drill  holes  intersecting  mineralisation  sampling  was  completed  according  to  different  types, 
mineralisation strength, and roof and floor areas. Sample lengths were generally 1 m to a maximum of 1.5 m 
based  on  the  geological  contacts.  Core  saws  or  core  splitters  were  used  for  halving  core  samples  along  the 
long axis of the core. Half of the core was taken as a sample and the other half was placed back into the core 
box as a duplicate record. When individual core sections had a high degree of fragmentation the saw couldn‟t 
be  used.  In  this  case  a  geological  hammer  was  used  but  half  sample  uniformity  was  ensured  by  careful 
sampling.
Sample  recoveries  were  recorded  during  drill  logging  to  ensure  the  sampling  reasonableness  and 
representativeness.  Following  this,  according  to  geological  sampling  requirements,  sampling,  packing, 
numbering, weighing and delivering for laboratory assay were completed. The actual weight of the sample and 
the  theoretical  weight  of  errors  were  generally  within  ±  10%.    RPM  considers  that  the  sampling  procedures 
were of satisfactory quality.
11.1.2  Trench Samples
Trenching  works  were  generally  completed  perpendicular  to  the  strike  of  the  mineralisation.  Trenching  width 
was generally between 2 and 3 m however because individual trenches covered some thick mineralised bodies 
widths up to 5 to 6 m were also used. The trench depths ranged from 2 m to 9 m with a width at the base of the 
trench of 0.8 m. The wall slope was generally 60 ° to 80 °. All trenches penetrated the bedrock by a minimum 
of 0.3 m. An excavator with a rock-breaker attachment (and blasting on some occasions) was used to ensure 
penetration to the required depth.
11.1.3  Channel Samples
Channel  sampling  was  completed  based  on  the  different  types  of  mineralisation,  waste  rock  inclusions  and 
hanging  and  foot  wall  areas.  Sample  channel  size  was  10  cm  ×  5  cm  and  length  was  generally  1  m  which 
ranged up to a maximum of 1.5 m based on geological contacts.
Samples  were  taken  from  exploration  trenches  and  adits.  In  the  trenches,  samples  were  usually  continuous 
along the bottom junction of trench walls and floor. Exploration adit samples were usually taken in areas which 
intersected mineralisation  on  the  right  side  wall  at  a  60  cm  height  above the floor  as  a horizontal  continuous 
channel sample.
The  bottom  of  the  trench  was  cleared  before  sampling.  Packaging,  numbering  and  weighing  was  done  as 
required. The theoretical and actual weight error was generally within ± 10%, in line with quality requirements.
11.1.4  Density Samples
Oxidized and primary mineralisation was collected as two types. Oxidized samples were all collected within the 
trenching project. Primary mineralisation was collected according to different ore grade categories.
In  total  215  samples  were  analysed  of  which  78  were  oxidized  mineralisation  and  137  were  primary 
mineralisation.  Samples  were  collected  from  drill  holes,  roadways,  and  trenches.  Packaging  was  done  in  a 
timely manner to meet quality requirements.

11.2  Sample Preparation Method
Samples  were  prepared  in  accordance  with the  Chinese "Rock  and Mineral  Preparation  Engineering  Sample 
Analysis Regulations" (DZ0130.13-2006) requirements for analysis implementation.  Samples were prepared in 
4 stages which included crushing, screening, blending and splitting.
Initially  the samples  were  crushed to  size  fractions  of  5 mesh  and then  20 mesh  prior  to  splitting  for  the  first 
time with coarse duplicate  samples saved.  Grinding to a size fraction of  80 mesh  was completed on the split 
samples which were split for a second time. This secondary split resulted in primary samples of 500 g in weight 
with all other sample saved as a duplicate.  The primary sample was subsequently ground to a 200 mesh size 
fraction using a rod mill then sent for analysis.
11.3  Sample Analysis
The  majority  of  analysis  included  gold  only  however  individual  samples  were  analysed  for  antimony  (mainly 
1998 general survey analysis). Although similar procedures were used in the analysis during different phases 
of  exploration,  different  laboratories  were  utilised.    All  laboratories  utilised  the  activated  carbon  adsorption 
digestion method followed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer finish or the activated carbon adsorption – 
hydroquinone volumetric methods. The laboratories utilised included:
  2012 Analysis sample work was completed by the Brigade 1 laboratory.
  2010  and  2011  Analysis  sample  work  was  completed  by  the  Internal  Lab  (partially  by  Xinjiang
Geological Bureau Testing Center) and Geophysical Prospecting Laboratory.
  2004-2007 Analysis sample work was completed by central laboratory of China Geosciences Institute
(IGGE) in Langfang, Hebei Province (ISO 9001 certification), and Vancouver ACME Laboratory.
  1994-1998  Analysis  was  by  completed  by  the  Brigade‟s  own  laboratory.  Mainly  using  the  activated
carbon adsorption dynamics - hydroquinone volumetric method for testing.
11.4  Sample Security
The  majority  of  the  exploration  work  undertaken  within  the  Project  was  completed  by  the  No.2  Geological 
Brigade  of  Xinjiang  Geological  and  Mineral  Bureau.    During  this  process  no  Client  or  Company  employees, 
officers,  directors,  or  associates  were  involved  in  the  sample  preparation  or  analysis  of  the  samples.  RPM 
considers the sample security utilized to be appropriate for this type of gold deposit

11.5  Quality Assurance and Quality Control
The Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) data provided to RPM included  internal and external pulp 
repeats,  internal  standards,  and  blank  samples  submitted  by  the  Company.  In  addition,  RPM  took  50 
independent  pulp  and  10  field  duplicate  samples  from  the  2011,  2012  and  2013  drilling  programs  and  re-
submitted these samples for check analysis to the SGS Laboratory in Tianjin, China.
The  number  and  type  of  QA/QC  samples  used  during  each  generation  of  drilling  varied,  as  can  be  seen  in 
Table 11-1.

Internal  and  external  pulp  repeat  samples  were  taken  throughout  the  exploration  works  completed  on  the 
Project.  The number varied between generations (Table  11-1) with a total of 2,702 internal pulp repeats and 
857  external  pulp  repeats  analysed.  Of  these,  592  external  pulp  duplicates  were  assayed  at  the  Central 
Laboratory of Xinjiang Geology & Mineral Bureau in Urumqi.  A summary of the results for each Phase is given 
below.
Phase 1
A comparison of the internal and external pulp repeat results against the primary assays for the Phase 1 drilling 
(Figure  11-1)  although  indicating  some  scatter  do  show  a  reasonable  level  of  repeatability  and  correlation.  
With less than 1 % of samples lying outside the 10% error range RPM considers this to be an acceptable result.
Phase 2
No internal and external pulp repeats analyses were supplied to RPM for Phase 2. RPM  was informed by the 
Client that Xinjiang Majiasi Mining Limited did not provide the Client with the QA/QC data for the Phase 2 work.
Phase 3
A comparison of both the internal and external pulp repeat results against the primary assays for the Phase 3 
drilling (Figure 11-1) show a similar pattern to the Phase 1 data.  This would be expected as similar sampling 
and  assaying  practices  were  utilised  during  each  phase  of  exploration.    RPM  considers  these  results  to  be 
acceptable given the style of mineralisation.
Phase 4
A comparison of the internal pulp repeat results against the primary assays for the Phase 4 drilling (Figure 11-
2)  indicate  excellent  repeatability  of  the  original  samples.  RPM  considers  this  to  be  an  acceptable  result.    A 
review  of  the  external  pulp  repeat  results  shows  some  scatter  and  there  is  evidence  of  minor  positive  assay 
bias.  RPM  considers  this  is  likely  not  to  be  representative  of  the  total  population  and  concludes  that  no 
definitive conclusion can be drawn from this given the size of the sample population.

11.5.2  Independent Core Duplicates and Pulp Re-Assays
During  the  site  visit,  as  part  of  the  data  validation  process  (as  outlined  in  Section  12),  RPM  reviewed  the 
remaining  core  of  several  holes  of  the  2013  Phase  4  drilling.    During  this  review  RPM  collected  10  core 
duplicate samples (the remaining half core) and 20 pulp samples.  These samples were subsequently sent to 
SGS Tianjin and were assayed by the Fire Assay method followed by an AAS finish.  This method differs from 
the primary assay methodology which consisted of an acid digestion method (Aqua Regia) with AAS finish.
A comparison of the RPM independent pulp re-assay results with the primary assays (Figure 11-3) indicate a 
positive assay bias is observed. RPM considers this can be attributed to the fire assay method used for the re-
assay.    Given  the  vein-  and  sulphide-hosted  style  of  mineralisation,  fire  assay  generally  results  in  a  higher 
recovery of  gold than the  acid digestion method.   This bias  is a common occurrence within China due to  the 
style of mineralisation, and has been observed by RPM in several other projects.  RPM does however note that 
some  scatter  is  observed  which  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  both  the  internal  and  external  repeats  of  all 
generations of drilling.
The results of the core duplicate sample analysis while inconclusive with some variation being observed in the 
scatter plot (Figure 11-3) clearly highlight the mineralisation trends within the individual samples.  Of the small 
sample set, a number of samples show reasonable correlation, while those which do not all have grade.  Given 
the high nugget observed and the vein- and sulphide-hosted mineralisation RPM considers these results to be 
consistent with the sampling method applied.

11.5.3  Blanks
During the 2012 Phase 3 and 2013 Phase 4 drilling the Company included a number of blanks in the sample 
batches.    A  total  of  407  blanks  for  Phase  3  and  71  blanks  for  Phase  4  were  provided,  of  which  no  samples 
recorded above 0.06 g/t Au.
11.5.4  QA/QC Conclusion
A review of the results of the Internal and External repeats for each Phase of drilling (where available) all show 
similar  reasonable  correlation  to  the  primary  samples,  however  some  scatter  is  observed.    This  scatter  is 
consistently  less  than  1%  of  the  total  population  and  as  such  RPM  considers  the  results  indicate  a  suitable 
level  of  repeatability  from  the  primary  laboratory.    This  is  further  supported  by  the  independent  assays 
completed on the 2013 drilling data  which,  while indicating a lower  bias for the  primary laboratory, have very 
similar scatter trends with the repeat data.
While  RPM  considers  that  these  results,  in  addition  to  the  standards  and  blanks  completed  during  the  2012 
and  2013  drilling,  indicate  that  the  Phase  3  and  Phase  4  drilling  are  of  suitable  quality  to  be  included  in  a 
Mineral  Resource  estimate,  RPM  does  recommend  additional  test  work  be  completed  to  determine  potential 
issues.    As  noted  the  independent  assays  show  a  systematic  bias  towards  the  secondary  lab,  due  to  the 
varying  methods,  while  the  scatter  on  the  internal  and  external  plots  indicate  that  the  pulverisation  of  the 
sample may not be of sufficient size and quality to ensure homogeneity of all samples.  While RPM considers 
that these two issues will not result in a material issues for the estimate RPM does however recommend that 
further studies be undertaken to ensure the reasonably high nugget does not result in any material bias during 
the  sample  preparation.    Of  particular  note  is  ensuring  that  crushing  and  grinding  sizes  are  suitable  for 
liberating the gold whilst not resulting in accumulations occurring which may result in potential bias.  This type 
of analysis is commonly undertaken with gold projects with a high nugget to customize the sample preparation 
techniques and ensure a representative technique and accurate result.  This type of testwork is known to test 
the sample homogeneity.
While  RPM  considers  the  QA/QC  available  for  Phase  3  and  Phase  4  suitable  to  confirm  the  accuracy  and 
precision  of  the  primary  laboratory,  there  is  limited  information  for  Phase  2  and  only  Internal  and  External 
checks  for  Phase  1.    As  such  RPM  completed  a  series  of  reviews  to  determine  any  variation  in  the  method 
applied to derive the data for these Phases, and compared the grade visually in three dimensions to determine 
potential variations.
  A  review  of  the  sampling  procedures  and  sampling  methods  (with  limited  documentations)  indicates
that the same or similar procedure were utilised, along with the same assaying methods;
  The general location  of the Phase 1 and  Phase 2 exploration  works indicates that the majority  of the 
channel sampling and trenching completed occurs in the  Inferred portion of the resource, while some 
drilling occurs within the Indicated portion. This is supported by Phase 3 and Phase 4 drilling and only 
constitutes a small proportion;
  Descriptive  statistics  of  the  various  phases  of  the  drilling  show  similarities  in  mean  grade  and
population distribution (See Section 14), and
  Drill holes from Phases 1, 3 and 4 that occur adjacent to drill holes from Phase 2 demonstrate similar
geology and mineralisation, both in cross section, plan and visualised in three dimensions.
Following  the  review  of  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  data,  RPM  considers  that  while  there  is  limited  QA/QC 
information, the comparison both globally  and on a local scale indicates that similar grade distributions occur 
within  the  same  geological  structure.    Importantly,  RPM  understand  that  similar  sampling  and  assaying 
techniques  were  undertaken  and  all  work  was  completed  to  Chinese  Standards  and  as  such  there  is  a 
reasonable  expectation  that  the  samples  will  be  of  similar  quality  as  the  Phase  3  and  Phase  4  data.  
Additionally the majority of the data for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 works is located in the  Inferred portion of the 
resource; as such RPM considers it suitable for the assays to be included in the resource.  RPM does however 
note that some issues with the down hole and location surveys also exist and some data was excluded for this 
reason (Section 12).

12  Data Verification
In  addition  to  the  data  verification  and  Quality  Assurance  and  Quality  Control‟s  data  reviewed  for  the  drilling 
prior to 2011, which is outlined in the previous publicly released Technical Reports, RPM conducted a review of 
the geological digital data supplied by the Company for the Project.  This review was to ensure that no material 
issues  could  be  identified  and  that  there  was  no  cause  to  consider  that  the  data  was  inaccurate  and  not 
representative of the underlying samples.
This  review  included  a series  of  systematic  data  validation steps  after  receiving  the  database  which included 
validation of field data as well as on a desktop basis.  Checks completed by RPM included:
  Carried out a site visit over four days including reviewing site geological and laboratory processes and
the active 2013 Phase 4 drilling;
  Compared digital drill hole data against original digital drill hole cross-sections;
  Drill  hole relative  location  was  checked  by  RPM  when on-site  by  locating  12  drill  holes  drilled  by  the 
Company  in  2013  with  a  hand-held  GPS.    The  recorded  positions  were  then  compared  with  the 
surveyed co-ordinates in the database (Table 12-1).  The drill holes were surveyed by handheld GPS 
in  latitude  and  longitude  and  converted  in  the  Xi‟an  1980  local  site  grid.  The  Company  would  not 
provide  conversion  parameters  that  RPM  could  take  from  site  for  this  grid  as  it  was  considered 
confidential  under  Chinese  law.  This  meant  that  we  were  unable  to  convert  the  check  surveys. 
However, by converting the data to Transverse Mercator coordinate system RPM was able to compare 
the  relative  position  of  the  drill  holes.  The  comparison  showed  the  relative  position  of  the  holes 
matches the collars from the database (see Table 12-1).

  RPM conducted a site visit to the Laboratory of Brigade 1, Xinjiang Geology & Mineral Bureau located 
in  Tulufan  City.  This  laboratory  carried  out  the  assaying  for  the  Phase  3  and  4  drilling  programs. 
External checks for 2013 were sent to the Central Laboratory of Xinjiang Geology and Mineral Bureau 
in  Urumqi.  Assaying  for  the  Phase  3  drilling  was  carried  out  at  Brigade  No.2  in  Kashi.    Checks  and 
observations by RPM included:
o  Observed different stages and procedures used within the lab
o  RPM observed that all records were hand written. However, great attention to detail  by laboratory
staff was observed.
o  RPM noted that  the sample  preparation  area was clean and  well organised. The machinery  was
old but appeared to be well maintained.
o  RPM noted that the pulp storage area was clean and well organised.
o  RPM noted that the wet lab was operational and well organised.
  Reviewed the remaining core from 5 drill holes and compared the mineralisation to the digital assays.
The exact metres reviewed by RPM are shown in Table 12-2.

assayed at the SGS Laboratory, Tianjin, China. (Section 11.5.2)
  Collected  50  pulp  samples  from  the  Brigade  1,  Xinjiang  Geology  &  Mineral  Bureau  laboratory  for
independent analysis at the SGS Laboratory, Tianjin, China. (Section 11.5.2)
  Compared  drill  hole,  trenching  and  channel  geology  and  assays  with  neighbouring  drill  holes
intersecting the same mineralised zone (See Section 11.5.4).
  Observed  historical  trenches  on  site.  This  confirmed  their  existence  but  no  other  useful  information
could be derived from them due to weathering and oxidation.
  Observed diamond drilling operations and noted core retrieval process and procedures.
  Reviewed  the  sampling  and  preparation  procedures  including  noting  sample  interval,  drillers  marks 
and  hole  ID  clearly  marked  and  labelled  on  the  core  boxes  and  consistent  with  digital  data.. 
Procedures appear consistent with the Chinese Standards;
  Observed  the  underground  adits.  However,  we  were  unable  to  enter  these  due  to  poor  ground
conditions.
  Observed core cutting equipment. A diamond saw was present on site although not in use at the time.
  Compared the hardcopy driller‟s reports, geological logging, geological reports and sampling sheets of 
14 holes with the database, which represent 5% of the total holes - no other error was noted except 3 
input errors.
  Compared the scanned copies of assay certificates from the Phase 3 and Phase 4 drilling.  All of the 
Phase  4  drilling  certificates  were  reviewed  and  compared  to  the  database  and  300  assays  in  the

Phase  3  program  were  compared  resulting  in  only  minor  errors  being  noted.    These  errors  were 
corrected accordingly and are not considered to be material.
  Comparison  of  geological  maps,  cross  sections,  long  sections,  exploration  drill  plans  with  the  digital
datasets.
12.1  Data Excluded
After  a  systematic  review  of  the  data  supplied  to  RPM  while  it  appears  the  majority  of  the  data  has  been 
accurately surveyed (both collars location and down hole) some have not, particularly within the Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 generations.  Due to the style of mineralisation (variable in location of mineralisation) and the impact a 
small drill hole deviation would have on the interpretation of the mineralisation RPM has excluded the 24 holes 
and  trenches  which  were  not  accurately  surveyed  and  could  not  be  confirmed  with  the  information  supplied 
(Table  12-4).    RPM  considers  this  data  could  materially  impact  the  resource  interpretation  to  not  reflect  the 
actual location of the mineralisation.

12.2  Data Verification Statement
The results of the data verification and data quality review indicate that the digital database used as the basis 
for the Statement of Mineral Resources is supported  by verified, certified assay  certificates, original drill  logs, 
QA/QC data, independent external assays and verified survey data.  As such, RPM believes there is sufficient 
data  quality  to  enable  the  use  of  this  data  (except  that  which  was  excluded  denoted  in  Section  12.1)  in  a 
Mineral Resource estimate and resultant classification following that set by the NI 43-101 Standards.

13  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
RPM has not reviewed this information, nor can it confirm the accuracy of the testwork or reports and presents 
the  summary  for  information  purposes  only.  The  summary  below  is  in  addition  to  those  tests  disclosed  in 
previous Technical Reports on the Project.  RPM recommends the reader review these  Technical Reports for 
further information.
13.1  Processing Test Sampling
During  the  2010  detailed  exploration  program,  metallurgical  test  samples  were  collected  from  drill  holes 
completed  between  profile  lines  00-51  (the  other  half  split  core  left  in  the  core  box)  from  the  main  zone  of 
mineralisation within the Zone IV mineralisation.  Samples were selected from areas of greater than 1.5 g/t Au, 
with thicknesses of greater than 4 m.  1 m of the adjacent waste rock was also included in the sample which 
aimed to have an average grade of between 2.2 and 2.6 g/t Au.
This  resulted  in  25  samples  being  collected  from  25  drill  holes  which  had  a  combined  weight  of  500  kg  as 
shown in Table 13-1. All samples were sent to the Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy 
for testing.

In  addition  to  the  above  samples,  in  2011  approximately  650  kg  of  low  grade  material  from  the  remaining 
samples  was  sent  to  Xinjiang  Bureau  of  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources  Research  Center  for  processing 
testwork.  No information was supplied to RPM as to the grade or source of this material however it is assumed 
to be lower than the grade in Table 13-1.
13.1.1  Processing Test Sample Preparation
Upon receipt of the samples the Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy  through a series 
of crushing, screening, blending and mixing steps, formed a composite sample at a grade of 2.25 g/t Au.

13.2  Primary Testing Method, Test Procedures and Test Results
13.2.1  Testing Method
A  series  of  tests  were  completed  on  the  primary  composite  sample  at  the  Beijing  test  centre.    These  tests 
included flotation, roasting and cyanide leaching with the results presented in Table 13-2.

13.3  Primary Low Grade Testwork
Xinjiang  Bureau  of  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources  Research  Center  selected  the  flotation  method  as  the 
primary  method  of  extracting  the  gold  from  the  low  grade  samples.    This  testwork  resulted  in  a  two  stage 
flotation,  coarse  separation  process,  mid  ore  process  re-grinding  as  being  recommended.    A  preliminary 
flowsheet included:
  Raw  ore  firstly  undergoes  two  stages  of  roughing  followed  by  four  stages  of  scavenging.  Foam 
products  from  the  first  stage  roughing  are  not  involved  in  the  cleaning  stage  and  are  taken  as 
concentrate.
  Foam  products  from  the  second  stage  roughing  formed  through  three  stages  of  cleaning  results  in
concentrate
  Cleaning tailing product and four stage scavenging combine and form Mid Ore. Mid Ore after grinding
and three stage cleaning result in a concentrate.
  The three concentrates are combined to form a saleable concentrate.
13.3.1  Testing Results
The tests included three types of separate closed-circuit flotation. These include one stage roughing, mid ore 
return  resulting  in  gold  concentrates  with  grade  of  21.48  g/t  Au  with  yield  of  6.02%  and  a  recovery  rate  of 
84.62%. One stage roughing mid ore re- grinding, resuls in gold concentrates with grade of 22.38 g/t Au with 
yield  of  5.64%  and  recovery  rate  of  84.62%.  Two  stages‟  roughing,  mid  ore  re-grinding  results  in  gold 
concentrates with grade of 20.55 g/t Au with yield of 6.56% and a recovery rate of 85.85%.
Combination  of  the  three  concentrates  achieves  a  total  recovery  of  85.85%  and  74.16%  for  Au  and  Ag 
respectively, with a concentrate grade of 20.55 g/t Au and 40.7 g/t Ag. Analysis of the total concentrate and the 
tails are shown in Table 13-3 and Table 13-4 respectively.

13.4  Metallurgical Conclusions
The testwork completed indicates that for primary ore and low grade ore a processing route involving flotation, 
cyanide roasting and cyanide leaching delivers an estimated total recovery for gold and silver of 82.37% and 
33.51% respectively. Primary low-grade ore flotation using two stages roughing and mid ore re-grinding obtain 
gold and silver total recoveries of 85.85% and 74.16% respectively.

14  Mineral Resource Estimates
A  Mineral  Resource  estimate  has  been  independently  completed  by  RPM  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines 
provided  in  the  NI  43-101,  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects,  dated  June  30,  2011.    Information 
contained in this Report is  based on information provided to RPM by the Company and verified  by RPM.   All 
statistical  analysis  and  Mineral  Resource  estimations  were  carried  out  by  RPM.    RPM  developed  three 
dimensional digital resources for the concentration of the Au metal and developed the resource estimate based 
on  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  data  which  RPM  considered  appropriate  (Section  12).    RPM  believes  the 
Mineral  Resource  estimate  meets  general  guidelines  for  NI  43-101  compliant  resources  for  the  Measured, 
Indicated and Inferred confidence levels.
14.1  Sample Data
14.1.1  Sample Data
All drill hole collar, survey, assay and geology records were supplied to RPM in Excel spreadsheet format by 
the site geologists and engineers.  All Mineral Resource work conducted by RPM was based on data received 
as of 31st January, 2014.  An Access database was created and managed by RPM.
The database utilised for estimation contains the records from 276 surface diamond drill holes (“DD”) for a total 
of 89,642 m and 107 trenches.  A summary of the drill hole database is shown in Table 14-1.

As outlined in Section 12 some drill hole and trench data was excluded from the model which were considered 
to be of sub-standard quality.  These holes have been omitted from Table 14-1.
14.1.2  Bulk Density Data
The bulk density data was provided to RPM by the Client in the report titled “Wuqia County Sawayaerdun Gold 
Deposit,  2012  Annual  Summary  of  Geological  Exploration  Work”  by  Brigade  2  of  the  Xinjiang  Geology  and 
Mineral  Bureau.  All  density  determinations  were  taken  on  core  from  2011  and  2012  drilling  programs.  RPM 
assigned a bulk density of 2.8 t/cu.m for all mineralisation and waste blocks in the resource model which was 
the same bulk density value assigned for the mineral resource estimate in 2013 (RPA, 2013) for the Project.
RPM  conducted  a  statistical  and  spatial  review  of  the  data  to  determine  its  suitability  for  use  in  the  Mineral 
Resource  estimate.  RPM  found  the  density  data  showed  little  variation,  was  consistent  with  the geology  and 
mineralisation  of  the  sample  locations  and  was  therefore  suitable  for  inclusion  in  the  Mineral  Resource 
estimate.

14.2  Geology and Resource Interpretation
Geological wireframes for the shear hosted mineralisation were created by RPM using the geological logging of 
the drill core.  These wireframes were used to guide the mineralised envelopes, which were interpreted using a 
nominal  0.3  g/t  Au  grade  cut-off  selected  from  log-probability  plots  to  separate  background  from  mineralised 
population.    In  addition,  a  cut-off  of  1.0  g/t  Au  was  used  to  interpret  the  high  grade  parts  of  the  main 
mineralisation  zone  in  Zone  IV  to  improve  the  resource  estimation.  No  other  potentially  economic  minerals 
have  been  defined  within  the  Project.  A  minimum  mineralisation  width  of  0.8  m  was  assumed  for  the 
interpretation based on Chinese reports for the Project.
Resource outlines were generally extrapolated to a distance half-way between mineralised and un-mineralised 
holes/sections or 50 metres from the nearest hole on the edges of the mineralisation, where no un-mineralised 
drill holes were available to limit the interpretation.  RPM does however note that geological continuity is high 
within the main mineralisation zone.  As such, RPM interpolated areas through sections with no drilling  when 
they have mineralisation intersection sections on either side.  This result in areas of the inferred resource being 
interpolated  at  distances  over  100m  within  the  main  zone.    RPM  considers  this  suitable  due  to  the  clearly 
demonstrated geological continuity of the main zone.
RPM  determined  the  extent  of  weathering  within  the  deposit  to  be  minimal  and  as  a  result  it  was  not 
incorporated in the geological interpretation.  RPM highlights this is a common occurrence in the region and is 
not an exception.
14.3  Preparation of Wireframes
A  drill  hole,  trench  and  channel  sample  layout  plan  for  the  Project  is  displayed  in  Figure  10-1.    This  data 
formed  the  basis  of  sectional  interpretations  of  the  mineralisation.  The  interpreted  sectional  outlines  were 
manually  triangulated  to  form  the  wireframes.    To form  ends  to  the  wireframes,  the  end  section  strings  were 
copied to a position midway to the next section or 50 meters from the nearest drill hole and adjusted to match 
the overall interpretation of the mineralisation.
The wireframed objects were validated using Surpac software and set as solids.
14.4  Sample Statistics
14.4.1  General
The mineralised envelopes were used to code the drill hole, trench and channel database to allow identification 
of the individual resource domains.  Separate intersection files were generated for each mineralised envelope.  
A review  of sample length within these files  was carried out to determine the  optimal composite length.  This 
review determined that a variety of sample lengths were used during the sampling; these lengths ranged from 
less  than  1  m  up  to  2  m  with  the  majority  being  1  m  (Figure  14-2).  RPM  believes  1  m  to  be  the  optimal 
composite length due to the weighted sample length  and the mining  method  planned  to be  employed for  the 
Project,  namely  small  scale  underground  mining.    Surpac  software  was  then  used  to  extract  downhole 
composites within the intervals coded for each domain.
The  composites  were  checked  for  spatial  correlation  with  the  wireframed  solids,  the  location  of  the  rejected 
composites and zero composite values.
14.4.2  Sample Support and Drilling Types and Generations
Three  main  sampling  recovery  methods  have  been  utilised  during  the  exploration  phases,  these  include 
trenching, surface diamond drilling and underground channel sampling.   To ensure no sample support issues 
between  the  different  sample  types  existed  RPM  completed  a  statistical  and  visual  comparison  between  the 
datasets.  Descriptive statistics between the composites from all domains shows that although some variation 
exists similar distributions are observed (similar Standard Deviations).  This interpretation is supported when a 
visual comparisons is made, with drill holes located in close proximity to other sampling types showing similar 
grades  and  distributions.    In  addition  similar  correlations  are  interpreted  when  the  different  Phases  of  the 
exploration works are examined.  As a result RPM considers that no sample support issues are present within 
the dataset.

14.5  Deposit Statistics
All  composite  sample  data  for  the  deposit  was  imported  into  Snowden  Supervisor  Software  for  analysis.  
Statistics were produced for the Au composites within the main mineralisation domains (Objects 1, 201 and 2), 
as shown in Table 14-3.
Analysis  of  the  descriptive  statistics  indicates  that  the  elements  within  each  domain  appear  to  have  a  log 
normal  distribution  with  moderate  to  high  variability.    A  reasonably  high  range,  coefficient  of  variation  and 
variance is observed.  This interpretation is further supported when the log probability plots and histograms are 
analysed,  resulting  in  the  interpretation  that  Au  grades  have  a  relatively  log  normal  distribution  and  a  highly 
positively skewed distribution. Figures 14-3 display histograms and log probability plots for Objects 1, 201 and 
2.
RPM interprets these statistics to be representative of the style of mineralisation observed at the Project and is 
consistent  with  these  styles  of  mineralisation  seen  in  the  region.    Of  particular  note  is  the  high  coefficient  of 
variation observed for all objects.

14.6  High Grade Cuts
Visual analysis of the grade distributions within drill holes indicates that the high grade mineralisation within the 
main zone is continuous.  This interpretation is supported when the histograms and the log probability plots are 
reviewed  with  no  distinct  breaks  interpreted.  As  a  result  RPM  considers  there  to  be  no  outliers  within  the 
distributions as such no high grade cuts were applied.
RPM does however  note that there is evidence of a higher grade population within Object 2 which cannot be 
domained with the current drill spacing.  This higher grade population appears to  occur as a continuous zone 
within a halo of lower grade material.  Upon further exploration sub-domaining should be considered.
14.7  Geospatial Analysis
Due  to  the  style  of  mineralisation  and  distribution  of  the  sampling  found  within  the  deposit  two  geospatial 
analyses were completed; on Object 1 combined with Object 201 and on Object 2.
The geospatial analysis of the separate objects indicated that robust variography could only be interpreted for 
Object  1  and  Object  201.    This  is  likely  due  to the  large  drill  spacing  (100  m  sections)  and inability  to define 
grade continuity  on smaller lag distances than the current drill spacing.   Good continuity could be interpreted 
for Object 1 and Object 201 and as such all other objects were assigned the variogram parameters for these 
objects.
The interpreted orientation of the majority of the mineralisation was supported when the dataset was analysed.  
The interpretation of the resultant semivariograms indicated that the nugget was relatively high at 39%, and the 
major and semi-major axes are in the plane of the dipping mineralisation and have similar ranges (130 m). This 
resulted in a search ellipse with no anisotropy in the plane of the mineralisation (strike 30o and westerly dip 70o 
for Objects 1 and 201).
The interpreted major and semi-major direction is consistent with the interpreted geology of the deposit where 
the  mineralisation  is  geologically  highly  continuous  however  variation  of  grade  occurs  between  sections.  
Importantly  only  60%  of  the sill  is  contained  within  the first  structure of  the  variogram  (40m).   While showing 
that  variability  in  grade  does  occur  on  a  local  scale,  this  highlights  the  higher  levels  of  continuity  observed 
within the deposit when compared to other gold deposits in the region and within China which in general have 
a  much  higher  proportion  in  the  first  structure  with  these  ranges.  The  interpreted  variogram  parameters  are 
shown in Table 14-4 and the interpreted model for the deposit is shown graphically in Figure 14-4.

14.8.2  Block Size
The  parent  block  size  was  determined  based  on  the  drill  spacing  and  geological  variability  of  the  deposit.    A 
significant number of drill holes have a spacing of 40 m or less, the vast majority having been drilled within the 
area of the exploration.  Given this, the variability of the mineralisation and the size of the mineralized lenses, 
RPM  considered  a  block  size  of  20  m  (northing)  by  20  m  (easting)  by  5  m  (vertical)  and  sub-blocked  to 
dimensions of 2.5 m (northing) by 2.5 m (easting) by 0.625 m (vertical) to be appropriate.
14.8.3  Estimation Parameters
For  all  mineralisation  envelopes  interpreted  within  the  Project,  the  resource  objects  were  used  as  hard 
boundaries in the interpolation of the metals.  That is, only grades inside each object were used to interpolate 
the  blocks  inside  that  object.  The  Ordinary  Kriging  (OK)  algorithm  was  selected  for  interpolation  due  to  the 
number  of  samples  and  the  adequate  interpreted  geospatial  analysis.    The  OK  algorithm  was  utilised  to 
minimise over smoothing within the estimate.
An anisotropic search based on the geospatial analysis was used to estimate a first pass radius of  70 m along 
the major direction of continuity and drill density through the mineralised zone,  with a search radius of 150 m 
used  for  the  second  pass  and  a  final  pass  of  500  m.  The  minimum  number  of  samples  was  8  for  the  first  2 
passes,  with  a  maximum  of  32  samples.  For  the  third  pass  a  minimum  of  1  sample  was  used  to  fill  the 
remainder of blocks.
The search parameters are shown in Table 14-6.

RPM considers that the  bulk densities for each rock type  as outlined  in Section  14.1.2 are representative  as 
they  are  appropriate  to  the  style  of  mineralisation  found.  As  a  result  RPM  utilised  the  average  of  the  bulk 
densities from each rock type in the block model.
14.8.5  Resource Classification
A significant number of drill holes, surface trenches and underground channel samples have been completed 
on the deposit.  Exploration was undertaken in a number of phases and on a number of spacings, as a result 
sample density is variable with some areas having dense coverage while others are quite sparse.
As  a result  of  this  sample density  variability  RPM  constrained the  geospatial  analysis  of  the  grade  within  the 
densely  populated  areas  to  limit  the  effect  of  the  variable  sample  spacing.    This  detailed  statistical  analysis 
suggested  that  sample  spacings  of  less  than  30  m,  60  m  and  150  m  are  appropriate  for  classification  of 
Measured,  Indicated  and  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  respectively,  which  would  be  compliant  with  the 
recommended guidelines of the NI 43-101 standards.   These distances were based on the variogram ranges 
for the major direction of continuity and the visual inspection of the grade within the drill holes.
These spacings were then utilised as a guide to build appropriate classification envelopes surrounding the area 
of the resource.  The areas classified as Measured and Indicated are highlighted in Figure 14-5.
14.8.6  Model Validation
To check that the interpolation of the block model correctly reflects the drilling data, validation was carried out 
using the following steps:
  Swath Plots;
  Grade Comparison by Domain;
  Visual Inspection of the Blocks.
Grade Comparison by Domain
Comparison  of  the  block  values  and  composites  results  in  a  reasonable  correlation  (Table  14-7),  with  the 
difference between the block model grades compared to the composites ranging from around 5 % to 15 %. The 
poorer correlation of Object 201 and Object 2 is a direct result of the large proportion of Inferred material which 
lies  at the  lower  elevations.    This  Inferred  material  is  a large  proportion of  the total  resource, however  has  a 
much lower number of supporting composites.  As a result of this poorer correlation, RPM completed a second 
mathematical comparison including only the Measured and Indicated material within Objects 1 and 201.  The 
result indicated a good correlation for both objects as shown in Table 14-7.  RPM notes that Table 14-7 does 
not show all objects, only the largest, which contain the majority of the mineralisation.

The composites were compared with the block model data by  easting and elevation in the swath plots. These 
plots  highlight  the  impact  of  the  Inferred  material  on  the  correlation  and  the  inaccurate  resultant  numbers.  
These  plots  highlight  that  the  correlation  on  easting  using  limited  composites  is  generally  relatively  low, 
however  when  large  number  of  composites  are  within  the  area  the  correlation  is  excellent.    This  is  further 
evidence  that  the  estimates  compare relatively  well  for  the  majority  of  composites,  however  they  do highlight 
the smoothing of the interpolation resulting from the OK estimation technique.
Visual Inspection of the Blocks
A  visual  inspection  of  the  block  estimates  and  the  composites  was  completed  to  confirm  the  mathematical 
correlation and ensure that no conditional bias had occurred on a local scale.
Overall Validation
The review of the mathematical comparison indicates that a good  correlation exists, as shown in Table  14-7.  
This  good  correlation  of  the  samples  and  interpolated  block  model  was  further  supported  when  a  visual 
inspection was completed.
As a result of the validation completed RPM believes the estimate is representative of the composites,  and is 
indicative of the known controls of mineralisation and the underlying data.
14.9  Mineral Resource Statement
RPM  has  independently  estimated  the  Mineral  Resources  contained  within  the  Project,  based  on  the  data 
collected  by  the  Company  as  at  31st  January,  2014.    The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  and  underlying  data 
complies  with  the  guidelines  provided  in  the  NI  43-101,  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects,  dated 
June  30,  2011.    Therefore  RPM  believes  it  is  suitable  for  public  reporting.    The  Mineral  Resources  were 
completed by or under the supervision of Mr. Jeremy Clark of RPM and are reported at a 1 g/t Au grade cut-off.  
The results of the resource estimate for the Project are tabulated in Table 14-8.

15  Adjacent Properties
RPM understands that the Project is not surrounded by any adjacent  exploration and mining licences.  There 
are, however, mineral occurrences in the surrounding area.  The region in which the Project is located contains 
iron and other precious metals.
RPM has been unable to verify the information on adjacent properties, and it is not necessarily indicative of the 
mineralisation on the property that is the subject of this Technical Report.

16  Other Relevant Data and Information
RPM  understands  there  is  no  other  relevant  data  and  information  that  is  required  to  be  included  in  this 
Technical Report to ensure it is  not misleading.  However RPM has  present a Risk Summary for the Mineral 
Resource as presented in Section 16.1.
16.1  Project Risk Summary
Mining is  a relatively  high risk  business  when compared  to other  industrial  and  commercial  operations.  Each 
deposit  has  unique  characteristics  and  responses  during  mining  and  processing,  which  can  never  be  wholly 
predicted.  RPM‟s  review  of  the  Project  indicates  risk  profiles  typical  of  mining  projects  at  similar  levels  of 
Resource estimation, mine planning and project development.
RPM has attempted to classify risks associated with the Project. Risks are ranked as  High, Medium or Low, 
and are determined by assessing the perceived consequence of a risk and its likelihood of occurring using the 
following definitions:
Consequence of risk:
  Major:  the  factor  poses  an  immediate  danger  of  a  failure,  which  if  uncorrected,  will  have  a  material 
effect  (>15%  to  20%)  on  the  project  cash  flow  and  performance and  could  potentially  lead  to  project 
failure;
  Moderate:  the  factor,  if  uncorrected,  could  have  a  significant  effect  (10%  to  15%  or  20%)  on  the
project cash flow and performance unless mitigated by some corrective action, and
  Minor:  the  factor,  if  uncorrected,  will  have  little  or  no  effect  (<10%)  on  project  cash  flow  and
performance.
Likelihood of risk occurring within a 7 year timeframe:
  Likely: will probably occur;
  Possible: may occur, and
  Unlikely: unlikely to occur.
The consequence of a risk and its likelihood of occurring are then combined into an overall risk assessment as 
shown in Table 16-1 to determine the overall risk rank.

RPM notes that in most instances it is likely that through enacting controls identified through detailed review of 
the  Project‟s  operation,  existing  documentation  and  additional  technical  studies,  many  of  the  normally 
encountered project risks may be mitigated.
Table 16-2 presents the Project‟s Risk Summary as determined by RPM.

17  Interpretation and Conclusions
The Project represents a large scale gold project with medium to low grades.  No detailed mining studies have 
been completed to date on the Project.
  A Mineral Resource estimate, using an ordinary kriging interpolation method, was completed by  RPM 
of  Beijing,  China.  The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  in  this  Technical  Report  is  reported  using  cut-off 
grades which are deemed appropriate for the style of mineralisation and the likely costs of production.
  RPM  considers  the  estimated  Mineral  Resources  to  be  compliant  with  NI  43-101  Guidelines  for 
Resource  Estimates.  Of  importance  for  mine  planning,  the  model  accommodates  in  situ  and  contact 
dilution but excludes mining dilution. Block size is similar (20 m by 20 m by 5 m) to the expected small-
mining  units  conventionally  used  in  this  type  of  deposit,  and  appropriate  for  the  likely  underground 
mining or open pit mining methods.
  Potential  for  increasing  of  the  Mineral  Resources  is  considered  good,  with  mineralisation  open  down 
dip and along strike, which requires further drilling to investigate the potential. The Project has a large 
resource base of which a large proportion is of Measured and Indicated categories.

18  Recommendations
The  recommendations  are  based  on  observations  made  by  RPM  during  the  completion  of  this  Technical 
Report and review of the associated documentation. These include:

Prior  to  any  further  exploration  works  being  undertaken,  RPM  recommends  that  a  conceptual  mining 
study  be  undertaken  to  determine  the  economic  potential  of  the  Project  within  the  currently  defined 
resource  with  particular  focus  on  the  mining  methods  employed.  This  conceptual  study  will  enable  an 
analysis of the likely areas of profitable economics within the Project as well as identify the potential area 
of  interest  that  should  be  drilled.    Importantly,  a  conceptual  study  will  highlight  the  areas  of  highest 
priority  for  further  exploration,  whether  that  be  infill  drilling  or  extensional  drilling  and  in  addition 
determine the likely mining method which could be successfully employed within the Project.  RPM notes 
that  given  mineralisation  occurs  at  surface  there  is  the  potential  for  open  cut  mining  methods  to  be 
utilised  prior  to  an  underground  method  being  employed.  RPM  estimates  this  study  would  cost 
approximately USD 100K.
  Limited  bulk  density  samples  have  been  measured  for  the  project.  RPM  recommends  all  future 
exploration  work  include  a  systematic  bulk  density  determination.  In addition,  RPM recommends  that 
bulk density be undertaken on the remaining core material from the 2012 and 2013 drilling to enhance 
the  accuracy  of  the  tonnage  estimates  on  a  local  scale.  RPM  considers  the  cost  will  likely  be 
approximately USD 10K to complete an additional 500 determinations.
  RPM  considers  that  the  QA/QC  data  indicates  that  the  primary  laboratory  during  the  2012  and  2013 
drilling programs showed no evidence of systematic bias and the samples taken from these programs 
are  representative.  While  RPM  considers  the  drilling  results  suitable  for  inclusion  in  a  Mineral 
Resource estimate for the classification applied it is recommended that further studies be undertaken 
to  ensure  the  reasonably  high  nugget  does  not  result  in  any  material  bias  during  the  sample 
preparation.  Of  particular  note  is  ensuring  that  crushing  and  grinding  sizes  are  suitable  for  liberating 
the gold whilst no accumulations are occurring which may result in potential bias.  This type of analysis 
is  commonly  undertaken  with  gold  projects  with  high  nugget  to  customize  the  sample  preparation 
techniques. RPM envisages this program will likely cost approximately USD 25K.
  Subsequent to  the  successful  completion of  a conceptual  mining  study  RPM recommends  upgrading 
the existing Inferred mineral resources to Indicated category in areas identified as potentially economic. 
RPM  recommends  the  Client  conduct  infill  drilling  to  50  m  sample  spacing  to  constrain  further  and 
delineate the boundaries of the mineralised lenses. Infill drilling would reduce the inherent uncertainty 
associated  with the geological model, increasing the level  of confidence in the  data  and the resulting 
Mineral  Resource  estimate.  The  cost  associated  with  this  drilling  would  vary  depending  on  the 
outcome and requirements of the next stage of project development however RPM envisages that it is 
likely costs would range from USD 1 million to USD 2 million.
