<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first United 
Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate. The 
original mandate derives from Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 
February 1980, which followed General Assembly resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978, 
in which the Assembly expressed concern at reports from various parts of the world relating 
to enforced disappearances and requested the Commission to consider the question of 
missing or disappeared persons. The mandate was most recently extended by the Human 
Rights Council in its resolution 16/16 of 24 March 2011.  
</p>
<p>2. The primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate 
or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. In this 
humanitarian capacity, the Working Group serves as a channel of communication between 
family members of victims of enforced disappearance and others connected to the 
disappeared person, and Governments. 
</p>
<p>3. Following the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 47/133 and of the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Working 
Group was entrusted to monitor the progress of States in fulfilling their obligations derived 
from the Declaration. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/12, encouraged the 
Working Group to provide assistance in the implementation by States of the Declaration 
and of existing international rules. The year 2012 marked the twentieth anniversary of the 
Declaration. The Working Group held a commemorative event on 30 and 31 October 2012 
with the support of the Organisation International de la Francophonie and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (see also paragraph 14 below). 
</p>
<p>4. The present report reflects the communications and cases examined by the Working 
Group during its three sessions in 2012, covering the period from 12 November 2011 to 9 
November 2012.  
</p>
<p>5. A summary of the activities held during the reporting period is presented in a table 
for each country, with a detailed text description of the areas of activity (see annex I). The 
Working Group regrets that this section, which contains relevant information on enforced 
disappearances around the world, will not be translated. In this respect, the Working Group 
is currently exploring different modalities to report on its activities, which would possibly 
allow their translation in the future. Where there has been no information from the 
Government or the sources, notwithstanding the annual reminder sent by the Working 
Group concerning outstanding cases, a table is provided and a reference is made to the 
previous report dealing with those cases.  
</p>
<p>6. Since its inception, the Working Group has transmitted a total of 53,986 cases to 
Governments. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet been 
clarified, closed or discontinued stands at 42,889 in a total of 84 States. The Working 
Group has been able to clarify 298 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group is concerned that many communications are not still translated 
in time, thus delaying their consideration by the Working Group and limiting its 
humanitarian mandate. The Working Group also regrets that, at the time of approval of the 
present report (November 2012), the previous report of the Working Group had been 
translated into Arabic only.  
</p>
<p>8. The website of the Working Group remains inadequate. The majority of the content 
is in English only. The Working Group once again calls on the United Nations to provide 
adequate resources to bring it up to date and more accessible.  </p>


<p>9. The Working Group is grateful for the additional human resources given to it during 
the reporting period. It notes, however, that, despite the efforts made, a backlog of more 
than 900 cases remains. The Working Group considers that reducing the backlog of cases is 
one of its priorities. Therefore, it is essential that additional support be sustained in the 
future.  
</p>
<p><b> II.  Activities of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances: 12 November 2011 to 9 November 2012  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Sessions, intersessional activities of the members and other events  
</b></p>
<p>10. During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions: the ninety-
sixth session, from 12 to 16 March 2012; the ninety-seventh session, from 9 to 13 July 
2012; and the ninety-eighth session, from 31 October to 9 November 2012. All sessions 
were held in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>11. The post of Chairperson- Rapporteur of the Working Group was held by Jeremy 
Sarkin until 11 March 2012. As from 12 March 2012, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group is Olivier de Frouville. The other members are Ariel Dulitzky, Jasminka 
Dzumhur, Osman El-Hajj&#233; and Jeremy Sarkin. 
</p>
<p>12. On 5 March 2012, the Chairperson-Rapporteur presented the annual report of the 
Working Group for 2011 to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session, and 
participated in the interactive dialogue with Member States.  
</p>
<p>13. On 25 October 2012, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group addressed 
the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and participated in the interactive 
dialogue with Member States.  
</p>
<p>14. On 30 and 31 October 2012, the Working Group held an event in Geneva to mark 
the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. On 30 October, a one-day thematic discussion was devoted to the theme 
&#8213;Exploring best practices and challenges to protect women from enforced disappearance 
and its impact&#8214;, followed by, on 31 October, a half-day open dialogue between the Working 
Group and representatives of States. The first day of the event focused on the impact of 
enforced disappearances on women as well as on the role of women as actors of change. 
Participants highlighted the socioeconomic and other consequences of enforced 
disappearances on women, as well as the gender-specific vulnerabilities of women during 
enforced disappearances. Women relatives of victims gave their testimonies and spoke of 
their role at the forefront of the struggle against enforced disappearances, while 
highlighting the difficulties encountered in their activities aimed at realizing the right to 
truth and justice. The second day of the event was devoted to an open dialogue between the 
Working Group and the States concerning the challenges and best practices in the 
implementation of the Declaration in the area of prevention, justice, truth and reparation for 
victims of enforced disappearance. The members of the Working Group introduced each 
topic of discussion, which was followed by an interactive dialogue with Member States. 
Various issues were highlighted, including the need to develop a comprehensive strategy to 
protect witnesses and relatives of the disappeared; the obligation of the States to include an 
autonomous crime of enforced disappearance in their criminal codes; the importance of 
developing gender-sensitive reparation measures; and the need to conceive the right to the 
truth as an absolute right. </p>


<p>15. During the reporting period, all the members of the Working Group carried out a 
number of activities connected to enforced disappearances, which included their 
participation in seminars, training events, workshops and lectures.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the period under review, representatives of the Governments of Algeria, the 
Gambia, Guatemala, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Japan, Morocco, Namibia, Pakistan, the 
Republic of Korea, Serbia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Togo attended the sessions of 
the Working Group. A number of other informal meetings were held with various States 
during the year. The Working Group also met with the Committee on Enforced 
Disappearances, representatives of international governmental organizations, human rights 
non-governmental organizations and associations of relatives of disappeared persons and 
families of victims of enforced disappearances or witnesses thereto.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  Communications  
</b></p>
<p>17. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 208 new cases of 
enforced disappearance to 21 States.  
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group transmitted 59 of the above-mentioned cases under the urgent-
action procedure to Algeria, Bangladesh, the Central African Republic, Mauritania, 
Mexico, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Ukraine and 
Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>19. During the same period, the Working Group clarified 74 cases, in Algeria, 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Morocco, Myanmar, Pakistan, Spain, the 
Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan and Uruguay. Of the 74 cases, 61 were clarified on the 
basis of information provided by Governments, and 13 on the basis of information provided 
by sources. 
</p>
<p>20. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 10 prompt-intervention 
communications addressing harassment of and threats to human rights defenders and 
relatives of disappeared persons in Algeria, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Sri 
Lanka and Turkey. All were sent as joint communications with other special procedures 
mandates. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group transmitted 16 urgent appeals concerning persons who had been 
arrested, detained, abducted or otherwise deprived of their liberty or who had been forcibly 
disappeared or were at risk of disappearance in Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Mali, Mexico, the Syrian Arab Republic, 
the United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe. All communications were sent jointly with other 
special procedures mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>22. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted three general 
allegations, to the Governments of Eritrea, of Lithuania and of the Philippines,1 and adopted 
a general allegation on Thailand. The Working Group also transmitted, jointly with other 
special procedures mechanisms, two general allegations to the Democratic People&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea and Colombia (see also annex I). 
</p>
<p>  
 1 As indicated in the previous annual report (see A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1, para. 22), summaries of the three 
</p>
<p>general allegations, which were considered by the Working Group at its ninety-fifth session, are 
included in annex I. </p>


<p><b> D.  Country visits  
</b></p>
<p>23. At the invitation of the Governments, the Working Group visited Chile and Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group, represented by Ariel Dulitzky and Jasminka Dzumhur, visited 
Chile from 13 to 21 August 2012. The purpose of the visit was to examine the main 
initiatives and policies undertaken by Chile relating to enforced or involuntary 
disappearances in the context of the human rights violations in the past. The experts also 
analysed the development of investigations and judicial proceedings relating to cases of 
enforced disappearance, as well as issues relating to truth, justice and reparation for the 
victims of enforced disappearance. The report on the visit to Chile is contained in an 
addendum to the present report (A/HRC/22/45/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group, represented by Olivier de Frouville and Osman El-Hajj&#233;, 
visited Pakistan from 10 to 20 September 2012. The purpose of the visit was to gather 
information on cases of enforced disappearances, as well as to study the measures taken by 
the State to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances, including issues relating to 
truth, justice and reparation for the victims of enforced disappearance. The report on the 
visit to Pakistan is contained in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/22/45/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>26. During the reporting period, the Working Group reiterated its request for visits to 
Algeria, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), the Russian Federation, Sri 
Lanka, Thailand and Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>27. During the reporting period, the Working Group also requested visits to Libya and 
Spain. The Government of Libya accepted the request of the Working Group to visit the 
country in the first half of 2013. The Government of Spain accepted the request of the 
Working Group to visit the country in the second half of 2013. 
</p>
<p>28. During the reporting period, the Government of Kyrgyzstan invited the Working 
Group to undertake a visit in 2013. The Working Group thanks the States that have 
extended invitations to visit their countries.  
</p>
<p>29. The Working Group has requested a visit to the following countries, without having 
yet received a positive response: Belarus, Burundi, Croatia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, 
Montenegro, Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, South Sudan, Sri 
Lanka, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe. The 
Working Group invites all States that have received a request for a visit by the Working 
Group to respond favourably to it, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
21/4.  
</p>
<p>30. In this regard, the Working Group would like to recall the fact that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working Group in 2004, which was delayed at the 
request of the Government. The Working Group calls upon the Government to set the dates 
for the visit.  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Follow-up reports 
</b></p>
<p>31. During the reporting period, the Working Group prepared follow-up reports on the 
implementation of recommendations made following its visits to El Salvador and Morocco. 
The follow-up reports are contained in an addendum to the present report 
(A/HRC/22/45/Add.3).  </p>


<p><b> F.  Press releases and statements 
</b></p>
<p>32. On 11 November 2011, the Working Group, jointly with the Committee on Enforced 
Disappearances, issued a press release on the occasion of the first meeting between the two 
bodies held on Wednesday 8 November 2011.2 
</p>
<p>33. On 30 August 2012, the Working Group and the Committee on Enforced 
Disappearances issued a joint statement to mark the second International Day of the 
Victims of Enforced Disappearances. The Working Group observed that, while 20 years 
had passed since the adoption of the Declaration, the practice of enforced disappearance 
was still used in certain countries to repress individuals and to intimidate people claiming 
their rights. The experts also observed that, in other countries, situations of the past had not 
been dealt with in an appropriate manner, and emphasized that all families of the 
disappeared, even though those disappearances occurred decades before, should enjoy the 
right to the truth, the right to justice and the right to reparation.3 
</p>
<p>34. On 25 October 2012, on the occasion of the address made by the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group to the General Assembly, a press release, jointly with the 
Chairperson of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, was issued.4  
</p>
<p>35. On 8 November 2012, the Working Group issued a joint statement with the 
Committee on Enforced Disappearances on their meeting held on 1 November 2012. At 
that meeting, the members of the two United Nations bodies working on the issue of 
enforced disappearance exchanged information on their respective activities and discussed 
the coordination of common initiatives. The Working Group and the Committee reaffirmed 
their commitment to cooperate and coordinate in the discharge of their respective mandates. 
They agreed on the principle of sharing information on a permanent basis. They held 
discussions on the complementarity of their procedures, on the interpretation of 
international law in the field of enforced disappearances and on country visits. The two 
bodies recalled that coordination and coherence were essential to guarantee the effective 
protection of victims of enforced disappearances, and that the Working Group and the 
Committee acted in a complementary and mutually reinforcing way to prevent and combat 
the heinous crime of enforced disappearance5. 
</p>
<p>36. During the reporting period, the Working Group also issued press releases 
concerning China, Colombia, Mexico and Spain.  
</p>
<p>37. On 23 December 2011, the Working Group, jointly with three other special 
procedures mechanisms, issued a press release concerning the alleged continued secret 
detention of Gao Zhisheng, a prominent human rights lawyer who was reportedly arrested 
in 2006 in relation to his work advocating against human rights violations in China. Mr. 
Gao was allegedly charged with subversion of State power, although this was never proven 
in a court of law. At the time when the press release was issued, Mr. Gao&#8216;s whereabouts 
</p>
<p>had been unknown for 20 months6. 
</p>
<p>38. On 8 February 2012, the Working Group, together with another mandate holder, 
issued a press release concerning the trial of Judge Baltasar Garz&#243;n in Spain and its effects 
on the process to investigate and deal with more than 100,000 cases of enforced 
disappearances that reportedly occurred during the Spanish civil war and under the Franco

<p>regime. The Working Group emphasized that an investigation should be conducted for as 
long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified, and that no 
amnesty law should bring an end to a State&#8216;s obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish 
those responsible for disappearances7. 
</p>
<p>39. On 14 March 2012, the Working Group issued a press release on the occasion of the 
presentation of the report on its visit to Mexico (A/HRC/19/58/Add.2). The experts, while 
recognizing the challenges posed by the complex public security situation in the context of 
the fight against crime, emphasized that there a chronic pattern of impunity was 
demonstrated by the absence of effective investigations in cases of enforced 
disappearances8. 
</p>
<p>40. On 21 August 2012, the Working Group issued a press release at the end of its 
official visit to Chile.9 
</p>
<p>41. On 20 September 2012, the Working Group issued a press release at the end of its 
official visit to Pakistan.10 
</p>
<p>42. On 22 October 2012, the Working Group, together with 10 other special procedures 
mechanisms, issued a joint press release on the proposed reform of political Constitution of 
Colombia with regard to military criminal law, expressing concern that the proposal could 
have serious implications for the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights in 
Colombia. Although the proposed reform would reportedly exclude the crimes of genocide, 
crimes against humanity and enforced disappearance from the jurisdiction of military and 
police tribunals, it could also expand the jurisdiction of these tribunals, giving them the 
power to investigate, process and decide on cases of other serious human rights violations, 
as well as crimes committed by private security forces, which should be under the authority 
of the ordinary criminal justice system and courts11.  
</p>
<p>43. Reference to the above-mentioned press releases may be also found in the relevant 
country sections of the present report (see annex I).  
</p>
<p>44. Media advisories and press releases were issued at the beginning and the end of each 
of the three sessions of the Working Group during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b> G.  General comments  
</b></p>
<p>45. In 2012, the Working Group finalized two general comments on children and 
enforced disappearance and women affected by enforced disappearances, which were 
adopted by the Working Group at its ninety-eighth session.  
</p>
<p><b> III.  Reparations and enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>46. As of the current year, the Working Group has decided to include a thematic section 
in its annual reports. Taking into account the time elapsed since its general comment on 
article 19 of the Declaration (1997) and the new developments in international law, the 
Working Group has chosen to devote the thematic section of the present report to the issue 
of reparation for victims of enforced disappearance.

<p>47. Article 19 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance provides that &#8213;the victims of acts of enforced disappearance and their family 
shall obtain redress and shall have the right to adequate compensation, including the means 
for as complete a rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result 
of an act of enforced disappearance, their dependents shall also be entitled to 
compensation&#8214;.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Definition of reparation 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Working Group considers that the term &#8213;redress&#8214; in article 19 of the Declaration 
is meant to include essentially the concept of &#8213;reparation&#8214;, even though it encompasses that 
of &#8213;effective remedy&#8214; as well.12 The right to reparations is a well-established and basic 
human right, which is enshrined in universal and regional human rights treaties as well as in 
other international instruments.13 The Working Group considers that the scope of the right 
to reparation in customary law has been evolving over recent decades.  
</p>
<p>49. For the first time in international law, the right to reparation for acts of enforced 
disappearance has been enshrined in an international legally binding instrument, namely, 
the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance.14 Paragraph 5 of article 24 of the Convention specifies that the right to 
obtain reparation covers both material and moral damages and, where appropriate, other 
forms of reparation such as restitution, rehabilitation, satisfaction (including restitution of 
dignity and reputation), and guarantees of non-repetition.15  
</p>
<p><b> 1. </b>Reparation as a consequence of the violation of the victim&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Working Group notes that, in practice, measures intended to help relatives to 
cope with the consequences of the absence of the disappeared person are assimilated to 
measures of reparation. Everyone has the right to social security and the State has the duty 
to provide the family with the widest possible protection. Measures that provide for social 
assistance do not, however, prejudice the obligation of the State to provide reparation to 
victims as a consequence of the violation of their rights.16 In addition, social allowances 
and/or measures of reparation should not be made conditional on the requirement that the 
relatives of the disappeared person produce a death certificate.17 In its general comments on 
article 19 of the Declaration, the Working Group made it clear that, &#8213;as a general principle,

</i></p>

</p>
<p> 14 Art. 24, para. 4: &#8213;Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victims of enforced 
disappearance have the right to obtain reparation and prompt, fair and adequate compensation.&#8214; 
</p>
<p> 15 The jurisprudence of regional human rights courts, and notably the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights, has been instrumental in the interpretation and development of the right to reparation. The 
Court has by far the most developed and creative jurisprudence with regard to asserting victims&#8216; right 
to reparation. 
</p>
<p> 16 The Working Group, in paragraph 9 of its general comment on the right to recognition as a person 
before the law in the context of enforced disappearances, stated that the acceptance of financial 
support for members of the families should not be considered a waiver of the right to integral 
reparation for the damage caused by the crime of enforced disappearance, in accordance with article 
19 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> 17 A/HRC/16/48/Add.1, para. 46. </p>


<p>no victim of enforced disappearance shall be presumed dead over the objections of the 
family.&#8214;18 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Definition of those with the right to obtain reparation 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Working Group does not differentiate between direct and indirect victims, but 
rather considers that both the disappeared person and those who have suffered harm as a 
result of the disappearance are to be considered victims of the enforced disappearance and 
are therefore entitled to obtain reparation.19 For the purposes of reparation, a broad 
definition of the victim, not linked to the establishment of the criminal liability and 
conviction of the accused, should be adopted.20 </p>
<p>52. The Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law21 define victims as persons who individually or 
collectively suffered harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, 
economic loss or substantial impairment of their fundamental rights, through acts or 
omissions that constitute gross violations of international human rights law, or serious 
violations of international humanitarian law. Where appropriate, and in accordance with 
domestic law, the term &#8213;victim&#8214; also includes the immediate family or dependants of the 
</p>
<p>direct victim and persons who have suffered harm in intervening to assist victims in distress 
or to prevent victimization<b> </b>. </p>
<p><b> B. Forms of reparation in cases of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Working Group noted that, in a number of countries, reparation was interpreted 
exclusively in the form of compensation, namely, as a sum of money intended to 
compensate all forms of damages caused to victims.The Working Group has already 
explained, in its general comments on article 19 of the Declaration, however, that the 
obligation to provide redress to victims of enforced disappearances is not limited to the 
right to monetary compensation, but includes, inter alia, medical and psychological care 
and rehabilitation for any form of physical or mental damage as well as legal and social 
rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition, restoration of personal liberty and similar forms 
of restitution, satisfaction and reparation that may remove the consequences of the enforced 
disappearance.22 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group generally recommends the establishment of a national 
programme on reparations that includes compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, 
satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition for all victims of human rights violations, 
including enforced disappearances.23<b> </b>The Working Group also emphasizes that, within the 
scope of the right to reparation in the case of enforced disappearance, the family of the 
disappeared person has an imprescriptible right to be informed of the fate and/or 
</p>
<p>  
 18 E/CN.4/1998/43, para. 74. 
 19 See A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1, para. 58. Article 24, paragraph 1 of the Convention stipulates that the term 
</p>
<p>&#8213;victim&#8214; denotes &#8213;the disappeared person and any individual who has suffered harm as the direct 
result of an enforced disappearance&#8214;.  
</p>
<p> 20 See A/HRC/19/58/Add.2, para. 109.   
 21 General Assembly resolution 60/147, annex.<b>  </b> 
 22 E/CN.4/1998/43, para. 75. 
 23 See A/HRC/19/58/Add.1, para.79(b) and A/HRC/16/48/Add.1, para. 84(d). See also principle 18 of 
</p>
<p>the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross 
Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian 
Law.  </p>


<p>whereabouts of the disappeared person and, in the event of decease, that person&#8216;s body 
must be returned to the family as soon as it has been identified, regardless of whether the 
perpetrators have been identified or prosecuted.24 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Restitution 
</b></p>
<p>55. Restitution is the act of restoring the victim, to the extent possible, to the original 
situation before the violation was committed. In the case of enforced disappearance, these 
measures include recovery of identity,25 restoration of liberty or return to one&#8216;s place of 
residence. The Working Group underlines that, as full restitution is normally not possible in 
the case of enforced disappearance owing to the irreversible nature of the harm suffered, 
other forms of reparation, such as compensation and rehabilitation, should complement 
restitution. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that, even when restitution is possible, 
reparation measures to return the victim to the status quo ante may need to remedy and 
address prior situations of discrimination and/or vulnerability.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Working Group emphasizes that financial compensation is not sufficient in 
itself and should be normally associated with other forms of reparation.26 The Basic 
Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross 
Violations of International Human Rights Law provide that compensation should be 
provided for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and proportional to the 
gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case, resulting from gross violations 
of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law. 
Principle 20 also provides a list of what may be considered economically assessable 
damage: (a) physical or mental harm; (b) lost opportunities, including employment, 
education and social benefits; (c) material damages and loss of earnings, including loss of 
earning potential; (d) moral damage; or (e) costs required for legal or expert assistance, 
medicine and medical services, and psychological and social services. 
</p>
<p>57. Compensation is an important element of the right to an effective remedy, 
particularly when restoring the victim to the situation ex ante is not possible, as is 
frequently the case in many international crimes, including enforced disappearance. The 
Working Group emphasizes that compensation should be full and &#8213;adequate&#8214;, namely, 
proportionate to the gravity of the human rights violation (such as the period of 
disappearance or the conditions of detention) and to the suffering of the victim and the 
family.27 
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group also emphasizes that monetary compensation should be applied 
in a broad sense and must be given for any damage resulting from an enforced 
disappearance, such as physical or mental harm,28 lost opportunities,29 material damages 
</p>
<p>  
 24 See E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1, principle 34.   
 25 See Inter-American Court of Human Rights , <i>Case of Contreras et al. v. El Salvador</i>, judgement of 31 
</p>
<p>August 2011 (available from www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_232_ing.pdf), para. 193.  
 26 See A/HRC/19/58/Add.3, para. 54. The Working Group previously examined the issue of 
</p>
<p>compensation for victims of enforced disappearances in its annual report for 1997 (E/CN.4/1998/43). 
In preparing that report, the Working Group wrote to countries with more than 20 outstanding cases 
to seek information on each country&#8216;s practice in this regard.  
</p>
<p> 27 A/HRC/16/48/Add.1, para. 45.   
 28 The concept of non-pecuniary damages was developed by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>to include &#8213;both the suffering and distress caused to the direct victims and their next of kin, and the 
impairment of values that are highly significant to the individual, as well as other changes of a non-
pecuniary nature in the living conditions of the victims or their next of kin&#8214;. See <i>Contreras et al. v. El 
</i></p>
<p> </p>


<p>and loss of earnings, harm to reputation and costs required for legal or expert assistance.30 
The Working Group further emphasizes the fact that, as civil responsibility of the State is 
generated by the seriousness of the crime of enforced disappearance, the passing of time 
should not be an obstacle for the progress of civil demands through the application of 
statutes of limitation.31 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Rehabilitation 
</b></p>
<p>59. Rehabilitation is an essential component of reparation. Article 19 of the Declaration 
refers to a &#8213;as complete a rehabilitation as possible&#8214; for the victims of acts of enforced 
disappearance and their family. Rehabilitation measures and programmes should be 
established and be easily accessible for victims and their families.  
</p>
<p>60. The Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law provide that &#8213;rehabilitation should include medical and 
psychological care as well as legal and social services&#8214;.32 The particular circumstances and 
needs of each victim must be taken into account when providing psychological or 
psychiatric treatment. The treatment may be individual, collective or a family one.33  
</p>
<p>61. The Working Group also emphasizes that measures should be taken to ensure that 
members of families of disappeared persons are entitled to social benefits and other 
measures of social support irrespective of where they live, including health care, special 
education programmes and psychological assistance.34  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition 
</b></p>
<p>62. Of the above-mentioned Basic Principles and Guidelines, principle 22, on measures 
of satisfaction, makes specific reference to a measure relating to enforced disappearance, 
namely, &#8213;the search for the whereabouts of the disappeared, for the identities of the children 
abducted, and for the bodies of those killed, and assistance in the recovery, identification 
and reburial of the bodies in accordance with the expressed or presumed wish of the 
victims, or the cultural practices of the families and communities&#8214;. The Working Group 
emphasizes that the search for the truth, including the obligation to investigate the facts and 
to identify, prosecute and, where appropriate, punish those responsible, is also a form of 
satisfaction for the victims.35 It also emphasizes that procedural rights to an investigation, to

</p>
<p> 29 See for example Inter-American Court of Human Rights <i>Case of Gelman v. Uruguay</i>, judgement of 
24 February 2011, para. 293, where the Court recognized the loss of income of the victim, who was 
only 19 years old at the time of her disappearance and a university student.   
</p>

 31 A/HRC/22/45/Add.1, para. 47.    
 32 Principle 21. In the <i>Barrios Altos case</i> (<i>Chumbipuma Aguirre et al. v. Peru)</i>, 2001, para. 40, the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Court of Human Rights approved the agreement signed by the State and the victims 
wherein the State recognized its obligation to provide &#8213;diagnostic procedures, medicines, specialized 
aid, hospitalisation, surgeries, labouring, traumatic rehabilitation and mental health.&#8214; 
</p>
<p> 33 See <i>Contreras et Al. v. El Salvador</i> (see footnote 25), para. 200. 
 34 A/HRC/16/48/Add.1, para. 84 (c).  
 35 See for example A/HRC/16/48/Add.2, para. 8. Principle 4 of the Updated set of principles for the 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity 
(E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1) states that &#8213;Irrespective of any legal proceedings, victims and their families 
have the imprescriptible right to know the truth about the circumstances in which violations took 
place and, in the event of death or disappearance, the victims&#8216; fate&#8214;. </p>


<p>truth and to justice are equally central to victims&#8216; perceptions of reparation. Indeed, in some 
</p>
<p>instances, the truth and justice process may in itself constitute a form of reparation.  
</p>
<p>63. Other forms of satisfaction for victims of enforced disappearance and their families 
include a judicial decision36 or an official declaration restoring the dignity, the reputation 
and the rights of the victim and of persons closely connected with the victim; a public 
apology, including acknowledgement of the facts and acceptance of responsibility, for 
instance through a public ceremony or act; and commemorations and tributes to the victims. 
Specific measures relating to enforced disappearance may include the creation of 
specialized units to carry out the investigation of complaints of serious human rights 
violations, including enforced disappearances; the elaboration of a protocol for the 
collection and identification of the bodily remains; the creation of psychosocial assistance 
programme for individuals who are found and their relatives, and for the relatives of those 
who remain disappeared; and public access to State files and archives containing relevant 
information.37  
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group considers that the establishment of memorial sites and 
monuments contributes to the collective social recognition of violations that have occurred, 
as well as to the rejection and repudiation of these violations which could also serve as a 
preventive measure.38 The Working Group emphasizes that States should adopt a 
comprehensive legal framework for reparation programmes, including the issue of 
memorials, with a view to avoiding re-victimization and further violations of the right to 
dignity. Legislation should set out the criteria and the process for the establishment of such 
memorials, taking into account the potential controversies that may arise out of conflicting 
memories from different groups in society.39 The establishment and maintenance of 
memorial sites is a responsibility of the State, with the close participation of the relatives of 
the disappeared and other parties concerned.40 
</p><p>65. With regard to guarantees of non-repetition, there are measures that should be taken 
to prevent future recurrence of enforced disappearances. Principle 23 (e) of the above-
mentioned Basic Principles and Guidelines refers to various possible guarantees of non-
repetition, such as providing, on a priority and continued basis, human rights and 
international humanitarian law education to all sectors of society and training for law 
enforcement officials as well as military and security forces; promoting mechanisms for 
preventing and monitoring social conflicts and their resolution; and reviewing and 
reforming laws contributing to or allowing gross violations of international human rights 
law and serious violations of international humanitarian law.41 The introduction of specific 
</p>
<p>  
 36 In the case of judicial decisions, the publication and dissemination of the judgement is also considered 
</p>
<p>a form of satisfaction.  
 37 See <i>Contreras et al. v. El Salvador</i> (see footnote 25), paras. 211-214; and <i>Case of Gelman v.Uruguay</i> 
</p>
<p>(footnote 29), paras. 272-282. 
 38 See A/HRC/19/58/Add.3, para. 101 (c); E/CN.4/2006/56/Add.1, para. 115; and A/HRC/10/9/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>para. 65.  
 39 See also A/HRC/16/48/Add.1, paras. 48 and 84 (g).   
 40 In Chile, for instance, while the State has supported the construction and maintenance of several 
</p>
<p>memorials and the development of cultural acts of various kinds, the increasing construction and 
maintenance of memorials aimed at the preservation of historic memory has been essentially the 
product of civil society initiatives, mainly of organizations of relatives of victims, not of a policy 
initiated by the State. See A/HRC/22/45/Add.1, para.50. 
</p>
<p> 41 Other guarantees mentioned in principle 23 are: (a) Ensuring effective civilian control of military and 
security forces; (b) Ensuring that all civilian and military proceedings abide by international standards 
of due process, fairness and impartiality; (c) Strengthening the independence of the judiciary; (d) 
Protecting persons in the legal, medical and health-care professions, the media and other related 
professions, and human rights defenders; (f) Promoting the observance of codes of conduct and 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>protocols and safeguards and the promotion of judicial or security sector reforms are other 
important measures of non-repetition. The Working Group further emphasizes that the full 
realization of the right to truth and justice are essential elements to ensure non-repetition. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Individual and collective reparations 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Working Group welcomes the growing recognition in international human 
rights law that reparations may be awarded on both an individual and a collective basis.42 
Individual and collective reparations may be granted concurrently and they do not exclude 
each other, given that both their essence and purpose are different.43 Collective reparations 
respond to collective harm or harm to society as a whole. Public apology or acceptance of 
responsibility as well as the construction of monuments or memorials for victims of 
enforced disappearances are possible forms of collective reparation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Gender perspective and culturally sensitive reparations 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Working Group emphasizes that both a gender-sensitive as well as culturally-
sensitive approach should be taken in the determination of the forms and modalities of 
reparations.44 The Nairobi Declaration on Women&#8216;s and Girls&#8216; Right to a Remedy and 
Reparation45 in particular provides gender specific considerations with respect to the 
formulation and implementation of reparations, emphasizing additional aspects of 
importance of the process of obtaining reparations, including removing possible barriers for 
them to claim their rights and to access to justice. The Declaration highlights the 
fundamental importance of a consultative process, which empowers women themselves to 
determine what forms of reparation are best suited to their situation. Special measures 
should be taken to empower women and enable their participation in all stages of the 
reparation process affecting them. The Working Group also emphasizes that reparation 
measures need to take into account many factors, in particular the victims&#8216; perspective and 
the circumstances of the case, given that what might be an appropriate reparation measure 
in one case may be inappropriate or even counterproductive in another.  
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group further stresses that access to reparation must be ensured in a 
culturally sensitive manner. Information on reparation processes and measures should be 
facilitated in local languages, if necessary, and the design of reparation plans or 
mechanisms should be designed with the participation of the communities affected, taking 
into account their needs. The Working Group also emphasizes that the provision of social 
services for victims should not be confused with their right to obtain reparation.

<p><b> VI.  Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In 2012, the Working Group transmitted 208 newly reported cases of 
disappearance to 21 States. It used the urgent action procedure in 59 of these cases, </b></p>


<p><b>which allegedly occurred within the three months preceding the receipt of the report 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Working Group. During the reporting period, the Working Group was able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>clarify 74 cases of enforced disappearance.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>More than 40,000 cases still remain unclarified by the Working Group, many 
dating back decades. In spite of this large number, underreporting remains a major 
</b></p>
<p><b>problem, and is due to various reasons, including fear of reprisals, weak 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration of justice, ineffectual reporting channels, institutionalized systems of 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity, poverty, illiteracy, language barriers, a practice of silence and restrictions 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the work of civil society. More assistance should be provided to family members 
</b></p>
<p><b>and members of civil society to enable them to report cases to the Working Group.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group continues to note a pattern of threats, intimidation and 
reprisals against victims of enforced disappearance, including family members, 
</b></p>
<p><b>witnesses and human rights defenders working on such cases. The Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>calls upon States to take specific measures to prevent such acts, protect those working 
</b></p>
<p><b>on cases of enforced disappearances and punish the perpetrators, in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>article 13, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Declaration</b> <b>on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. Measures should be taken by the Human Rights Council to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure a more systematic reaction to counter reprisals against persons who cooperate 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the United Nations. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Working Group is grateful for the cooperation received from a number of 
States; such cooperation is indispensable for discovering the fate or whereabouts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappeared persons around the globe. Nevertheless, the Working Group remains 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned that, of the 84 States with outstanding cases, some have never replied to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group,and some provide responses that do not contain relevant information. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group urges all States to fulfil their obligations under the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Country visits are an integral part of the mandate fulfilled the Working Group. 
They allow the Working Group to highlight country practices in addressing enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances, to assist States in reducing obstacles to implement the Declaration, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to ensure direct contact with the family members of victims. There are, however, 
</b></p>
<p><b>a number of States from which the Working Group has requested invitations to visit, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which have not been forthcoming. There are others that have informally invited 
</b></p>
<p><b>and/or confirmed invitations, but for which specific dates to visit have not been 
</b></p>
<p><b>agreed. The Working Group therefore calls upon all States with pending requests for 
</b></p>
<p><b>visits to respond favourably to them in the light of Human Rights Council resolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>21/4, and those that have agreed to visits to respond as soon as possible with specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>dates.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group once again calls upon Governments that have not signed 
and/or ratified the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from 
</b></p>
<p><b>Enforced Disappearance to do so as soon as possible and to accept the competence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Committee on Enforced Disappearances to receive individual cases, under article 
</b></p>
<p><b>31, and inter-State complaints under article 32 of the Convention.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Working Group is grateful to the Governments of Argentina and of France 
for their financial and human resource contributions, which allowed the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group to have enhanced support. The Working Group reminds the United Nations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the limited regular budget made available to it and calls on all States for greater 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance to allow it to accomplish its mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Working Group is concerned that many communications are not still 
translated in time, thus delaying their consideration by the Working Group and 
</b></p>
<p><b>limiting its humanitarian mandate. The Working Group also regrets that, at the time </b></p>


<p><b>of approval of the present report (November 2012), the report for 2011 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group (A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1) had been translated into Arabic only. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Reparations and enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Working Group emphasizes that victims of enforced disappearances have 
the right to reparation. The concept of reparation for enforced disappearance entails 
</b></p>
<p><b>restitution, rehabilitation, compensation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>repetition. The Working Group recommends that Member States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that victims of enforced disappearance have the right to obtain 
</b></p>
<p><b>reparation and prompt, fair and adequate compensation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Make provisions in their legal systems for victims of enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearance or their families to seek fair, prompt and adequate reparation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Adopt, for the purpose of reparation, a broad definition of victim that 
</b></p>
<p><b>includes all those who have suffered harm as a result of a disappearance; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Guarantee the right to truth and justice as an essential elements to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure non-repetition; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that both individual and collective reparations may be granted, 
</b></p>
<p><b>given that they have different purposes and not are not mutually exclusive; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Adopt a gender-sensitive approach to the formulation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of reparation programmes, and ensure the participation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>empowerment of women to determine themselves the forms of reparation best suited 
</b></p>
<p><b>to their situation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Provide for specific reparation measures in cases of enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances, including the adoption of a national plan for searching for 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappeared persons; the creation of specialized units to investigate cases of enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearance; the elaboration of a protocol for the collection and identification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodily remains; the creation of a psychosocial assistance programme for individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>who are found and their relatives, and for the relatives of those who remain 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappeared; public access to State files and archives containing relevant information; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the provision of human rights education and training to law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as military and security forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Consider symbolic measures, such as memorial sites and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commemorative acts, recognizing the suffering of victims and restoring their dignity 
</b></p>
<p><b>and reputation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Strengthen prevention measures as a form of reparation, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption of effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>punish and eradicate acts of enforced disappearance. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Protection of All 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
was the first instrument to characterize all acts of enforced disappearance of persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>as </b>&#8220;<b>very serious offences</b>&#8221;<b> and to set forth standards designed to punish and prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>their commission. The General Assembly stated 20 years ago, when adopting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration, </b>that it was &#8220;<b>deeply concerned that, in many countries, often in a </b></p>


<p>persistent manner, enforced disappearances occur&#8221;. The Working Group regrets <b>the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fact that, 20 years later, the practice of enforced disappearance persists in many 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries, notably in situations of conflict or internal unrest or as a tool to fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism or organized crime. The Working Group recalls in this respect article 7 of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Declaration, which provides that no circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat 
</b></p>
<p><b>of war, a state of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may 
</b></p>
<p><b>be invoked to justify enforced disappearances.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Working Group recommends that States focus more on measures 
preventing enforced disappearances, including by keeping accessible and updated 
</b></p>
<p><b>registries of detainees at all places of deprivation of liberty; guaranteeing access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate information and to all such places for relatives, as well as lawyers; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>bringing arrested persons promptly before a judicial authority. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>On its twentieth anniversary, the Working Group calls on all States to renew 
their commitment to the principles of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>from Enforced Disappearance and, in </b>particular to reaffirm strongly that &#8220;any act of 
</p>
<p><b>enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity. It is condemned as a denial of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and as a grave and flagrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal 
</b></p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights&#8221;. <b>The Working Group encourages all States and civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society to translate the Declaration into all languages and dialects, with no distinction, 
</b></p>
<p><b>since all serve the purpose to assist in its global dissemination and the ultimate goal of 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Over the years, the families of disappeared persons have brought to the 
attention of the international community the extent of this odious crime. It was largely 
</b></p>
<p><b>thanks to their efforts that the International Convention for the Protection of All 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons from Enforced Disappearance entered into force on 23 December 2010. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Following the entry into force of the Convention, the Committee on Enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>Disappearances was established. Like for many other thematic human rights issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as torture, racial discrimination, discrimination against women, the rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>child and a series of civil, cultural, economic, political, social rights, the Committee 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Working Group coexist side by side, cooperating in the fight to prevent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>eradicate enforced disappearances wherever they occur around the world. In the same 
</b></p>
<p><b>vein, the Declaration and the Convention reinforce each other to create a more 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective legal framework to confront the practice of enforced disappearance.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Working Group thanks those States that regularly cooperate with it and 
recalls that it stands ready to provide appropriate assistance to all States in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Women affected by enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>At its ninety-eight session, the Working Group adopted a general comment on 
women affected by enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Working Group emphasizes that, when dealing with cases of enforced 
disappearance, States should ensure a gender perspective in all measures taken, 
</b></p>
<p><b>whether they be legislative, administrative, judicial or otherwise. Gender equality in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the area of enforced disappearances requires primarily that all individuals, regardless 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their sex or gender, enjoy without discrimination the rights enshrined in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Working Group recognizes that women play a fundamental role in 
securing and advancing the rights of disappeared persons. In particular, from its </b></p>


<p><b>experience, the Working Group recognizes that women are often at the forefront of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the struggle against enforced disappearances. They often form organizations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations seeking to establish the circumstances of enforced disappearances and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fate of disappeared persons, and to assist victims themselves.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Women and girls are often affected by enforced disappearances as disappeared 
persons, but also as relatives or as persons suffering harm as a result of an enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearance. The effects of enforced disappearances are endured in different ways 
</b></p>
<p><b>by them all because of gender roles, which are deeply embedded in history, tradition, 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion and culture. Gender equality and the empowerment of women are essential 
</b></p>
<p><b>tools to addressing the situation women victims of enforced disappearance face. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to prevent and eradicate effectively the enforced disappearances of women, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group recognizes the importance of States developing a comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>national policy from a gender perspective on the basis of the principles of gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>mainstreaming. The Working Group encourages States to use the general comment on 
</b></p>
<p><b>women affected by enforced disappearances as a tool to provide gender equality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>empowerment of women. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Children and enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>In 2012, the Working Group adopted a general comment on children and 
enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The enforced disappearance of a child constitutes an exacerbation of the 
violation of the multiplicity of rights protected by the Declaration on the Protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and an extreme form of violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>children.</b>46<b> 
</b></p>
<p>91. Children&#8217;s evolving stages of physical and mental maturity, as well a<b>s their 
reliance on adults, places them in a situation of particular vulnerability. As such, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific nature of the violation of rights and the specific obligations of the State in 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases of child victims of enforced disappearance must be properly understood and 
</b></p>
<p><b>underscored.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Working Group recognizes that children must be afforded special 
protection and acknowledges the salience of relevant instruments that specifically 
</b></p>
<p><b>address violence against children. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Given that enforced disappearance is a continuous crime, its specific effects on 
a child could continue even after he or she has reached majority. Thus, the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group notes that the obligations of the State that arose when the child was under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>age of 18 continue as long as those obligations are not fully complied with.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Working Group considers that States should address, in dealing with 
situation of enforced disappearances, the different challenges and needs faced by girls 
</b></p>
<p><b>and boys, adolescents and younger children, refugee and internally displaced children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>children recruited into armed forces and groups, children from different religious and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic and racial backgrounds and children with disabilities. A gender-sensitive 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach should include a focus on the protection of the rights of girls and on 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing their particular needs.

Group to reflect in its report the communications it had transmitted in 2008 and 2009.

<p>9. On 31 July 2012, the Working Group, jointly with four other special procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted a prompt intervention letter to the Government concerning 
allegations of excessive use of force during a peaceful rally held on 5 July 2012 by 
individuals including members of the Collectif des Familles de Disparus en Alg&#233;rie 
</p>
<p>  
 a See paragraph 18. </p>


<p>(Collective of Families of the Disappeared in Algeria), SOS Disparus (SOS Disappeared) to 
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the independence of Algeria and denounce a number 
of alleged human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>10. On 1 October 2012, the Government replied to the prompt intervention letter during 
the reporting period. In this communication, the Government reported, inter alia, that the 
CFDA, SOS Disparus and the Comit&#233; national pour la d&#233;fense des droits de ch&#244;meurs had 
no legal status in Algeria and did not respect the established procedure concerning public 
rallies and peaceful demonstrations. The Government commented on disruptions to traffic 
caused, and action taken against individuals involved in the rally. The Government also 
pointed out that any action by public order agents was carried out calmly and without any 
use of force.  
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the reporting period the Government transmitted three communications dated 
29 November 2011, 1 July 2012 and 1 October 2012. 
</p>
<p>12. The first communication concerned the visit request of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>13. The second communication was handed to the Working Group during its ninety-
seventh session and concerned outstanding cases. This information could only be partially 
processed for inclusion in the present report. 
</p>
<p>14. The third communication concerned the prompt intervention letter sent by the 
Working Group, jointly with four other special procedures mandates, on 31 July 2012.  
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>15. Information was received from sources concerning one outstanding case. As a result, 
this case was clarified.  
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>16. Following the information provided by the source, the Working Group decided to 
clarify one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>17. Representatives of the Government of Algeria met with the Working Group at its 
ninety-seventh session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 25 August 2000, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
to Algeria. A reminder was sent on 21 October 2010. On 12 November 2010, the 
Government proposed that the Working Group travel to Algiers to consult the documents 
which had been requested concerning outstanding cases and meet with the families of those 
allegedly disappeared but found alive. On 29 November 2011, the Government reiterated 
its proposal for the Working Group&#8216;s visit to take place in the context of a review of the 
</p>
<p>measures taken by the Government to deal with the outstanding cases. On 23 May 2011 and 
23 January 2012, the Working Group replied to these communications indicating to the 
Government that it would prefer to carry out a visit to the country in conformity with its 
mandate and usual practice. </p>


<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>19. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 3,033 cases to the 
Government; of those, 19 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, nine cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 3,005 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Working Group wishes to express its appreciation for the reply received from 
the Government, dated 1 October 2012, concerning the prompt intervention letter 
transmitted on 31 July 2012. The Working Group notes with concern that the Government 
stated in its reply that the CFDA, <i>SOS Disparus</i> and the <i>Comit&#233; national pour la d&#233;fense 
des droits de ch&#244;meurs</i> have no legal status in Algeria and did not respect the established 
procedure concerning public rallies and peaceful demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>21. In relation to this prompt intervention letter, the Working Group would like to recall 
the Declaration, which affirms that States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in 
investigations of cases of disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and 
those conducting the investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or 
reprisal. The Working Group would also like to recall that, in its resolution 21/4, the 
Human Rights Council urged Governments to take steps to provide adequate protection to 
witnesses of enforced or involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders acting against 
enforced disappearances and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any 
intimidation, persecution, reprisals or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected, 
paying special attention to women as relatives of disappeared persons in the context of their 
struggle to resolve the disappearance of members of their families.

<b>Chen Guangcheng</b> and his family and the alleged arbitrary detention or enforced 
disappearance of a number of his relatives and supporters. It was reported, inter alia, that on 
28 April 2012, Mr. Chen Guangcun and his son Mr. Chen Hua, both cousins of Mr. Chen

the date of the communication the whereabouts of 37 intellectuals, including artists, 
remained unknown. Among these intellectuals were Nyendak and Yama Tsering, director 
and a teacher respectively at a school established 20 years previously to teach and promote

</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>70. On 11 October 2011, the Government transmitted one communication which could 
not be translated in time for inclusion in the 2011 annual report (A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1). This 
communication concerned one outstanding case and an urgent appeal, the Government 
replied &#8213;Ershidin Israel is a Chinese citizen. In 2009 Mr. Ershidin was suspected of plotting 
violent terrorist activities in Xinjiang. He is wanted by the Chinese police as a major 
suspect, and is the subject of a Red Notice issued by the International Criminal Police 
Organization (INTERPOL). In September 2009, Mr. Ershidin, fearing punishment, fled 
across the national border to Kazakhstan.  </p>


<p>71. In May 2011, Mr. Ershidin was extradited to China in strict observance by both 
parties of the extradition treaty between China and Kazakhstan. Mr. Ershidin has now fully 
confessed to having carried out violent illegal terrorist activities and his case is currently 
being further adjudicated. 
</p>
<p>72. The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in 
its entirety in the relevant documents of the United Nations.&#8214; The information provided was 
not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of the outstanding case. 
</p>
<p>73. During the reporting period, the Government transmitted three communications, 
dated 18 November 2011, 27 August 2012, and 28 September 2012. These communications 
concerned the general allegation transmitted to the Government on 21 September 2011, the 
joint urgent appeal sent on 15 May 2012, and the urgent appeal sent on 9 August 2012, 
respectively, but could not be translated in time for inclusion in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>  Information was received from sources concerning one outstanding case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>74. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 119 cases to the 
Government; of those, 12 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 77 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 30 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Press release 
</b></p>
<p>75. On 23 December 2011, the Working Group, jointly with three other special 
procedures mechanisms, issued a press release concerning the alleged continued secret 
detention of Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a prominent Chinese human rights lawyer who was 
reportedly arrested in 2006 in relation to his work advocating against human rights 
violations in China. Mr. Gao was allegedly charged with subversion of State power, 
although this was never proven in a court of law. At the time when the press release was 
issued, Mr. Gao&#8216;s whereabouts had been unknown for 20 months.  
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Working Group welcomes the responses received from the Government, 
including a response dated 18 November 2011 to a general allegation transmitted to the 
Government on 21 September 2011. The Working Group regrets that it has not been 
possible to translate this communication and others from the Government in time for 
inclusion in the present report.  
</p>
<p>77. The Working Group also regrets that, notwithstanding the reminder sent on 26 
August 2011, no response has been received from the Government in relation to a general 
allegation transmitted on 6 August 2010 (A/HRC/16/48, paras. 118-21) concerning unrest 
in Urumqi, Xinjiang, in July 2009, which reportedly led to the detention of hundreds of 
young Uighur men and the disappearance of some of them.

<p>79. The Working Group transmitted one newly-reported case to the Government under 
its standard procedure, concerning a person below the age of 18, who, on 8 May 2010, was 
reportedly forcibly recruited by an armed paramilitary group which allegedly acted with the 
acquiescence of the police and the military. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>80. On 10 May 2012, the Working Group, jointly with three other special procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the alleged 
enforced disappearance of Mr. <b>Hern&#225;n Henry D&#237;az</b>, on 18 April 2012, while he was 
travelling from Puerto de As&#237;s to Puerto Vega, Putumayo. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>81. On 2 October 2012, the Working Group, jointly with 10 other special procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted a general allegation to the Government concerning the possible 
adoption by Congress of draft legislation which would reform articles 116, 152 and 221 of 
the Political Constitution of Colombia, which could seriously affect the rule of law and the 
fight against impunity in Colombia. A press release on the same matter was issued on 22 
October 2012 (see para. 92). 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Government transmitted a communication, dated 5 May 2011, which could not 
be translated in time for the 2011 annual report (A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1). It concerned 16 
cases. The information provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of 
these cases.  
</p>
<p>83. During the reporting period, the Government transmitted five communications, 
dated 30 January 2012, 8 March 2012, 22 May 2012, 10 August 2012 and 2 November 
</p><p>2012.  
</p>
<p>84. The first communication concerned 20 outstanding cases. The information provided 
was not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of these cases. </p>


<p>85. The second communication concerned outstanding cases but could not be processed 
in time for inclusion in the present report. 
</p>
<p>86. In the third communication, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
transmitted on 10 May 2012 (see para. 80). In its response, the Government informed that 
the Urgent Search Mechanism (<i>Mecanismo de B&#250;squeda Urgente</i>) was launched, as well as 
the methodological registration process in the National Register of Missing Persons (RND); 
that Mr. Diaz&#8216;s case was registered under reference number 865686000528201280327. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the Government provided a list of the steps taken with respect to this case, and 
information on a technical match with the remains of those deceased in Colombian 
territory, whose bodies were with the Institute of Legal Medicine. The results were 
negative. The Government noted that any update on this case would be transmitted to the 
special procedures branch. 
</p>
<p>87. The fourth communication concerned one outstanding case. The information 
received was not considered sufficient to clarify the case. 
</p>
<p>88. The fifth communication concerned the general allegation transmitted on 2 October 
</p><p>2012. The information received could not be processed in time for inclusion in the present 
report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>89. Sources provided information on four outstanding cases.  
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>90. Following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule, the 
Working Group decided to clarify two cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>91. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 1,255 cases to the 
Government; of those, 68 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 218 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 969 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Press release 
</b></p>
<p>92. On 22 October 2012, the Working Group, jointly with 10 other special procedures 
mechanisms, issued a press release regarding the proposed reform of Colombia&#8216;s Political 
Constitution with regard to military criminal law, and expressed concerns that the proposal 
could have serious implications for the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights in 
Colombia. Although the proposed reform would reportedly exclude crimes of genocide, 
crimes against humanity and enforced disappearances from the jurisdiction of military and 
police tribunals, it could also expand the jurisdiction of these tribunals, giving them the 
power to investigate, process and decide on cases of other serious human rights violations, 
as well as crimes committed by private security forces, which should be under the authority 
of the ordinary criminal justice system and courts. Concern was also expressed that the 
preliminary investigation phase, which is essential for the clarification of facts and 
responsibilities, could become the responsibility of institutions of military or police 
criminal justice. Further concern was expressed that the establishment of a Penal 
Guarantees Court, as the control court to deal with any accusation against a member of the 
<i>Fuerza P&#250;blica</i>, would suggest that the accused was receiving preferential treatment, which 
could generate a climate of impunity; and that such a court, which would examine cases 
involving military or police personnel exclusively, would suggest the existence of a parallel </p>


<p>system of administration of justice and violate the principle of equality in relation to access 
to justice for all individuals and impair due process, thus undermining the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>93. The Working Group welcomes the response from the Government, dated 22 May 
2012, in relation to the joint urgent appeal transmitted on 10 May 2012, as well as the 
communications from the Government regarding outstanding cases and the general 
allegation transmitted on 2 October 2012. The Working Group regrets that it has not been 
possible to process certain communications in time for inclusion in the present report.  
</p>
<p>94. The Working Group also wishes to express its concern that, during the reporting 
period, one urgent appeal and one general allegation were transmitted to the Government, 
and that one press release was issued. In relation to the press release, dated 22 October 
2012, the Working Group wishes to reiterate its concern regarding the potential 
implications of the proposed reform of Colombia&#8216;s Political Constitution for the rule of law 
</p>
<p>and the enjoyment of human rights in Colombia.

<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>102. The Working Group transmitted four newly-reported cases to the Government. 
</p>
<p>103. The first two cases concerned Mr. <b>Won-mo Choi</b>, and Mr. <b>Kyeong-shik Moon</b> who

Peninsula, by members of the Coast Guard of the Democratic People&#8216;s Republic of Korea 
on 5 June 1967. In accordance with the Working Group&#8216;s methods of work, the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Republic of Korea received copies of these cases.

<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>124. The Working Group transmitted three newly-reported cases to the Government. The 
first case concerned Mr. <b>Ahmed Ashour Hassan</b>, who was allegedly last seen at Abu 
Zaabal Prison, Cairo, on 28 January 2011. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Reda Fathy 
Mohamed Ibrahim</b>, who was allegedly arrested on Talaat Harb Street, close to Tahrir 
Square, by State police on 1 June 2011. The third case concerned Mr. <b>Samy Bakry Orani 
Morsi</b>, who was allegedly arrested near his home in Helwan, Cairo, by military forces on 8 
February 2011.  
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>125. The Government transmitted two communications to the Working Group, dated 1 
December 2011 and 14 August 2012. 
</p>
<p>126. In its first communication, the Government responded to an urgent appeal dated 28 
January 2011. The communication could not be translated in time for the present report. 
</p>
<p>127. In its second communication, the Government responded to a reminder from the 
Working Group concerning a general allegation dated 4 May 2011. The Government 
pointed out that it had in fact responded to the general allegation in a communication dated 
16 August 2011, and attached said communication. </p>


<p>128.  In its response, the Government reported, inter alia, that an investigation of 
allegations of enforced disappearances in relation to a Hizbollah cell and a robbery at a 
jewellery shop in Cairo demonstrated that arrest and detention procedures had been fully 
consistent with the law. The Government further informed that allegations such as those 
regarding the practice of enforced disappearances by the State Security Investigations 
Service (SSI) could be submitted to the Department of Public Prosecutions and that the 
investigating authorities afforded the necessary attention to such reports in order to bring to 
account anyone responsible for violations of the law. The Government gave details of the 
Egyptian Penal Code concerning arrest and detention. Finally, the Government explained 
that the SSI was abolished following a decision made in March 2011 and that the functions 
of the new national security division would be discharged in full conformity with the 
provisions of the Constitution, the law and the principles of human rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>129. Sources provided information on two outstanding cases. Both cases were clarified as 
a result.

<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the general allegation 
</b></p>
<p>140. The Working Group received information from sources concerning reported 
obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance in Eritrea. This information was transmitted to the 
Government on 16 April 2012.d  
</p>
<p>141. Allegations were reported of arrests, incommunicado and secret detention, inhuman 
and degrading conditions of detention, deaths in custody, denial of trials, and enforced 
disappearances perpetrated by Government security officers in Eritrea. It was alleged that 
11 high-level political and military critics of the Government and 10 journalists working for 
a small group of private newspapers in Eritrea became victims of such practices in 
September 2001. Of these individuals, 20 men and one woman have reportedly never been 
seen again. Ten of them are allegedly dead. 
</p>
<p>142. It was further alleged that many other Government officials, leaders of Government-
controlled labour unions, businessmen, Government journalists, employees of foreign 
embassies and international non-governmental organisations, followers of &#8213;unrecognised 
religions&#8214;, and national service evaders or escapees have been jailed incommunicado, under 
</p>
<p>inhumane conditions, in secret prisons since 2001. 
</p>
<p>143. Sources alleged that the arrests occurred without explanation or recourse, and result 
from various activities such as questioning Government policies or practicing certain 
religions. It was also alleged that prisoners were often held indefinitely, without access to 
family members, prison monitors, lawyers, or appeal procedures. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p>145. The Working Group regrets that no response has yet been received from the 
Government to the general allegation, transmitted on 16 April 2012, and is concerned about 
the allegations of reported arrests, incommunicado and secret detention, inhuman and 
degrading conditions of detention, deaths in custody, denial of trials, and enforced 
disappearances perpetrated by Government security officers in Eritrea.

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>158. The Government transmitted two communications to the Working Group, on 21 
November 2011 and 25 September 2012, in response to a general allegation, transmitted in 
September 2011, concerning reported obstacles in the advancement in criminal courts of 
cases of enforced disappearance and the lack of a national search commission resulting in 
the fate and whereabouts of victims remaining unknown in the great majority of the 45,000 
cases of reported enforced disappearances in Guatemala (see A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1, paras. 
194-200). Both responses from the Government contained a report on the implementation 
of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance in 
Guatemala.  
</p>
<p>159. The Government provided information on four trials concerning cases of enforced 
disappearances, in which a total of five members of the military forces and two members of 
the National Police (PN) were condemned. In these trials a wide range of resources were 
used, such as files from the &#8213;Archivo Hist&#243;rico de la Polic&#237;a Nacional (AHPN &#8211; Historic 
Archive of the National Police)&#8214; for the first time included as evidence in a trial in 
</p>
<p>Guatemala; and a broader concept of enforced disappearance as a permanent and 
imprescriptible crime was applied.  
</p>
<p>160. A meeting between governmental human rights bodies, the Criminal Police and the 
Public Ministry reportedly took place on 7 July 2010, with the aim of adjusting the 
methodology that should be used to deal more efficiently with the cases presented by the 
Working Group in 2007. It was reported that to provide better conditions for moving 
investigations forward, the Public Ministry budget for 2011 was increased by 
approximately 15 per cent. Furthermore, the overuse of the <i>amparo</i> resource, an option of 
making a legal appeal to protect individuals from violations of human rights which is now 
reportedly often used in courts to delay or avoid sentences, was recognized by the 
Government as a barrier to justice. The <i>amparo</i> resource was subjected to preventive 
measures and a project that modifies the text of the law, which is being processed by the 
legislative body in order to avoid the misuse of this judicial procedure. 
</p>
<p>161. Regarding the trial concerning the enforced disappearance of Mr.<b> </b>Efra&#237;n Ciriaco 
B&#225;maca Vel&#225;squez, procedures were taken by the authorities to re-open the case but several 
times appeals were lodged by the lawyers of the accused precluding its progress. Following 
decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Government took action to 
comply with the investigations in the case of Mr. B&#225;maca Vel&#225;squez and to adapt the 
Guatemalans legal system to International Humanitarian Law standards. 
</p>
<p>162. It was reported that advances are being made in relation to the potential approval of 
a draft law to create the &#8213;Comisi&#243;n Nacional de B&#250;squeda de Personas V&#237;ctimas de 
Desaparicion Forzada y otras Formas de Desaparici&#243;n&#8214; (National Commission to Search for 
</p>
<p>Victims of Enforced Disappearances and other Forms of Disappearances). Approval is 
expected in 2012. The participation of civil society organisms in this process was 
emphasized. 
</p>
<p>163. The Government reported, concerning forensic investigations to identify victims of 
enforced disappearances, that since 2009, several Covenants were signed between 
Government entities related to this process in order to facilitate and support investigations. 
A pronounced advancement in relation to the methods employed and the results achieved 
was reported. Moreover, the work of the &#8213;Direcci&#243;n de los Archivos de la Paz&#8214; 
</p>
<p>(Management of Peace Archives), a Government agency which administrates the historical 
archives related to the Guatemalan civil war, was reportedly very fruitful in terms of the 
clarification of the context of enforced disappearances committed in this period. It was 
therefore able to assist a large number of condemnations. </p>


<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>164. Representatives of the Government of Guatemala met with the Working Group at its 
ninety-eighth session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>165. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 3,155 cases to the 
Government; of those, 79 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the Government, 177 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
source, and 2,899 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>166. The Working Group thanks the Government of Guatemala for its response to the 
general allegation. The Working Group recalls article 9 of the Declaration, which concerns 
&#8213;The right to a prompt and effective judicial remedy as a means of determining the 
whereabouts or state of health of persons deprived of their liberty and/or identifying the 
authority ordering or carrying out the deprivation of liberty is required to prevent enforced 
disappearances under all circumstances&#8214;; article 13.6, which states that &#8213;An investigation, 
in accordance the [relevant] procedures&#8230;, should be able to be conducted for as long as the 
fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified&#8214;; article 18.1, which 
affirms that &#8213;Persons who have or are alleged to have committed [acts of enforced 
disappearances] shall not benefit from any special amnesty law or similar measures that 
might have the effect of exempting them from any criminal proceedings or sanction.&#8214;; and

<p><b>  Urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>173. The Working Group transmitted one communication on 28 September 2012, jointly 
with six other special procedures mechanisms, to the Government, under its urgent appeals 
procedure. The communication concerned alleged acts of harassment against members of 
the Peoples Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE) and other human rights 
defenders. It was reported, inter alia, that three individuals associated with this movement, 
Mr. <b>Selson </b>from Idinthakarai, Mr. <b>Siluvai</b> <b>John</b> from Koothenkuli, and Mr. <b>Jesu</b> from 
Idinthakarai were hospitalized in Lourdu Matha Hospital and were subsequently transferred 
by the police to a different location. At the time of the communication, their whereabouts 
were reportedly unknown. No response to the urgent appeal has yet been received from the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>174. The Working Group transmitted one communication on 17 January 2012, jointly 
with three other special procedures mechanisms, under its prompt intervention procedure. 
The communication concerned<b> Mr. Parvez Imroz</b>, who has allegedly been denied travel 
documents by the Government since 2004. It was reported that the denial of Mr. Imroz&#8216;s 
travel documents may be a direct attempt to inhibit Mr. Imroz human rights work in 
relation to victims of enforced disappearance. No response to the prompt intervention letter 
has yet been received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>175. The Government transmitted one communication to the Working Group, dated 9 
August 2012, concerning one outstanding case. The information provided was not 
considered sufficient for the clarification of the case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit  
</b></p>
<p>176. On 16 August 2010, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
to the country. On 18 August 2010, the Government acknowledged receipt of the request. A 
reminder letter was transmitted on 18 August 2011. On 29 August 2011, the Government 
replied that the request was conveyed to the relevant authorities in India. A further reminder 
was transmitted on 8 November 2012. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>177. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 433 cases to the 
Government; of those, 12 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 68 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 353 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>178. The Working Group notes with concern that during the reporting period it 
transmitted one urgent appeal and one prompt intervention letter to the Government, and 
that no response has been received to either communication. The Working Group regrets 
that no response was received from the Government of India to the general allegation sent 
on 16 January 2009 (A/HRC/13/31, paras. 260-266), concerning legal provisions that may 
hamper the right to a prompt and effective remedy, notwithstanding the reminder 
transmitted on 26 August 2011. The Working Group also regrets that no response was 
received from the Government of India to the general allegation transmitted on 11 February 
2011, concerning reports that, between 1989 and 2009, actions of military and paramilitary </p>


<p>forces in Kashmir resulted in more than 8,000 enforced and involuntary disappearances 
(A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1, paras. 219-225).  
</p>
<p>179. In relation to the communication transmitted under the prompt intervention 
procedure, on 17 January 2012, the Working Group would like to recall the Declaration, 
which affirms that States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations 
of cases of disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those 
conducting the investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. 
The Working Group would also like to recall that, in its resolution 21/4, the Human Rights 
Council urged Governments to take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of 
enforced or involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced 
disappearances and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any 
intimidation, persecution, reprisals or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected, 
paying special attention to women as relatives of disappeared persons in the context of their 
struggle to resolve the disappearance of members of their families.

<p><b> Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>184. The Working Group transmitted one newly-reported case to the Government, 
concerning Mr. <b>Saeed Zeinaly</b>, who was allegedly arrested at home on 14 July 1999 by 
agents of security forces.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>185. The Working Group, jointly with three other special procedures mechanisms, 
transmitted to the Government an urgent appeal on 16 February 2012, concerning various 
individuals including Mr.<b> Shahram Manouchehri</b>, allegedly arrested at his home by 
security forces on 19 January 2012, before being transferred to an unknown location. At the 
time of the communication, the fate and whereabouts of Mr. Manouchehri reportedly 
remained unknown. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>186. The Government transmitted four communications dated 2 March 2012, 4 May 
2012, 15 May 2012, and 20 July 2012. All of these communications concerned an urgent 
appeal transmitted on 19 October 2011. 
</p>
<p>187.  In its first communication, the Government reported that one of the individuals 
referred to in the urgent appeal was fined for using satellite TV equipment, sentenced to 
one year&#8216;s imprisonment for propaganda against the State, and two year&#8216;s imprisonment for 
</p>
<p>insulting the late Imam and the eminent leader of the Revolution; that 16 months of his 
original sentence was converted into an additional fine  because of his advanced age; that </p>


<p>the individual appealed his verdict; and that part of the verdict was quashed and his 
sentence was halted due to his advanced age. 
</p>
<p>188. In its second communication, the Government reported that Mr. <b>Kouhyar Goudarzi</b> 
was charged with disseminating misinformation about the system of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran by his membership in the Committee of Human Rights Reporters and was brought 
before branch 26 of Tehran Court of Revolution; that he was found guilty and sentenced to 
one year&#8216;s imprisonment; and that the decision was appealed but the appeal was rejected. 
</p>
<p>189. In its third communication, the Government provided information on several of the 
individuals referred to in the urgent appeal. 
</p>
<p>190. In its fourth communication, the Government reported that one of the individuals 
referred to in the urgent appeal was charged with engaging in propaganda against the 
system of the Islamic Republic of Iran and in favour with the MEK terrorist group, as well 
as association and collusion to disturb national security; that he was found guilty on the first 
charge and given a one-year suspended prison sentence for two years; and that he was 
cleared of the second charge and freed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>191. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working 
Group in 2004, which was delayed at the request of the Government. Reminder letters were 
sent on 20 July 2009, 16 August 2010, 18 August 2011 and 8 November 2012, asking the 
Government to set a date for the proposed visit. The Government has not yet set a new date 
for the visit despite the fact that more than eight years have elapsed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>192. Representatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran met with the 
Working Group at its ninety-sixth session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

Government; of those, five cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided 
by the source, 14 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 518 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><i>  Observations  
</i></p>
<p>194. The Working Group welcomes the replies received from the Government regarding 
the urgent appeal transmitted on 19 October 2011, but is concerned that no reply has yet 
been received regarding the urgent appeal transmitted on 16 February 2012.  
</p>
<p>195. The Working Group reiterates its hope that a final date will be agreed in the near 
future for the visit which was agreed to in 2004 and recalls Human Rights Council 
resolution 21/4 which &#8213;Urges States to cooperate with the Working Group to help it to carry 
out its mandate effectively and, in that framework, to give serious consideration to 
responding favourably to its requests for visits to their countries&#8214;. </p>

<p><b>  General allegation

<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>229. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances received 
information from credible sources concerning reported obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Lithuania. This information was transmitted to the Government on 16 
April 2012.h 
</p>
<p>230. According to sources, there have been credible reports of involvement of Lithuania 
with secret detentions between 2001 and 2006. It is alleged that a Lithuanian parliamentary 
committee in December 2009 concluded that State agents had collaborated with the United 
States of America Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and that detention facilities operated 
by the United States of America intelligence agency had existed in Lithuania. It is also 
reported that these sites were later visited by various organisations. It is further reported 
that there has been an acknowledgement by Lithuania that it was involved in secret 
detentions and renditions. 
</p>
<p>231.  It is alleged that an investigation into these practices was ordered by Lithuania in 
</p><p>2009. However, it is reported that it was announced on 14 January 2011, that the 
investigation was to be closed for a variety of reasons, including a State secrets privilege. 
</p>
<p>232.  Sources affirm that Lithuania is under an international legal obligation to 
investigate all allegations of serious human rights violations and that it should re-open its 
criminal investigation into both its own involvement in these operations, and that of the 
United States of America and its agents on Lithuanian territory. It is further alleged that the 
investigation ought to be conducted through an independent, impartial, thorough and 
effective process. It is further alleged that Lithuania ought to hold those involved in these 
practices accountable and that victims should receive redress.

</p>
<p>260. In the fourth communication, the Government replied to a prompt intervention letter 
dated 31 January 2012. The Government reported that the Procuradur&#237;a General del Estado 
de Michoac&#225;n (Attorney General of the Michoac&#225;n State) had conducted an investigation 
regarding the case of Ms. Barajas Mejia and that this procedure has not yet been able to 
identify those involved in the harassment. In addition, the Government reported that the 
presence of public security elements in the neighbourhood was increased and the services 
of the Unidad de Psicolog&#237;a y Atenci&#243;n a las Victimas del Delito (Psychology and Care to 
Victims of Crime Unit) of the Attorney General of the Michoac&#225;n State were made 
available to the victim and her family. Finally, the Government highlighted that an 
investigation was being conducted into the alleged disappearance of a member of Ms. 
Barajas Mej&#237;a&#8216;s family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>261. Sources provided information on twelve outstanding cases 
</p>
<p><b>  Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>262. On 14 March 2012, the Working Group issued a press release on the occasion of the 
presentation of the report on its visit to Mexico. The experts, while recognizing the 
challenges posed by the complex situation in relation to public security in the context of the 
fight against crime, emphasized that &#8213;there is a chronic pattern of impunity demonstrated 
</p>
<p>by the absence of effective investigations in cases of enforced disappearances&#8214;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>263. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 505 cases to the 
Government; of those, 28 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 134 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, 16 cases have been discontinued and 327 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>264. The Working Group is seriously concerned that during the reporting period 11 
urgent actions, six newly-reported cases, one urgent appeal, four prompt intervention 
letters, and one press release were transmitted to the Government. The Working Group 
recalls article 2.1 of the Declaration which states that &#8213;No State shall practise, permit or 
</p>
<p>tolerate enforced disappearances&#8214;, as well as article 3, which provides that &#8213;Each State shall 
take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and terminate 
acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>265. The Working Group would also like to recall article 7 of the Declaration, which 
states that &#8213;No circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of war, internal 
</p>
<p>political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to justify enforced 
disappearances&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>266. The Working Group would also like to remind the Government of its obligations 
under the Declaration towards the families of the disappeared and in particular of article 
13.3 according to which States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in 
investigations of cases of enforced disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, 
witnesses and those conducting the investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, 
intimidation or reprisal. The Working Group would also like to recall that, in its resolution 
21/4, the Human Rights Council urged Governments to take steps to provide adequate </p>


<p>protection to witnesses of enforced or involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders 
acting against enforced disappearances and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons 
against any intimidation, persecution, reprisals or ill-treatment to which they might be 
subjected, paying special attention to women as relatives of disappeared persons in the 
context of their struggle to resolve the disappearance of members of their families. 
</p>
<p>267. Finally, the Working Group calls on the Government to make efforts to implement 
the recommendations contained in the report published following the country visit in 2011 
(A/HRC/19/58/Add.2).

<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>316. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances received 
information from credible sources concerning reported obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in the Philippines. This information was transmitted to the Government on 
16 April 2012.i 
</p>
<p>317. Sources reported on serious violations of human rights in the Philippines, such as 
enforced disappearances. It is alleged that these abuses persist in part because of the 
Philippines police&#8216;s failure to conduct thorough and impartial investigations, particularly 
when evidence points to the involvement of the military. The ability to bring the 
perpetrators to justice has also been hindered by the Justice Department&#8216;s inadequate 
</p>
<p>protection program for witnesses, who have been subject to harassment and intimidation. 
</p>
<p>318. Sources also reported that several victims were killed or abducted in front of 
witnesses. The perpetrators either wore civilian clothes with bonnets (balaclavas), or wore 
military uniforms and made no attempt to hide their faces. According to the sources, in 
several cases there is evidence that soldiers worked with members of paramilitary forces&#8212;
primarily the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU)&#8212;or paid military &#8213;assets,&#8214; 
including &#8213;rebel returnees&#8214; (former New People&#8216;s Army &#8211;members). It is reported that the 
military appears to have targeted several of these victims as CPP-NPA (Communist Party 
of the Philippines - New People&#8216;s Army) members because of their involvement with leftist 
organizations, work on land reform, or opposition to military presence in their 
communities. 
</p>
<p>319. The sources alleged that police investigations into reports of enforced 
disappearances are woefully inadequate. Several core aspects of investigations are often 
disregarded by investigators, including effectively examining crime scenes and canvassing 
for witnesses. Witness protection is rarely provided and, where it is provided, the protection 
</p>
<p>  
 i A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1, para. 22.  </p>


<p>program is inflexible. Despite official orders requiring prosecutors and police to work 
together in order to ensure that a strong case is presented to court, such cooperation remains 
extremely unusual. Once a case is filed in court, hearings occur only at monthly intervals. 
</p>
<p>320. No response from the Government was received during the reporting period 
regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>321. On 24 May 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
the country. Reminder letters were sent on 16 August 2010 and 18 August 2011. No 
response has yet been received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>322. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 782 cases to the 
Government; of those, 35 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 126 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 621 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>323. The Working Group regrets that no response has been received from the 
Government to its general allegation sent in 2009 concerning the dismissal, by the Court of 
Appeals, of <i>amparo </i>petitions for the supposed failure of the petitioners to prove that their 
rights to life, liberty or security were violated or under threat (A/HRC/13/31, paras. 416-
419), notwithstanding the reminders sent on 26 August 2011 and 14 August 2012. The 
Working Group also regrets that no response has been received from the Government to its 
general allegation sent on 16 April 2012 (see summary above) notwithstanding the 
reminder sent on 14 August 2012. The Working Group recalls the Declaration, in particular 
article 2.1 which states that &#8213;No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances&#8214;, and article 13.1, which states that &#8213;Each State shall ensure that any person 
having knowledge or a legitimate interest who alleges that a person has been subjected to 
enforced disappearance has the right to complain to a competent and independent State 
authority and to have that complaint promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated by 
that authority. Whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that an enforced 
disappearance has been committed, the State shall promptly refer the matter to that 
authority for such an investigation, even if there has been no formal complaint. No measure 
shall be taken to curtail or impede the investigation.&#8214; </p>

<p>356. Following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule, the 
Working Group decided, at its ninety-sixth session, to clarify one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>357. On 3 September 2012, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the country. During the ninety-eighth session, the Government confirmed its 
agreement to extend an invitation to the Working Group to undertake a visit to the country 
in 2013.

<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>358. Representatives of the Government of Spain met with the Working Group at its 
ninety-eighth session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>359. On 8 February 2012, the Working Group together with another mandate holder 
issued a press release concerning the trial of Judge Baltasar Garz&#243;n in Spain and its effects 
on the process to investigate and deal with more than a hundred thousand cases of enforced 
disappearances which reportedly occurred during the Spanish civil war and the Franco 
regime. The Working Group emphasized that an investigation should be able to be 
conducted for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains 
unclarified and that an amnesty law should not allow an end to a State&#8216;s obligation to 
investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>360. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted five cases to the 
Government; of those, two have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the

the Sri Lankan Army on 9 December 2011. 
</p>
<p>364. The third case concerned Mr. <b>Ramasamy Prabaharan</b>, a Tamil businessman of 
Indian origin,  allegedly abducted by seven armed men in civilian clothing, believed to be

</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedure

<p>366. The Working Group transmitted nine newly-reported cases to the Government. 
</p>
<p>367. The first case concerned Mr. <b>Punyamoorthy Velusamy</b>, a three-wheeler taxi driver

Road on 1 March 2008. The police had reportedly previously been to Mr. Velusamy&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>house on several occasions and questioned him regarding whether he had received money 
from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE). 
</p>
<p>  
 k During its ninety-sixth and ninety-eighth sessions, the Working Group discovered that six and two 
</p>
<p>cases, respectively, were in fact duplicates of existing cases. These eight cases were subsequently 
eliminated from the Working Group&#8216;s records. </p>


<p>368. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Mathurakulasingam</b> <b>Velautham</b>, who was 
allegedly arrested at 55 Alwis Place, Kottehena, Colombo, by paramilitary forces 
reportedly working with the Sri Lankan military, on 11 June 2008. 
</p>
<p>369. The third case concerned Mr. <b>Abiyouth Anthony</b>, also known as Hilman, an 
employee of the District Secretariat of Mannar, Government Agent&#8216;s Office, who allegedly 
</p>
<p>disappeared after leaving a family member&#8216;s house in Kallikaddaikadu, Uyilankulam, 
</p>
<p>Mannar district, on 5 January 2009. Mr. Anthony was reportedly seen approximately one 
month after his alleged disappearance in front of Thalladi Military Camp, walking with 
army officers. 
</p>
<p>370. The fourth case concerned a <b>person below the age of 18</b> who, on 17 April 2009, 
was allegedly last seen in Puthumathalan. According to the information received, during the 
night of 17 April 2009, the person below the age of 18 was reportedly forcibly taken away 
by members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). On 20 April 2009, the Sri 
Lankan army allegedly took control of the area. It was reported that all those in the area 
where the person below the age of 18 had been were taken away by members of the army. 
</p>
<p>371. The fifth case concerned Mr. <b>Varathalingam Ratnathurai</b>, also known as Puthuvai

</p>
<p>372. The sixth case concerned Mr. <b>Ilmi Rifai Ahmed Adbulla</b> who, on 5 May 2010, was 
allegedly abducted by seven individuals, one of whom was in police uniform, and driven 
away in a white van with registration number 7030 when he was returning home from work 
on his motorcycle. 
</p>
<p>373. The seventh and eighth cases concerned Mr. <b>Mohamed Kaya Mohideen

white vans with registration numbers 58-0093 and LF 7655 at the hotel in front of a race 
course in Nuwara Eliya. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>375. On 29 December 2011, the Working Group, together with four other Special 
Procedures mechanisms, sent a prompt intervention letter regarding the alleged arrest and 
detention of 42 human rights and political activists, including members of the non-
governmental organisation, the Committee to Investigate Disappearances. 
</p>
<p>376. On 1 March 2012, the Working Group, together with four other Special Procedures 
mechanisms, sent a prompt intervention letter regarding alleged repeated instances of 
excessive use of force against peaceful protestors, and undue restrictions on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including against members of the 
Organization Collective against Abductions and Disappearance (OCAD), a platform of civil 
society organizations working on cases of disappearances and abduction. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>377. The Government transmitted seven communications, dated 24 January 2012, 5 April 
2012, 26 April 2012, 27 April 2012, 7 May 2012, 15 June 2012, and 29 October 2012. </p>


<p>378. In the first communication, the Government acknowledged receipt of a 
communication from the Working Group dated 19 December 2011 concerning its ninety-
fifth session. 
</p>
<p>379. In the second communication, the Government acknowledged receipt of the urgent 
action concerning Mr. Ramasamy Prabaharan. 
</p>
<p>380. In the third communication, the Government provided information on the report of 
the Working Group presented to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session 
(A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1). 
</p>
<p>381. In the fourth communication, the Government responded to a communication 
transmitted by the Working Group on 6 May 2011. 
</p>
<p>382. In the fifth communication, the Government submitted information concerning one 
outstanding case. The information provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the 
clarification of the remaining case. 
</p>
<p>383. In the sixth communication, the Government submitted information concerning 59 
outstanding cases. Based on the information provided by the Government, the Working 
Group decided, at its ninety-seventh session, to apply the six-month rule to one of the cases. 
The information provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of the 
remaining cases. 
</p>
<p>384. In the seventh communication, the Government submitted information concerning 
100 outstanding cases. Based on the information provided by the Government, the Working 
Group decided, at its ninety-eighth session, that two cases were duplicates. The Working 
Group also decided to transmit information concerning one case to the source in order to 
verify whether the case was a duplicate. The information provided concerning the other 97 
cases was not considered sufficient to lead to their clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>385. Sources provided information concerning two outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>386. Representatives of the Government of Sri Lanka met with the Working Group at its 
ninety-sixth and ninety-eighth sessions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>387. On 16 October 2006, the Working Group requested the Government of Sri Lanka to 
extend an invitation to undertake a visit to the country. The Government replied that it 
would not be possible to schedule a visit during the proposed dates, and that the interest of 
the Working Group would be given due consideration. Reminder letters were sent on 20 
July 2009, 16 August 2010, 20 July 2011 and 8 November 2012.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>388. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 12,473 cases to the 
Government; of those, 40 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 6,535 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, 222 cases were found to be duplications and were therefore deleted, and 5,676 
remain outstanding </p>


<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>389. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government to 
its general allegation on 4 May 2011, concerning serious obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances in Sri Lanka during the last phase of the war against the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam from 2006 to 2009 (A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1, paras. 495-501), notwithstanding 
a reminder sent on 13 August 2012. 
</p>
<p>390. The Working Group is seriously concerned that, during the reporting period, it 
transmitted four urgent actions, nine standard cases, and two prompt intervention letters. In 
this respect, the Working Group would like to recall the Declaration, which affirms that 
States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations of cases of 
disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those conducting the 
investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. The Working 
Group would also like to recall that, in its resolution 21/4, the Human Rights Council urged 
Governments to take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of enforced or 
involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced 
disappearances, and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any 
intimidation, persecution, reprisals or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected, 
paying special attention to women as relatives of disappeared persons in the context of their 
struggle to resolve the disappearance of members of their families. 
</p>
<p>391. Following its request dated 16 October 2006, and reminder letters sent on 20 July 
2009, 16 August 2010, 20 July 2011 and 8 November 2012, the Working Group wishes to 
reiterate its hope that the Government will extend an invitation for a visit to the country.

containing the remains of at least 13 bodies including women and children (possibly 
including members of the Abazied and al-Mahmaed families), on 16 May 2011, near Daraa 
in an area called Talit Mohammed Assarie. The other general allegation concerned reported 
systematic human rights violations committed by the Syrian authorities against its 
population, including enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>420. Also on 27 December 2011, the Government responded to an urgent appeal dated 3 
August 2011. The response could not be translated in time for inclusion in the present 
report. 
</p>
<p>421. On 26 January 2012, the Government transmitted a communication with updated 
information on major events and developments in the Syrian Arab Republic, with reference 
to Legislative Decree No. 10 of 15 January 2012, statistics on the release of prisoners, 
communiqu&#233;s of the Ministry of the Interior, impact of armed terrorist operations on the 
electricity sector, economic matters, abduction and murder of Ministry officials. 
</p>
<p>422. On 23 February 2012, the Government transmitted a communication concerning six 
outstanding cases. The information provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the 
clarification of these cases. 
</p>
<p>423. On 2 April 2012, the Government transmitted a communication with statistics on the 
loss of human life and material damage in the Syrian Arab Republic&#8216;s governorates from 
</p>
<p>the outbreak of the events until 15 March 2012 due to the acts of armed terrorist groups. 
</p>
<p>424. On 12 April 2012, the Government transmitted two communications concerning

losses incurred by the Ministry of Trade in the Syrian Arab Republic as a result of acts </p>


<p>committed by armed terrorist groups against staff, buildings and vehicles belonging to the 
Ministry of Trade. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>427. Information was received from sources concerning 14 outstanding cases. As a result, 
seven of these cases were clarified. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>428. On 27 December 2011, the Government transmitted a communication concerning 
two general allegations which were sent on 9 September 2011. The Government reported 
that there were inaccuracies in relation to allegations concerning a mass grave containing 
13 bodies in the Tallit Mohammed Assarie area, near Daraa. The Government reported that 
the Syrian Arab Army did not launch an attack on Daraa but did search for weapons and 
armed outlaws; that the army cordoned off Daraa on 25 April because an increasing number 
of armed men were using the town as a base from which to launch attacks against army and 
security personnel; and that the Army Command had given the armed men until 30 April to 
surrender their weapons before beginning to search. The Government further reported that 
the families of the persons concerned, with the assistance of the local authorities, 
discovered five bodies, rather than 13, in the mass grave. The names of the individuals 
whose bodies were discovered were listed, details of their disappearance were given, and 
information concerning the legal history of two of the individuals was also included. The 
Government explained that the place where their bodies were found was not under the 
control of the army and security forces, nor was it closed off; that the persons concerned 
were thought to be cooperating with the authorities, were targeted by armed terrorist groups 
and may have been killed and buried by such groups; that the authorities worked with the 
family of the concerned persons to conduct relevant investigations; and that the authorities 
did not attend either the home of the persons concerned or the place where their bodies 
were found, either before or after action against the members of armed terrorist groups 
began. 
</p>
<p>429. The Government reported that allegations that security personnel prevented residents 
of Daraa from leaving their homes to recover dead bodies from the streets, and that those 
bodies subsequently disappeared from the streets, were untrue. The Government suggested 
that the sources of the information were believed to have links with armed terrorist groups. 
</p>
<p>430. In relation to allegations of thousands of cases of enforced disappearances, the 
Government reported, inter alia, that there were no such cases in Syria and that all arrests of 
persons suspected of involvement in offences punishable by Syrian law were made in 
accordance with the Syrian Code of Criminal Procedure and were under the monitoring, 
supervision and authority of the competent prosecutor&#8216;s office. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>431. Based on the information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to clarify 
seven cases. Following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule, the 
Working Group decided to clarify one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>432. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 121 cases to the 
Government; of those, 34 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by </p>


<p>the source, 15 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 72 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>433. On 19 September 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the Syrian Arab Republic. The Government has not yet responded. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>434. The Working Group would like to thank the Government for its reply to the two 
general allegations transmitted on 9 September 2011. However, the Working Group is 
gravely concerned about the number of allegations of enforced disappearances received 
during the reporting period, as reflected by 30 urgent actions, two urgent appeals and nine 
standard cases. 
</p>
<p>435. The Working Group is also deeply concerned by the recent report of the independent 
international commission of inquiry of the Syrian Arab Republic (A/HRC/19/69) 
concerning the increasing number of grave human rights violations in Syria, including 
enforced disappearances. In this context, the Working Group recalls recent General 
Assembly resolution 66/176, adopted on 23 February 2012, and Human Rights Council 
resolution 21/26, adopted on 17 October 2012, which condemn the continued grave and 
systematic human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, by the Syrian 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>436. The Working Group would like to recall article 2 of the Declaration, which states 
that &#8213;No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced&#8214;; article 3, which states that &#8213;Each 
</p>
<p>State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent 
and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8214;; and 
</p>
<p>article 7, which states that &#8213;No circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state 
of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to 
justify enforced disappearances&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>437. In the light of the above, the Working Group would like to stress its interest in 
undertaking a visit to the country.

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>445. The Working Group sent one case under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government. It concerned Mr. <b>Pee Naselan</b>, who was allegedly taken away from a local tea 
shop in his village, at Ban Moo 5 Juab Sub district, in the south of Thailand by three men in 
Navy uniforms, on 28 February 2012. 
</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>446. The Working Group transmitted 15 newly-reported cases to the Government. 
</p>
<p>447.  The first case concerned Mr. <b>Songkran Namprom </b>who, on 20 September 1999, 
was allegedly last seen entering Sofitel Hotel, Khon Kaen city, Khon Kaen province, to 
meet an individual who had identified himself as a police officer. 
</p>
<p>448. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Ja-Ur Pawlu</b> who, on 25 October 2002, was 
allegedly arrested with two other individuals near Ang Kang Mountain, Fang district, 
Chiang Mai province, by officers carrying firearms travelling in a vehicle identified as 
belonging to the Thai Narcotics Control Board. 
</p>
<p>449. The third case concerned Mr. <b>Burahum Ma-ela </b>who, on 10 March 2003, was

armed police officers at the mobile telephone shop at Tanyongmas Market. </p>


<p>453. The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth cases concerned Messrs. <b>Wandi Gazi, 
Abdullah Eitae, Manasay Lohlanay </b>and<b> Eruwan Masay</b>, all from the Malayu indigenous

military checkpoint near a market, on the main road between Yaha district and Yala district, 
Yala province, to an unknown location. 
</p>
<p>454. The thirteenth case concerned Mr. <b>Saman Meethum</b> who, on 2 June 2007, was

was allegedly arrested at local Beu-Reah Mosque by three men wearing army ranger 
uniforms and wool facemasks. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegations 
</i></p>
<p>457. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. This information was transmitted to the Government after the Working 
Group&#8216;s ninety-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>458. The source alleged that enforced disappearances have been carried out in Thailand 
for many years as a method to stamp out dissent or to eliminate suspected criminals outside 
of the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>459. The source also alleged that two official policies directly contributed to the creation 
of an environment in which enforced disappearances along with other gross violation of 
human rights have taken place: 1) the highly militarized counter-insurgency approach 
adopted in southern Thailand by various regional governments beginning in 2001 under the 
Thaksin Administration; and 2) the so-called War on Narcotic Drugs Policy implemented 
by Prime Minister Thaksin in 2003. 
</p>
<p>460.  The source argued that the counter-insurgency policies in the south led to the 
implementation of three emergency legislative frameworks, namely, 1) Martial law, which 
allows for detention of up to seven days for interrogation without a warrant or judicial 
review and without the right to challenge the detention; 2) the Decree on Government 
Administration in Emergency Situations issued in 2005, which allows for detention with a 
court warrant without criminal charges for up to seven days and renewable for up to 30 
days; and 3) the Internal Security Act, which reportedly allows for detention  of anyone 
suspected to be involved in insurgency or terrorism in a military training camp for up to six 
months by the order of court without any requirement of pending criminal charges or 
conviction. Such laws as well as the &#8215;good faith&#8216; clauses, which provide immunity for 
</p>
<p>officials from civil, criminal and disciplinary penalties for acts performed in good faith, 
facilitate impunity for enforced disappearances as demonstrated in a number of documented 
cases.  
</p>
<p>461. The source also argued that the counter-insurgency approach led to the militarisation 
of the southern part of Thailand where currently 74, 000 security officers are deployed and 
further 4000 troops are authorised to be deployed in the region. According to the source, 
such militarisation of the region contributed to the increase in enforced disappearances.  </p>


<p>462. The source further reported that three patterns of enforced disappearances are 
observed in southern Thailand: i.e. individuals are taken from the street; they are arrested 
from home, work or mosque; or disappear as a consequence of their voluntary reporting to 
security forces. 
</p>
<p>463.  The source further reported that the violent implementation of the so-called 2003 
War on Narcotic Drugs Policy, which sets a quota for arrests and seizure of narcotic drugs 
to each province and financial rewards for drugs seized, also contributed to the increased 
cases of enforced disappearances. The source pointed out that although the laws in Thailand 
do not condone its security forces to arbitrarily detain or forcefully disappear suspected 
drug traffickers or users, such drug policy allegedly contribute to the creation of an 
environment where enforced disappearances happen. The source alleged that under the 
policy, a number of &#8215;Ranger camps&#8216; were established where locally recruited security 
</p>
<p>personnel, who assist and report to the military, detained suspected drug traffickers or users 
without warrants. It is reported that especially ethnic minorities are most heavily affected 
by the policy due to the stereotyped beliefs that members of ethnic minorities are often 
involved in illegal activities.  
</p>
<p>464. The source reported that the large majority of the victims of enforced disappearances 
belonged to minority groups, such as Malayu or Hill tribes. The source also alleged that the 
human rights, anti-corruption and environmental activists as well as witness of human 
rights violations were also vulnerable to enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>465.  It was further reported that there is no definition of enforced disappearance in the 
domestic legislation. The source also informed on the lack of independence and the 
weakness of the Thai judiciary. As a result, according to the source, no case of enforced 
disappearance has led to the prosecution or conviction of the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>466. In addition, the source reported that with the exception of a recommendation on 12 
February 2012 made by the Committee for Compensation of People Affected by Unrest in 
the Southern Border Provinces established by the Prime Minister in 2010, to pay 
reparations to victims of a number of cases of enforced disappearances that occurred from 
January 2004 to 30 September 2011, reparations for enforced disappearances have been 
extremely limited in Thailand. For instance, it is reported that in a small number of cases in 
southern Thailand, 100,000 Baht were paid to the relatives by the Government following a 
recommendation of the National Reconciliation Commission established by the 
Government in 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>467. The Government transmitted two communications to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>468. In the first communication, dated 13 January 2012, the Government acknowledged 
receipt of a letter transmitted by the Working Group on 19 December 2011. The 
Government also reported that Thailand signed the International Convention on the 
Protection of All persons from Enforced Disappearance on 9 January 2012. 
</p>
<p>469. In the second communication, dated 4 April 2012, the Government provided 
information on two outstanding cases. The information provided was not considered 
sufficient to lead to the clarification of these cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>470. Sources provided information on five outstanding cases. </p>


<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>471. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
the country. On 17 October 2011, the Government of Thailand replied that given the high 
number of requests received, a further communication would be conveyed to the Working 
Group when an agreeable time can be arranged. A reminder was sent by the working group 
on 8 November 2012. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>472. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 78 cases to the 
Government; of those, two cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided 
by the Government, two cases have been discontinued, three cases were found to be 
duplications and were therefore deleted, and 71 remain outstanding. 
</p>

<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>484. On 9 August 2012, the Working Group, jointly with five other special procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted a prompt intervention letter to the Government concerning the 
alleged detention and trial of Mr. <b>Cemal Bektas</b>, president of Yakay-der, an organization 
which works to clarify the circumstances of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial 
executions in Turkey and a member association of the Euro-Mediterranean Federation 
Against Enforced Disappearances (FEMED). 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>485. The Government transmitted four communications to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>486. In the first communication, dated 13 December 2011, the Government replied to a 
prompt intervention letter transmitted by the Working Group jointly with two other special 
procedures mechanisms, on 28 October 2011, regarding the alleged arrests of 
representatives of member associations of the Euro-Mediterranean Federation Against 
Enforced Disappearances (FEMED), Messrs. <b>Kemal Aydin</b>, <b>Selahattin Tekin</b> and <b>Cemal 
Bektas</b> from Yakay-der, and Ms. <b>Nahide Ormani</b> from Mothers for Peace 
(A/HRC/19/58/Rev.1, par. 598). The Government reported that the aforementioned 
individuals were arrested for illegal activities falling within the scope of the investigation of 
a terrorist organisation known as the PKK/KCK. The Government further reported that, in 
2007, the Diyarbakir Chief Public Prosecutor&#8216;s Office initiated an investigation (number 
</p>
<p>20007/997) to transcribe the activities of the so-called Koma Civaken Kurdistan Parliament 
of Turkey (KCK/TM) that operates as the urban wing of the illegal PKK/KONGRA-GEL 
terrorist organization. In relation to Messrs. Aydin, Tekin and Bektas, the Government 
reported that they did have the opportunity to be assisted by lawyers and their relatives 
were informed about their situation; and that none of them lodged a complaint against any 
law enforcement officers involved in the investigation process. Regarding Ms. Ormani, the 
Government reported that she was taken into custody after her home was searched upon the 
instruction of Silopi Chief Public Prosecutor&#8216;s Office; she was detained for 48 hours upon 
the written instruction of the Prosecutor&#8216;s office; a member of her family was informed 
</p>
<p>during the search of her home; she was assisted by her lawyer while in custody; she </p>


<p>benefited from her legal rights during the investigation stage; and she did not lodge a 
complaint against any law enforcement officer. 
</p>
<p>487. In the second communication, dated 5 March 2012, the Government provided 
information on 10 outstanding cases. The information provided was considered insufficient 
to lead to the clarification of the 10 cases, although the six-month rule had previously been 
applied to three of the cases. 
</p>
<p>488. In the third communication, dated 6 July 2012, the Government provided 
information on 18 outstanding cases. The information provided was not considered 
sufficient to clarify the cases. 
</p>
<p>489. In the fourth communication, dated 22 October 2012, the Government responded to 
the prompt intervention letter of 9 August 2012. The Government reported, inter alia, that 
all defence lawyers were able to attend the hearing but some did not attend on their own 
initiatives; according safety precautions, audio and video recorders (including cell phones) 
could not be admitted to the hearing room and the accused could not defend themselves in 
their native languages; the hearings were held open to the public, although some hearings 
were held in closed sessions in order to maintain discipline and order. The Government 
reported that there was no factual information or tangible evidence supporting the 
allegation that Mr. Bektas&#8216; detention on remand was because of his work on 
disappearances, and that Mr. Bektas was being tried on the charge of being a member of an 
armed terrorist organization. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>490. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 182 cases to the 
Government; of those, 49 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 72 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, one case was discontinued, and 60 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>491. In relation to the communication transmitted under the prompt intervention 
procedure on 9 August 2012, the Working Group would like to recall the Declaration, 
which affirms that States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations 
of cases of disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those 
conducting the investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. 
The Working Group would also like to recall that, in its resolution 21/4, the Human Rights 
Council urged Governments to take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of 
enforced or involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced 
disappearances and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any 
intimidation, persecution, reprisals or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected, 
paying special attention to women as relatives of disappeared persons in the context of their 
struggle to resolve the disappearance of members of their families. </p>
