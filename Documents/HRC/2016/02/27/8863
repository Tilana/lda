<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government of Morocco, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 22 to 25 June 2009. The Working 
Group was represented by its Chairman, Mr. Santiago Corcuera, and two members, Mr. 
Olivier de Frouville and Mr. Jeremy Sarkin. The purpose of the visit was to collect 
information with a view to clarifying certain unresolved cases of enforced or involuntary 
disappearance, to study the situation with respect to disappearances in Morocco in the light 
of international human rights standards and to take stock of the work of the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group commends the work done by the Commission and considers 
that this experience should serve as a model for other States. It welcomes, in particular, the 
Commission&#8217;s approach to the gender dimension, its practice of holding public hearings, its 
efforts to establish the truth concerning serious human rights violations and its creative 
approach to reparation, which distinguishes between individual and community reparation. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group regrets, however, that, four years after the completion of the 
Commission&#8217;s work, many of its recommendations have not been implemented, despite the 
fact that the task of ensuring follow-up was entrusted to the national human rights 
institution, the Consultative Council on Human Rights; the Council&#8217;s independence and

<p>authority require further strengthening. 
</p>
<p> While the Equity and Reconciliation Commission has helped to shed at least some 
light on 742 enforced disappearances, the complete list of names of the disappeared persons 
and the full details of their cases have yet to be made public. Doubts remain as to the 
identity of some exhumed bodies, which the Moroccan Government has a duty to dispel by 
performing DNA testing. 
</p>
<p> Likewise, the failure to publish the amounts awarded and decisions issued in respect 
of individual reparation has prevented the results of that part of the programme from being 
evaluated. As for community reparation, the Working Group encourages the Government to 
expedite efforts in that area while respecting the participatory process defined by the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group has received allegations that enforced disappearances took 
place after 1999 in the context of the fight against terrorism and, while taking note of the 
Government&#8217;s expressed determination no longer to tolerate such practices, calls on it to 
take all necessary measures to prevent a recurrence in the future. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommends the adoption of a certain number of legislative 
measures, such as the introduction in the Criminal Code of a separate offence of enforced 
disappearance and the ratification by Morocco of several international instruments, in 
particular the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, of 2006. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also recommends the adoption of measures to put an end to 
impunity, which would constitute a first step towards ensuring that enforced disappearances 
will not recur in the future.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Morocco, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 22 to 25 June 2009. The Working 
Group was represented by its Chairman, Mr. Santiago Corcuera, and two members, Mr. 
Olivier de Frouville and Mr. Jeremy Sarkin. The purpose of the visit was to gather 
information with a view to clarifying certain unresolved cases of enforced or involuntary 
disappearance, to study the situation with respect to disappearances in Morocco in the light 
of international human rights standards and to take stock of the work of the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission. 
</p>
<p>2. The delegation was able to meet with the Minister of Justice and senior 
representatives of the Government and the judicial system, members of the Consultative 
Council on Human Rights, NGOs, victims&#8217; family members, lawyers and other civil society 
actors. The Working Group visited the former detention centres and the cemeteries in 
Kelaat M&#8217;Gouna and Agdez and the former Derb Moulay Cherif detention centre in 
Casablanca. At the end of the visit, the delegation held a press conference in Rabat. 
</p>
<p>3. The delegation expresses its deep gratitude and appreciation to the Government of 
Morocco for inviting the Working Group to visit the country and for its positive 
cooperation before and during the mission. The delegation also thanks the Government for 
the assistance it provided in obtaining information which may lead to the resolution of 
some cases. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition, the delegation wishes to thank the United Nations Resident Coordinator, 
the United Nations Development Programme in Morocco and the United Nations 
Secretariat for their invaluable support during the mission. The Working Group was very 
impressed by the level of engagement of Moroccan civil society and thanks the NGOs, 
lawyers and individuals it met during the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General context 
</b></p>
<p>5. The history of Morocco after independence and at the beginning of the reign of King 
Hassan II was marked by a period of political tension between the monarchy and the 
opposition parties. There was much political persecution, which resulted in serious human 
rights violations. In 1975, a dispute arose concerning the Sahara following the withdrawal 
of Spain from that territory. The status of Western Sahara is to be determined in a 
referendum organized by the United Nations, which, however, has been postponed several 
times, owing to fundamental differences between the parties. This unresolved situation is 
closely connected to many cases of human rights violations and enforced disappearance 
reported in the country. Nevertheless, in the last decade of the reign of King Hassan II and 
under the current monarch King Mohammed VI, Morocco has sought to achieve 
reconciliation with the victims by investigating the abuses committed and acknowledging 
the responsibility of the State. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal and constitutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>6. The 1996 Constitution contains several provisions on the protection and promotion 
of the main human rights. It reaffirms the independence of the judiciary. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. The Criminal Code 
</b></p>
<p>7. There is no specific offence of enforced disappearance in national criminal 
legislation. However, the Criminal Code envisages a series of offences directly related to 
enforced disappearance, such as abduction, which, under certain circumstances, is equated 
with an act of terrorism (art. 218.1). Articles 224 et seq. and article 436 contain rules 
applicable, in many respects, to enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>8. Article 225 provides that any public servant who orders or commits an arbitrary act 
which infringes the rights of citizens is liable to loss of civic rights (<i>d&#233;gradation civique</i>). 
One concern of the Working Group is that, if a public servant pleads that he or she was 
acting on the orders of a superior, this is considered grounds for absolute discharge, and, 
consequently, the penalty can be inflicted only on the superior who gave the order. 
Exempting the actual perpetrator of the act from liability in this manner is incompatible 
with the first and second paragraphs of article 6 of the Declaration on the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which provide that no order may be invoked to 
justify an enforced disappearance, that any person receiving such an order has the duty not 
to obey it and that States must prohibit such orders. At any event, the penalty of loss of 
civic rights is insufficient, given the stipulations of article 4 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>9. During its mission, the delegation of the Working Group was informed that a new 
Criminal Code had been drafted and was about to be adopted. The new Code should 
include a separate offence of enforced disappearance, as called for in the Declaration (art. 
4). A copy of the draft was provided to the delegation as the present report was being 
completed. The Working Group therefore had to analyse the situation and make 
recommendations on the basis of the Code currently in force. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Protection during arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>10. With regard to guarantees in case of arrest or detention, the Constitution provides 
that no one may be arrested or detained pending investigation or trial except under the 
conditions and procedure stipulated by law (art. 10). 
</p><p>11. Articles 66 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide for a maximum period 
of 48 hours of detention in police custody, which may be renewed once, for 24 hours, on 
the written authorization of the Chief Prosecutor. However, in cases where there is a threat 
to national security, the duration of police custody may be up to 96 hours, renewable once 
on the written authorization of the Chief Prosecutor. In cases involving an act of terrorism, 
the 96-hour period of police custody may be renewed twice, each time for a further period 
of 96 hours. The Chief Prosecutor must authorize each application for renewal in writing. 
When each period of police custody expires, the person being held must be released or 
brought before the prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>12. A person in police custody is not entitled to the assistance of a lawyer until after the 
renewal of the period of custody. In terrorism cases, however, the prosecutor may delay the 
meeting between the client and his or her lawyer at the request of the police (art. 80). 
Article 67 provides for the registration of the arrest, questioning and release of a person in 
police custody and, in addition, requires the police to notify the person&#8217;s family of his or 
her detention. The Code stipulates that representatives of the prosecutor or the investigating 
judge must visit police and gendarmerie custody facilities to verify the lawfulness of the 
conditions of detention. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. International human rights treaties 
</b></p>
<p>13. Morocco is a party to the seven major international human rights treaties, the two 
Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10732 
</p>
<p>14. It has also ratified the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. Morocco has signed 
but not ratified the two Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court and the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>15. The Moroccan courts, by applying the provisions of the international treaties, have 
on several occasions confirmed the primacy of international human rights law over 
domestic law. The Code of Criminal Procedure recognizes explicitly the primacy of 
international texts over national laws. The Supreme Court ruled that article 11 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights takes precedence over national laws 
(judgement of 26 September 2000). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Measures taken to clarify the enforced disappearance cases submitted 
to the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Working Group expresses satisfaction at the large number of cases clarified by 
the Government of Morocco. To clarify the remaining cases, the Government has 
established an inter-ministerial committee to investigate them with assistance from the local 
judicial authorities and thus to shed light on the status of the victims of enforced 
disappearance. The efforts made by the Government should be an example to other States. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government and the delegation exchanged views on the working methods to be 
employed in respect of the as yet unresolved cases. One of the main obstacles identified by 
the Government is the phonetic transcription of names, which has prevented the 
identification of persons who have disappeared. In addition, the need to produce official 
translations of all documents drafted in Arabic before they can be examined by the experts 
has significantly delayed the progress of the work. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The phenomenon of disappearances in Morocco 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Historical context 
</b></p>
<p>18. From its establishment up to the end of 2008, the Working Group had transmitted 
249 cases to the Government. Of those cases, 191 have been clarified, 144 on the basis of 
information provided by the Government and 47 using information from other sources. 
Fifty-eight cases remain pending. The majority of the disappearances occurred between 
1972 and 1980. Most of these cases involved persons alleged to have disappeared because 
they &#8212; or members of their families &#8212; were known or suspected to belong to the Frente 
Polisario, because they were known or suspected to have ties to left wing intellectual 
movements, or because they had participated in putsches organized against King Hassan II. 
Some of these persons were students or trade unionists, while others were journalists or 
members of opposition political parties. 
</p>
<p>19. One aspect which distinguishes the phenomenon of enforced disappearances in 
Morocco is the fact that more than 100 disappeared persons were eventually freed at the 
beginning of the 1990s following a royal pardon. Consequently, they were able to testify 
about the conditions in which they were held and about the systematic use of torture. They 
were also able to identify the various detention centres to which they were taken and to 
provide information on the fate of other disappeared persons. These survivors bear living 
witness to the physical and mental harm resulting from years of secret detention and to its 
lasting effects. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Allegations concerning recent disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Working Group has received allegations of persons being arrested, abducted or 
detained pending investigation or trial for prolonged periods since 1999, mainly in the 
context of the fight against terrorism; the victims did not have access to a lawyer, and their 
families were not notified. These periods, during which the victim is placed outside the 
protection of the law by government agents who refuse to provide information on their 
status or whereabouts, may be considered enforced disappearances under the Declaration 
and in accordance with the general comment of the Working Group on the definition of 
enforced disappearance (A/HRC/7/2, para. 26). 
</p><p>21. According to these allegations, the National Surveillance Directorate, which is 
responsible for ensuring the security and protection of the State and its institutions, is 
involved in the enforced disappearances. Since its staff are not judicial police officers, the 
Directorate is not authorized to make arrests, hold persons in custody or question suspects. 
There are allegations that the Directorate&#8217;s agents have carried out arrests without 
providing any explanation to the persons concerned or producing any arrest warrant. 
Reportedly, these persons are taken to the Directorate&#8217;s headquarters in T&#233;mara, which, it is 
claimed, is a secret unofficial detention centre. Furthermore, the victims&#8217; families are 
generally not notified of the arrest of their loved one, or of the place in which he or she is 
being held, although article 67 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the family 
of a suspect be informed as soon as a decision has been taken to detain him or her pending 
investigation or trial. It was also reported that family members who demanded that the 
authorities inform them of the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones received no 
response or were told that no information was available. Persons were thus held for long 
periods in the centre in T&#233;mara without having access to either a lawyer or their families. 
</p>
<p>22. After being detained secretly for a certain time, some persons were reportedly 
transferred to official detention centres and proceedings were initiated against them. The 
Working Group received allegations that, in certain cases, the date of arrest indicated in the 
report submitted to the judicial authorities was falsified in order to cover up the prolonged 
period of illegal detention. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group has also received information concerning Morocco&#8217;s 
participation in the &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; programme and the secret transfer of persons 
to Morocco, to unofficial facilities in which they were tortured. These &#8220;unacknowledged 
detentions&#8221; amount to enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group notes that the Government considers these allegations to be 
abusive and unjustified. It notes with satisfaction the commitment of the Moroccan 
authorities not to tolerate or permit any form of forced or secret detention, even for short 
periods. The Government has stated that a visit by the Chief Prosecutor of the Rabat Court 
of Appeal to the headquarters of the National Surveillance Directorate established 
categorically that it is not a secret detention centre. Nevertheless, the Working Group 
reminds the authorities that they are obliged to investigate all serious allegations of 
enforced disappearances, in accordance with article 13 of the Declaration. The Working 
Group has received numerous allegations of such practices and is convinced that more 
effort should be made to investigate these allegations, in order to prevent the crime of 
enforced disappearance from recurring. The Moroccan authorities assured the Working 
Group that they have investigated systematically the allegations brought to their attention. </p>

</p>
<p><b> IV. Legal and institutional means of combating disappearances: 
work and recommendations of the Equity and Reconciliation 
Commission 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Establishment of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>25. In recent years, as Morocco has become more open to democracy, it has developed 
mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights. It has also sought to make 
reparation for the significant human rights violations committed in the past. In this respect, 
Morocco may be regarded as a genuine model for the countries of the Middle East. 
</p>
<p>26. The process of instituting mechanisms to protect human rights and achieve 
reconciliation with the past began in 1990, when King Hassan II established the 
Consultative Council on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>27. In 1999, the Council drafted a solemn recommendation to King Mohammed VI, 
inviting him to set up a body to compensate victims of human rights violations. The King, 
in his first public statement, recognized the responsibility of the State for the 
disappearances. He appointed an independent arbitration commission to determine the 
different amounts of compensation payable in respect of arbitrary detention or enforced 
disappearance cases between 1956 and 1999. The commission began its work on 1 
September 1999 and was active for about four years. 
</p>
<p>28. Pursuant to a recommendation of the Council, in 2003 the King established the 
Equity and Reconciliation Commission by royal decree. From 2004 to 2005, the 
Commission investigated serious human rights violations which had occurred between 
independence (1956) and 1999. It is rather unusual for a State to look so far back into its 
past (43 years); that this was done without a change of political regime is all the more 
remarkable. Some of the Commission&#8217;s members, including its Chairperson, were former 
political prisoners and torture survivors, which gave greater credibility to the authorities&#8217; 
expressed intent to treat past human rights violations seriously. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Report of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>29. In November 2005, the Commission submitted its report to the King, who decided to 
make the document public on 6 January 2006. The report comprises three sections, 
concerning the historical aspects, the issue of reparation and, lastly, proposals for reform. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group views the work of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission 
in Morocco as a remarkable undertaking which may serve as an example for other countries 
of the region or other regions of the world where it is decided to embark on a process of 
transitional justice, with a view to achieving reconciliation with the past. While there is 
room for criticism, the Commission has achieved very positive results. 
</p>
<p>31. The fact that the Commission&#8217;s work covered such a long period, that it gathered 
testimony from thousands of victims, held public hearings, including some with media 
coverage, and initiated a process which should lead to the creation of an archive, are 
extremely positive aspects. The Working Group congratulates the Commission on 
integrating the gender dimension in its working methods and notes that the assistance 
requested and received by the Commission from international experts was particularly 
helpful. The Commission appears to have examined numerous cases, determined the fate 
and identified the remains of some victims, and established in its reports the details of the 
violations committed and, where relevant, the causes of death. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>32. Nevertheless, the Commission has also been the subject of much criticism, notably 
concerning its inability to compel persons who might be responsible for past abuses or who 
might have information on such abuses to give evidence. Other criticisms relate to the 
political context in general and, in particular, to the impunity of the perpetrators of serious 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>33. The Consultative Council on Human Rights was entrusted with the follow-up to the 
Commission&#8217;s work, including the investigations which remained incomplete and the 
making of reparation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to truth and reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Public hearings and testimony 
</b></p>
<p>34. The public hearings organized for victims constituted the most visible dimension of 
the work of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. The Commission&#8217;s mandate did 
not refer to the holding of hearings, but its members interpreted the provisions requiring it 
to contribute to and enrich the culture of dialogue as authorizing such hearings. Seven 
public hearings took place, in Rabat, Figuig, Rachidia, Khenifra, Marrakech and El 
Hoceima, between December 2004 and May 2005. A final public hearing scheduled to be 
held in Laayoune, Western Sahara, was cancelled for political and security reasons. 
</p>
<p>35. The hearings drew a large number of participants. The media paid greater attention 
to the live broadcasts of the hearings on Moroccan television and radio than to other aspects 
of the Commission&#8217;s work. Given the high rate of illiteracy among the population, 
television and radio were the most effective means of communication, capable of reaching 
millions of people. 
</p>
<p>36. Although the hearings were subject to strict rules, they enabled some victims to tell 
their stories publicly. These accounts helped to bring about an experience of catharsis. No 
questions were allowed, and it was prohibited to identify the perpetrators or persons 
responsible; the testimony given focused on witnesses&#8217; experiences as victims, precluding 
accusation. They could mention only the place where they had endured their suffering and 
the authorities which had maltreated them. Some victims felt that these constraints rendered 
the process of establishing the truth, which had been the goal set by the Commission, 
considerably less effective. 
</p>
<p>37. The process itself, and its conclusions, are a powerful legacy of the Commission&#8217;s 
work, mainly in terms of the realization of the right to truth and the promotion of 
reconciliation. The national dialogue and the numerous events, workshops and other 
activities held to promote and facilitate the Commission&#8217;s work made a valuable 
contribution to the reconciliation process. Some victims with whom the Working Group 
met described this process positively and emphasized their desire to play a part in it. Others 
have written books recounting their experiences, which deserve to be more widely 
publicized among the Moroccan community as they are a tool for reconciliation.1 These

</p>
<p>victims have stated that, even though they remain forever marked by what they underwent, 
the fact of having attended the hearings has helped them to feel at peace with themselves. 
Other victims, however, have been less positive about their experiences. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The right to truth and the cases of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>38. With regard to establishing the truth, the final report of the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission states that the cases of 742 disappeared persons have been 
resolved. Of these persons, 89 died in secret detention centres; 173 during their arbitrary 
detention or enforced disappearance, though their place of burial has not been determined; 
11 during armed clashes between 1961 and 1964; and 325 owing to the use of excessive 
force during demonstrations. Lastly, 144 perished in armed clashes in the disputed region of 
Western Sahara. The report also indicates that 66 cases remain pending; these cases are 
reportedly to be investigated by the committee established by the Consultative Council on 
Human Rights to follow-up on the Commission&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group welcomes the efforts which have led to the resolution of 742 
cases of enforced disappearance. It notes, however, that some of these cases have not been 
clarified in the manner specified in its methods of work. In other words, detailed 
information on the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared persons &#8212; that is, at the very 
least, the circumstances of the disappearance and the name of the place of detention or 
place of burial if the person has died &#8212; has not been disclosed. 
</p>
<p>40. The Council has been assigned the task of monitoring the implementation of the 
Commission&#8217;s recommendations, in cooperation with the Government and the other 
stakeholders. It had announced that the detailed list of the disappearances examined by the 
Commission would be published in 2006, but, three years later, this has yet to be done. The 
Working Group was informed after its mission that a follow-up report drafted by the 
Council was being finalized. According to the Council, 58 additional cases have been 
clarified, while 8 remain unresolved and are still being investigated by it. 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group is cognizant of the difficulties inherent in this exercise, 
particularly where DNA testing is concerned, but it calls on the Council to publish as soon 
as possible a consolidated list of the 742 disappeared persons&#8217; cases, stating the 
circumstances of the disappearances, and the 66 pending cases. 
</p>
<p>42. The publication of the names would be helpful in determining whether there is any 
overlap with the cases still pending before the Working Group. It would also dispel some 
uncertainty as to the supposed number of disappeared persons, an issue raised by certain 
families with whom the Working Group met; they assert that, while they submitted 
disappearance cases and gave evidence to the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, no 
mention was made of these cases subsequently. The families state that they wrote to the 
Council to request information but received no response. Moreover, research carried out by 
the Working Group has shown that some families have had access to information on their 
own cases through informal channels, while others have not. The publication of the results 
would thus remedy any inequality of treatment among the different victims&#8217; families. 
</p>
<p>43. The process of identifying the victims sometimes appears controversial, with 
families refusing to accept that the graves they are shown contain the remains of their loved 
ones. Some families ask how the State can rely on the word of prison staff to determine 
which bodies are resting in which graves and have demanded DNA testing. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Working Group considers it very positive that some burial sites have been 
located, but it also believes that the bodies recovered from these graves must be identified 
with certainty. Some families allege that results have yet to be received from the DNA 
samples taken from relatives. The Working Group is of the view that the use of independent 
pathologists could resolve these problems. Lastly, there is a need to continue the search for 
bodies, including in places which have not yet been excavated, such as Fixed Point 3 in 
Rabat (PF 3). 
</p><p>45. Many disappearances are linked to the situation in Western Sahara. They represent 
the majority of the cases before the Working Group. The reports of the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission also attest that many disappearances took place in the region 
and that prisoners of Saharan origin died in secret detention centres such as those in Kelaat 
M&#8217;Gouna and Agdez. However, the Working Group has received allegations that the goals 
of truth and reconciliation have not been realized in this region. According to these 
allegations, the Commission did not succeed in shedding light on many of the cases referred 
to it. The Working Group therefore regretted the cancellation of the public hearing 
scheduled to take place in Laayoune. Some witnesses claim that victims from Western 
Sahara have not received equal reparations (see paras. 47 et seq. below). 
46. The Working Group considers that reconciliation is a long-term task and that it may 
therefore be some years before the positive effects become apparent. To ensure a successful 
outcome to the process, it is vital to achieve greater involvement of groups and individuals 
who have felt excluded from it. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The right to reparation 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Working Group is of the view that article 19 of the Declaration encompasses 
not only the right to financial compensation, but also the right to obtain &#8220;the means for as 
complete a rehabilitation as possible&#8221;. This refers to &#8220;medical and psychological care and 
rehabilitation for &#8230; physical or mental damage as well as to legal and social rehabilitation, 
guarantees of non-repetition, restoration of personal liberty, family life, citizenship, 
employment or property, return to one&#8217;s place of residence and similar forms of restitution, 
satisfaction and reparation which may remove the consequences of the enforced 
disappearance&#8221; (Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, general 
comments on article 19 of the Declaration (E/CN.4/1998/43, para. 75)). 
</p><p>48. The approach adopted by the Equity and Reconciliation Commission was intended 
to respond to the criticisms directed at the work of the arbitration commission which 
preceded it. The Commission&#8217;s statute establishes its competence to pursue the work 
undertaken by the arbitration commission, but also to make recommendations regarding the 
provision of compensation for all other harm suffered by victims, in the form of medical 
and psychological rehabilitation as well as social reintegration. The Commission was also 
mandated to resolve any administrative, legal or employment-related problem and to deal 
with cases of deprivation of property. In addition, the Commission was given the task of 
formulating recommendations regarding the preservation of memory, the prevention of a 
recurrence, the removal of the consequences of the violations, and the restoration and 
consolidation of confidence in the rule of law and respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>49. The Commission carried out its mandate in a progressive manner, basing itself not 
only on international legal norms in this area, but also on the latest developments and the 
discussions which have taken place at the international level concerning reparation for 
victims of violations. Thus, it took account of the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the 
Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human 
Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2005/35). This text contains broad definitions of the concept of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10732 
</p>
<p>&#8220;victim&#8221; of human rights violations and that of &#8220;reparation&#8221;, which covers not only 
compensation, but also restitution, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition, including 
disclosure of the truth and acknowledgement of State responsibility. The Commission also 
gave consideration to the need to integrate a gender perspective in the reparation 
programme, women having suffered different violations from those inflicted on men or, 
where the violations were the same, having been affected differently by them. 
</p>
<p>50. The Commission based its own approach to and philosophy of reparation on these 
elements and instituted a reparation programme consisting of two components: individual 
reparations and community reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Individual reparations 
</b></p>
<p>51. According to the final report of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission (vol. 3, 
p. 66), 16,861 complaints were received in total. Of these, 7,082 were declared inadmissible 
on the basis of various criteria; the Commission ruled on the 9,779 remaining cases. In 
6,385 cases (37.9 per cent), it decided to grant financial compensation; in 1,895 cases (11.2 
per cent), it granted financial compensation while making recommendations for other types 
of reparation; and, in 1,499 cases (8.9 per cent), it made recommendations only. The 
Consultative Council on Human Rights continued the Commission&#8217;s work on the expiry of 
the latter body&#8217;s mandate, taking over both pending cases and the disbursement of 
compensation to victims. In a document transmitted to the Working Group concerning the 
follow-up to the Commission&#8217;s recommendations, the Council affirmed that, as at 20 
September 2009, no fewer than 17,012 victims had received compensation. 
</p>
<p>52. The Commission has given a detailed account of the methodology on which its 
decisions were based. According to its report, it combined fixed payments (in rape cases, 
for example) with compensation reflecting the particular circumstances of each case, in 
order to achieve equality and fairness, the two concepts being central to its approach. It also 
established its own rules for determining the compensation due to plaintiffs, following very 
specific criteria. The report bears witness to the scientific and rigorous approach adopted. 
Nevertheless, during the visit by the Working Group, NGOs and individuals expressed 
criticism of the Commission&#8217;s work on individual compensation and the follow-up 
undertaken. 
</p>
<p>53. Inexplicable differences of treatment were alleged between victims who had met the 
same fate. It was reported that victims of Saharan origin, in particular, were better 
compensated than others; at the same time, other sources indicated that numerous cases 
from the region had been unjustly declared inadmissible or rejected by the Commission. 
The decisions on compensation made by the arbitration commission and the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission have not been published. The reason put forward by the former 
members of the Commission and the current members of the Consultative Council on 
Human Rights is that publishing these decisions would violate the victims&#8217; right to 
confidentiality. However, some victims have informed the Working Group that they would 
not oppose publication of the decisions concerning their own cases. The Working Group 
considers that it is the failure to publish the decisions which has caused the controversy as 
to whether the principles of equality and fairness foregrounded by the Commission have 
been respected. 
</p>
<p>54. According to the explanations given to the Working Group, the Commission decided 
on compensation once families had accepted the results of the investigations. However, the 
Working Group has been informed that victims&#8217; full case files were not transmitted to the 
families; instead, the results of the investigations were communicated orally. Some families 
refused compensation on the grounds that the information provided to them was 
insufficient, particularly in cases where the Commission had concluded that the victim was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>dead but that the place of burial could not be identified, or where it claimed to have 
identified the place of burial, but the family disputed its conclusions. 
</p>
<p>55. Concern was also expressed to the Working Group about the follow-up to the 
Commission&#8217;s recommendations on measures other than compensation, measures in 
respect, for example, of employment, social reintegration, the problem of dispossessions 
and medical rehabilitation. The Commission recommended that health coverage should be 
granted to victims pursuant to Act No. 00-65, but also that a permanent structure should be 
established to provide advice and assistance to victims, and, lastly, that some 50 victims 
suffering chronic serious health problems should receive immediate medical attention. 
According to some sources, these recommendations have not been implemented since 2004, 
and the situation of the victims remains unchanged. The Council asserts that the programme 
is being implemented and that 2,886 victims have been given a card enabling them to 
receive medical coverage. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Community reparations 
</b></p>
<p>56. The granting of community reparations represents the most original part of the work 
of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. While the concept of community reparations 
exists in legal philosophy and in some judgements of the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights, examples of its application remain rare and limited in scale. The Commission&#8217;s 
decision to develop this aspect of reparation was unanimously welcomed. In its final report, 
the Commission explains that community reparations are a response to the situation of 
certain communities which consider themselves to have suffered collectively, directly or 
indirectly, from the consequences of the outbreaks of political violence and the ensuing 
serious violations and which are in regions where serious violations occurred or where 
centres for enforced disappearance or arbitrary detention were located. By way of 
community reparations, the Commission has called for the adoption of and support for 
numerous socio-economic and cultural development programmes to benefit several regions 
as well as groups of victims (notably women) in a number of cities and regions. The 
Commission has recommended, in particular, that former illegal detention centres, 
including Tazmamart, Agdez and Derb Moulay Cherif in Casablanca, should be converted 
to other uses. 
</p>
<p>57. In practice, the community reparation programme is twofold: it involves the 
conversion of former detention centres to memorials, but it also provides for the launching 
of social and development programmes from which regions and individuals who have been 
victims of serious human rights violations may benefit. 
</p>
<p>58. The programme is financed in large part by the European Union. On 5 July 2007, the 
European Union signed an agreement with Morocco under which it pledged to provide 3 
million euros out of total programme costs of 4 million euros, with the remaining 1 million 
euros to be provided by Morocco. 
</p>
<p>59. Like all other observers, the Working Group warmly welcomed this new approach to 
reparation. It was able to visit the former detention centres covered by the programme &#8212; 
Kelaat M&#8217;Gouna, Agdez and Derb Moulay Cherif &#8212; and to meet with the local authorities 
and voluntary associations involved in community reparation. 
</p>
<p>60. In Agdez, the members of the Working Group attended a presentation explaining the 
specific plans developed for the former detention centre. At Derb Moulay Cherif, two 
voluntary association members gave an account to the Working Group of their project for 
the conversion of the site. In both cases, it is a question of finding a balance between two 
imperatives: the preservation of memory, and the adoption of measures to support the 
socio-economic development of populations that have suffered discrimination. These sites 
are therefore to incorporate elements intended to preserve memory, for example &#8220;corridors </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10732 
</p>
<p>of remembrance&#8221; or commemorative plaques, while providing a venue for development 
initiatives, such as dedicated social services for women or cultural centres. 
</p>
<p>61. The Working Group was very interested in and impressed by the ideas and 
discussions to which the community reparation programme has given rise. It was 
disappointed, however, to observe that work on the renovation of the centres it visited had 
not actually begun. The centres located near Kelaat M&#8217;Gouna and Agdez appear to have 
been abandoned. Part of the <i>ksar</i> (fort) in Agdez is in ruins. In Kelaat M&#8217;Gouna, prisoners&#8217; 
personal effects have been collected and placed in rooms at random: there are suitcases, 
clothes and mattresses on the floor and, in some cases, drawings on the walls, apparently 
done by prisoners. At both sites, the only work begun dates from the time of the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission, when graves were excavated in order to identify the bodies 
and re-inter them in new graves bearing the presumed names of the victims. 
</p>
<p>62. One part of the Derb Moulay Cherif site &#8212; the ground floor of a building situated in 
the middle of a working-class district of Casablanca &#8212; is in ruins, while another part 
(containing the &#8220;<i>chambre noire</i>&#8221; (black room) described by Jaouad Mdidech in his book) is 
occupied by a tenant. The rest of the building continues to be occupied by tenants and 
owners. The members of the Consultative Council on Human Rights explained that the 
issue of the occupancy of the site has yet to be resolved and that this is delaying the start of 
renovations. However, in 2004, the Commission affirmed in its report that the occupants of 
buildings, the ground floors of which formed part of the former Derb Moulay Cherif 
detention centre had been moved and were in the process of being rehoused. 
</p>
<p>63. In the same paragraph, the Commission mentioned another detention centre, in the 
vicinity of Tazmamart, which the Working Group was unable to visit owing to lack of time. 
The Commission indicated that the Royal Armed Forces had left the barracks near 
Tazmamart. The Working Group was informed by other sources that, when the army left 
the barracks, it destroyed two buildings in which prisoners had been secretly detained, some 
of them for 18 years. 
</p>
<p>64. According to the Commission, the discussions on community reparations were 
founded on a participatory approach, involving civil society human rights defenders 
working in the field of local development as well as development agencies and institutions 
active in the regions concerned. Some of the victims with whom the Working Group met 
stated that the Consultative Council on Human Rights had not paid sufficient attention to 
the views of victims. Either they had not been consulted, or else their opinions had not been 
clearly taken into account. 
</p>
<p>65. In conclusion, the Working Group acknowledges the innovative approach taken by 
the Commission in respect of community reparation. A report by the Consultative Council 
on Human Rights, received by the Working Group after its mission, describes the lengthy 
process for the implementation of the programme and the many initiatives and events 
organized since 2007, the date on which the project was officially launched. The Working 
Group understands the difficulties encountered in putting this new and ambitious idea into 
practice and the need not to rush the process, so as to allow time for genuine consultation 
and discussions with the various actors involved. However, the Working Group remains 
concerned that so little appears to have been done to implement the Commission&#8217;s 
recommendations four years after their formulation. 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group recommends that the Government should expedite the 
implementation of the recommendations while respecting the participatory approach 
outlined by the Commission, notably through the involvement of former disappeared 
persons who were held at the centres. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. The right to justice 
</b>67. Morocco has a sophisticated legal framework containing a series of provisions 
governing the judicial system and other institutions with powers to investigate, prosecute 
and bring to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations. 
68. In addition to the judicial system, Morocco has a national human rights institution, 
the Consultative Council on Human Rights, which is competent to investigate human rights 
violations, render opinions on human rights issues and handle cases of violations. The 
Council has been made responsible for ensuring follow-up to the recommendations of the 
Equity and Reconciliation Commission. 
</p>
<p>69. In principle, some lacunae notwithstanding, the configuration of the criminal system 
appears to be in conformity with the Declaration, which stipulates that: &#8220;Each State shall 
ensure that the competent authority shall have the necessary powers and resources to 
conduct the investigation effectively, including powers to compel attendance of witnesses 
and production of relevant documents and to make immediate on-site visits.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>70. Despite this requirement, when the Working Group asked about the number of 
prosecutions and convictions for enforced disappearances (or abductions committed by 
State agents), the official sources to whom the question was put replied that the process put 
in place by the Commission was focused on achieving reconciliation, not bringing legal 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group recognizes that the role of a reconciliation commission is not to 
prosecute the perpetrators of human rights violations but to seek justice through non-
judicial methods. Nevertheless, experience in several countries where truth and 
reconciliation commissions have been established shows that this does not prevent 
perpetrators of crimes from being charged, prosecuted and eventually convicted. Moreover, 
the Commission itself recommended in its report that a comprehensive, integrated and 
multilateral national strategy should be developed to combat impunity (vol. 4, p. 82). 
</p><p>72. The Working Group takes particular note of the fact that, four years after the project 
was launched, this recommendation has still not been implemented in respect of 
perpetrators of enforced disappearances, even in cases where, according to official sources, 
the supposed perpetrators testified before the Commission. The Working Group shares the 
view of the Human Rights Committee, which stated that it was &#8220;concerned that those 
responsible for disappearances have still not been identified, tried and punished&#8221; and 
recommended that the State party should &#8220;conduct the necessary investigations to identify, 
try and punish those responsible for such crimes&#8221; (CCPR/CO/82/MAR, para. 12). 
73. Senior officials of the Consultative Council on Human Rights indicated to the 
Working Group that the reason for which no prosecution or conviction had taken place was 
that victims and their families had not lodged complaints with the authorities. 
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group noted that the desire to prosecute and punish the perpetrators of 
enforced disappearances and other flagrant human rights violations was far from unanimous 
in Moroccan civil society, even among victims. When asked whether they wished to see 
those responsible for enforced disappearances jailed, some victims and families stated very 
clearly that they did, while others were more hesitant or replied that they were not seeking 
to settle a score and preferred to forgive. 
</p>
<p>75. Some victims told the Working Group that they had attempted to bring certain 
enforced disappearance cases before the courts but without success. The Working Group 
also received reports indicating that some perpetrators of violations remained in their posts 
and that the victims would have appreciated it if these individuals had, at the very least, 
been removed from their official functions. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-10732 
</p>
<p>76. Even if a large majority of the Moroccan population expressed the wish to forgive 
the perpetrators of enforced disappearances and other flagrant human rights violations, the 
State of Morocco would nevertheless have an obligation under international norms to 
prevent those responsible for these odious crimes from enjoying impunity. 
</p><p>77. The Working Group wishes to emphasize the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the 
Declaration and, in addition, article 18, which stipulates that &#8220;persons who &#8230; are alleged to 
have committed offences referred to in article 4, paragraph 1, &#8230; shall not benefit from any 
special amnesty law or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them from 
any criminal proceedings or sanction&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>78. The Working Group has stated on other occasions that, even in the absence of an 
amnesty law, if the circumstances obtaining guarantee absolute impunity, this constitutes a 
&#8220;similar measure&#8221; effectively exempting perpetrators from any criminal proceedings or 
sanction. It considers that such a situation amounts to a &#8220;de facto amnesty&#8221; and is contrary 
to the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>79. A clear sign of the climate of impunity is the fact that, according to some victims, 
those responsible for enforced disappearances or other flagrant human rights violations 
have not been removed from their official functions; this represents a violation of article 16 
of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>80. The issues raised above notwithstanding, the Working Group wishes to take account 
of the argument put forward by certain official sources to the effect that it is not the 
prosecution and conviction of perpetrators that represents the route to reconciliation for 
Morocco, but transitional justice as effected by the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. 
It is no less the case that absolute impunity remains contrary to international law, even 
where a commendable reconciliation process is in place. 
</p>
<p>81. The Working Group, in its general comment on article 18 of the Declaration, 
recognized that, &#8220;in States where systematic or massive violations of human rights have 
occurred as a result of internal armed conflict or political repression, legislative measures 
that could lead to finding the truth and reconciliation through pardon might be the only 
option to terminate or prevent disappearances&#8221;, provided that such measures are consistent 
with the Declaration (E/CN.4/2006/56, para. 49). 
</p><p>82. The Working Group considers that, despite the positive experience of the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission, the situation in Morocco does not correspond to the 
exceptional conditions described in paragraph 8 of the aforementioned general comment. 
</p>
<p>83. The Working Group considers that Morocco should adopt the necessary legislative 
and other measures to put an end to impunity. This is the first step towards ensuring the 
non-recurrence of enforced disappearances and other flagrant human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>84. The Working Group notes that, pursuant to the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
of Action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993, &#8220;Morocco has begun 
to devise an action plan and national strategy on human rights, in partnership with the 
Consultative Council on Human Rights and the European Commission&#8221; 
(A/HRC/WG.6/1/MAR/1, para. 149). It would be desirable for the action plan to be 
founded on a firm commitment by Morocco to put an end to impunity and to take the 
measures outlined in the previous paragraphs, under the monitoring and with the support of 
the Council. 
</p>
<p>85. In the same vein, the Working Group also wishes to encourage the Council to pursue 
the work of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, in particular the investigations into 
enforced disappearances, and to transmit cases to the competent authorities so that criminal 
inquiries can be conducted, even where no third party complaint has been lodged. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Working Group is aware that the Council has the power to consider cases of violations of 
human rights and to make appropriate recommendations to the competent authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>86. <b>The Working Group wishes to thank the Government of Morocco for its 
diligence in seeking to clarify the cases pending before the Working Group, for the 
continuous spirit of cooperation it has shown and for its expressed political will to take 
all necessary measures to prevent enforced disappearances and build a society based 
on the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.</b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>The Working Group commends the work of the Equity and Reconciliation 
Commission and considers that this experience should serve as a model for other 
States. It welcomes, in particular, the Commission&#8217;s approach to the gender 
dimension and its creative approach to reparation, distinguishing between individual 
and community reparation.</b> 
</p>
<p>88. <b>In order to guarantee that the flagrant violations which have taken place in 
Morocco do not recur and to give impetus to the reforms under way, the Commission 
formulated a series of recommendations concerning institutional reform, the adoption 
of a national strategy to combat impunity and, lastly, the different phases to be 
followed in implementing these recommendations.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The Working Group is conscious of the fact that, four years after the 
completion of this process, many of the Commission&#8217;s recommendations have still not 
been implemented, and it takes note of the Government&#8217;s commitment to implement 
them soon. During the universal periodic review of the country&#8217;s human rights 
situation, Morocco accepted a total of 11 recommendations encouraging it, inter alia, 
to continue to implement the recommendations of the Equity and Reconciliation 
Commission, to continue the harmonization of its domestic law with its international 
human rights obligations and to consolidate the culture of human rights in the 
country (A/HRC/8/52, paras. 273&#8211;287). The Commission&#8217;s report contains numerous 
helpful proposals which must be implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Working Group wishes to focus on some of these proposals and to add 
some supplementary elements, which it considers to be of capital importance for the 
elimination in Morocco not only of the practice of enforced disappearances, but also of 
the risk that the practice may recur in a crisis or conflict situation.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Institutional reform 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Strengthen the independence of the judicial system 
</b>91. <b>The Working Group was informed that the Consultative Council on Human 
Rights had drafted a memorandum on judicial reform, which had been transmitted to 
the Government. On 20 August 2009, the King delivered an important statement on 
this theme, in which he expressed his determination to give new impetus to the reform.</b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>The Working Group welcomes this new stage in the reform of the judicial 
system, which demonstrates once again, if more proof were needed, the political will of 
the authorities to bring Moroccan legislation further into line with international 
standards. The Working Group is convinced that an independent and impartial 
judicial system is essential for preventing enforced disappearances and ensuring that 
perpetrators are effectively punished.</b> </p>

</p>
<p><b> 2. Reform the oversight of the security services 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Working Group was informed that the Consultative Council on Human 
Rights is currently drafting a memorandum on this issue. The goals are, inter alia, to 
enhance the image of the security services among the population, to establish a right 
of access to information concerning security operations and to put in place a 
mechanism to oversee all institutions responsible for security.</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>The Working Group welcomes these measures and the efforts made and 
recommends that the Council should take account of article 12 of the Declaration on 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Strengthen the independence and authority of the Consultative Council on Human 
Rights 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In order to reinforce the vital role played by the Council in the follow-up to the 
work of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, the Working Group suggests that 
the independence of the Council should be strengthened. To this end, the Working 
Group considers that no member of the Council should be selected by the King and 
that no ministry under the Government&#8217;s executive authority (for example, the 
Ministry of Justice) should participate in the Council&#8217;s sessions, even as a mere 
observer or in an advisory capacity. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Legislative reform 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Working Group commends the commitment to legislative reform. It 
recommends, in particular, that the international norms on enforced disappearances 
should be taken fully into account in this process. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Criminal Code 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>With respect to the strengthening of the legal framework to put an end to 
impunity and prevent enforced disappearances, the Working Group emphasizes that, 
in accordance with article 4 of the Declaration, &#8220;all acts of enforced disappearance 
shall be offences under criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties which shall 
take into account their extreme seriousness&#8221;. The Working Group notes that, while 
certain provisions of the current Criminal Code relate to enforced disappearance, 
there is no article specifically criminalizing the practice. The Working Group takes 
note that, according to official sources, the new criminal code currently being drafted 
contains a specific offence of enforced disappearance. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Working Group hopes that the legislative process leading to the realization 
of this important goal will be concluded successfully, and at the earliest opportunity. 
The text should, however, not only define the offence but also: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>Specify penalties proportionate to its extreme seriousness;</b> 
 <b>(b)</b> <b>Respect the principle that one of the fundamental characteristics of the 
offence is its ongoing nature;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(c)</b> <b>Comply with the provisions of article 17, paragraph 3, of the 
Declaration, which states that &#8220;statutes of limitations, where they exist, relating to acts 
of enforced disappearance shall be substantial and commensurate with the extreme 
seriousness of the offence&#8221;; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d)</b> <b>Guarantee that persons responsible for the offence of enforced 
disappearance are &#8220;tried only by the competent ordinary courts in each State, and not </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>by any other special tribunal, in particular military courts&#8221; (article 16, paragraph 2, 
of the Declaration);</b> 
 <b>(e)</b> <b>Guarantee that &#8220;no order or instruction of any public authority, civilian, 
military or other, may be invoked to justify an enforced disappearance&#8221; and that &#8220;any 
person receiving such an order or instruction shall have the right and duty not to obey 
it&#8221; (article 6, paragraph 1, of the Declaration).</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Criminal procedure 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Working Group observes that current criminal procedural provisions 
already offer significant guarantees against arbitrary detention and enforced 
disappearance, notably the provisions on police custody; the obligation on the 
prosecutor to notify the detained person&#8217;s family; the competence given to the 
prosecutor and investigating judge to visit detention centres and verify the lawfulness 
of the conditions of detention; and the obligation to maintain official registers of 
detentions. Nevertheless, the Working Group has received allegations that these 
provisions are not always applied. The effective implementation of these guarantees is 
thus a priority. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Working Group is also convinced that the legislation should provide 
additional guarantees, in accordance with the standards defined in international 
instruments. Among the measures that should be taken, the Working Group wishes to 
emphasize the following: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Deprivation of liberty other than in an official facility must be prohibited and 
made a criminal offence (article 10 of the Declaration) 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The law must recognize and enforce &#8220;the right to a prompt and effective legal 
remedy as a means of determining the whereabouts or state of health of persons 
deprived of their liberty and/or identifying the authority ordering &#8230; the 
deprivation of liberty&#8221; (article 9, paragraph 1, of the Declaration), and the 
obligation to render a decision on the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty 
(habeas corpus, as required in article 17, paragraph 2 (f), of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance) 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The law must guarantee the authority of the &#8220;competent national [institutions 
to] have access to all places where persons deprived of their liberty are being 
held and to each part of those places, as well as to any place in which there are 
grounds to believe that such persons may be found&#8221; (article 9, paragraph 2, of 
the Declaration) 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The law must establish the jurisdiction of the civilian criminal courts (not the 
military courts) to try any person alleged to have perpetrated an act of 
enforced disappearance, on a territorial and a personal, but also on a universal, 
basis (article 14 of the Declaration) 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. International conventions 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Working Group congratulates the Government of Morocco on its 
important contribution to the drafting and promotion of the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Morocco was one of 
the first States to sign the instrument. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Working Group looks forward to Morocco&#8217;s ratification of the Convention 
and its recognition of the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-10732 
</p>
<p><b>as provided for in articles 31 and 32 of the Convention, as well as to its ratification of 
other international instruments which have a bearing on enforced disappearance. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Morocco should ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, as the Human Rights Committee has well-established case 
law on enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Working Group also calls on Morocco to ratify the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, which qualifies enforced disappearance as a crime 
against humanity under certain conditions. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>It further encourages Morocco to ratify Protocols I and II to the Geneva 
Conventions of 12 August 1949, as Protocol I contains fundamental provisions on the 
question of &#8220;missing persons&#8221; (arts. 32 et seq.). 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. The right to truth 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Working Group considers that the work of the Equity and Reconciliation 
Commission has enabled Morocco to take an important step towards the realization of 
the right to truth in respect of past disappearances. The Commission itself recognized, 
however, that much remained to be done and issued many recommendations in that 
respect. The Working Group makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Consultative Council on Human Rights should publish a full report on the 
follow-up given to the Commission&#8217;s recommendations, including a complete 
and detailed list of the 742 disappearance cases clarified by the Commission 
and the 66 cases left pending 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The bodies found in burial sites must be formally identified, and the 
identifications fully accepted by the victims&#8217; families. When doubts remain, 
DNA testing must be conducted 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The search for bodies must continue, with the excavation of as yet 
uninvestigated sites 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>As part of the follow-up to the Commission&#8217;s work, the Council must make the 
Commission&#8217;s archives public, along with any other documents that would 
make it possible to determine whether similar situations have always been 
treated equally, particularly where victims of Saharan origin are concerned 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The arbitral decisions on individual compensation should be made public, with 
the consent of the victims, and widely disseminated, so that all persons have the 
chance to verify and comment on the &#8220;case law&#8221; of the arbitration commission, 
the Equity and Reconciliation Commission and the Council 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The complete file of each victim must be transmitted to the person concerned 
or to his or her family 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. The right to reparation 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Working Group welcomes the innovative reparation programme put in 
place by the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. It recognizes the fundamental 
measures adopted in this area, including the awarding of individual reparations based 
on arbitral decisions. However, it calls on the Moroccan authorities to go further and 
makes the following recommendations: </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10732 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The amounts of the reparations must be made public and detailed reports 
published on the steps taken to date 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The implementation of the community reparation programme must be 
accelerated while respecting the participatory approach stipulated by the 
Commission, with the involvement, notably, of former detainees held in the 
centres 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. The right to justice 
</b>108. <b>The Working Group acknowledges that the process put in place by the 
Commission was founded on reconciliation, not criminal proceedings. However, it 
remains concerned about the consequences of this approach in terms of impunity. It 
makes the following recommendation: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Effective legislative and other appropriate measures must be taken to put an 
end to the impunity of perpetrators, as a first step towards ensuring that 
enforced disappearances do not recur in the future</b> 
</p>
<p>    </p>
