<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its resolution 26/31, the Human Rights Council held a panel discussion 
</p>
<p>on the human rights situation in South Sudan, during its twenty-seventh session, on 
</p>
<p>24 September 2014. The discussion focused on identifying effective measures to improve 
</p>
<p>the human rights situation in South Sudan and to strengthen United Nations support for the 
</p>
<p>work of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan and for the 
</p>
<p>Intergovernmental Authority on Development&#8211;led peace process.  
</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was moderated by the Permanent Representative of Djibouti to 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Office at Geneva, Mohamed Said Doualeh, and was opened by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Flavia Pansieri. The 
</p>
<p>panellists were Paulino Wanawilla Unango, Minister of Justice of South Sudan, Olusegun 
</p>
<p>Obasanjo, Chair of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan, Lawrence 
</p>
<p>Korbandy, Chair of the Human Rights Commission of South Sudan, and Ibrahim Wani, 
</p>
<p>Director of the Human Rights Division of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan 
</p>
<p>(UNMISS). Seyoum Mesfin, Chair of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development 
</p>
<p>(IGAD) Mediation Team on South Sudan, had prepared a statement, which was read on his 
</p>
<p>behalf by the Permanent Representative of Ethiopia to the United Nations Office at Geneva.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report was prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 26/31. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement by the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and contributions by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening statement, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights noted that the human rights situation in South Sudan continued to be of 
</p>
<p>grave concern, despite a decline in the scale and severity of reported violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and of international humanitarian law compared to the first months of the conflict. 
</p>
<p>The Deputy High Commissioner referred to the visit to South Sudan by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, in April 2014, which had taken place 
</p>
<p>against the background of a critical level of violence, including ethnically motivated mass 
</p>
<p>slaughter and gruesome revenge killings. The Deputy High Commissioner noted that 
</p>
<p>civilians continued to bear the brunt of the ongoing armed conflict, with continued reports 
</p>
<p>of killings and wounding of civilians by all parties to the conflict as well as by other armed 
</p>
<p>groups, and serious violations of the rights of children and women. She stressed that the 
</p>
<p>number of internally displaced persons had continued to rise, and drew attention to the vast 
</p>
<p>influx of civilians into UNMISS compounds, which presented UNMISS with 
</p>
<p>unprecedented challenges.  
</p>
<p>5. The Deputy High Commissioner expressed concern that the Government and the 
</p>
<p>Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition continued to mobilize forces 
</p>
<p>and amass weapons in an effort to consolidate their respective power bases &#8212; and to 
</p>
<p>undermine the protection of civilians and the life-saving work of humanitarian agencies and 
</p>
<p>UNMISS. She also noted that the humanitarian situation had deteriorated rapidly, with the 
</p>
<p>country experiencing extreme food insecurity and facing a possible famine.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner further noted that the conflict had exacerbated the 
</p>
<p>already weak system of administration of justice, and that there had been arbitrary arrests, 
</p>
<p>incidents of prolonged detention and allegations of torture and ill-treatment in custody. A </p>


<p>steep deterioration had also been observed in the exercise of freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>including, in particular, freedom of the press and access to information.  
</p>
<p>7. The Deputy High Commissioner emphasized the need to step up efforts to protect 
</p>
<p>civilians and to ensure accountability for crimes and human rights violations committed in 
</p>
<p>the course of the conflict. She noted that a legacy of human rights violations committed in 
</p>
<p>the past had contributed to the current crisis. In that regard, she urged the international 
</p>
<p>community to put pressure on the country&#8217;s leaders to prevent further violations and abuses 
</p>
<p>by forces under their command and control, and to make clear that anyone committing 
</p>
<p>crimes and human rights violations and abuses would be held accountable.  
</p>
<p>8. The Minister of Justice of South Sudan stated that the events in Juba on 
</p>
<p>15 December 2013 had amounted to an attempted coup by the former Vice-President Riek 
</p>
<p>Machar and his supporters to overthrow an elected government. He stressed that what had 
</p>
<p>happened on that fateful day had not been an ethnic feud or struggle, but the result of a 
</p>
<p>political disagreement among politicians from different ethnic backgrounds.  
</p>
<p>9. The Minister briefed the Council on measures taken by the Government to maintain 
</p>
<p>calm and stability in the country, mentioning, inter alia, the establishment of a crisis 
</p>
<p>management committee, a peace, reconciliation and healing committee, and an 
</p>
<p>investigation committee into human rights violations and abuses committed in the course of 
</p>
<p>the conflict. He noted that the Government had regained control of areas previously under 
</p>
<p>the control of rebels in the States of Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile. The Minister stated that 
</p>
<p>the Government had accepted the cessation of hostilities and peace negotiated under IGAD 
</p>
<p>auspices, and had welcomed the Commission of Inquiry formed by the African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, under the African Union, to investigate 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses in South Sudan. He also referred to a communiqu&#233;, signed by the 
</p>
<p>Government, providing for direct negotiations between the Government and the Sudan 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition. He noted that the Popular Committee 
</p>
<p>for Peacebuilding, established by the Government, had succeeded in persuading many 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons in the UNMISS compounds to return to their homes.  
</p>
<p>10. The Minister referred to several positive developments in the country, such as the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s endorsement of a human rights agenda prepared by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission of South Sudan, and the passage of media laws by the national legislature. He 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that the Government bore the primary responsibility for protecting civilians, 
</p>
<p>and stressed that the promotion of peace, reconciliation and healing among South Sudanese 
</p>
<p>remained the Government&#8217;s major priority.  
</p>
<p>11. The Chair of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan commended 
</p>
<p>the African Union on having established the Commission. He explained that the 
</p>
<p>Commission had been entrusted with helping to bring about a united and cohesive South 
</p>
<p>Sudan via its mandate of healing, reconciliation, accountability and institutional reform. He 
</p>
<p>mentioned that the commissioners had visited Juba and other areas in the region to assess 
</p>
<p>the extent of the conflict and the human rights violations committed. They had met with 
</p>
<p>government officials, the leaders of the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement/Army in 
</p>
<p>Opposition, regional leaders in Ethiopia, Kenya, the Sudan and Uganda, and representatives 
</p>
<p>of civil society and international organizations. They had also visited camps for internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons within South Sudan and camps for refugees in neighbouring countries. 
</p>
<p>The Chair of the Commission stated that, although the conflict had started as a political 
</p>
<p>dispute within the ruling Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army, it had quickly degenerated into 
</p>
<p>an ethnic conflict that had resulted in deep division and mistrust between the two major 
</p>
<p>ethnic groups, the Dinka and the Nuer. He stressed that gross violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>had been committed, and that no political leader in South Sudan could claim innocence. He 
</p>
<p>underlined that the cycle of impunity had to stop in order for healing to take place. He also </p>


<p>noted that some form of restitution was necessary at the community level, and expressed 
</p>
<p>the hope that the work of IGAD would contribute to the healing and reconciliation process.  
</p>
<p>12. Speaking on behalf of the Chair of the IGAD Mediation Team on South Sudan, the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Representative of Ethiopia stated that IGAD continued to stress the principles of 
</p>
<p>the rule of law and human rights as the cornerstones of the peace process. He noted that 
</p>
<p>IGAD continued to urge the parties to the conflict to comply with the agreements 
</p>
<p>negotiated and to fulfil their obligations under national and international law, stressing that 
</p>
<p>IGAD would not hesitate to take action against those who would obstruct the peace process, 
</p>
<p>and hold them accountable. He acknowledged that the IGAD-led talks continued to face 
</p>
<p>challenges, as fighting had continued and the parties had failed to abide by the Cessation of 
</p>
<p>Hostilities Agreement signed in January 2014. He noted that, since the outbreak of the 
</p>
<p>conflict, millions of lives had been put at risk, education and health services had been 
</p>
<p>interrupted, and the humanitarian situation had become dire. He stressed that IGAD was 
</p>
<p>aware of the acute need for a comprehensive agreement that would address the root causes 
</p>
<p>of the crisis and create conditions for genuine and far-reaching reforms. 
</p>
<p>13. The Chair of the Human Rights Commission of South Sudan stated that the report of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights provided a detailed account of 
</p>
<p>the magnitude of the human rights abuses and violations committed in the course of the 
</p>
<p>conflict, which could not be ignored. He noted that the findings of the report underscored 
</p>
<p>the need for accountability and for mechanisms for truth-telling and reparation.  
</p>
<p>14. He explained that the Human Rights Commission had a constitutional mandate to 
</p>
<p>promote human rights, to monitor and report on the human rights situation in the country, 
</p>
<p>and to make recommendations and advise the Government. The Commission had organized 
</p>
<p>a national human rights forum in 2012, which had raised awareness of human rights 
</p>
<p>throughout the country. The Chair referred to a report published by the Commission in July 
</p>
<p>2014, which revealed that over 10,000 people had lost their lives since the beginning of the 
</p>
<p>conflict. He highlighted some of the major human rights challenges in South Sudan, which 
</p>
<p>included protection of the right to life, the prevailing ethnic tensions between the Dinka and 
</p>
<p>Nuer populations, and the deteriorating environment for the exercise of the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression.  
</p>
<p>15. The Chair of the Human Rights Commission of South Sudan urged the parties to the 
</p>
<p>conflict to respect and implement the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement signed in January 
</p>
<p>2014. He also called on the United Nations to expedite the deployment of IGAD monitors 
</p>
<p>and United Nations peacekeepers, and to support UNMISS and regional bodies for the 
</p>
<p>monitoring of human rights violations and abuses.  
</p>
<p>16. The Director of the Human Rights Division of UNMISS noted that the situation in 
</p>
<p>South Sudan warranted the close attention of the Human Rights Council, and he 
</p>
<p>commended the Council for holding the panel discussion. He stated that UNMISS was 
</p>
<p>closely monitoring the human rights situation and had documented numerous incidents of 
</p>
<p>deliberate targeting of civilians; gender-based violence, including rape; arbitrary arrest and 
</p>
<p>detention; torture; forced disappearance; looting; and attacks on hospitals, churches and 
</p>
<p>mosques. UNMISS reports had confirmed that ethnically targeted killings and inter-clan 
</p>
<p>murders were common occurrences. He noted that freedom of expression had been severely 
</p>
<p>curtailed, with repeated attacks on journalists and civil society organizations. He also 
</p>
<p>stressed that the targeted killings of humanitarian workers had further impeded the 
</p>
<p>provision of humanitarian support to civilians.  
</p>
<p>17. The Director of the Human Rights Division of UNMISS said that there were strong 
</p>
<p>reasons to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed, in light of the 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic nature of the violence, and that such acts had been committed by 
</p>
<p>both parties to the conflict. He noted that in spite of pledges by both sides to hold </p>


<p>accountable those responsible for the crimes, there had been little or no progress towards 
</p>
<p>ensuring accountability. He stressed that accountability would be crucial to achieving 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation, and that UNMISS had recommended the immediate establishment 
</p>
<p>of an international tribunal to establish responsibility for the crimes and serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and abuses committed in the course of the conflict. He called on the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council to act immediately and decisively to help bring about an effective 
</p>
<p>and comprehensive solution to the South Sudan crisis.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of interventions at the plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the plenary discussion, the following delegations took the floor: Australia, 
Belgium, Canada, China, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia on behalf 
</p>
<p>of the African Group, the European Union, France, Italy, Kuwait, Montenegro, the 
Netherlands, Norway, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Togo, Turkey, the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>The following non-governmental organizations contributed to the discussion: Caritas 
</p>
<p>Internationalis, CIVICUS World Alliance for Citizen Participation, the East and Horn of 
</p>
<p>Africa Human Rights Defenders Project, Femmes Africa Solidarit&#233; and the Norwegian 
</p>
<p>Refugee Council.  
</p>
<p>19. Many delegations noted with concern that fighting had been persisting for many 
</p>
<p>months and that serious human rights abuses and violations, and violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, continued to be committed by both parties to the conflict. They 
</p>
<p>condemned the violations and atrocities against civilians, noting that some may amount to 
</p>
<p>war crimes or crimes against humanity. They also called on the parties to the conflict to 
</p>
<p>immediately cease fighting and all forms of violence, and appealed to the leaders concerned 
</p>
<p>to ensure that their forces would not commit human rights abuses or violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law or other international crimes. 
</p>
<p>20. Many delegations denounced the lack of accountability for the crimes and atrocities 
</p>
<p>committed in the course of the conflict. They underlined the importance of justice and 
</p>
<p>accountability as a basis for achieving any meaningful healing and national reconciliation 
</p>
<p>in South Sudan. They urged both parties to the conflict to ensure that perpetrators of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and abuses were brought to justice and held accountable. They all stressed 
</p>
<p>that justice and accountability should be a vital part of the peace process.  
</p>
<p>21. Several delegations expressed grave concern regarding the lack of protection of 
</p>
<p>civilians, particularly of vulnerable groups such as women and children, who continued to 
</p>
<p>bear the brunt of the conflict and were experiencing deteriorating living conditions. 
</p>
<p>Specifically, some delegations expressed deep concern about the grave violations 
</p>
<p>committed against women and children, including incidents of sexual and gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, and the systematic recruitment of children into armed forces. 
</p>
<p>22. Many delegations stressed the need for a comprehensive political solution to the 
</p>
<p>conflict, and urged the parties to commit themselves to an inclusive, constructive and open 
</p>
<p>dialogue to achieve peace. They expressed concern about the leaders&#8217; lack of political will 
</p>
<p>for a peaceful resolution, as illustrated by their failure to abide by the ceasefire agreements 
</p>
<p>signed under the auspices of IGAD. Many delegations commended IGAD for its work in 
</p>
<p>leading the peace process in South Sudan and called on the international community to give 
</p>
<p>IGAD its full support.  
</p>
<p>23. Many delegations strongly urged the parties to facilitate access to humanitarian aid 
</p>
<p>in territories under their control and to ensure the protection of humanitarian aid workers. 
</p>
<p>Several delegations expressed concern about the severity of the humanitarian crisis, </p>


<p>particularly with regard to food insecurity, and about the acute protection challenges faced 
</p>
<p>by internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>24. Some delegations expressed concern about the deteriorating environment for the 
</p>
<p>exercise of freedom of expression, which included widespread intimidation and harassment 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders and journalists. Several delegations also noted the atmosphere of 
</p>
<p>fear and repression against civil society organizations, which had prevented their 
</p>
<p>participation in IGAD-led peace talks in Addis Ababa.  
</p>
<p>25. Several delegations welcomed the role of the African Union Commission of Inquiry 
</p>
<p>on South Sudan in investigating the human rights violations and abuses and encouraged the 
</p>
<p>Commission to make recommendations on the best way to ensure accountability. They 
</p>
<p>called on the Human Rights Council, other United Nations bodies, specialized agencies and 
</p>
<p>other stakeholders to support the work of the African Union and other regional mechanisms 
</p>
<p>in regard to South Sudan.  
</p>
<p>26. Several delegations called for the creation of a special procedures mandate to 
</p>
<p>monitor and report to the Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in South 
</p>
<p>Sudan.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>The panellists made concluding remarks in response to some of the comments 
</b></p>
<p><b>and questions from the plenary discussion. The Chair of the African Union 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan stated that the </b>Commission&#8217;s <b>report would be 
</b></p>
<p><b>completed and submitted to the African Union in the first half of October 2014. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicated that the Commission would accept support from all those willing to assist 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the implementation of its findings and recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>The Minister of Justice of South Sudan stated that, in regard to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression, a media law had been adopted, as a legitimate instrument in conformity 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international law. He also mentioned that the National Assembly would pass a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national security law in due course. 
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>In his concluding remarks, the Chair of the Human Rights Commission of 
</b></p>
<p><b>South Sudan mentioned that the Commission supported the task assigned to regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions of monitoring the human rights situation in South Sudan. He stressed that 
</b></p>
<p><b>any accountability mechanism adopted in a future peace agreement should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>negotiated in such a way as to ensure t</b>he parties&#8217; <b>commitment and better 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation. He warned that the peace process should not be rushed, so as to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that it would be comprehensive and thorough and would involve all relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>The Director of the Human Rights Division of UNMISS assured the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council that the Mission was committed to fulfilling its mandate to monitor the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights situation in South Sudan with the highest standards of verification. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>stressed that the promotion and protection of human rights was an international 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation which required the engagement of regional and international mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In that regard, he underlined the importance of the Human Rights Council</b>&#8217;s<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility to continue playing its role for improvement of the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation in South Sudan. </b></p>
