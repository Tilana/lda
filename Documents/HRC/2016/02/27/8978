<p><b>I.  THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council reviewed the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression at its seventh session in March 2008. As a result, the mandate 
was extended for a further three years by virtue of resolution 7/36, in paragraphs 3 and 4 of 
which the Council outlined the terms of reference of the Special Rapporteur, who is mandated: 
</p>
<p> (a) To gather all relevant information, wherever it may occur, relating to violations of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, discrimination against, threats or use of violence, 
harassment, persecution or intimidation directed at persons seeking to exercise or to promote the 
exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, including, as a matter of high priority, 
against journalists or other professionals in the field of information;  
 (b) To seek, receive and respond to credible and reliable information from Governments, 
non-governmental organizations and any other parties who have knowledge of these cases; 
</p>
<p> (c) To make recommendations and provide suggestions on ways and means to better 
promote and protect the right to freedom of opinion and expression in all its manifestations; 
</p>
<p> (d) To contribute to the provision of technical assistance or advisory services by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to better promote and 
protect the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council, through this resolution, recognizes that the exercise of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression is one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, and in 
paragraph 5 it calls upon all Governments &#8220;to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in 
the performance of his tasks, to provide all information to respond to communications 
transmitted by the mandate-holder without undue delay and calls upon Governments to seriously 
consider responding favourably to the requests of the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries 
in a spirit of constructive dialogue&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the request in resolution 7/36 to continue 
to provide his views, when appropriate, on the advantages and challenges of new information 
and communication technologies, particularly the reference in paragraph 4 (f) to the right to 
access to the information society for all. The Special Rapporteur considers access to information 
as one of the priority issues for the mandate and as such wishes to focus part of this report on 
access to information in situations of extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>4. In paragraph 4 (d) of resolution 7/36, the Council further requests that the 
Special Rapporteur report &#8220;on instances in which the abuse of the right of freedom of expression 
constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination, taking into account articles 19, 
paragraphs 3 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and general 
comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
which stipulates that the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial 
superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur will continue to pursue the provisions outlined in the resolution in 
addition to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other relevant 
international and regional instruments, which continue to provide the legal framework for the 
mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Analysis of information, communications and trends 
</b></p>
<p>6. For the effective implementation of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur focuses on 
information received from a variety of sources, including Governments; local, national, regional 
or international governmental and non-governmental organizations; associations of media 
professionals and writers; and trade unions. The communications received from various sources 
are a means to identify trends, reiterate issues already discussed in previous reports and bring to 
the attention of the international community a number of policies, practices and measures having 
an impact on the respect for freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>7. Information received is a significant indicator of the degree of implementation of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression in a given country. The Special Rapporteur may also 
decide to take initiative <i>motu proprio</i> on issues of general concern that he considers relevant to 
his mandate.  
</p>
<p>8. The majority of cases received by the Special Rapporteur concern threats, aggressions, 
harassment, murder or other sorts of attacks on the physical and psychological integrity of 
journalists, students, human rights defenders and unionists in retaliation for the exercise of their 
right to freedom of opinion and expression. In many cases, these attacks are linked to the 
repression of peaceful protests conducted to express disagreement with a particular governmental 
policy, at the national or local level, or with the actions of large corporations. While the extent of 
the repression, its duress and length may substantially vary, allegations received are not confined 
to countries where the political, social and economic situation is particularly difficult, but also 
concern violations occurring in transitional or long-established democracies. 
</p>
<p>9. Analysis of communications also shows a large number of cases of prosecution or 
imprisonment of individuals including media professionals on charges of defamation, libel and 
slander, despite the decriminalization of these offences by some countries. Another important 
trend in many regions has been the adoption of legislation that unduly limits freedom of 
expression by fostering State interference in editorial independence; by creating subjective 
licensing procedures that are used to close media outlets; by restricting the ability of journalists, 
particularly foreign correspondents, to perform their work freely; and by imposing severe 
limitations on the operation, including funding, of civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>10. From 5 December 2007 to 31 December 2008, 433 communications were sent on behalf of 
the Special Rapporteur, 365 of which were signed jointly with other special-procedures 
mandate-holders. The geographical division of the communications was as follows: 30 per cent 
in Asia and the Pacific; 20 per cent in Africa; 20 per cent in Latin America and the 
Caribbean; 17 per cent in the Middle East and North Africa; and 13 per cent in Europe, 
North America and Central Asia. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>11. Within the scope of his mandate the Special Rapporteur may issue press releases<b>1</b> in order 
to highlight his particular concern about current events in relation to freedom of opinion and 
expression. Since the beginning of his term in August 2008 the Special Rapporteur has issued 
four joint press statements concerning restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. 
</p>
<p>12. On 18 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, issued a joint press release condemning the 
severe conditions and unfair trials of prisoners of conscience in Myanmar. The experts noted that 
peaceful demonstrators arrested in 2007 were being tried after one year of arbitrary detention, 
with dozens of the detainees being sentenced to 65 years&#8217; imprisonment; others were 
given 25-year sentences. Moreover, defence lawyers had also been sentenced to several months&#8217; 
imprisonment or were barred from representing their clients. The experts strongly urged 
authorities in Myanmar to cease these acts of harassment and detention against individuals who 
were exercising their human rights. They stipulated that all the detainees should be retried 
respecting fair trials guarantees and that all the defence counsels be released. 
</p>
<p>13. On 27 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur, along with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
issued a press release regarding the ongoing harassment and intimidation of members of the One 
Million Signatures Campaign in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The experts noted that peaceful 
demonstrators had been arrested, detained and persecuted with prison sentences, while women&#8217;s 
rights activists involved in the campaign had been continuously harassed and prevented from 
travelling. The experts stipulated that women&#8217;s participation in public life, to promote equal 
treatment of women and men in the Islamic Republic of Iran, should be encouraged as a means 
to build a stronger and healthier society, in which women&#8217;s unique contributions can flourish. As 
such, the Special Rapporteurs urged the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by 
its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and 
to respect the rights of women&#8217;s rights activists to freedom of association and peaceful assembly, 
and to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>14. On 10 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur, along with 35 other special rapporteurs and 
independent experts, issued a press release welcoming the adoption by the General Assembly of 
the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
which enables those suffering from violations of their economic, social and cultural rights to 
seek remedies and hold those responsible to account for their actions. The experts expressed their 
hope that views adopted by the Committee under the Optional Protocol procedures would be 
used by the human rights community to assist States in taking concrete steps to realize the rights

</p>
<p>of all and to reach out to the most marginalized and disadvantaged, who are the most likely to 
see their rights violated. The experts called on all States to sign and ratify the instrument swiftly, 
so as to secure a speedy entry into force and wide application. 
</p>
<p>15. On 9 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with 10 other independent experts, 
issued a press statement expressing their deep concern about the deteriorating human rights 
situation in Sri Lanka, particularly the shrinking space for critical voices and the fear of reprisals 
against victims and witnesses. The experts noted that impunity for human rights violations 
continues unabated throughout the country with a climate of fear and intimidation reigning over 
those defending human rights, especially over journalists and lawyers. The experts also noted the 
serious and fatal aggression against journalists and the media as now a common occurrence as 
witnessed in the killing of the journalist Lasantha Wickremetunga and attacks on major media 
outlets. The experts shared the deep concern of the High Commissioner for Human Rights over 
the rapidly deteriorating conditions facing those civilians and the significant number of civilian 
casualties. They also deplored the restrictions on humanitarian access to conflict areas which 
exacerbate the ongoing serious violations of the most basic economic and social rights. The 
experts strongly urged the Government of Sri Lanka to immediately take measures to ensure that 
effective remedial action can be pursued in support of the victims of human rights abuses and 
their families. They also highlighted that thorough reforms of the general system of governance 
are needed to prevent the recurrence of further serious human rights violations. The experts 
called for an immediate end to impunity and to refrain from any reprisals. To strengthen the rule 
of law and to help ensure the safety and protection of the human rights of all persons in 
Sri Lanka, the experts noted that they would continue to extend their offer of assistance to the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Participation in meetings and seminars 
</b></p>
<p>16. From 2 to 3 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur participated in the &#8220;Expert seminar on 
the links between articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: 
Freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221;.<b>2</b> The seminar was organized by the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and was attended by over 200 observers, including 
representatives of Governments, other United Nations agencies, regional organizations, the 
media and non-governmental organizations. The aim of the event was to clarify the links 
between articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 
freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence. The Special Rapporteur presented a paper on the differences 
and links between permissible limitations under article 19, paragraph 3, in particular when it 
comes to restrictions aimed at protecting the rights of others, and States&#8217; obligations under 
article 20 of the Covenant. The Special Rapporteur noted through his participation in the event 
the importance of resolving tensions based on genuine cultural or religious differences through

 <p> 
</p>
<p>open debate, emphasizing that free speech is therefore a requirement for, and not an impediment 
to, tolerance. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s participation in the event falls within the realms of his 
mandate as outlined in resolution 7/36 of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>17. From 7 to 8 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur participated in the information session 
for newly appointed special-procedures mandate-holders, held in Geneva. The meeting primarily 
discussed the institution-building process conducted by the Human Rights Council and the new 
methods of work of mandate-holders, as well as issues such as cooperation with civil society, 
national human rights institutions and among special-procedures mandates. 
</p>
<p>18. While in Geneva to attend the aforementioned events, the Special Rapporteur met with 
representatives of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Group of 
Latin American and Caribbean Group States (GRULAC). The Special Rapporteur is keen to 
maintain open dialogue with all regional groups and plans to meet with those he did not have the 
opportunity to meet with during his future visits to Geneva. 
</p>
<p>19. On 10 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur participated in a seminar at the European 
Court of Justice in Strasbourg entitled &#8220;The European protection of freedom of expression: 
reflections on some recent restrictive trends&#8221;. The event was organized jointly by 
Robert Schumann University of Strasbourg, Ghent University and the Open Society Justice 
Initiative. 
</p>
<p>20. On 26 October the Special Rapporteur met with members of the World Association of 
Newspapers (WAN) in London. 
</p>
<p>21. On 28 October, the Special Rapporteur attended the International Symposium on Freedom 
of Expression organized by UNESCO in Paris. The event, entitled &#8220;Freedom of expression: 
development, democracy and dialogue&#8221;, was organized to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary 
of article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While in Paris for this event, the 
Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of Reporters Without Borders. 
</p>
<p>22. On 7 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended the international symposium 
&#8220;25th anniversary of AMARC: Development and empowerment through community radio&#8221; 
organized by the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (AMARC) in Montreal.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. From 13 to 15 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur participated in an event organized 
by the Latin American Association for Educational Radio (ALER), in Buenos Aires. The 
international conference focused on &#8220;Freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity in radio&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>24. Following a meeting on 9 December 2008, as part of the Global Forum on World Media 
Development (held 7-10 December 2008 in Athens), the Special Rapporteur, along with the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Representative on Freedom of the 
Media, Miklos Haraszti, the Organization of American States (OAS) Special Rapporteur on 
Freedom of Expression, Catalina Botero, and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, Faith Pansy 
Tlakula, issued a joint declaration on defamation of religions, and anti-terrorism and 
anti-extremism legislation. The declaration noted that the concept of &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; 
did not accord with international standards regarding defamation and that restrictions on freedom </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of expression should be limited in scope to the protection of overriding individual rights and 
social interests. Restrictions should never be used to protect particular institutions or abstract 
notions, concepts or beliefs, including religious ones. The declaration further noted that 
restrictions on freedom of expression to prevent intolerance should be limited in scope to 
advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence and it encouraged the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council to 
desist from further adoption of statements supporting the idea of defamation of religions. 
</p>
<p>25. On 11 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended an event in London organized by 
the non-governmental organization Article 19, on &#8220;Promoting equality within a free speech 
framework&#8221;, and from 12 to 14 December he participated in an International Expert Roundtable 
event on freedom of expression organized by the Center for Media and Communication Studies 
at Central European University in Budapest. 
</p>
<p>26. On 5 February 2009 the Special Rapporteur participated in an event entitled &#8220;The Agenda 
for Change: A free speech framework for Nepal&#8221; which took place in Kathmandu. A report 
(&#8220;Agenda for Change on Right to Freedom of Expression in Nepal&#8221;) prepared as a joint initiative 
of the non-governmental organizations Freedom Forum, Article 19 and Federation of Nepali 
journalists (FNJ) was launched as part of the event by Prime Minister Puspa Kamal Dahal. 
</p><p>27. On 23 January, the Special Rapporteur addressed the Wilton Park Conference on &#8220;the 
relationship between freedom of expression and freedom of religion: a victim&#8217;s perspective&#8221;. 
The event, entitled &#8220;Contemporary and future human rights challenges&#8221;, took place from 22 
to 24 January in London. 
</p>
<p>28. From 25 to 29 January, the Special Rapporteur participated in the regional meeting of 
Latin American organizations on freedom of expression, organized by the International Freedom 
of Expression Exchange (IFEX) in Antigua, Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>29. From 13 to 16 March, the Special Rapporteur participated in a round-table event organized 
by the International Press Society (SIP) in Asunci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>30. From 22 to 25 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in an international seminar 
entitled &#8220;Latin America in the 21st century: communication and power&#8221;. The event was 
organized by the Latin American Association for Educational Broadcasting (ALER) and the 
Universidad Andina Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var. The seminar took place in Quito. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>31. From 1 to 5 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur undertook an official country visit to the 
Maldives. This was the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s first country mission as mandate-holder. The visit 
was carried out at the invitation of the Government in order to examine issues of relevance to his 
mandate. In his conclusions on the visit, the Special Rapporteur highlighted the importance of 
the ongoing democratic transition in the Maldives and made preliminary recommendations on 
how to strengthen this process. An addendum (A/HRC/11/4/Add.3) to this report includes the 
full mission report of the Special Rapporteur on his visit to the country. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes that country visits will remain central to the activities of the 
mandate. Visits previously undertaken by the former Special Rapporteur, along with requests 
made to Governments for official country visits, and the emerging trends as they result from the 
analysis of communications on freedom of expression and opinion form the basis of requests 
sent to countries requesting an invitation from various Governments. Requests for invitations to 
visit a number of countries have been sent by the Special Rapporteur, taking into consideration 
the importance of achieving a geographical balance. The Special Rapporteur hopes that visit 
requests will be met favourably by the concerned Governments. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  VISION AND PRIORITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Main priorities and working methods 
</b></p>
<p>33. As this is the first report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council, this 
chapter highlights his vision for the mandate along with proposed working methods. The 
Special Rapporteur will also make some preliminary reflections on the issue of limitations to the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression. The report elaborates on two priority areas identified 
by the Special Rapporteur, including the right of access to information in situations of extreme 
poverty, and the protection of journalists and the media working in conflict situations. 
</p><p>34. The Special Rapporteur will build on the accomplishments achieved by his predecessors 
holding the mandate and he presents this report in a spirit of transparency and openness. While 
recognizing the immutable independence inherent to the position of a special-procedures 
mandate-holder, the Special Rapporteur believes that open dialogue with all stakeholders should 
be encouraged and that such interaction will be of fundamental importance to the implementation 
of the mandate. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur will continue to analyse trends and challenges facing the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and will aim to develop methods with interested 
Governments, national institutions, regional mechanisms, diplomatic representatives and relevant 
branches of international and regional organizations to enhance this fundamental right. The 
Special Rapporteur would also like to further reinforce follow-up to individual cases brought to 
his attention through the mandate, and in doing so, will enhance collaboration with stakeholders, 
including Governments, human rights communities at the national, regional and international 
levels, regional mechanisms, national institutions, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, including its field presences, human rights components 
of United Nations country teams and peacekeeping missions, the media, treaty bodies and other 
special procedures. 
</p>
<p>36. In fulfilling some of the requirements cited in Council resolution 7/36, which calls upon 
the mandate of the Special Rapporteur &#8220;to make recommendations and provide suggestions on 
ways and means to better promote and protect the right to freedom of opinion and expression in 
all its manifestations&#8221;<b>3</b> and &#8220;to contribute to the provision of technical assistance or advisory 
services by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to better 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Paragraph 3 (c). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>promote and protect the right to freedom of opinion and expression&#8221;,<b>4</b> the Special Rapporteur has 
proposed developing an online training programme for media personnel on freedom of 
expression, human rights and multiculturalism. The aim of the programme is to identify ways to 
strengthen professional commitments to high-quality journalism, while also fostering greater 
respect for diversity, multiculturalism and human rights education. The programme will aim to 
address some of the main concerns voiced by various stakeholders in relation to hate speech, 
intolerance and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur participated in the Durban Review Conference held in Geneva 
from 20 to 24 April 2009. The Conference was meant to provide an opportunity to review 
progress made in the combat against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and the actual implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
at the national, regional and international levels since 2001, as well as to share best practices. 
The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s participation in the event highlights the indivisible link between the 
promotion of the right to freedom of expression and the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Limitations to the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>38. The exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is a significant indicator of 
the level of protection and respect of all other human rights in a given society. Democratic 
institutions, while not preventing all violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
do offer guarantees for its protection as well as an enabling environment for its exercise. 
Freedom of opinion and expression not only benefits from a democratic environment; it also 
contributes to, and is indeed instrumental to, the emergence and existence of effective 
democratic systems. However, violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression may 
occur in all regions and countries, whatever their system, and may have various forms. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes that freedom of expression is the manifestation of cultures, 
cultural diversity, religion and ideologies. Therefore, the right to freedom of expression should 
be approached with a positive view to defending it. Existing international instruments establish a 
specific limit on freedom of expression. In particular, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights provides that &#8220;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&#8221;. The main 
challenge thus lies in identifying at which point these thresholds are reached. A broad 
interpretation of these limitations, which has recently been suggested in international forums, is 
not in line with existing international instruments and would ultimately jeopardize the full 
enjoyment of human rights. Limitations to the right to freedom of opinion and expression have 
more often than not been used by States as a means to restrict criticism and silence dissent. 
</p>
<p>40. Limitations on freedom of expression should be clearly defined and provided by law. 
Limitations should not threaten the exercise of the right itself. In addition, they ought to be 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Para. 3 (d). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>necessary and proportionate to the objective they propound to achieve, and should include the 
least intrusive means insofar as freedom of expression is concerned, to prevent a chilling effect. 
The adjudication of such limitations should be made by an independent judiciary. 
</p><p>41. The right to freedom of expression cannot be exercised passively, but requires a lasting 
commitment by States to ensure the mechanisms that guarantee and protect it. Mechanisms for 
criticism, including of political leaders, are deemed important to hold individuals accountable. 
Freedom of expression is not limited to statements that are considered appropriate or beneficial; 
any boundaries should directly adhere to the wording of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>42. In many countries, overbroad rules in this area are abused by the powerful to limit 
non-traditional, dissenting, critical or minority voices, or discussion about challenging social 
issues. Furthermore, resolution of tensions based on genuine cultural or religious differences 
cannot be achieved by suppressing the expression of differences but rather by debating them 
openly. The Special Rapporteur notes that free speech is therefore a requirement for, and not an 
impediment to, tolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Safety and protection of journalists and media professionals in conflict zones 
</b>43. The protection of journalists engaged in dangerous missions during an armed conflict is a 
major concern for the international community and in the last year remained a key obstacle for 
achieving the full implementation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. In 2008, a 
total of 60 journalists were killed, some 29 media professionals were kidnapped and 929 were 
physically attacked or threatened throughout the year.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Violent conflicts in many parts of the world, and specifically in Afghanistan, Iraq, the 
Middle East, Somalia, the Sudan and recently Ossetia, have a serious impact on the ordinary 
population, including journalists and media professionals. Large numbers of journalists are either 
assassinated, wounded by direct armed attacks during the fighting or deliberately targeted and 
kidnapped by the parties to the conflict. The proliferation of small arms, the use of increasingly 
sophisticated weapons by belligerents and the concern to win the war of images worsens the 
situation of physical safety for civilians and media professionals. Such attacks, in blatant 
violation of international humanitarian and human rights law, are committed in an environment 
of almost total impunity. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur received numerous reports concerning deliberate attempts to target 
journalists, particularly in areas of ongoing armed conflict. The evolution of modern warfare has 
a serious impact on the freedom of expression, the freedom of the press, and on the quality and 
independence of information, which are the basic components of a free media. Factors 
contributing to this are, among others, the loss of the civilian status of media professionals that

 <p> 
</p>
<p>results in the restriction of their movement and of their access to reliable and objective sources of 
information, the increasing use of embedded journalists and the insecurity that exists regarding 
their status of protection. 
</p>
<p>46. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur received reports that lawyers investigating the killing of 
Radio Okapi journalist Serge Mahese, were subjected to ongoing threats and harassment. 
Serge Mahese was shot dead in Bukavu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 
13 June 2007. He was a respected journalist with Radio Okapi, a national radio station sponsored 
jointly by the Swiss Hirondelle Foundation and the United Nations Organization Mission in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). 
</p>
<p>47. The main provisions protecting journalists and other media professionals in situations of 
armed conflict come from humanitarian law, in particular from special measures contained in 
article 79 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, relating to the protection 
of victims of international armed conflicts. This article establishes that &#8220;journalists engaged in 
dangerous professional missions in areas of armed conflict shall be considered as civilians&#8221; and 
&#8220;shall be protected as such under the Conventions and this Protocol, provided that they take no 
action adversely affecting their status as civilians&#8221;. The civilian status of journalists transcends 
any type of contractual arrangement that the journalist may have; equal protection is granted to 
freelance, independent or to journalists belonging to any media. 
</p><p>48. The Security Council passed resolution 1738 (2006) to express its deep concern &#8220;at the 
frequency of acts of violence in many parts of the world against journalists, media professionals 
and associated personnel in armed conflict&#8221;, and it condemned intentional attacks against this 
group. The Security Council also underlined the obligation under humanitarian law to grant 
civilian status to journalists during armed conflicts, as established by the Geneva Conventions. 
49. The Special Rapporteur supports this Security Council resolution, adopted on the joint 
initiative of Greece and France, and would encourage States to give renewed attention to the fact 
that the media, its personnel and its equipment as long as they are not making an effective 
contribution to military action cannot be considered a legitimate target and attacks against them 
are illegal under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>50. Journalists and media professionals are not only at risk during times of conflict, but many 
are targeted during public crises and states of emergency. In such cases, journalists are often 
victims of abuse and harassment by the security forces, and are subjected to arrests and 
detention. Throughout 2008, the Special Rapporteur has received reports of such human rights 
violations against journalists, particularly those covering public demonstrations opposing 
government policies. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Implementing the right of access to information  
in situations of extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p>51. Extreme poverty, often described as multidimensional and not limited to income, but also 
touching livelihood, health, education and housing as well as social, cultural and political 
participation, affects millions of people worldwide. This multidimensional approach to poverty is 
paralleled by an integrated understanding of human rights, in which civil and political rights are 
indivisible from social, economic and cultural rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>52. The impact of the global financial crisis of 2008 has had a considerable impact on the 
developing world, with slowdowns expected in all emerging economies. These growth declines 
could have significant effects on the world&#8217;s poorest populations. 
</p>
<p>53. The concept of human poverty that focuses on the denial of opportunities and choices most 
basic to human development and the lack of respect of others, also highlights a lack of 
participation in decision-making and in civil, social and cultural life. The Commission on Human 
Rights, in its resolution 1997/11, reaffirmed that &#8220;in accordance with the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action, it is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the 
decision-making process in their communities, in the promotion of human rights and in efforts to 
combat extreme poverty&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur notes that people affected by chronic extreme 
poverty risk becoming socially<b> </b>excluded from full participation in the society in which they are 
living. Often the poor, the unemployed and people belonging to ethnic minorities and other 
vulnerable groups, remain marginalized in the social hierarchy. As such, the Special Rapporteur 
emphasizes the need for access to information<b> </b>to be guaranteed as a means towards securing 
participation and accountability. 
</p>
<p>54. Strengthening the voices of people living in poverty improves understanding and actions 
aimed at addressing poverty, injustice and inequality and can inform and influence public 
agendas locally, nationally and internationally. Adequate access to knowledge and information 
helps communities work for a better future. The Special Rapporteur believes that the media can 
play an important role by ensuring the dissemination of information and raising awareness of 
poverty as well as of a community&#8217;s role in eliminating poverty and improving living standards. 
</p>
<p>55. The inability of some people to command the processes and benefits of globalization, 
communications and information included, is a key concern. For many poor people, for whom 
globalization and the information revolution is still a slow-moving process, careful thought must 
be given as to how best to include them in local, national, regional and international information 
flows. The Special Rapporteur urges the international community to address the exclusion of 
marginalized and vulnerable groups from the media. Minorities, indigenous peoples, migrant 
workers, refugees and many other vulnerable communities have faced higher barriers, some of 
them insurmountable, to be able to fully exercise their right to impart and also to access 
information. For these groups, the media plays the central role of fostering social mobilization, 
participation in public life and access to information that is relevant for the community. Without 
a means to disseminate their views and problems, these communities are in effect excluded from 
public debates, which ultimately hinders their ability to fully enjoy their human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>This report outlines the vision and priorities of the Special Rapporteur for his 
mandate that he wishes to share with Member States and other stakeholders in a spirit of 
openness and transparency. The Special Rapporteur hopes that this same spirit will 
characterize his relationship with them throughout his tenure. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The Special Rapporteur will interpret the mandate by building on the achievements 
of his predecessors and the knowledge base developed and methods of work used. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>58. <b>Given that this is his first report, the Special Rapporteur has focused on two areas 
only which he deems as priority for the mandate. Future reports will aim to further 
develop thematic issues related to the fundamental right of freedom of opinion and 
expression. As such, the Special Rapporteur will be in a position to present more detailed 
recommendations based on the activities and trends which he will identify during his first 
year as mandate-holder. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Access to information in situations of extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Rights to information and freedom of expression should be encouraged at all levels. 
The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to deregulate the communications and media 
environment to allow free and fair information to flow more effectively to civil society. 
Support for enhancing such flows and targeted interventions that support the most 
vulnerable and marginalized groups within society at large should be given priority. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur further encourages States to uphold the rights to freedom of 
expression and access to information stipulated within article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Public access to information can be systematically denied by Governments and, similarly, 
Governments can place restrictions on free speech and freedom of expression via 
legislation and activities that deny rights of political and cultural association. Openness of 
government and the free flow of information are enshrined within the principle of 
&#8220;maximum disclosure&#8221; through which Governments and public institutions become more 
answerable to the general public. A civil society that is empowered with open information 
is better placed to advocate for more impartial and transparent service delivery and has a 
greater sense of participation and ownership in decision-making processes. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Governments may be poorly placed to systematically disseminate information to the 
public or may not be inclined towards such transparency because of high levels of 
corruption. The Special Rapporteur recommends that in such cases support for the media 
during times of conflict and deregulation of the communications and media environment 
be seen as mechanisms for increasing the plurality and diversity of information flows in 
poor and conflict-prone countries. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Governments to strengthen public broadcasting 
and to introduce anti-monopoly legislation in order to achieve a diverse broadcasting 
system which is accessible to all. Policies should promote freedom of expression and public 
participation. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Community-based broadcasting provides an alternative social and economic model 
for media development that can broaden access to information, voice and opinion. People 
faced with economic exclusion also face systemic obstacles to freedom of expression that 
are associated with the conditions of poverty, including low levels of education and literacy, 
poor infrastructure, lack of access to electricity and general communications services. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that Governments consider community broadcasting as a 
vital tool for the voiceless, which would enable them to exercise their right to freedom of </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>expression and access to information. Such programmes should encourage active 
participation of the community in their initiation, production and presentation to empower 
the poorest people and communities and as a means of reducing poverty.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Safety and protection of media professionals 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendations of his predecessors that 
Governments should translate their formal concerns about the safety of journalists, 
elaborated in international forums and treaty law, into concrete measures for enhancing 
the safety of journalists and other media personnel including at the legislative, 
administrative and judicial levels. Measures should be taken to protect all media personnel 
regardless of their professional and political affiliation. The protection of journalists and 
media workers must be ensured at all times, particularly during armed conflicts, states of 
emergency and public disorder and electoral processes. Governments are also urged to 
ensure the protection of other groups at risk, such as trade unionists, social workers, 
students and teachers, writers and artists. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Creating a culture of safety for journalism adds to the capacity of media to contribute 
to building prosperous and confident democracies. The Special Rapporteur urges 
Governments and State institutions to provide support and an assurance that all acts of 
violence against journalists are fully investigated. Limiting impunity for the perpetrators of 
crimes against media professionals will function as an important deterrent against the 
repetition of these crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages Governments to develop protection schemes for 
media personnel. News associations should be supported in promoting actions that secure 
the safety of journalists, including safety training, health care, life insurance, and equal 
access to social protection for freelance employees and full-time staff. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Council may wish to consider the opportunity, as previously suggested by his 
predecessor, of entrusting the Special Rapporteur with the preparation of a study on the 
causes of violence against media professionals, based, inter alia, on information from and 
the experiences of Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, 
and including a comprehensive set of conclusions and recommendations and the drafting of 
guidelines for the protection of journalists and other media professionals. This study could 
represent the first step towards a debate, within the Human Rights Council, on this crucial 
issue, following the discussions held by other bodies, including the Security Council.
