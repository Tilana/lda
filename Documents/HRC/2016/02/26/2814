</p>

<p>Council, with a view to proclaiming the decade starting in 2013 the Decade for People of 
African Descent, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the Global African Diaspora Summit, held in Sandton, Johannesburg, 
on 25 May 2012, and the outcome adopted at its conclusion, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing the importance</i> of a consistent global effort to inform the public about the 
contribution that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action has made in the 
struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and 
economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices, 
which in turn generate more poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that the current economic and financial crisis and its 
consequences on poverty and unemployment may have further contributed to the rise of 
extremist political parties, movements and groups and exacerbated identity-related issues, 
and that in this period of economic crisis, non-citizens, members of minorities, migrants, 
refugees and asylum seekers are still the main scapegoat of extremist political parties that 
have a xenophobic and racist agenda and that sometimes incite racial discrimination and 
violence against them, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining the importance</i> of eliminating discriminatory practices and laws that 
hamper some specific groups of individuals from fully participating in the public and 
political life of the countries they live in, including legal and practical obstacles such as 
discriminatory regulations regarding voter registration, the lack of identification documents, 
administrative and financial barriers, and discrimination in access to citizenship, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>at the use of the Internet and social media by extremist groups and 
individuals to disseminate racist ideas and propagate racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the Internet and social media can also be a useful tool for 
preventing the spread of racist ideologies by extremist political parties, groups and 
movements, as well as its potential to contribute to development as an international and 
equal forum, aware that there are disparities in the use of and access thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the misuse of print, audiovisual and electronic media, including the 
Internet, and any other means that constitute incitement to acts of national, racial or 
religious violence, discrimination and hatred, which have targeted and severely affected 
racial and religious communities and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities, emanating from a variety of sources, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that despite the immense potential of sport in promoting 
tolerance, racism in sport is still a serious problem, 
</p>
<p>1.<i> Welcomes</i> the efforts made by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in its 
constructive work aimed at the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, 
including by increasing efforts to complement the work of other Durban follow-up 
mechanisms with a view to achieving better coordination and synergy with other human 
rights mechanisms, thereby avoiding duplication of initiatives; </p>


<p>2<i>. Takes note</i> of the report of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/19/77. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>3<i>. Decides</i> that the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action should convene its 
eleventh session from 7 to 18 October 2013; 
</p>
<p>4.<i> Recalls </i>that preventing and combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance is a primary responsibility of States and, in this regard, 
recommends that States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)  Consider developing and implementing national plans of action to combat 
racism and racial discrimination, and to promote equality, equity, social justice, equality of 
opportunity, respect for diversity and the participation of all; These plans should aim at 
creating conditions for all to participate effectively in decision-making and realize civil, 
cultural, economic, political and social rights in all spheres of life on the basis of non-
discrimination; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)  Consider linking their development programmes and priorities for the 
improvement of the socioeconomic conditions of individuals and groups experiencing 
racial discrimination, social exclusion and marginalization, and that these linkages should 
be reflected in, inter alia, States&#8217; reports for the universal periodic review mechanism of the 
Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Invest in education as a tool for transforming attitudes and eliminating ideas 
of racial hierarchies and superiority; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Consider collecting ethnically disaggregated data with a view to setting up 
concrete targets and designing appropriate and effective anti-discrimination legislation, 
policies and programmes aimed at promoting equality and preventing and eliminating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; any such information 
should, as appropriate, be collected with the explicit consent of individuals, based on their 
self-determination and in accordance with provisions on human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as data protection regulations and privacy guarantees; this information 
must not be misused;

through which States may prevent and address the rise of tension and conflict; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Underlines </i>in the above context that all citizens have the right to participate 
freely in the electoral processes in their countries, including the right to vote, consistent 
with article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, particularly since 
any restriction inconsistent with that article is incompatible with democracy, the rule of law 
and transparent and accountable electoral processes;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes</i> the setting up of projects at the national level by civil society 
groups, including with the financial support of public authorities, including the creation of a 
</p>

<p>social network-based platform targeting young people and aiming specifically at countering 
right-wing extremism and fostering a democratic culture;

hatred; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Calls</i> <i>on</i> States to strengthen measures to prevent racist and xenophobic 
incidents in major sporting events, including by individuals or groups of individuals linked 
to extremist movements and groups; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Urges</i> States, in cooperation with intergovernmental organizations, the 
International Olympic Committee and international and regional sports federations, to 
intensify the fight against racism in sport by, among other things, educating the youth of the 
world through sport practised without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, 
which requires human understanding, tolerance, fair play and solidarity; 
</p>
<p>11.<i> Welcomes</i> <i>and acknowledges</i> the importance and significance of the work of 
the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent in examining the current 
situation and conditions and the extent of racism against Africans and people of African

of African Descent to the General Assembly for its consideration, with a view to its
