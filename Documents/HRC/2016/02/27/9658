<p><b>I.  Resolution adopted by the Council at its seventh special session 
</b></p>
<p><b>S-7/1. The negative impact of the worsening of the world food  
crisis on the realization of the right to food for all 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions and decisions on the issue of the right to food 
adopted in the framework of the United Nations, in particular by the General Assembly, in its 
resolution 62/164 of 18 December 2007, and the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/14 
of 27 March 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> paragraph 10 of General Assembly resolution 60/251, in which the 
Assembly stipulates, inter alia, that the Human Rights Council shall be able to hold special 
sessions, when needed, at a request of a member of the Council with the support of one third of 
the membership of the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including its provision that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself or 
herself and that of his or her family, including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication 
of Hunger and Malnutrition and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the 
first Millennium Development Goal of eradicating hunger and extreme poverty by 2015, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, especially its article 11 (2), which recognize the fundamental right of every person to be 
free from hunger, and the duty of States to take, individually and through international 
cooperation, the measures needed to implement this right by improving the methods of 
production, conservation and distribution of food,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action of November 1996, and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: 
five years later, adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind also </i>the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, 
and recommending the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of 
financing for the fight against hunger and poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right 
to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming further</i> that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-7/2 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the complex character of the worsening of the current global food crisis, in 
which the right to adequate food is threatened to be violated on a massive scale, as a combination 
of several major factors, including macroeconomic factors, also impacted negatively by 
environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the 
lack of the necessary technology to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries and 
least developed countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the situation of one sixth of the world population, mainly in developing 
and least developed countries, suffering from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, and 
alarmed at the particular effects of the current global food crisis on many net food importing 
countries, and especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the 
Caribbean, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the international community should provide its assistance to populations in 
need in an effective and coordinated manner, with the consent and in principle on the basis of the 
appeal by the affected country, in order to ensure that such humanitarian assistance, including 
the supply of food, reaches affected populations, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the United Nations Task Force established by the Secretary-General, and 
supporting the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in this regard, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> grave concern at the worsening of the world food crisis, which seriously 
undermines the realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also expresses</i> grave concern that this crisis threatens to further undermine the 
achievement of Millennium Development Goals, in particular Goal 1 aiming at halving by 2015 
the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon </i>States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, 
relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all necessary measures 
to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to 
consider reviewing any policy or measure which could have a negative impact on the realization 
of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting 
such a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Stresses</i> that States have a primary obligation to make their best efforts to meet the 
vital food needs of their own populations, especially of the vulnerable groups and households, 
such as through enhancing programmes to combat mother-child malnutrition, and to increase 
local production for this purpose, while the international community should provide, through a 
coordinated response and upon request, support to national and regional efforts by providing the 
necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly through transfer of technology, 
as well as food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/S-7/2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States Members of the United Nations and other relevant stakeholders 
to participate actively in the High-level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges 
of Climate Change and Bioenergy, to be held from 3 to 5 June 2008, in Rome, organized 
by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, while taking note of 
the results of the special meeting of the Economic and Social Council on this issue, held 
on 20 May 2008; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Invites </i>the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to extend an 
invitation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and to the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food to attend and actively participate in the aforementioned 
High-level Conference, so as to help to mainstream a human rights perspective in the analysis of 
the world food crisis, with a focus on the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to make a presentation to the Council at its 
eighth session on his participation in the meeting mentioned in paragraph 5 above, and on his 
initial recommendations regarding actions required, at all levels, to promote, respect and protect 
the right to food and freedom from hunger in the midst of the current food crisis, when actions 
are called for to promote mid- and long-term food security; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to present a report to the Council at its 
ninth session, inviting comments from States and other relevant actors, on the impact of the 
global food crisis on the protection of the right to food and the required remedies from a human 
rights perspective; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner for Human Rights to bring the present resolution to 
the attention of all relevant international organizations and agencies; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue reporting on further 
developments on this issue to the Council and the General Assembly; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the implementation of the present resolution. 
</p>
<p><i>2nd meeting 
22 May 2008 
</i></p>
<p>Resolution adopted, as orally revised, without a vote; see chapter II. </p>
