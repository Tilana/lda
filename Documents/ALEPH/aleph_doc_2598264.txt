Perseus Mining positions itself for growth following a challenging year
West  African  gold  producer  Perseus  Mining  Limited  (ASX/TSX:  PRU)  (“Perseus”)  has  released  its 
Annual Financial Report for the twelve months ending 30 June 2016  (“FY2016”), announcing a loss 
for  the  year  attributable  to  the  owners  of  the  parent  entity  (i.e.  excluding  minority  interests)  of 
A$35.6  million,  or  (5.7)  cents  per  share.  This  loss  compares  to  a  profit  of  A$87.8m  earned  in  the 
corresponding period ending 30 June 2015 (“FY2015”). The key factors contributing to the reduction 
in earnings include a reduction of A$43.2 million in foreign exchange gain, a write-off of exploration 
expenditure of A$17.9M and reduced gold production at the Edikan Gold Mine in Ghana (“Edikan”) 
due to issues arising from delays in obtaining access to mine the Fetish and Chirawewa pits.
An intensive work programme was undertaken at Edikan during the second half of FY2016 which has 
resulted in materially  improved  operating performance  as well as  reduced unit costs  compared to 
FY2015: mining cost per tonne of material mined reduced by 40%; processing cost per tonne of ore 
milled reduced by 11%; and G & A cost reduced by 19%. Coupled with a period of accelerated capital 
investment  to  achieve  power  self-sufficiency,  processing  plant  improvements,  waste  stripping  and 
infrastructure and relocation housing, all of which are scheduled to finish by December 2016, Edikan 
is expected to enter a period of sustained strong positive cash flows from early calendar year 2017.
Following execution of a Mining Convention for Perseus’s second operating mine, the Sissingué Gold 
Mine in Côte d’Ivoire (“Sissingué”) in July 2015, execution plans for the full scale development of the 
project have been activated and production of first gold from Sissingué is scheduled to occur in the 
December 2017 quarter.
On  18  April  2016,  Perseus  acquired  Amara  Mining  plc  giving  Perseus  ownership  of  one  of  West 
Africa’s  highest  quality  pre-development  stage  projects,  the  Yaouré  Gold  Project  in  Côte  d’Ivoire 
(“Yaouré”).  Contracts  for  all  material  work  packages  required  to  complete  the  Yaouré  definitive 
feasibility study have been awarded and work on the study is well underway.
On 20 June 2016, Perseus announced an equity placement and an accelerated entitlements offer. In 
total  A$102  million  of  equity  capital  was  raised  from  new  and  existing  institutional  and  retail 
investors. Perseus has also advanced negotiations for a project finance debt facility of US$60 million 
to  be  used  to  partially  fund  the  development  of  Sissingué  with  Macquarie  Bank  and  BNP  Paribas. 
Final credit approval and documentation of the debt facility are anticipated to be completed early in 
the 2017 financial year.

Combining  proceeds  of  the  equity  capital  raising  and  planned  debt  facility  with  expected  future 
positive cash flows from Edikan from January 2017 and Sissingué from the March quarter of 2018, 
means  that  Perseus  is  well  placed  to  fund  its  growth  strategy  that  is  expected  to  transform  the 
Company from being a single-country, single-mine enterprise into a multi-mine, multi-country gold 
producer with production in excess of 500,000 ounces of gold within five years.
Other key points of the 2016 Financial Year results include:
  24% decrease in revenue 
  7% increase in expenses 
  Cash balance of A$151.2M, or 15.1cps – A$47.5M (46%) more than FY2015 
  Combined  value  of  cash  and  bullion  of  A$166.0M,  or  16.5cps  at  the  end  of  FY2016  –  up
A$38.7M or 30% on FY2015
  Working capital of A$159.7M – a decrease of A$17.9M, or 10%, on FY2015 
  No third party debt.
Edikan produced the following results in the 2016 Financial Year:
-  Gold production 153,900 ounces 
-  All In Site Costs US$1,351/oz 
-  Average sale price of gold US$1,224/oz.
Managing Director Jeff Quartermaine Comments:
“The 2016 fiscal year has been a challenging period for Perseus as reflected by the results 
announced today however, it has been an important year for us in terms of our corporate 
development. Not only have we met and overcome some sizeable operating challenges at our 
Edikan mine but we have set the platform for a major transformation of Perseus through 
acquiring the Yaouré Gold Project, committing to the development of our second operation at 
Sissingué and arranging sufficient finance to enable us to execute our growth plans.
Considered in the context of a widely held and positive view of the future market for gold, 
Perseus is now very well positioned to unlock and create material value for shareholders in 
coming years.”
