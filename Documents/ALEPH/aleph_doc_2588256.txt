Hercules Offshore, Inc.
(&#147;Hercules&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) commenced a solicitation of 
acceptances of a consensual Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization (the 
&#147;Plan&#148;) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code (the 
&#147;Bankruptcy
Code&#148;). A copy of the Solicitation and Disclosure Statement for the Joint 
Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization of the Company and certain of its U.S. 
domestic direct and indirect subsidiaries (the &#147;Solicitation and Disclosure
Statement&#148;), which includes a copy of the Plan, is attached as Exhibit 99.1
to this Current Report on Form 8-K. As part of the Plan, on July&nbsp;13, 2015, 
the Company also entered into a commitment letter (and agreed to pay certain 
fees) with
certain holders of its existing senior unsecured notes, pursuant to which such 
holders agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the commitment 
letter, including confirmation of the Plan, to lend the Company $450 million 
upon the
effective date of the Plan. The commitment letter is included as an exhibit to 
the Solicitation and Disclosure Statement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New 
Roman">The Company
recommends that holders of claims against the Company refer to the information 
and the limitations and qualifications discussed in the Solicitation and 
Disclosure Statement, including the attached Plan. Information contained in the 
Solicitation and
Disclosure Statement, including the attached Plan, is subject to change, whether
as a result of amendments, actions of third parties or otherwise. There can be 
no assurances that the Plan will be approved or confirmed pursuant to the 
Bankruptcy
Code. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management of the Company has prepared
the financial projections included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and has not 
received an
opinion or report on it from any independent auditor or third party. The 
assumptions and estimates underlying the projections are substantially driven by
estimated activity levels of our customers and, although we consider our 
assumptions as to
activity levels reasonable as of the date these projections were prepared, those
estimates and our ability to achieve anticipated results are subject to a wide 
variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and 
uncertainties,
including those related to commodity prices, that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those contained in the projections. As the financial 
projections cover future years, such information by its nature becomes less 
predictive and
less reliable with each successive year. While they may be presented with 
numeric specificity, the projections reflect numerous assumptions made by our 
management with respect to financial condition, business and industry 
performance, general
economic, market and financial conditions, and other matters, all of which are 
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions used in preparing the projections
will prove
accurate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; 
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial analyses and other 
information and projections included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K should not
be regarded
as an indication that this financial and other information or projections 
reflect current estimates or expectations, beliefs and assumptions of management
about prospects for the Company&#146;s business, changes in general business or 
economic
conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or may occur or 
that was not anticipated at the time the information was prepared. The 
information likely does not reflect either current results or future 
performance. The financial
analyses and projections were prepared for purposes of the Plan and are 
subjective in many respects. The information included in Exhibit 99.1 reflects 
information prepared in July 2015 and does not reflect any subsequent events or 
adjustments,
including adjustments customarily made in year-end balance sheets, including any
asset impairments, debt reclassifications and other matters. The financial 
analyses and projections are forward-looking statements and should be read 
together with our
historical financial statements and public filings with the SEC, including the 
risk factors and cautionary statements in our public filings with the SEC, as 
well as our fleet status reports made public from time to time. The information 
included in
Exhibit 99.1 does not include all information that may be required by SEC 
disclosure rules, including Regulation G. Information required by Regulation G 
is included in our applicable filings with the SEC. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The financial projections were not prepared with a 
view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute 
of
Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, 
but, in the view of our management, were prepared on a reasonable basis based on
available estimates and judgments at the time. The information is a high-level 
summary
only and is subject to assumptions, qualifications and performance criteria not 
otherwise described or apparent in the information presented. The financial 
projections and underlying assumptions are not factual and should not be relied 
upon as being
a representation by us or necessarily indicative of future results, and you are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. We do not prepare 
projections for disclosure purposes in the ordinary course of our business and
do not
anticipate that we will continue to prepare or update projections for disclosure
in the future. </P>

Securities Act of 1933
and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements in this 
Form 8-K or exhibits hereto that are not historical fact are forward-looking 
statements, including the timing of the restructuring, and its impact on our 
operations,
customers, vendors and employees. Forward-looking statements by their nature 
involve substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including without 
limitation, contract renegotiations with customers, early termination or 
renegotiation by
customers or suppliers pursuant to contract or otherwise, government and 
regulatory actions and other factors described in the risks and uncertainties 
described in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange

different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by 
our
forward-looking statements, including but not limited to potential adverse 
effects related to the following: potential de-listing of our common stock on 
Nasdaq; potential restructuring of our outstanding debt and related effects on 
the holders of
our outstanding common stock and notes; potential effects of the industry 
downturn on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
potential limitations on our ability to maintain contracts and other critical 
business relationships;
requirements for adequate liquidity to fund our operations in the future, 
including obtaining sufficient financing on acceptable terms; and other matters 
related to the potential restructuring and our indebtedness. Accordingly, you 
should not place
undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not intend to

management forecasts not to be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks 
and uncertainties relating to the Debtors&#146; businesses (including their 
ability to achieve
strategic goals, objectives, and targets over applicable periods), industry 
performance, the regulatory environment, general business and economic 
conditions and other factors. The Debtors caution that no representations can be
made as to the
accuracy of these projections or to their ultimate performance compared to the 
information contained in the forecasts or that the forecasted results will be 
achieved. Therefore, the financial projections may not be relied upon as a

group of holders of Senior Notes that together hold in excess of 66&nbsp;2/3% of
the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. This Disclosure Statement, the 
Plan, and the accompanying documents have been extensively negotiated with the 
legal and/or financial advisors to the Steering Group. The votes on the Plan are
being
solicited in accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement dated as of 
June&nbsp;17, 2015 (as may be amended from time to time), which was executed by 
the Debtors and each of the members of the Steering Group. </B></P>

the Effective Date to occur promptly after confirmation of the Plan. There can 
be no
assurance, however, as to when and whether confirmation of the Plan and the 
Effective Date actually will occur. The confirmation and effectiveness of the 
Plan are subject to material conditions precedent. See Section 
VIII.A&#151;&#147;<B>Conditions

conditions will be satisfied or waived. Procedures for distributions under the

the indebtedness
contemplated by the Plan is not approved and consummated, there can be no 
assurance that the Debtors will be able to effectuate an alternative 
restructuring or successfully emerge from its chapter 11 cases, and the Debtors 
may be forced into a
liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or under the laws of other 
countries. As reflected in the Liquidation Analysis (as defined below), 
<B><I><U>the Debtors believe that if operations are terminated and their assets 
are liquidated
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, the value of the assets 
available for payment to creditors and interest holders would be significantly 
lower than the value of the distributions contemplated by and under the 
Plan.</U></I></B>

Disclosure Statement pursuant to section 1126 of title 11 of the United States 
Code (the &#147;<B><U>Bankruptcy Code</U></B>&#148;) for use in the solicitation
of votes on the Plan. A copy of the Plan is annexed as <B>Exhibit A </B>to this
Disclosure Statement. <B>Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.</B> For the avoidance of

New Roman">HERO provides shallow-water drilling and marine services to the oil 
and natural gas
exploration and production industry globally through its Domestic Offshore, 
International Offshore and International Liftboats segments (as discussed 
further below). At June&nbsp;23, 2015, the Debtors and their Non-Debtor 
Subsidiaries (collectively,
&#147;<B><U>Hercules</U></B>&#148; or the &#147;<B><U>Company</U></B>&#148;) 
operated a fleet of 27 jackup rigs, including one rig under construction, and 24
liftboat vessels. Hercules&#146; diverse fleet is capable of providing services 
such as oil
and gas exploration and development drilling, well service, platform inspection,
maintenance and decommissioning operations in several key shallow-water 
provinces around the world. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The purpose of this Disclosure Statement is to 
provide information of a kind, and in sufficient detail, to enable creditors of 
the Debtors
that are entitled to vote on the Plan to make informed decisions on whether to 
vote to accept or reject the Plan. This Disclosure Statement sets forth certain 
information regarding the Debtors&#146; prepetition operating and financial 
history, the
Debtors&#146; need to seek chapter 11 protection, significant events that are 
expected to occur during the Chapter 11 Cases, and the Debtors&#146; anticipated
organization, operations, and liquidity upon successful emergence from chapter 
11
protection. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; 
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Plan and this Disclosure 
Statement are the result of extensive and vigorous negotiations among the 
Debtors and the
Steering Group, which is an ad hoc group of holders of Senior Notes that 
collectively hold in excess of 66 2/3% of the Senior Notes. The culmination of 
such negotiations was the entry into the Restructuring Support Agreement (as may
be amended from
time to time, the &#147;<B><U>Restructuring Support Agreement</U></B>&#148;), a 
copy of which is attached hereto as <B>Exhibit B</B>. The Restructuring Support 
Agreement sets forth the material terms and conditions of the restructuring 
provided for
in the Plan and described herein (the &#147;<B><U>Restructuring</U></B>&#148;). 
As described in more detail below, the Plan substantially deleverages the 
Debtors&#146; balance sheet by converting approximately $1.2 billion of debt 
under the Senior
Notes into 96.9% of the equity in Reorganized HERO. As part of the overall 
settlement embodied in the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan, the 
holders of Senior Notes are voluntarily forgoing their right to part of the 
distributions under
the Plan that they are otherwise entitled to receive so that the Debtors can 
(i)&nbsp;pay in full allowed general unsecured claims, such as the claims of 
suppliers and vendors, in the ordinary course according to existing business 
terms and
(ii)&nbsp;provide a pro rata distribution of a portion of the New HERO Common 
Stock and the New HERO Warrants to holders of HERO Equity Interests in exchange
for the surrender or cancellation of their Equity Interests. </P>

Restructuring Support Agreement believe that the restructuring contemplated by 
the Plan is in the
best interests of all stakeholders because it (i)&nbsp;achieves a substantial 
deleveraging of the Debtors&#146; balance sheet through consensus with the 
overwhelming majority of the holders of Senior Notes, (ii)&nbsp;provides for a 
reduction of
approximately $50 million of the Debtors&#146; pre-Restructuring annual interest
burden on previously funded debt, (iii)&nbsp;provides $450 million of new 
financing in the form of the First Lien Exit Facility, and (iv)&nbsp;eliminates 
potential
deterioration of value&#151;and disruptions to worldwide operations&#151;that 
could otherwise result from protracted and contentious bankruptcy cases. 
Importantly, the Debtors would not be able to implement the conversion of debt-
to-equity
contemplated by the Plan without the support of the Steering Group. In sum, the 
Plan embodies a global settlement as part of an expeditious and consensual 
restructuring. This avoids potential litigation that could decrease value for 
all stakeholders
and delay (and possibly derail) the restructuring process. The significant 
support obtained by the Debtors pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement 
provides a fair and reasonable path for an expeditious consummation of the Plan 
and the
preservation of Hercules&#146; ordinary course of business. </P> <P

businesses in which Hercules
operates are highly competitive. Domestic drilling contracts are traditionally 
short term in nature, although Hercules has at times been awarded longer term 
domestic drilling contracts. International drilling and liftboat contracts are 
generally
longer term in nature. The contracts are typically awarded on a competitive bid 
basis. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified 
contractor is awarded a job, although technical capability of service and 
equipment, unit
availability, unit location, safety record and crew quality may also be
considered. Certain competitors in the shallow-water business may have greater 
financial and other resources than Hercules. As a result, these competitors may 
have a better
ability to withstand periods of low utilization, compete more effectively on the
basis of price, build new rigs, acquire existing rigs, and make technological 
improvements to existing equipment or replace equipment that becomes obsolete. 
Competition
for offshore rigs is usually on a global basis, as drilling rigs are highly 
mobile and may be moved, at a cost that is sometimes substantial, from one 
region to another in response to demand. However, the Company&#146;s mat-
supported jackup rigs are
less capable than independent leg jackup rigs of managing variable sea floor 
conditions found in most areas outside the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, the 
Company&#146;s ability to move its mat-supported jackup rigs to certain regions 
in response to
changes in market conditions is limited. Additionally, a number of competitors 
have independent leg jackup rigs with generally higher specifications and 
capabilities than most of the independent leg rigs that Hercules currently 
operates.
Particularly during market downturns when there is decreased rig demand, higher 
specification rigs may be more likely to obtain contracts than lower 
specification rigs. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-

revenue for management agreements, mobilization, demobilization, contract 
preparation and customer reimbursables. The amount of actual revenue earned and 
the actual periods during which revenue is earned will be different than the

including unscheduled repairs, maintenance, operational delays, health, safety 
and environmental incidents, weather events in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere 
and other
factors (some of which are beyond the Company&#146;s control), may result in 
lower dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate. In some of the

and in certain
instances, with little or no notice. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

degrees by
federal, state, local and foreign and/or international governmental laws and 
regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or 
otherwise relating to environmental protection. The industry is dependent on 
demand for services
from the oil and natural gas industry and, accordingly, is also affected by 
changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. In the 
United States, Hercules is subject to the jurisdiction of the Environmental 
Protection Agency
(&#147;<B><U>EPA</U></B>&#148;), U.S. Coast Guard (&#147;<B><U>Coast

of the Macondo well blowout incident in April 2010, BSEE and BOEM have proposed 
and implemented regulations and requirements that add safety measures, increase 
permit scrutiny and add other requirements and policies such as contractor 
sanctions that
could materially increase the cost of offshore drilling in the U.S. Gulf of 
Mexico. Restrictions on oil and gas development and production activities in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and the promulgation of notices to lessees have impacted 
and may
continue to impact the Company&#146;s operations. In addition, the federal 
government has considered legislation that could impose additional equipment and
safety requirements on operators and drilling contractors in the U.S. Gulf of 
Mexico as well
as regulations relating to the protection of the environment, all of which could
materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition and results 
of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The shorelines and shallow-water areas of the U.S. 
Gulf of Mexico are ecologically sensitive. Heightened environmental concerns in 
these areas
have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well 
permitting process and, in general, have adversely affected drilling decisions 
of oil and natural gas companies. In the United States, the Company&#146;s 
operations are subject
to federal and state laws and regulations that require us to obtain and maintain
specified permits or governmental approvals; control the discharge of materials 
into the environment; remove and cleanup materials that may harm the 
environment; or
otherwise comply with the protection of the environment. For example, as an 
operator of mobile offshore units in navigable U.S. waters including the OCS, 
and some offshore areas, Hercules may be liable for damages and costs incurred 
in connection
with oil spills or other unauthorized discharges of chemicals or wastes 
resulting from or related to those operations. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and 
criminal penalties,
the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions 
restricting some or all of the Company&#146;s activities in the affected areas.

1972, as amended, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, prohibits the 
discharge of
pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States without a permit. The 
regulations implementing the Clean Water Act require permits to be obtained by 
an operator before specified discharge activities occur. Offshore facilities 
must also
prepare plans addressing spill prevention, control and countermeasures. In place
of the former Clean Water Act exemption, the EPA adopted a Vessel General 
Permit, effective December&nbsp;19, 2008, that required subject vessel 
operators, including
us, to obtain a Vessel General Permit for all of the Company&#146;s covered 
vessels by February&nbsp;6, 2009. Hercules has obtained the necessary Vessel 
General Permit for all of the Company&#146;s vessels to which this permitting 
program applies
and has prepared Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans where 
appropriate. In addition to the EPA&#146;s issuance of the Vessel General 
Permit, some states are, and other states are considering, regulating ballast 
water discharges.
Violations of monitoring, reporting and permitting requirements associated with 
applicable ballast water discharge permitting programs or other regulatory 
initiatives may result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties. 
Moreover, Hercules
has incurred added costs to comply with legal requirements under the Vessel 
General Permit and may continue to incur further costs as other legal 
requirements under federal and state ballast water discharge permit programs are
adopted and
implemented, but Hercules does not believe that such compliance efforts will 
have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations or 
financial position. </P>

the U.S. A &#147;responsible party&#148; includes the owner or operator of an 
onshore
facility, pipeline or vessel or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an 
offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party 
for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Under OPA, as
amended by
the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, &#147;tank 
vessels&#148; are subject to certain specified liability limits. Few defenses 
exist to the liability imposed by OPA and the liability could be substantial. 
Moreover, a party cannot
take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence 
or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, 
construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to
cooperate fully in
the cleanup, the liability limits likewise do not apply and certain defenses may
not be available. In addition, OPA imposes on responsible parties the need for 
proof of financial responsibility to cover at least some costs in a potential 
spill. As
required, Hercules has provided satisfactory evidence of financial 
responsibility to the Coast Guard for all of the Company&#146;s vessels subject

member countries to the International Maritime Organization 
(&#147;<B><U>IMO</U></B>&#148;), a
specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for developing 
measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to 
prevent marine pollution from ships. Among the various international conventions
negotiated by
the IMO is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from 
Ships (&#147;<B><U>MARPOL</U></B>&#148;). MARPOL imposes environmental standards
on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the 
handling and
disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and 
air emissions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annex VI to MARPOL sets 
limits on sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts, prohibits deliberate 
emissions of ozone depleting substances and includes measures aimed at reducing 
greenhouse gases. Annex VI entered into force on May&nbsp;19, 2005, and applies
to all
ships, fixed and floating drilling rigs and other floating platforms. Annex VI 
also imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for 
specialized areas to be established internationally with more stringent controls
on sulfur
emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling rigs, 
Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. For this 
purpose, gross tonnage is based on the International Tonnage Certificate for the
vessel, which
may vary from the standard U.S. gross tonnage for the vessel reflected in the 
liftboat table previously. Annex VI came into force in the United States on 
January&nbsp;8, 2009. Moreover, on July&nbsp;1, 2010, amendments to Annex VI to 
the MARPOL
Convention took effect requiring the imposition of progressively stricter 
limitations on sulfur emissions from ships. As a result, limitations imposed on 
sulfur emissions will require that fuels of vessels in covered Emission Control 
Areas
(&#147;<B><U>ECAs</U></B>&#148;) contain no more than 1% sulfur. In August 2012,
the North American ECA became enforceable. The North American ECA includes areas
subject to the exclusive sovereignty of the United States and extends up to 200
nautical miles from the coasts of the United States, which area includes parts 
of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2012, 
limits on marine fuel used to power ships in non-ECA areas were capped at 3.5% 
sulfur and, in
August 2012, when the North American ECA became effective, the sulfur limit in 
marine fuel was capped at 1%, which is the capped amount for all other ECA areas
since July&nbsp;1, 2010. These capped amounts will then decrease progressively 
until they
reach 0.5% by January&nbsp;1, 2020 for non-ECA areas and 0.1% by January&nbsp;1,
2015 for ECA areas, including the North American ECA. The amendments also 
establish new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new 
marine engines,
depending on their date of installation. The Company&#146;s operation of vessels
in international waters, outside of the North American ECA, are subject to the 
requirements of Annex VI in those countries that have implemented its 
provisions.
Hercules believes the rigs it currently offers for international projects are 
generally exempt from the more costly compliance requirements of Annex VI and 
the liftboats it currently offers for international projects are generally 
exempt from or
otherwise substantially comply with those requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

Contracts Generally </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s 
contracts to provide services are individually negotiated and vary in their 
terms and
provisions. Currently, all of the Company&#146;s drilling contracts are on a 
dayrate basis. Dayrate drilling contracts typically provide for payment on a 
dayrate basis, with higher rates while the unit is operating and lower rates or 
a lump sum
payment for periods of mobilization or when operations are interrupted or 
restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other factors.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over 
a period of time covering the drilling of a single well or group of wells or 
covering a
stated term. These contracts typically can be terminated by the customer under 
various circumstances such as the loss or destruction of the drilling unit or 
the suspension of drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result
of a
breakdown of major equipment or due to events beyond the control of either 
party. In addition, customers in some instances have the right to terminate 
contracts with little or no prior notice, and without penalty or early 
termination payments. The
contract term in some instances may be extended by the customers exercising 
options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term, or by 
exercising a right of first refusal. Traditionally, most contracts in the U.S. 
Gulf of Mexico
have been on a short-term basis of less than six months. Contracts in 
international locations have historically been longer-term, with contract terms 
of up to five years. For contracts over six months in term Hercules may have the
right to pass
through certain cost escalations. Customers may have the right to terminate, or 
may seek to renegotiate, existing contracts if Hercules experiences downtime or 
operational problems above a contractual limit, if the rig is a total loss, or 
in other
specified circumstances. A customer is more likely to seek to cancel or 
renegotiate its contract during periods of depressed market conditions. Hercules
could be required to pay penalties if some contracts with customers are canceled
due to downtime
or operational problems. Suspension of drilling contracts results in the 
reduction in or loss of dayrates for the period of the suspension. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">A liftboat contract generally is based on a flat 
dayrate for the vessel and crew. Liftboat
dayrates are determined by prevailing market rates, vessel availability and 
historical rates paid by the specific customer. Under most of its liftboat 
contracts, Hercules receives a variable rate for reimbursement of costs such as 
catering, fuel,
rental equipment and other items. Liftboat contracts generally are for shorter 
terms than are drilling contracts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On 
larger contracts,
particularly outside the United States, Hercules may be required to arrange for 
the issuance of a variety of bank guarantees, performance bonds or letters of 
credit. The issuance of such guarantees may be a condition of the bidding 
process imposed
by customers for work outside the United States. The customer would have the 
right to call on the guarantee, bond or letter of credit in the event Hercules 
defaults in the performance of the services. The guarantees, bonds and letters 
of credit
would typically expire after Hercules completes the services. </P> <P

Hercules&#146; oilfield
services is driven by its exploration and production customers&#146; capital 
spending, which can experience significant fluctuation depending on current 
commodity prices and their expectations of future price levels, among other 
factors. The recent
decline in the price of crude oil has negatively impacted dayrates and demand 
for Hercules&#146; services. In addition to the oil price decline, the 
consolidation of the domestic customer base has negatively impacted demand for 
jackup rigs in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, the new capacity growth expected over the 
next three years could put further pressure on the operating environment for the
existing jackup rig fleet. Although activity levels for liftboats are not as 
closely
correlated to commodity prices as Hercules&#146; drilling segments, commodity 
prices are still a key driver of liftboat demand. Demand for liftboat services

numerous actions to mitigate the effects of the decline in activity levels,

(ii)&nbsp;significantly reducing its capital expenditures planned for 2015; and
(iii)&nbsp;significantly reducing its workforce, both onshore and offshore. 
Hercules continues to monitor its operating environment and will respond to 
further activity level declines as appropriate. Hercules cannot predict how an 
extended period of
low commodity prices will affect its operations and liquidity levels. </P> <P

per day decreased to $99,203 in the first quarter 2015 from $106,596 in the 
comparable 2014 period. Operating
expense decreased approximately 51% to $36.0 million in the first quarter 2015 
from $72.8 million in the first quarter 2014, largely attributable to the 
reduced number of marketed rigs in operation. Domestic Offshore generated 
operating income of
$3.8 million in the first quarter 2015, compared to $51.5 million in the first 
quarter 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%;
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">International Offshore revenue 
declined to
$51.6 million in the first quarter 2015, from $80.9 million in the first quarter
2014, driven largely by reduced utilization and partially offset by slightly 
higher dayrates. Utilization decreased to 47.9% in the first quarter 2015 from 
88.1% in the
first quarter 2014, largely due to scheduled downtime for equipment 
recertification on the Hercules 262, as well as idle time on the <I>Hercules 
Triumph</I>, <I>Hercules Resilience</I> and <I>Hercules 260</I>. Average revenue
per rig per day
increased to $149,704 in the first quarter 2015 from $136,030 in the first 
quarter of 2014, driven in part by a demobilization fee of $4.5 million received
for the <I>Hercules 208</I> following its contract conclusion, as well as higher
dayrates on
the <I>Hercules 261</I> and <I>Hercules 262</I> as these rigs rolled to new 
contracts. Operating expense in the first quarter 2015 was $50.2 million, up 
slightly from $47.5 million in the respective 2014 period. Preparation costs for
the <I>Hercules
260</I> prior to commencing its contract with a subsidiary of Eni S.p.A. in 
Gabon, as well as mobilization costs of the <I>Hercules 208</I> to Malaysia, 
contributed to the increase in segment operating expenses. International 
Offshore recorded an
operating loss of $20.9 million in the first quarter 2015 compared to operating

million in the first quarter 2015 from $32.5 million in the prior year period, 
due to lower
utilization and dayrates. First quarter 2015 utilization of 38.1% reflects a 
continuation of lower activity in Nigeria as well as shipyard work on multiple 
boats in both West Africa and the Middle East, and compares to 57.9% utilization
during the
first quarter 2014 period. Average revenue per liftboat per day decreased to 
$22,964 in the first quarter 2015 from $27,132 in the first quarter 2014, 
primarily due to a shift in revenue mix toward the smaller class liftboats while
larger boats were
in the shipyard. Operating expenses in the first quarter 2015 declined by 34% to
$13.5 million, compared to $20.4 million in the first quarter 2014, reflecting 
lower activity levels and the impact of the Company&#146;s cost reduction

with a heavy debt
burden and declining revenues, Hercules hired financial and legal advisors to 
evaluate a wide range of options to improve Hercules&#146; financial position in
the event of a prolonged market downturn. Hercules engaged Baker Botts L.L.P. as
legal
restructuring counsel, Lazard as a financial advisor, and Deutsche Bank as an 
investment banker. Hercules engaged in discussions with potential financing 
sources and existing holders of Senior Notes to determine available options to 
enhance
liquidity, including new financing and deleveraging measures and considered both
out-of-court as well as bankruptcy court focused alternatives. Hercules and its 
Board of Directors carefully considered and weighed each option with the benefit
of
advice from its financial and legal advisors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt;

ultimately become
the Steering Group&#151;formed and hired professionals to advise the group about
options to protect their investment in Hercules bonds. The Steering Group 
engaged Akin Gump Strauss Hauer&nbsp;&amp; Feld LLP as its legal counsel and the
Blackstone
Group as its financial advisor. Thereafter, Hercules and the Steering Group 
entered into negotiations regarding a potential restructuring transaction that 
would allow Hercules to substantially reduce its debt burden and secure 
additional liquidity
to help Hercules navigate the current downcycle. The Restructuring Support
Agreement, discussed below, contemplates a value maximizing transaction for 
Hercules, providing for a balance sheet restructuring while operations continue 
as usual. The new
capital structure provided by the financial restructuring contemplated by the 
Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan will provide the best foundation 
for Hercules to meet the challenges in the global offshore drilling market due 
to the
downcycle in crude oil prices and the expected influx of newbuild jackup rigs 
over the coming years as well as an opportunity for all of its existing 
stakeholders to participate in any recovery. Although holders of existing equity
interests in HERO
are out of the money and not entitled to a distribution under the Plan, the Plan
provides that holders of such equity interests will receive New HERO Equity 
Interests and New HERO Warrants, so long as they do not opt out of granting the

Debtors&#146; release of the Released Parties is appropriate where: 
(a)&nbsp;there is an identity of
interest between the debtor and the third party, such that a suit against the 
released non-debtor party is, at core, a suit against the debtor or will deplete
assets of the estate; (b)&nbsp;there is a substantial contribution by the non-

of the claims affected
by the injunction. <I>See In re Indianapolis Downs, LLC</I>, 486 B.R. 286, 303 
(Bankr. D. Del. 2013). Importantly, these factors are &#147;neither exclusive 
nor are they a list of conjunctive requirements,&#148; but &#147;[i]nstead, they
are helpful
in weighing the equities of the particular case after a fact-specific

third party claims against non-debtors, such as the Third-Party Release, where 
such releases are
consensual. <I>Id.</I> at 304&#150;06. In addition, exculpation is appropriate 
where it applies to estate fiduciaries. <I>Id.</I> at 306. Finally, an 
injunction is appropriate where it is necessary to the reorganization and fair 
pursuant to section
105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. <I>See In re W.R. Grace&nbsp;&amp; Co.</I>, 475

text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Debtors believe
that the
releases, exculpations, and injunctions set forth in the Plan are appropriate 
because, among other things, the releases are narrowly tailored to the 
Debtors&#146; restructuring proceedings, and each of the Released Parties has 
afforded value to the
Debtors and aided in the reorganization process, which facilitated the 
Debtors&#146; ability to propose and pursue confirmation of the Plan. The 
Debtors believe that each of the Released Parties has played an integral role in
negotiating and
formulating the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan and has expended 
significant time and resources analyzing and negotiating the issues presented by
the Debtors&#146; prepetition capital structure. Furthermore, holders of Senior 
Notes
Claims are voluntarily forgoing their right to part of the distributions under 
the Plan that they are otherwise entitled to receive so that the Debtors can 
(i)&nbsp;pay in full Allowed General Unsecured Claims, such as the Claims of 
suppliers and
vendors, in the ordinary course according to existing business terms and 
(ii)&nbsp;provide a Pro Rata distribution of a portion of the New HERO Common 
Stock and the New HERO Warrants to holders of HERO Equity Interests in exchange 
for the surrender
or cancellation of their Equity Interests, provided that they do not opt out of 
the voluntary releases contained in the Plan. In addition, certain holders of 
Senior Notes Claims have agreed to backstop the First Lien Exit Facility. The 
Debtors
further believe that such releases, exculpations, and injunctions are a 
necessary part of the Plan. Finally, the Debtors believe the Third-Party Release
is entirely consensual under the established case law in the United States 
Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware. <I>See Indianapolis Downs</I>, 486 B.R. at 
304&#150;06. The Debtors will be prepared to meet their burden to establish the 
basis for the releases, exculpations, and injunctions for each of the Released 
Parties and each
Exculpated Party as part of Confirmation of the Plan. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt;

Plan. While the Plan provides for the reorganization of the Debtors&#146; 
business as a
going concern and the conversion of approximately $1.2 billion of funded debt 
into equity, a different plan might involve either a reorganization and 
continuation of the Debtors&#146; business or, in the alternative, a sale or 
liquidation of the
Debtors&#146; assets. In the event the Plan is not confirmed, there is no 
guaranty the Debtors will be able to obtain any investment at all, let alone one
that would provide recoveries as favorable to its stakeholders as those provided
pursuant to
the Plan. As an alternative to a going concern reorganization, a sale or 
liquidation of Debtors&#146; assets would, in Debtors&#146; view, be unlikely to
provide returns equal or greater to the returns provided by the Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt;

diminished
recoveries, significant delay, and larger administrative costs. The Debtors 
believe that the Plan, as described herein, enables creditors to realize the 
highest and best value under the circumstances as compared to any foreseeable 
alternative. </P>

would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Debtors&#146; assets for

Bankruptcy Code. A discussion of the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would 
have on the
recoveries of holders of Claims and Equity Interests is set forth in the 
Liquidation Analysis annexed as <B>Exhibit E</B> to this Disclosure Statement.

the Plan provides a greater
recovery for holders of Allowed Claims and Equity Interests as would be achieved
in a liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. This belief is based on
a number of considerations, including: (a)&nbsp;the likely erosion in value of 
the
Debtors&#146; rigs and vessels in a chapter 7 case in the context of an 
expeditious liquidation and the &#147;forced sale&#148; atmosphere that would 
prevail under a chapter 7 liquidation; (b)&nbsp;the additional Administrative 
Claims generated by
conversion to a chapter 7 case and any related costs in connection with a 
chapter 7 liquidation; (c)&nbsp;the absence of a robust market for the 
liquidation sale of the Debtors&#146; assets and services in which such assets 
and services could be
marketed and sold; and (d)&nbsp;the additional claims that would arise by reason
of the breach or rejection in a chapter 7 of obligations under leases and

Liquidation Analysis is based on the value of the Debtors&#146; assets and

commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code will not be deemed to have 
accepted or rejected the plan if the Court finds that the plan was not 
transmitted to substantially all creditors and equity security holders of the

such a re-solicitation would be successful. Re-solicitation could delay or 
jeopardize Confirmation of the Plan and result in termination of the

termination
event due to the fact that, based on the Valuation Analysis, holders of HERO 
Equity Interests are not entitled to a distribution under the Plan. As noted

accomplish an alternative to the Plan. There can be no assurance that the terms

continue normal
operations, public perception of its continued viability may affect, among other
things, the desire of new and existing customers to enter into, or continue, 
agreements or arrangements with the Debtors. The failure to maintain any of 
these important
relationships could adversely affect the Debtors&#146; business, financial 
condition, and results of operations. Because of the public disclosure of the 
Chapter 11 Cases and concerns vendors may have about liquidity, the 
Debtors&#146; ability to
maintain normal credit terms with vendors may be impaired. Also, the

of its business
and reflects assumptions and analyses based on the Debtors&#146; experience and 
perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future 
developments, as well as other factors that the Debtors consider appropriate 
under the
circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent
with the Debtors&#146; expectations and assumptions depends on a number of 
factors, including but not limited to the Debtors&#146; (i)&nbsp;ability to 
implement the
substantial changes to the capital structure; (ii)&nbsp;ability to obtain 
adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii)&nbsp;ability to maintain 
customers&#146; confidence in the Company&#146;s viability as a continuing

employees, as well as the overall strength and stability of general economic

Projections, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, debt service, and cash 
flow. Financial
forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the 
assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will 
not be accurate. In the Company&#146;s case, the forecasts are even more 
speculative than
normal, because they involve fundamental changes in the nature of its capital 
structure. Accordingly, Hercules acknowledges that its actual financial 
condition and results of operations may differ, perhaps materially, from what 
was anticipated.
Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments 
contemplated by any plan of reorganization implemented will occur or, even if 
they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on the Debtors and 
their subsidiaries
or their businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or 
developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the
successful execution of any plan of reorganization. </P>

drilling
activity since clients&#146; expectations about future commodity prices 
typically drive demand for the Company&#146;s services. Reductions in capital

STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-
family:Times New Roman">Currently, all drilling contracts with major customers 
are
dayrate contracts, where the Debtors charge a fixed charge per day regardless of
the number of days needed to drill the well. Likewise, under existing liftboat 
contracts, the Debtors charge a fixed fee per day regardless of the success of 
the
operations that are being conducted by the customer utilizing the liftboat. In 
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, contracts are generally short term, and oil and natural
gas companies tend to reduce activity levels quickly in response to depressed 
oil and
natural gas prices, such as the Debtors are currently experiencing. Due to the 
short-term nature of most contracts, a decline in market conditions such as the 
Debtors are currently experiencing can quickly affect business if customers 
reduce their
levels of operations. Also, during these periods of depressed market conditions,
a customer may no longer need a rig or liftboat that is currently under contract
or may be able to obtain a comparable rig or liftboat at a lower daily rate. As 
a
result, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing contracts 
or avoid their obligations, including their payment obligations, under those 
contracts. In addition, customers may have the right to terminate, or may seek 
to
renegotiate, existing contracts if Hercules experiences downtime, operational 
problems above the contractual limit or safety-related issues, if the rig or 
liftboat is a total loss, if the rig or liftboat is not delivered to the 
customer within the
period specified in the contract or in other specified circumstances, which 
include events beyond the control of either party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-
top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">The
likelihood that a customer may seek to renegotiate or terminate a contract is 
increased during periods of market weakness. If customers cancel or require 
Hercules to renegotiate some of its significant contracts, if the Debtors are 
unable to secure
new contracts on substantially similar terms, especially those contracts in 
their International Offshore segment, or if contracts are suspended for an 
extended period of time, revenue and profitability would be materially reduced. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

Contract Revenue and Receivables Will be Ultimately Realized. </U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">As of June&nbsp;23, 2015, the Company&#146;s total 
contract drilling backlog for Domestic Offshore, International Offshore and 
International
Liftboats segments was approximately $913,649,700 for executed contracts, 
including the Maersk contract for the newbuild jackup rig, <I>Hercules 
Highlander</I>. The Debtors calculate their contract revenue backlog, or future 
contracted revenue, as
the contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining on the contract 
assuming full utilization, less any penalties or reductions in dayrate for late 
delivery or non-compliance with contractual obligations. Backlog excludes 
revenue for
management agreements, mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and 
customer reimbursables. The amount of actual revenue earned and the actual 
periods during which revenue is earned will be different than the backlog 
disclosed or expected
due to various factors. Hercules may not be able to perform under its drilling 
contracts due to various operational factors, including unscheduled repairs, 
maintenance, operational delays, health, safety and environmental incidents, 
weather events
in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere and other factors (some of which are beyond 
the Company&#146;s control), and customers may seek to cancel or renegotiate 
contracts for various reasons. In some of the contracts, including the contracts
for the
<I>Hercules 261</I> and <I>Hercules 262</I>, the customer has the right to 
terminate the contract without penalty and in certain instances, with little or 
no notice. In addition, Hercules can provide no assurance that customers will 
pay any or all
of the revenues that Hercules has earned from them for providing drilling and 
liftboat services. The Company&#146;s inability or the inability of its 
customers to perform under the Company&#146;s or their contractual obligations 
may have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations 
and cash flows. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and in particular the 
shallow-water region of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, is a mature oil and natural gas
production
region that has experienced substantial seismic survey and exploration activity 
for many years. Because a large number of oil and natural gas prospects in this 
region have already been drilled, additional prospects of sufficient size and 
quality
could be more difficult to identify. In addition, the amount of natural gas 
production in the shallow-water U.S. Gulf of Mexico has declined over the last 
decade. Moreover, oil and natural gas companies may be unable to obtain 
financing necessary to
drill prospects in this region. The decrease in the size of oil and natural gas 
prospects, the decrease in production or the failure to obtain such financing 
may result in reduced drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and reduced 
demand for
the Company&#146;s services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of the 
Company&#146;s 18 domestic rigs, all but nine are cold stacked. Of these nine, 
only six are under
short term contract contracts as of June&nbsp;23, 2015. Hercules is actively 
marketing an additional three rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If demand in the 
U.S. Gulf of Mexico does not improve or further weakens, Hercules may be 
required to cold
stack additional rigs. This would further negatively influence the 
Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. </P> <P

</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The Debtors&#146; industry is highly competitive. 
Their contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Pricing is
often the
primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, 
although rig and liftboat availability, location and technical capability and 
each contractor&#146;s safety performance record and reputation for quality also
can be key
factors in the determination. Dayrates also depend on the supply of rigs and 
vessels with excess capacity putting downward pressure on dayrates. Excess 
capacity can occur when newly constructed rigs and vessels enter service, when 
rigs and vessels
are mobilized between geographic areas and when non-marketed rigs and vessels 
are reactivated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Several competitors also
are incorporated
in jurisdictions outside the United States, which provides them with significant
tax advantages that are not available to HERO as a U.S. company and, as a 
result, may materially impair HERO&#146;s ability to compete with them for many 
projects that
would be beneficial to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>An Increase in Supply of Rigs or
Liftboats Could Adversely Affect the Debtors&#146; Financial Condition and 
Results of
Operations. </U></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">New construction of rigs
and liftboats, mobilization of rigs to regions in which Hercules operates, or 
reactivation of
non-marketed rigs and liftboats, could result in excess supply in the regions in
which Hercules operates, and dayrates and utilization could be reduced. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Construction of rigs, including high specification 
rigs such as the <I>Hercules Highlander</I>, the <I>Hercules Triumph </I>and the
<I>Hercules Resilience</I>, could result in excess supply in international 
regions, which could reduce the Company&#146;s ability to secure new contracts 
for its rigs and could reduce the Company&#146;s ability to renew, extend or 
obtain new
contracts for working rigs at the end of such contract term. The excess supply 
could also impact the dayrates on future contracts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-
top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">If
market conditions improve, inactive rigs and liftboats that are not currently 
being marketed could be reactivated to meet an increase in demand. Improved 
market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, particularly relative to other 
regions, could
also lead to the movement of jackup rigs and other mobile offshore drilling 
units into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Improved market conditions in any region 
worldwide could lead to increased construction of rigs and liftboats and upgrade
programs by the
Company&#146;s competitors. Some of the Company&#146;s competitors have already 
announced plans to build additional jackup rigs with higher specifications than 
most of the Company&#146;s fleet. Many of the rigs currently under construction 
have not
been contracted for future work, which may intensify price competition as 
scheduled delivery dates occur. A significant increase in the supply of jackup 
rigs, other mobile offshore drilling units or liftboats could adversely affect 
both the
Company&#146;s utilization and dayrates. </P>

use of and potential company equity and asset ownership by local representatives
might
limit the Company&#146;s business and operations, and occasions may arise when 
Hercules has disagreements with its local representative, or the continuation of
such relationship may become infeasible. Any such developments might disrupt the
Company&#146;s operations and continuity of business in such jurisdictions. If 
Hercules is unable to resolve issues with a local representative, it may decide 
to terminate the relationship with such local representative and seek another 
local
representative or seek opportunities for the Company&#146;s rigs and vessels 
elsewhere. Where local representative relationships require approval from the 
local government or other third parties Hercules may be constrained in its 
ability to replace
an existing local representative which may disrupt its operations and continuity
of business in such jurisdictions and require Hercules to seek opportunities for
its rigs and vessels elsewhere. In addition, if Hercules experiences delays or

liftboat operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in
which it
operates, including laws and regulations relating to the equipment and operation
of drilling rigs and liftboats, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and 
natural gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and 
earnings of
expatriate personnel, employees and suppliers by foreign contractors, the 
ownership of assets by local citizens and companies, and duties on the 
importation and exportation of units and other equipment. Governments in some 
foreign countries have
become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of 
concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and 
natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their 
countries. In some
areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount
of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies 
and may continue to do so. Operations in developing countries can be subject to 
legal
systems which are not as predictable as those in more developed countries, which
can lead to greater risk and uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. The 
Company&#146;s ability to compete in international markets may be adversely 
affected by
these foreign governmental regulations and/or policies that favor the awarding 
of contracts to contractors in which nationals of those foreign countries have 
substantial ownership interests or by regulations requiring foreign contractors 
to employ,
transfer ownership of equipment to, or purchase supplies from citizens of a 
particular jurisdiction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;

revenue is received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or when 
it does not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. It may also incur losses as
a result of its

fleets with
generally higher specification rigs than those in the Company&#146;s jackup 
fleet other than the Company&#146;s three ultra-high specification rigs, 
including one under construction, the <I>Hercules Highlander</I>. In the 
Company&#146;s existing
fleet, 17 of its 27 jackup rigs are mat-supported, which are generally limited 
to geographic areas with soft bottom conditions like much of the Gulf of Mexico.
In addition, the majority of new rigs under construction are of higher 
specification than
the Company&#146;s existing fleet, other than the Company&#146;s three ultra-
high specification rigs, including one under construction. Most of these rigs 
under construction are currently without contracts, which may intensify price 
competition as
scheduled delivery dates occur. Particularly in periods in which there is 
decreased rig demand, higher specification rigs may be more likely to obtain 
contracts than lower specification jackup rigs such as the Company&#146;s. In 
the past, lower
specification rigs typically have been stacked earlier in the cycle of decreased
rig demand than higher specification rigs and have been reactivated later in the
cycle, which may adversely impact the Company&#146;s business. In addition, 
higher
specification rigs may be more adaptable to different operating conditions and 
therefore have greater flexibility to move to areas of demand in response to 
changes in market conditions. Because a majority of the Company&#146;s rigs were
designed
specifically for drilling in the shallow-water of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the 
Company&#146;s ability to move them to other regions in response to changes in 
market conditions is limited. </P>

significant consolidation
in the Company&#146;s customer base. Therefore, Hercules derives a significant 
amount of its revenue from a few energy companies. Chevron Corporation, EPL 
Oil&nbsp;&amp; Gas, Saudi Aramco and Cairn Energy accounted for 15%, 14%, 12% 
and 11%,
respectively, of the Company&#146;s revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2014. The Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations will be 
materially adversely affected if these customers interrupt or curtail their 
activities,
terminate or re-negotiate their contracts, fail to renew their existing 
contracts, refuse to award new contracts and Hercules is unable to enter into 
contracts with new customers at comparable dayrates, or fail to pay for the 
revenues that it has
earned providing drilling and liftboat services. The loss of any of these or any

bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 
Company&#146;s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the 
drilling and
operation of oil and natural gas wells, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss
of production, loss of well control, punch throughs, craterings, fires and 
pollution, such as the well control incident experienced in July 2013 by the 
Company&#146;s
jackup drilling rig <I>Hercules 265</I> in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The 
occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling or 
production operations, claims by the operator, severe damage to or destruction 
of the property and
equipment involved, injury or death to rig or liftboat personnel, and
environmental damage. Hercules may also be subject to personal injury and other 
claims of rig or liftboat personnel as a result of its drilling and liftboat 
operations. Operations
also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal operating 
conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services and
personnel shortages. </P>

liftboat operations are subject to perils of marine operations, including 
capsizing, grounding,
collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Tropical storms, hurricanes 
and other severe weather prevalent in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. In addition, damage to
rigs,
liftboats, shorebases and corporate infrastructure caused by high winds, 
turbulent seas, or unstable sea bottom conditions could potentially cause 
Hercules to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the damages
can be repaired. In
addition, Hercules cold stacks a number of rigs in certain locations offshore. 
This concentration of rigs in specific locations could expose Hercules to 
increased liability from a catastrophic event and could cause an increase in the
Company&#146;s
insurance costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-

environment could result from the Company&#146;s operations, particularly 
through oil spillage or
extensive uncontrolled fires. Hercules may also be subject to property, 
environmental and other damage claims by oil and natural gas companies and other
businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas. The Company&#146;s insurance
policies and
contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses, and Hercules 
may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. Moreover, 
pollution and environmental risks generally are subject to significant 
deductibles and are
not totally insurable. Risks from extreme weather and marine hazards may 
increase in the event of ongoing patterns of adverse changes in weather or

result of a number of catastrophic weather related and other events, insurance 
underwriters
increased insurance premiums for many of the coverages historically maintained 
and issued general notices of cancellation and significant changes for a wide 
variety of insurance coverages. The oil and natural gas industry has suffered 
extensive
damage from several hurricanes over the last decade. As a result, the 
Company&#146;s insurance costs have increased significantly, its deductibles 
have increased and its coverage for named windstorm damage was restricted. Any 
additional severe storm
activity in the energy producing areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the future 
could cause insurance underwriters to no longer insure U.S. Gulf of Mexico 
assets against weather-related damage. Further, due to the escalating costs for
weather-related damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, in the future Hercules may 
elect to forgo purchasing such coverage. A number of the Company&#146;s 
customers that produce oil and natural gas have previously maintained business 
interruption
insurance for their production. This insurance is less available and may cease 
to be available in the future, which could adversely impact the Company&#146;s

Company&#146;s clients generally assume, and indemnify it against, well control 
and subsurface
risks under dayrate contracts, regardless of how the loss or damages may be 
caused. Typically, the Company&#146;s customer agrees to indemnify Hercules for 
these risks, even if Hercules is grossly negligent. However, since the Macondo 
well blowout
and resulting litigation, some of the Company&#146;s customers have been 
reluctant to extend their indemnity obligations in instances where Hercules is 
grossly negligent. These risks are those associated with the loss of control of 
a well, such as
blowout or cratering, the cost to regain control or redrill the well and 
associated pollution. There can be no assurance, however, that these clients 
will necessarily be financially able to indemnify Hercules against all these 
risks. Also, Hercules
may be effectively prevented from enforcing these indemnities because of the 
nature of the Company&#146;s relationship with some of its larger clients. 
Additionally, from time to time Hercules may not be able to obtain agreement

provide technical services and support for its rigs and liftboats. Shortages of 
qualified
personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel could 
negatively affect the quality and timeliness of the Company&#146;s work. In 
periods of economic crisis or during a recession, Hercules may have difficulty 
attracting and
retaining skilled workers as these workers may seek employment in less cyclical 
or volatile industries or employers. In periods of recovery or increasing 
activity, Hercules may have to increase the wages of skilled workers, which 
could negatively

by maritime labor unions in an effort to organize U.S. Gulf of Mexico employees.
A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the 
unionization of
the Company&#146;s U.S. Gulf of Mexico employees could result in a reduction of 
the Company&#146;s skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that 
Hercules must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, the

the Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Customs and 
Border Protection, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management and BSEE, as well as private industry organizations such as the 
American Bureau of
Shipping. New laws, regulations and requirements imposed after the Macondo well 
incident may delay the Company&#146;s operations and cause Hercules to incur 
additional expenses in order for its rigs and operations in the U.S. Gulf of 
Mexico to be
compliant with these new laws, regulations and requirements. These new laws, 
regulations and requirements and other potential changes in laws and regulations
applicable to the offshore drilling industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may also
prevent
the Company&#146;s customers from obtaining new drilling permits and approvals 
in a timely manner, if at all, which could materially adversely impact the 
Company&#146;s business, financial position or results of operations. In 
addition, Hercules may
be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with laws and the
applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and 
organizations. Moreover, the cost of compliance could be higher than 
anticipated. For example, the
BSEE has extended its regulatory enforcement reach to include contractors, which
exposes contractors to potential fines, sanctions and penalties for violations 
of law arising in the BSEE&#146;s jurisdictional area. Similarly, the 
Company&#146;s
international operations are subject to compliance with the FCPA, certain 
international conventions and the laws, regulations and standards of other 
foreign countries in which it operates. It is also possible that existing and 
proposed governmental
conventions, laws, regulations and standards, including those related to climate
change and emissions of greenhouse gases, may in the future add significantly to
the Company&#146;s operating costs or limit the Company&#146;s activities or the

substantially increased potential liability and operating costs for Hercules and
its customers, which could cause customers to discontinue or delay operating in 
the U.S. Gulf

require Hercules
to obtain and maintain specified permits or other governmental approvals, 
control the discharge of materials into the environment, require the removal and
cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relate to the 
protection of
the environment. Governmental entities such as the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with 
these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring 
difficult
and costly actions. For example, as an operator of mobile offshore drilling 
units in navigable U.S. waters and some offshore areas, Hercules may be liable 
for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or other 
unauthorized discharges
of chemicals or wastes resulting from those operations. Additionally, the BSEE 
has extended its regulatory enforcement reach to include contractors which 
exposes contractors to potential fines, sanctions and penalties for violations 
of law arising
in the BSEE&#146;s jurisdictional area. Failure to comply with these laws and 
regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal 
penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of 
injunctions
restricting some or all of the Company&#146;s activities in the affected areas. 
Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in 
recent years, and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person 
liable for
environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such 
person. Some of these laws and regulations may expose Hercules to liability for 
the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in 
compliance with all
applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these 
requirements, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption 
of new requirements, both in U.S. waters and internationally, could have a

Additionally, if the
Company&#146;s rigs incur idle time between contracts, Hercules typically does 
not de-man those rigs because it will use the crew to prepare the rig for its 
next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be 
immediate as
portions of the crew may be required to prepare the Company&#146;s rigs for 
stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or 
dismissed. Moreover, as the Company&#146;s rigs are mobilized from one

selling, or otherwise dealing or trading in securities issued by another person.
An
&#147;issuer&#148; includes any &#147;affiliate&#148; of the issuer, which is 
defined as a person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under

Securities Act, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to

While there is no
precise definition of a &#147;controlling&#148; stockholder, the legislative 
history of section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code suggests that a creditor who owns
10% or more of a class of securities of a reorganized debtor may be presumed to 
be a
&#147;controlling person&#148; of the debtor. However, that presumption is 
rebuttable, and whether or not any particular person would be deemed to be an

applicable to that person. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;

cancellation of a portion of the Debtors&#146; outstanding indebtedness. In 
general, absent an
exception, a debtor will realize and recognize cancellation of debt income 
(&#147;<B><U>COD Income</U></B>&#148;) upon satisfaction of its outstanding 
indebtedness for total consideration less than the amount of such indebtedness. 
The amount of COD
Income, in general, is the excess of (a)&nbsp;the adjusted issue price of the

fair market value of any other consideration. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt;

any amount of COD Income in gross income if the debtor is under the jurisdiction

in a case under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and the discharge of debt 
occurs pursuant to that proceeding. Instead, as a consequence of such exclusion,
a debtor must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of COD Income 
that it
excluded from gross income. In general, tax attributes will be reduced in the 
following order: (a)&nbsp;NOLs and NOL carryovers; (b)&nbsp;certain tax credit 
carryovers; (c)&nbsp;net capital losses and capital loss carryovers;

(f)&nbsp;foreign tax credit carryovers. A debtor with COD Income may elect first
to reduce the basis of its depreciable
assets. In the context of a consolidated group of corporations, the tax rules 
provide for a complex ordering mechanism in determining how the tax attributes 
of one member can be reduced by the COD Income of another member. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt;

connection with their bankruptcy, the Debtors generally will not recognize COD 
Income from the
discharge of indebtedness pursuant to the Plan; however, the Debtors expect 
that, subject to the limitations discussed herein, they will be required to make
material reductions in their tax attributes. Because the Plan provides that 
holders of
certain Claims may receive New HERO Common Stock, the amount of COD Income, and 
accordingly the amount of tax attributes required to be reduced, will depend in 
part on the fair market value of the New HERO Common Stock. These values cannot 
be known
with certainty as of the date hereof. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The Debtors had significant NOLs as of 
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and expect to generate operating losses through the 
Effective Date. The Debtors
expect that, as a consequence of the COD Income, their NOLs will be 
substantially reduced. The amount of tax attributes, if any, that will be 
available to the Reorganized Debtors following such reduction is based on a 
number of factors and is
impossible to calculate at this time. Some of the factors that will impact the 
amount of available tax attributes include: the amount of taxable income or loss
incurred by the Debtors in 2015 and the amount of COD Income recognized by the 
Debtors in
connection with the consummation of the Plan. Following the consummation of the 
Plan, the Debtors anticipate that any remaining NOLs and other tax attributes, 
if any, may be subject to limitation under section 382 of the Tax Code by reason
of the
transactions under the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under section 382 
of the Tax Code, if a corporation undergoes an &#147;ownership change,&#148; the
amount of
its pre-ownership change NOLs (collectively, &#147;<B><U>Pre-Change 
Losses</U></B>&#148;) that may be utilized to offset future taxable income 
generally is subject to an annual limitation. Corresponding rules may reduce a 
corporation&#146;s ability
to use losses if it has built-in losses in its assets at the time of an 
ownership change. Capital loss carryovers and certain tax credit carryovers are 
also generally limited after an ownership change under section 383 of the Tax 
Code. Although the
Debtors do not believe that their NOLs are currently subject to these 
utilization limitations (other than certain carryovers relating to the 2011 
acquisition of Seahawk Drilling, Inc.), subsequent trading activity in 
HERO&#146;s shares or further
changes in the ownership of HERO stock prior to the issuance of the New HERO 
Common Stock pursuant to the Plan could result in &#147;ownership changes&#148; 
that may ultimately affect the ability to fully utilize the Debtors&#146; NOLs. 
As discussed
in greater detail herein, the Debtors anticipate that the issuance of the New 
HERO Common Stock pursuant to the Plan will result in an &#147;ownership 
change&#148; of the Reorganized Debtors for these purposes, and that the 
Reorganized Debtors&#146;
use of their Pre-Change Losses will be subject to limitation unless an exception
to the general rules of Section&nbsp;382 of the Tax Code applies. This 
limitation is independent of, and in addition to, the reduction of tax

general, the annual limitation
determined under section 382 of the Tax Code in the case of an &#147;ownership 
change&#148; of a corporation (the &#147;<B><U>Section 382 
Limitation</U></B>&#148;) is equal to the product of (a)&nbsp;the fair market 
value of the stock of the
corporation immediately before the ownership change (with certain adjustments) 
multiplied by (b)&nbsp;the applicable &#147;long-term tax-exempt rate&#148; 
posted by the IRS (<I>e.g.</I>, 2.74% for July 2015). Generally, the 
Section&nbsp;382
Limitation may be increased to the extent that the corporation recognizes 
certain built-in gains in its assets during the five-year period following the 
ownership change, or is treated as recognizing built-in gains pursuant to 
certain safe harbors
provided by the IRS. Corresponding rules may reduce a corporation&#146;s ability
to use losses if it has built-in losses in its assets at the time of an 
ownership change. Section&nbsp;383 of the Tax Code applies a limitation, similar
to the
Section&nbsp;382 Limitation, to capital loss carryforwards and tax credits. Any 
unused limitation may be carried forward, thereby increasing the annual 
limitation in the subsequent taxable year. The debtor corporation&#146;s Pre-
Change Losses will
be subject to further limitations if the debtor does not continue its business 
enterprise for at least two years following the ownership change or if it 
experiences additional future ownership changes. As discussed below, however,

382(l)(5) Exception applies and the debtor undergoes another ownership change 
within two years after consummation of the plan, then the debtor&#146;s Pre-
Change Losses effectively would be eliminated in their entirety. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">When the 382(l)(5) Exception is not applicable 
(either because the debtor does not qualify for it or the debtor otherwise 
elects not to
utilize the 382(l)(5) Exception), a second special rule will generally apply to 
a debtor in chapter 11 (the &#147;<B><U>382(l)(6) Exception</U></B>&#148;). When
the 382(l)(6) Exception applies, a debtor corporation that undergoes an 
ownership change
generally is permitted to determine the fair market value of its stock after 
taking into account the increase in value resulting from any surrender or 
cancellation of creditors&#146; claims in the bankruptcy. This differs from the 
ordinary rule that
requires the fair market value of a debtor corporation that undergoes an 
ownership change to be determined before the events giving rise to the change. 
The 382(l)(6) Exception also differs from the 382(l)(5) Exception in that the 
debtor corporation
is not required to reduce its NOLs by interest deductions in the manner 
described above, and the debtor may undergo a change of ownership within two 
years without triggering the elimination of its Pre-Change Losses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Whether the Debtors qualify for the 382(l)(5) 
Exception is highly fact specific and significant uncertainties exist as to the 
facts and law
underlying this position. Thus, the Debtors are not certain whether they will 
qualify for the Section&nbsp;382(l)(5) Exception or would choose to elect out of
the Section&nbsp;382(l)(5) Exception. If the Debtors do not qualify for the 
382(1)(5)
Exception or the Debtors elect out of the 382(l)(5) Exception, the Debtors&#146;
use of its Pre-Change Losses will be subject to the Section&nbsp;382 Limitation 
following confirmation of the Plan, calculated under the special rule of
Section&nbsp;382(1)(6) of the Tax Code described above. However, any NOLs 
generated in any-post-Effective Date taxable year (including the portion of the 
taxable year of the ownership change following the Effective Date) should not be
subject to
this limitation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regardless of whether 
the Debtors take advantage of the 382(l)(5) Exception or the 382(l)(6) 
Exception, the Reorganized
Debtors&#146; use of their Pre-Change Losses, if any, after the Effective Date 
may be adversely affected if an &#147;ownership change&#148; within the meaning 
of Section&nbsp;382 of the Tax Code were to occur after the Effective Date. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">In general, an alternative minimum tax 
(&#147;<B><U>AMT</U></B>&#148;) is imposed on a corporation&#146;s alternative 
minimum taxable income
(&#147;<B><U>AMTI</U></B>&#148;) at a 20% rate to the extent such tax exceeds 
the corporation&#146;s regular federal income tax for the year. AMTI is 
generally equal to regular taxable income with certain adjustments. For purposes
of computing AMTI,
certain tax deductions and other beneficial allowances are modified or 
eliminated. For example, except for AMT NOLs for certain taxable years, only 90%
of a corporation&#146;s AMTI may be offset by available AMT NOL carryforwards. 
Additionally,
under section 56(g)(4(G) of the Tax Code an ownership change (as discussed 
above) that occurs with respect to a corporation having a net unrealized built-
in loss in its assets may cause the corporation&#146;s aggregate tax basis in 
its assets to be
reduced for certain AMT purposes to reflect the fair market value of such assets
as of the change date. </P>

a bad debt deduction or worthless security deduction with respect to the Claim

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Whether an instrument constitutes a 
&#147;security&#148; is determined based upon all the facts and circumstances, 
but most authorities have
held that the length of the term of a debt instrument is an important factor in 
determining whether such instrument is a security for federal income tax 
purposes. These authorities have indicated that a term of less than five years 
is evidence that
the instrument is not a security, whereas a term of ten years or more is 
evidence that it is a security. Under somewhat different facts, the IRS has 
ruled that new debt obligations with a term of less than five years issued in 
exchange for and
bearing the same terms (other than interest rate) as securities should also be 
classified as securities for this purpose, since the new debt represents a 
continuation of the holder&#146;s investment in the corporation in substantially
the same form.
The Senior Notes have terms between seven (7)&nbsp;and thirty (30)&nbsp;years. 
There are numerous other factors that could be taken into account in determining
whether a debt instrument is a security, including the security for payment, the
creditworthiness of the obligor, the subordination or lack thereof to other 
creditors, the right to vote or otherwise participate in the management of the 
obligor, convertibility of the instrument into an equity interest of the 
obligor, whether
payments of interest are fixed, variable, or contingent, and whether such 
payments are made on a current basis or accrued. Because of the inherently 
factual nature of this determination, each U.S. holder of a Claim is urged to 
consult its tax
advisor regarding whether a Senior Note constitutes a security for federal 
income tax purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-

on IRS Form W-9 for a U.S. holder); (b)&nbsp;furnishes an incorrect taxpayer

corporations generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup 
withholding tax rules provided that evidence of such corporate status is 
furnished to the payor.
Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Any amounts withheld
under the backup withholding tax rules will generally be allowed as a credit

affiliated Debtors jointly propose the following prepackaged plan of 
reorganization under section
1121(a) of chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code. Although proposed 
jointly for administrative purposes, the Plan constitutes a separate Plan for 
each Debtor for the resolution of outstanding Claims against and Interests in 
each Debtor
pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors seek to consummate the 
restructuring on the Effective Date of the Plan. Each Debtor is a proponent of 
the Plan within the meaning of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. The 
classifications of Claims and
Interests set forth in Article III shall be deemed to apply separately with 
respect to each Plan proposed by each Debtor, as applicable. The Plan does not 
contemplate substantive consolidation of any of the Debtors. </P>

the feasibility requirement set
forth in section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code, as confirmation is not 
likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial 
reorganization of the Debtors or any successor under the Plan. In connection 
with the development of a
plan of reorganization and for the purposes of determining whether such plan 
would satisfy this feasibility standard, the Debtors analyzed their ability to 
satisfy their financial obligations while maintaining sufficient liquidity and 
capital
resources. The Debtors prepared financial projections (the 
&#147;Projections&#148;) for the balance of the 2015 calendar year, and for 2016
through 2018 (the &#147;Projection Period&#148;). The Debtors do not, as a

business plans or strategies, projections or anticipated financial position. 
Accordingly, the Debtors do not anticipate that they will, and disclaim any

oil and natural gas prices and our expectations about future commodity prices, 
the level of activity of oil and natural gas exploration, development and 
production in the

provider
of shallow-water drilling and marine services to the oil and natural gas 
exploration and production industry globally. The Debtors provide these services
to national oil and gas companies, major integrated energy companies and 
independent oil and
natural gas operators. As of June&nbsp;30, 2015, the Debtors and their 
subsidiaries operated a fleet of 27 jackup rigs, including one rig under 
construction, and 24 liftboat vessels. The Company&#146;s diverse fleet is 
capable of providing services
such as oil and gas exploration and development drilling, well service, platform
inspection, maintenance and decommissioning operations in several key shallow-
water provinces around the world. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">Often called the &#147;best interests&#148; test, section 1129(a)(7) 
of the Bankruptcy Code requires that the Bankruptcy Court find, as a condition 
to
confirmation of the Plan, that each holder of a Claim or Interest in each 
Impaired Class: (i)&nbsp;has accepted the Plan; or (ii)&nbsp;will receive or 
retain under the Plan property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is not
less than the
amount that such Person would receive if the Debtors were liquidated under 
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. To make these findings, the Bankruptcy Court 
must: (1)&nbsp;estimate the cash proceeds (the &#147;Net Estimated Liquidation 
Proceeds&#148;)
that a chapter 7 trustee would generate if each Debtor&#146;s Chapter 11 Case 
were converted to a chapter 7 case on the Effective Date and the assets of such 
Debtor&#146;s estate were liquidated; (2)&nbsp;determine the distribution (the
&#147;Estimated Recovery Under Liquidation&#148;) that each non-accepting holder
of a Claim or Interest would receive from the Net Estimated Liquidation Proceeds
under the priority scheme dictated in chapter 7; and (3)&nbsp;compare each
holder&#146;s Estimated Recovery Under Liquidation to the distribution under the
Plan (the &#147;Plan Recovery&#148;) that such Holder would receive if the Plan 
were confirmed and consummated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">Based on the following hypothetical Liquidation Analysis, the Debtors
believe that the Plan satisfies the best interests test and that each holder of 
an
Impaired Claim or Equity Interest will receive value under the Plan on the 
Effective Date that is not less than the value such holder would receive if the 
Debtors liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors believe 
that the
Liquidation Analysis and conclusions set forth herein are fair and represent 
management&#146;s best judgment regarding the results of a liquidation of the 
Debtors under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code taking into account various 
factors including
the absence of a robust market for the sale of the Debtors&#146; assets and the 
negative impact on values arising from a distressed sale of a large number of 
rigs in a relatively short amount of time under current market conditions. The 
Liquidation
Analysis was prepared for the sole purpose of assisting the Bankruptcy Court and
holders of Impaired Claims or Equity Interests in making this determination, and
should not be used for any other purpose. Nothing contained in this Liquidation
Analysis is intended as or constitutes a concession or admission for any purpose
other than the presentation of a hypothetical Liquidation Analysis for purposes 
of the best interests test. Accordingly, asset values discussed herein may be 
different
than amounts referred to in the Plan. The Liquidation Analysis is based upon 
certain assumptions discussed herein and in the Disclosure Statement. </P>

Analysis assumes
that the Debtors&#146; liquidation would commence on or about October&nbsp;1, 
2015 (the &#147;Conversion Date&#148;) under the direction of a chapter 7 
trustee and would continue for a period of approximately twelve months, during 
which time all of
the Debtors&#146; assets would be sold, and the cash proceeds (net of 
liquidation-related costs), together with the cash on hand, would then be

scheme established under the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors would expect the 
chapter 7 trustee to retain professionals to assist in the liquidation of the 
estates. It is assumed that the Debtors
would continue to operate all rigs under customer contracts at the Conversion 
Date in order to maximize the liquidation value. All other operations are 
assumed to cease in order to minimize costs associated with the chapter 7 wind 
down and
liquidation. Because the Debtors own 100% of the equity interests in the non-
Debtor subsidiaries, with the exception of the Hercules Offshore (Nigeria) 
Limited (&#147;Nigerian Entity&#148;), and all management and corporate 
functions reside with the
Debtor entities, operations at those subsidiaries would cease as well. 
Therefore, for the purposes of the Liquidation Analysis, the Debtors and their 
advisors have attempted to ascribe value to each of the assets individually as 
they would be
liquidated by a chapter 7 trustee and the professionals retained by the trustee.
For other assets, liquidation values were assessed for general classes of assets
by estimating the percentage recoveries that a trustee might achieve through an 
orderly
disposition. Where applicable, asset recoveries below are shown net of the costs
to achieve those recoveries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;

Analysis is based on a number of estimates and assumptions that, although

inherently subject to significant economic, business, regulatory and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of the Debtors. Accordingly,

liquidation itself may trigger certain obligations and priority payments that 
otherwise would not be due in the ordinary course of business or would otherwise
not exist
under a chapter 11 plan. These priority payments would be made in full before 
any distribution of proceeds to pay holders of general unsecured claims or to 
make distributions in respect of Equity Interests. The liquidation would likely 
prompt
certain other events to occur including the rejection of executory contracts, 
unexpired leases, defaults under agreements with suppliers, and severance 
obligations. Such events, if triggered, would likely create a larger number of 
creditors and
would subject the chapter 7 estates to additional claims. As a general rule, the
Company does not enter into long-term contracts with their vendors and only 
maintains leases for its corporate offices and Houma facility. As such, the 
amount of
additional unsecured claims is not deemed to have a material impact on the 
Liquidation Analysis. </TD></TR></TABLE>

does not forecast accounts receivable at the entity level, the balance is based 
on the May&nbsp;31, 2015 balances for the consolidated Debtor entities. It is 
not expected
that the October&nbsp;1, 2015 accounts receivable balance will vary materially 
from this estimate. It is assumed that in a Chapter 7 certain existing staff of 
the Debtors would be retained to lead an aggressive collection effort for 
outstanding
Accounts Receivable.&nbsp;In order to achieve the highest recovery of accounts 
receivable, the Debtors believe that relatively senior level people will be 
retained. The costs associated with such employees (excluding any retention or 
incentive
payments that may be required) are included in the Chapter 7 operating expenses.
Due to the contract nature of the Debtors&#146; business, and the assumption 
that contracted rig operations will continue until the rigs are sold over the 
twelve-month
liquidation period, it is very likely that conversion to a Chapter 7 will 
disrupt operations in the middle of a contract. Although the Debtors expect that
the operating rigs would be sold and the contracts would be assigned to the 
buyer, it is
likely that there are certain instances where this will not occur. As a result, 
the Debtors estimate a 50% - 75% recovery rate on accounts 
receivable.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><U>Property, Plant&nbsp;&amp; Equipment</U>: Fixed
assets primarily include rigs and related equipment, liftboats, and 
miscellaneous equipment. The Debtors currently have 19 jackup rigs primarily
located in the Gulf of
Mexico. 9 rigs are cold stacked, 6 are under contract and 4 are warm stacked as 
of June&nbsp;23, 2015. All of the current rig contracts expire prior to the end 
of 2015. There is currently a significant oversupply of rigs in the market, and 
the
average age of the Debtors&#146; rigs is 37 years. It is management&#146;s view 
that rigs are becoming increasingly difficult to sell in an over saturated 
market with decreasing demand. </TD></TR></TABLE>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">In general, contracted rigs can be sold at the 
highest values, and warm stacked rigs can be sold more easily at higher values 
than cold stacked
rigs. Based on management&#146;s knowledge of the rigs and current market 
conditions, comparable rigs sales Hercules made in 2015, and other data points, 
the Debtors and their advisors assigned orderly liquidation values to each of 
the Debtors&#146;
rigs by rig category (i.e., cold stacked rigs, warm stacked rigs and contracted 
rigs). Given the already over saturated nature of the market and the shortage of
willing buyers in the market under present conditions, it is likely that 19 
additional
rigs hitting the market at one time would significantly reduce these already 
depressed liquidation values. For this reason, the Debtors applied an additional
50-75% discount to the liquidation values. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the Debtors own 10 liftboats in 
various classes. The liftboats were reviewed using a methodology similar to that
used for the
drilling rigs. Of the 10 liftboats, management believes 3 are significantly more
marketable due to age and class and these were ascribed a higher value. It is 
management&#146;s opinion that there are few, if any, potential buyers currently
in the
market for liftboats and therefore it was assumed that an additional discount of
50-75% should be applied to reflect the incremental reduction in value due to 
marketing all 10 liftboats at the same time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">For other fixed asset classes, liquidation 
discounts were applied based on discussions with management and current market 
demand as outlined in
the table below. These discounts were applied on fair market value of the assets
in question if available, and on net book value where unavailable. </P>

level. For this reason, it is unlikely the non-debtor entities would be able to

addition, it is assumed that the rigs

equity interest in the non-Debtor subsidiaries with the exception of the 
Nigerian entity,
which is 60% owned by a local Nigerian party. While only the pro-rata portion of
the net liquidation proceeds at the Nigerian entity would go towards satisfying 
the Debtors&#146; investment in non-Debtor affiliates, we do not expect the net 
recovery
of the Nigerian Entity&#146;s liquidation to have a meaningful impact on the 
liquidation analysis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-

liquidation of
non-Debtor subsidiaries must first be used to satisfy trade payables and other 
expenses at the foreign entity level, prior to being returned to the Debtors. 
Therefore, the foreign liquidation analysis was performed on a consolidated 
basis using the
Asset Recovery Estimates outlined above in sections (a)&nbsp;&#150; (f). </P> <P

are either
under long term contracts or being actively marketed. Two rigs in particular, 
the <I>Hercules Triumph</I> and <I>Hercules Resilience</I>, have significantly 
more value than the other rigs in a liquidation scenario. Both rigs were built 
in 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt;

made two installment payments totaling $47.2 million toward the building of a 
new rig, the
<I>Hercules Highlander</I>, with a final installment of $188.8M due upon 
delivery of the vessel, estimated in the second quarter of 2016. In a chapter 7 
scenario, the company will not have the liquidity to make the final installment 
payment, and
therefore the payment will not be made. In this case, the contracted customer 
for the <I>Hercules Highlander</I> has the right to purchase the rig from the 
shipyard at full value resulting in a recoup of the $47.2 million (included as 
the high
scenario). If the customer refuses the right to purchase the rig, ownership is 
retained by the shipyard which will then market the rig for sale. In current 
market conditions, it is assumed that the remaining rig payment will exceed the 
sale value of
the rig by the shipyard, resulting in no recovery of the first two installment 
payments (included as the low scenario). Per the contract, no deficiency claim 
arises as a result of failing to make the final payment and secure delivery of 
the rig.

the Disclosure Statement. The valuation analysis assumes that the reorganization

approximately $535 million to approximately $725 million, which is used herein

basis. For purposes of this valuation, it has been assumed that no material 
changes that

$133 million<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">1</SUP> as

of any

material respects, including revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and cash flows as
projected. If the business performs at levels below or above those set forth in

including the Financial Projections; (c)&nbsp;discussed the Debtors&#146;

COLOR="#FFFFFF">(1) Rigs with a Customer named are under contract, while rigs 
described as &#147;Ready Stacked&#148; are not under contract, but generally
are ready for service. Rigs described as &#147;Warm Stacked&#148; are actively 
marketed and may have a reduced number of crew, but require a full crew to be 
ready for service. Rigs described as &#147;Cold Stacked&#148; are not actively 
marketed,
normally require the hiring of an entire crew and require a maintenance review 
and refurbishment before they can function as a drilling rig. Rigs described as 
&#147;Shipyard&#148; are undergoing maintenance, repairs, upgrades and may or 
may not be
actively marketed depending on the length of stay in the shipyard. Rigs 
described as &#147;en route&#148; are in the process of moving to and from 
various locations, and may or may not be earning revenue during this period.

Contract dayrates shown in the table above are full contract operating dayrates,
which may include estimated contractual adjustments for changes in operating 
costs and
reimbursable cost items for operating expenses such as crew and may also include
additional services and personnel that may be requested by the customer from 
time-to-time. However, the dayrates do not include certain non-recurring 
revenues such as
lump sum mobilizations and demobilizations. The actual dayrate over the term of 
the contract could be lower and could be substantially lower and or subject to 
numerous risks as disclosed in the Company&#146;s filings with the Securities 
and Exchange
Commission. Lower dayrates typically apply when the rig is under contract but 
not fully operating, including periods when the rig is moving, waiting on 
weather, on standby, down for repairs or maintenance or during other operational
delays or events
of force majeure. </FONT><br><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman; font-

including those that may impact the ability of our customers to timely obtain 
drilling permits. </FONT><br><FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">HOUSTON, July&nbsp;13, 2015 &#151; Hercules Offshore, Inc. (Nasdaq: 
HERO) (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Hercules&#148;), announced today that it
commenced
a solicitation of votes for a prepackaged plan of reorganization from holders of
its 10.25% senior notes due 2019, 8.75% senior notes due 2021, 7.5% senior notes
due 2021, 6.75% senior notes due 2022, 7.375% senior notes due 2018 and 3.375%
convertible senior notes due 2038 (the &#147;Noteholders&#148;). Votes on the 
prepackaged plan must be received by Prime Clerk, the Company&#146;s voting 
agent, by August&nbsp;12, 2015, unless the deadline is extended. The record date
for voting has
been set for July&nbsp;13, 2015. Solicitation materials will be mailed on or 
about July&nbsp;13, 2015 to creditors of record that are entitled to vote. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">The prepackaged plan of reorganization (the &#147;Plan&#148;) 
provides that claims of trade creditors, suppliers and employees will be paid in
full. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">As previously disclosed, on June&nbsp;17, 2015 the Company entered 
into a restructuring support agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with 
Noteholders who
held approximately 67% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 
Company&#146;s notes. The terms of the consensual financial restructuring would 
support a substantial deleveraging transaction pursuant to which approximately 
$1.2 billion
of the Company&#146;s outstanding notes would be converted to 96.9% of new 
common equity, and $450 million in new backstop debt financing would be 
provided, which would fully fund the remaining construction cost of the 
<I>Hercules Highlander</I> and
provide additional liquidity to fund the Company&#146;s operations. The 
Company&#146;s current shareholders, despite being substantially &#147;out of 
the money&#148; as described in the Plan, would have the opportunity to receive 
their pro rata
portion of the remaining 3.1% of the new common equity, as well as certain 
warrants described in Plan and the Agreement, subject to the requirements of the
Plan. The Company and the consenting Noteholders agreed to complete the 
restructuring through
a prepackaged plan of reorganization. Assuming the Company receives the required
acceptances, the Company intends to commence a prepackaged Chapter 11 case 
shortly after the conclusion of the solicitation period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">The Company recommends that Noteholders refer to the information and 
the limitations and qualifications discussed in the Solicitation and Disclosure
Statement, including the attached Plan. Information contained in the 
Solicitation and Disclosure Statement, including the attached Plan, is subject 
to change, whether as a result of amendments, actions of third parties or 
otherwise. There can be no
assurances that the Plan will be approved or confirmed pursuant to the 
Bankruptcy Code. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

purposes only and is not a
solicitation to accept or reject the proposed prepackaged plan of reorganization
referred to herein or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any 
securities of the Company. Any solicitation or offer to sell will be made 
pursuant to
and in accordance with the Solicitation and Disclosure Statement distributed to 
Noteholders and applicable law. </P>
