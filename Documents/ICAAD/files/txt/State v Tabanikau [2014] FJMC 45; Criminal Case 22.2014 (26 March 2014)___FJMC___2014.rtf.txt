12.     
The offending in this case falls into category 1 i.e. possession of between 0-100 grams whereby non-custodial sentences such as fines, community work, counselling, discharge with a strong warning, suspended sentence or short sharp imprisonment would be appropriate as noted in the case authority of Kini Sulua & Micheal Chandra v State (supra).

13.

14.     
However from your 8 months sentence I will further deduct 2 months 3 days for time in custody. Thus you will have to serve an immediate prison term of 5 months 27 days.
