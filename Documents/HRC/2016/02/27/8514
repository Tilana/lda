<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Secretary-General submits to the Commission on Human Rights and, 
subsequently to the Human Rights Council, an annual report on technical cooperation in the 
field of human rights, reflecting the discussions of the Board of Trustees of the United 
Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights. The 
Council, in its decision 2/102, requested<b> </b>the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of their activities, in accordance with all 
previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, and to update the 
relevant reports and studies. The present report is therefore submitted as an update of the 
previous report,1 and focuses on the work of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund in 
2010. 
</p>
<p>2. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
had previously interpreted decision 2/102 as extending previous Commission of Human 
Rights reports and providing for an annual reporting cycle. This interpretation had not 
received any objections to date, and the Office's interpretation was thus deemed to have 
received the tacit approval of Member States.  However, an objection was placed on the 
record in 2010, albeit in the context of another report which also used Decision 2/102 as the 
basis for its annual reporting. OHCHR has thus further reviewed the said Decision, and 
concludes that with it, the Human Rights Council sought to fill a technical gap by ensuring 
that the deadlines for reports which were to be submitted to the 62nd session of the Human 
Rights Commission would be extended by one year, for submission to the subsequent 
substantive Human Rights Council session. With this transition period over, and the 
objection now on the record to the previous interpretation of annual reporting cycles, if the 
Human Rights Council wishes to see a continuation of this reporting mandate, a new 
Human Rights Council Resolution or Decision on the matter should be tabled. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>3. The members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Secretary-General to 
advise OHCHR on streamlining and rationalizing the working methods and procedures of 
its technical cooperation programme. Its current members are William Schabas (Canada 
and Ireland), Chairperson; M&#243;nica Pinto (Argentina); Sozar Subari (Georgia), Fatima 
Mbaye (Mauritania); and Deepika Udagama (Sri Lanka). The second terms of office of Mr. 
Schabas and Ms. Pinto will end in December 2011, while Ms. Udagama&#8217;s term of office 
has been extended by the Secretary-General for a second term, as from December 2010.  
</p>
<p>4. The work of the Board has evolved in its approach in recent years, from detailed 
revision of individual projects to advising OHCHR on policy orientation and providing 
global vision and strategy on technical cooperation at a broader programme level. The new 
direction in the role played by the Board has been appreciated by the Office, which has 
greatly benefited from the experience and wisdom of the Board members, particularly 
following the recent reforms within the United Nations and OHCHR, including 
strengthened engagement at the country level and strategic planning. 
</p>
<p>5. The Board holds its meetings twice a year in Geneva. Its thirty-second session was 
planned to coincide with the annual consultations of the OHCHR heads of field presences 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/13/61 </p>


<p>from 22 February to 2 March 2010 and its thirty-third session took place from 4 to 10 
October 2010. During its sessions, the Board examined various components of the United 
Nations human rights technical cooperation programme supported by the Voluntary Fund 
and received thematic and regional updates on the implementation of the OHCHR strategic 
management plan 2010-2011 in the context of the mid-year review, the strategic framework 
2012-2013 and the performance monitoring system. 
</p>
<p>6. The Chairperson of the Board expressed appreciation on behalf of the Board for the 
opportunity to engage in interactive dialogue with the High Commissioner, having followed 
with interest the growth of the Office over the years. The High Commissioner noted her 
gratitude to the Board members for their guidance in the work of the Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation and her indebtedness to them for continuing to provide their 
expertise and maintaining an overview of the work of OHCHR in the field. She was pleased 
with the format of the Board of Trustees sessions including briefings and interactions with 
the different sections of the Office and Member States, encouraging the Board to continue 
to provide expert advice invaluable to the work of the Office in the field of technical 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner briefed the Board on the Strategic Management Plan and 
the Human Rights Council, in the context of strengthening dialogue, coordination and 
cooperation with OHCHR. The Board members thanked the High Commissioner for her 
update and noted the transformation in human rights over the years and the role of 
OHCHR, which has become more significant, and emphasized the integrated approach to 
human rights work in the field.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Financial status of the Voluntary Fund 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Finance and Budget Section and the Donor and External Relations Section of 
OHCHR provided the Board of Trustees with an update on the Status of the Voluntary 
Fund for Technical Cooperation, which is in a good financial state. The Board was 
impressed to note that the Voluntary Fund was the second largest source of extra-budgetary 
funds to the Office. It was informed that, although the Fund had been weaker in the 2006-
2007 biennium, it had since picked up and has steadily grown stronger over the years. The 
expenditure patterns are positive for 2010 and the rise in income is staying stable. The 
documents provided to the Board are contained as annexes to the present report. 
</p>
<p>9. The Board members noted that since the establishment of the Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation, the financial situation has greatly improved, drawing on the 
strategy of funding human rights advisers within United Nations country teams, human 
rights components of United Nations peace missions and country/stand-alone offices with 
technical cooperation components, successfully attracting donor contributions to the Fund. 
It acknowledged the importance of planning and results-based management, also welcomed 
by donors, enabling impact measurements for the benefit of long-term human-rights work. 
</p>
<p>10. The Board emphasized that the Voluntary Fund provided a very important source of 
financial support to the technical cooperation activities of the United Nations in the field of 
human rights. Despite the continued economic crisis, Member States and other contributors 
have generally maintained their levels of contribution. The Board expressed its gratitude 
and thanks to Member States and organizations for all donations to the Voluntary Fund, 
which manifests confidence in the work of the Board of Trustees. It reiterated the 
importance of receiving funds from a wide range of donors, including from those countries 
that benefit from the Fund, and encouraging even modest contributions as an important sign 
of support including those from developing nations supporting south-south cooperation.  </p>


<p><b> IV. High Commissioner for Human Rights: Strategic 
Management Plan 2010-2011, Mid-Year review, planning 
and performance monitoring system 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Board was updated on the implementation of the High Commissioner&#8217;s 
Strategic Management Plan 2010-2011 and the planning process of the Strategic 
Framework 2012-2013, including the status and progress of development and 
implementation of the OHCHR performance monitoring system. It was informed that the 
Strategic Management Plan encompasses the vision of the High Commissioner to move 
towards objectives which were set out to be achieved when the six thematic priorities were 
established. Concrete recommendations for improvements will be developed and presented 
to the OHCHR Senior Management Team during the last quarter of the year.  
</p>
<p>12.  The Board was pleased to note the progress achieved in the development and 
implementation of the new Information Technology-based performance monitoring system. 
The members were informed that a modular approach has been adopted whereby key 
components of the system will be tested in a number of field presences before the full 
package is released office-wide. The Board received a brief on the development of the 
indicators to measure progress towards the achievement of accomplishments/results 
through a system of evidence-based performance monitoring and was updated on the 
progress with the development of protocols to standardize monitoring methods and ensure 
comparability. In terms of reporting requirements, the Senior Management Team has 
requested reporting at output level on an annual basis and at expected accomplishment level 
on a biennial basis.  
</p>
<p>13. The Board was updated on an upcoming evaluation on OHCHR performance in 
supporting States to follow up on recommendations from the human rights mechanisms. It 
is expected that an evaluation will be under way during the first quarter of 2011. The Board 
acknowledged the challenging work under way in planning and monitoring, in all thematic 
areas and in servicing different human rights mechanisms. They were informed of the need 
for the planning processes to be integrated and simplified, including improvement of the 
coordination and coherence between Headquarters and the field. 
</p>
<p>14. The Board was informed that the Strategic Management Plan was a general 
summary planning document and does not outline the detailed activities, outputs, and 
resources required to ensure that the expected accomplishments are achieved. This 
information is part of the annual work plans, the implementation of which is monitored 
regularly through the office-wide mid-year review and the end-of-year review. The Board 
was pleased to note that after the mid-year review 2010, most activities are on track and 
implementation rates are being monitored. They were also updated on the unexpected 
changes resulting from responses to global crises. 
</p>
<p><b> V. OHCHR technical cooperation: capacity- and institution-
building activities 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation provides support for technical 
cooperation activities to strengthen capacity and institution-building activities in the Middle 
East and North Africa region, the Europe and Central Asia region, the Americas region, and 
the Africa region, which represents the largest proportion. </p>


<p><b> A. Africa region 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Board was updated on the situation of field presences in the Africa region, 
learning about the country situations, the projects and activities as well as strategies, 
partners, budget constraints and regional priorities within the context of technical 
cooperation. It was briefed on the work of human rights components of United Nations 
peace missions in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Haiti, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Sudan and Somalia; on 
the situation of human rights advisers in the International Conference on the Great Lakes 
Region (Burundi), Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Rwanda; and on the situation of 
country offices in Guinea and Togo.  
</p>
<p>17. It was informed that, although the Strategic Management Plan is the primary guide 
in determining the issues on which OHCHR focuses, the Office needs to keep focus and 
strike a balance to respond to emerging issues and to intervene where maximum impact can 
be made, as for example in its positive engagement in the context of elections in Togo as 
well as the establishment of an office in Guinea and a human rights adviser in Kenya in 
collaboration with United Nations agencies and national partners.  
</p>
<p>18. In the Africa region, work continued in all the six thematic areas where all human 
rights challenges presented themselves as priorities, specifically on countering 
discrimination in the framework of the Durban Declaration by addressing ethnic regional 
and class discrimination; and addressing economic, social and cultural rights, a critical and 
challenging task, especially with regard to the attainment of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MGDs). The Board took note of the successful cooperation with partners and was 
heartened to note that the Office had continued its work in strengthening regional and 
subregional human rights mechanisms such as the African Union, Southern African 
Development Community, Economic Community of West African States, and the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Development.  
</p>
<p>19. The Board was informed of the mid-year review progress and new developments in 
the field presences in Africa even when faced with limited financial and human resources 
as well as the large presence of human rights components in peacekeeping missions. The 
Board enquired into the actual application of the Strategic Management Plan in the field 
work and was pleased to note that a bottom-up approach had been adopted in its 
development. The Office acknowledged the need to be strategic and forward-looking to 
ensure results, impact and achievement of expected accomplishments.  
</p>
<p>20. The Board was also provided with an update on the work in the Southern Africa 
Regional Office and the work on strengthening engagement with treaty bodies and the 
universal periodic review (UPR). It encouraged more efforts towards cooperation with the 
United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) in the areas of collaboration that had been 
identified and was pleased to note interest from Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, 
including progress in the establishment and strengthening of their national human rights 
institutions (NHRIs). It was noted that technical cooperation projects in South Africa could 
serve as learning platforms for other countries in the region. The recruitment of a human 
rights adviser was ongoing in Madagascar. 
</p>
<p>21. In Somalia the framework for technical cooperation, endorsed by the Transitional 
Federal Government in 2009, contained the following main areas of intervention: 
strengthening the human rights capacity of the authorities, strengthening monitoring, 
reporting and advocacy, contributing to addressing impunity, contributing to the creation of 
human rights-compliant security forces, and increasing public awareness of human rights. 
Its implementation, regrettably, had been impacted by significant challenges and 
constraints. The Board was updated on the advisory services provided by OHCHR to the 
Independent Federal Constitution Committee, OHCHR's advocacy in favour of signing the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, its work on mainstreaming human rights in the work </p>


<p>of the UNCT, and its support for the mandate of the independent expert on human rights in 
Somalia. The Board was also informed that Somalia is scheduled to undergo the UPR in 
2011 and welcomed the results achieved with limited funds in spite of the challenging 
circumstances, encouraging OHCHR to address sexual and gender-based violence in its 
programming. 
</p>
<p>22. While the human rights component of the United Nations Mission in Sudan 
(UNMIS) is engaged in the Sudan working with institutions on the process of elections 
aiming at fairness and transparency, the Board noted that it was important for OHCHR to 
make a meaningful contribution in the context of the referendum process by preparing a 
plan of action for intervention on the various possible outcomes even though the human 
rights component of the integrated mission may have a contingency plan.  
</p>
<p>23. The Human Rights Adviser in the Great Lakes region had organized workshops 
closely with civil society on development of projects and activities in the framework of the 
UPR process for Rwanda. Consultations had also been held with members of parliament on 
their role in promoting and protecting human rights. The Board acknowledged the 
impressive work of the adviser as catalyst and human rights advocate to the International 
Conference on the Great Lakes Region.  
</p>
<p>24. The Board thanked the Office for the thorough briefing on the activities in the Africa 
region and acknowledged the challenges faced in the subregions, welcoming the 
achievements realized. It highlighted the importance of working to develop justice and 
accountability mechanisms in the region and emphasized the coordination role to be played 
by human rights advisers in UNCTs, including relations with Governments. The Board 
emphasized the need for the Office to develop strategic contingency plans drawing from 
experience and lessons learned in the course of its human rights work in peace processes to 
prepare to tackle emerging challenges in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Asia-Pacific region 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Board was updated on human rights developments in the region, the situation of 
the field presences, projects and technical cooperation activities supported by the Voluntary 
Fund, and challenges. It was briefed on the situation of human rights components of United 
Nations peace missions in Afghanistan and Timor-Leste and on the situation of human 
rights advisers in Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>26. The Board was informed of positive developments in Papua New Guinea with the 
establishment of the NHRI and the successful visit of the special rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, with significant development 
partners such as the New Zealand Agency for International Development, the Australian 
Agency for International Development and the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human 
Rights Institutions. In addition the UPR had been an important exercise in the Pacific and 
the Office found that it was relatively easy to interact with States although there were few 
ratifications and treaty reports prepared.  
</p>
<p>27. The Board was also updated on the challenges faced in Afghanistan with the 
deepening conflict and security and consequent staffing problems which have led to the 
delay in implementation of technical cooperation activities. However human rights 
monitoring, reporting and advocacy work has continued. The Board was briefed on the 
situation in Timor-Leste, which concerns addressing economic social and cultural rights, 
the slow implementation of activities in Sri Lanka due to weakened collaboration with 
partners as well as the continuation of technical cooperation activities in Indonesia after the 
departure of the Human Rights Adviser in January 2010. </p>


<p>28. The Board reiterated its support for and expressed its satisfaction with the effective 
human rights field presences in the region, highlighting the need for OHCHR to further 
develop specific intervention strategies and the importance of strengthening relations with 
UNCT and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) representatives.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Middle East and North Africa region  
</b></p>
<p>29. The Board was given an overview of OHCHR field presences in the Middle East 
and North Africa region. It learned about the projects and activities funded by the 
Voluntary Fund in the region, including strategies within the context of technical 
cooperation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  
</p>
<p>30. The Agreement with the Government of Mauritania to establish an OHCHR country 
office was signed in September 2009 between the High Commissioner and the Government 
of Mauritania. The Country Office will be established in Nouakchott by the end of 2010.  
</p>
<p>31. In the OPT, the extent and complexity of the human rights challenges has required a 
high degree of adaptability on the part of the field presence. The Board was informed that 
the main priorities for OHCHR in the Occupied Palestinian Territories centre on 
accountability, right to life and security of person, freedom of movement and 
discrimination. It was further informed regarding the OHCHR leadership of the Protection 
Cluster Working Group in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, as well as the Office&#8217;s 
monitoring capabilities and activities, in response to the Human Rights Council's requests. 
With respect to monitoring, the urgent need for OHCHR to give East Jerusalem increased 
attention was stressed. The field presence's continuing provision of technical cooperation 
services and capacity-building activities to the Palestinian authorities were noted. 
</p>
<p>32. The deployment of a human rights adviser within the UNCT in Yemen is planned 
and negotiations are ongoing. The Board was informed of the activities of the Regional 
Office for the Middle East in Lebanon and the consultations with Member States regarding 
the planned establishment of the Regional Office for North Africa. The Board was pleased 
to note the success of the High Commissioner&#8217;s visit to the Gulf Cooperation Council&#8217;s 
countries and subsequent follow-up. The Board reiterated the need for OHCHR to have a 
strategic contingency plan to provide assistance to address human rights concerns in the 
region when needed. The Board learned of the progress made in the United Nations Human 
Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region in 
Qatar.  
</p>
<p>33. The Board was further interested in the issue of combating impunity and the rights 
to freedom of expression and association in the region, and welcomed the efforts made in 
the region despite challenges faced. The Board embarked on a general discussion on the 
state of the death penalty in the region and potential workshops to be held in view of 
promoting its abolition.  
</p>
<p>34. The Board also received a general update on the human rights challenges in Iraq and 
took note of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq<b> </b>(UNAMI) activities, observing 
that planning and strategies of intervention for the promotion and the protection of human 
rights are crucial to provide a stable environment for the full enjoyment of all rights.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Europe and Central Asia region 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Board noted the recent developments in the field presences in the Europe and 
Central Asia region, as well as the challenges &#8212; including political, human, financial and 
administrative constraints &#8212; to the implementation of priorities in the region.  </p>


<p>36. The Board was briefed on the situation of human rights advisers in Georgia, 
Moldova and the Russian Federation and on the situation of the field presence in Kosovo2. 
The Board learned of the work undertaken with the United Nations Interim Administration 
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on legislative amendments in workshops with the Kosovo 
Assembly, in its role of appointing the Ombudsperson to promote compliance with the 
Paris Principles relating to national human rights institutions. OHCHR had also been 
working with other partners in Kosovo such as the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the European Union and had thus 
established its reputation as a coordinator of human rights work. The Board was interested 
to learn that the European Union integration agenda in Kosovo provides opportunities for 
OHCHR to mainstream human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>37. In the South Caucasus, a region faced with the challenges linked to countries in 
transition, OHCHR carried out activities to strengthen NHRIs in order to increase local 
capacity to translate international obligations with regard to human rights protection. The 
Senior Human Rights Adviser contributed to the working groups established by the 
Georgian Government to prepare a justice reform strategy, focusing on penitentiary, 
probation and juvenile justice issues. He also contributed, through a series of regional 
workshops, to an increased understanding in Azeri society of the need to decriminalize libel 
and defamation. As a result, a draft law has been developed which is pending consideration 
in the Parliament. OHCHR continued to promote ratification of human rights treaties and 
engagement of countries with special procedures mandates. The UNDAF 2010-2015 was 
accepted by the Government of Azerbaijan and human rights concerns were reflected in the 
document. The Board noted that in the case of a high level of ratification, the challenge was 
practical implementation of laws. The Board was heartened to learn that the UPR was an 
encouraging mechanism for engagement with the countries in the region on human rights. 
</p>
<p>38. <b> </b>The Board learned of the steady progress in the completion of the first cycle of the 
human rights masters programme at leading Russian universities and the OHCHR 
fellowship programme for indigenous peoples. The second cycle is under way and the 
feedback from students who have studied in European universities is positive. The Board 
was pleased to learn that civil society was supportive of the programme and was aware of 
its long-term goals. It also took note of the human rights network for judges established in 
the Russian Federation for which United Nations jurisprudence in Russian is planned on the 
website. The High Commissioner is expected to visit next year. The Ombudsman&#8217;s office is 
a key partner in the Russian Federation.  
</p>
<p>39. The Board was updated on the work in the Republic of Moldova in preparation for 
and in follow-up to the ratification of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities. OHCHR was also instrumental in building the capacity of the Centre for 
Human Rights (Moldova&#8217;s NHRI) through information sessions and expertise, as well as in 
providing advice on the process of preparing the Centre&#8217;s application for accreditation with 
the International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs. The Republic of Moldova will be 
reviewed under the UPR in 2011, and OHCHR is presently assisting in the preparation 
process. The deployment of a human rights adviser in Ukraine in 2011 is being discussed 
with the RC and the UNCT. 
</p>
<p>40. Following the violence in Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, human rights staff have been 
deployed to the South of Kyrgyzstan in the field for a period of one year. The Board was 
further informed that the Regional Office for Europe in Brussels was working on the issue 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Throughout this report, all references to Kosovo, whether to the territory, institutions or population 
</p>
<p>shall be understood in the context of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and without prejudice 
to the status of Kosovo. </p>


<p>of discrimination and migration as a priority. The Office is working closely with the 
Council of Europe on adequate housing, education and migration, and child trafficking. The 
Board was pleased to note that economic, social and cultural rights were being addressed in 
the region. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Americas region 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Board was updated on field presences, projects, activities, strategies, partners 
and regional priorities within the context of technical cooperation in the Americas, as 
funded by the Voluntary Fund. The Americas region is generally characterized by stable 
democracies, solid legal frameworks, good NHRIs, organized civil society, and a high level 
of ratification and therefore presents a number of opportunities to engage with OHCHR in 
specific areas of human rights. In this context, the Board was informed that the challenges 
were mainly inequality and lack of access to economic social and cultural rights, 
discrimination against indigenous peoples and minorities, administration of justice, the 
fight against impunity and public security. It was informed about a regional consultation 
with Heads of Field Presences and experts that took place in Panama in August 2010 to 
assess the human rights and political situation in the region. During the consultation, the 
participants agreed that the priorities established in the 2010-2011 Strategic Management 
Plan were still valid, with a focus on the issues of public security and Indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>42. The Board was pleased to learn that the deployment of Human Rights Advisers in 
Paraguay and Honduras had been completed and that the regional office in Santiago, Chile, 
is operational. OHCHR has been working to review legislation in the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia by addressing the anti-discrimination law and providing support to the Government 
on a human rights-based approach in policy planning and in developing the Human Rights 
Plan of Action in Nicaragua and Ecuador. The Board also learned of the challenges faced 
by the Office in strengthening human rights protection mechanisms and the national 
institutions.  
</p>
<p>43.  The Board was pleased to note the work in support of administration of justice in 
Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Panama and the issuance of an <i>amicus curiae3</i> in Guatemala 
in setting jurisprudence on empowering rights holders to participate in public policy. The 
earthquake crisis in Haiti, during which the Human Rights Section of the United Nations 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) suffered fatalities, placed enormous stress on 
the implementation of technical cooperation activities by the human rights component of 
United Nations peace missions in Haiti and had a significant impact on the capacity of the 
Office to manage the Protection Cluster. The Board acknowledged the challenges faced and 
welcomed achievements realized.  
</p>
<p>44. The Board was briefed on possible activities for the coming year to engage more 
with the English-speaking Caribbean in order to increase the level of ratification of 
international instruments in these countries, improve reporting status, increase open 
invitations to special procedures and enhance knowledge of the UPR mechanism. It was 
informed of the conditions of the NHRIs and the state of the justice systems; it advised that 
the challenge would be to find the best strategy for impact in strengthening national 
institutions through international standards reinforcing the accountability mechanisms. The 
Board acknowledged the important efforts conducted in the region in establishing relations 
with Governments and local authorities. In the Mexico Office, under the monitoring 
</p>
<p>  
 3 On 25 August 2008, OHCHR presented an amicus curiae brief to the Constitutional Court of Guatemala in the case 
</p>
<p>against a former military commissioner for the forced disappearance of a number of residents of the Choatulum 
village between 1981 and 1984.  </p>


<p>mandate, OHCHR has had the opportunity to increase its presence in the State and organize 
missions to follow up on human rights violations. The Board learned of the plan to 
implement the human rights-based approach programme in partnership with the 
Government, the military and civil society. It noted that addressing impunity and providing 
public security is a challenge in the region. The Board was informed of the successful 
cooperation in Ecuador with the UNCT and the implementation of joint programmes on 
judiciary reform and technical advice on the new constitution in Ecuador.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Capacity- and institution-building in the context of United Nations 
peace operations 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Board received an overview of the activities carried out by the Peace Mission 
Support and Rapid Response Section of OHCHR. The activities of the section are broadly 
divided into four main areas: rapid response, human rights in humanitarian action, peace 
missions support, and roster management for peace missions. The Board learned of the 
evolving role of this section in managing partnerships at headquarters and field level during 
crises (including during humanitarian emergencies) and in the context of the United 
Nations peace and security agenda (Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)) and 
Department of Political Affairs lead missions).   
</p>
<p>46. The Section guides OHCHR engagement in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee 
(IASC), the primary mechanism for inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance 
involving the key United Nations and non-United Nations humanitarian partners4. The 
section supports OHCHR&#8217;s role in the Protection Cluster, including when the Office has 
committed to lead the inter-agency protection efforts at the field level such as in the case of 
Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. The challenge faced by OHCHR is the 
mainstreaming of human rights from early warning to preparedness, contingency planning, 
emergency response and transition to recovery. It was emphasized that early engagement of 
OHCHR in humanitarian processes contributes to a switch from needs-based to rights-
based delivery of humanitarian assistance. The Board learned of the challenges faced by the 
Office while working in Haiti and in Kyrgyzstan. OHCHR is also organizing six regional 
consultations to take place in 2010-2011 on human rights and humanitarian action in West 
Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, the Middle East, Central and Southern America and 
South East Asia with the objective to further enhance the Office&#8217;s operational capacity to 
engage effectively in humanitarian preparedness and response activities. The consultations 
are also being undertaken within the broader ambit of contributing to the development of an 
Office-wide framework for engagement in humanitarian action. 
</p>
<p>47. The Board was informed about progress in the field of consolidating the integration 
of human rights within the peace and security agenda of the United Nations. In terms of 
recent developments, the Board was heartened to note the discussions taking place at the 
highest level of the United Nations system on the possibility of applying the conditionality 
policy to all peacekeeping missions, which establishes that the military component of 
United Nations missions cannot provide support to national armed forces if they are found 
to have been involved in human rights violations. It was noted that OHCHR continues to 
play a key role in the selection for recruitment of human rights officers in United Nations 
peace missions formally under DPKO by providing substantive clearance of candidates. 
The Office also advises on and facilitates the selection process of the Heads of Human 
Rights components. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 IASC was established in June 1992 in response to General Assembly resolution 46/182 on 
</p>
<p>strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance. </p>


<p>48. In the context of rapid response, the Section supported the deployment of Human 
Rights observers to the elections in Togo; the establishment of the panel for the follow-up 
to the Goldstone report; the establishment of the international fact-finding mission on the 
Gaza flotilla (A/HRC/RES/14/1); the establishment of the United Nations Secretary 
General Advisory Panel on the Sri Lankan conflict; the opening of the Guinea country 
office and the dispatch of a team of observers to monitor the human rights situation during 
the elections; and the establishment of the temporary emergency operation in southern 
Kyrgyzstan. An initial training session on fact-finding and investigative skills for some of 
the roster members took place in September 2010.  
</p>
<p>49. The Board learned of the progress on Early Warning tools being developed by the 
section to support senior management decision-making during crises. It heard about 
OHCHR coordination with the IASC sub-Working Group on Preparedness and the Office 
of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide. Finally, it learned about the re-
launch of the Human Rights violations database project and about the plans to roll out the 
database initially in Mexico, Uganda, Nepal, Burundi and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p><b> G. National human rights institutions and regional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Board was updated on the cooperation by the National Institutions and Regional 
Mechanisms Section with the geographic sections, Treaty Bodies Division, Human Rights 
Council and Special Procedures Division, field presences, UNDP offices and UNCTs in 
carrying out their work. In the course of the year OHCHR held regional workshops on 
regional arrangements to enhance regional and subregional arrangements for human rights 
mechanisms. The Board learned of the successful outcome of three consultations held in 
Addis Ababa, Strasbourg and Washington DC in the preparation of the international 
workshop on enhancing cooperation between international and regional mechanisms for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, held in Geneva in May 2010 pursuant to Human 
Rights Council resolution 12/15. The workshops were attended by experts from regional 
mechanisms and treaty bodies inter alia, which resulted in a series of recommendations, 
among which the appointment of focal points within regional arrangements to liaise with 
the United Nations System.   
</p>
<p>51. The Board was updated on the strengthening of national institutions and the 
provision of technical assistance to NHRIs in partnership with UNDP and Governments 
and was heartened to note the support from UNDP senior management in reiterating their 
strategic partnership with OHCHR in the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs for the 
promotion and protection of human rights at domestic level. It also learned of the ongoing 
fellowship programme and the status of accreditation of the NHRIs. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Translation of human rights themes and mechanisms into the 
OHCHR Technical Cooperation Programme and Policy 
recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Board was updated on the current Human Rights Council review Working 
Group dealing with issues of substance and procedures and was informed of the Code of 
Conduct for special procedures mandate holders, the Complaints Procedures and the link 
that technical cooperation could provide to address human rights violations in the field.  </p>


<p>53. The Board highlighted the current success of the active participation of States in the 
UPR process, including the highly significant input by civil society reporting. However it 
was noted that there is room to improve on the quality and type of recommendations 
emanating from the process.  
</p>
<p>54. The Board enquired as to whether the Human Rights Council had a strategy on 
engagement of NGOs to ensure their wide participation in preparation of alternative reports 
on sensitive human rights and in the Human Rights Council sessions. It noted with thanks 
the ongoing work of the Human Rights Council and looked forward to the upcoming 
review.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Board was informed of the work in thematic mandates covering civil and 
political as well as economic and social and cultural rights, Groups in Focus (migrants, 
indigenous peoples and women and children) and was briefed on the overall structure of the 
Special Procedures Branch. The Office provided an update on the work of the special 
procedures, the working groups and the new mandates, including the review of mandates 
and the implementation of the Code of Conduct. The Board acknowledged the important 
contribution to the development of international law made by mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>56. The Board thanked the Special Procedures Branch for its update, noted the 
importance of maintaining both the thematic and country mandates and called for the 
strengthening of the consultative group on the nomination of the mandate holders on the 
public list.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Universal Periodic Review (UPR), follow-up and related funds 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Board was informed that an OHCHR UPR Strategy was developed in May 
2010, adopting a holistic approach for implementation of recommendations by treaty 
bodies, special procedures, UPR, and High Commissioners&#8217; recommendations. It was 
informed that the framework for the strategic approach for implementation of 
recommendations and follow-up to UPR outcomes was through: dissemination and 
knowledge management, direct support for implementation, and tracking the status of the 
implementation of recommendations.  
</p>
<p>58. The Board was informed of the UPR activities in Belarus, and a proposal being 
drawn up by the Regional Office for the Pacific that would help Pacific Island countries to 
prioritize the recommendations of UPR and other international mechanisms in a holistic 
fashion with a view to bringing about tangible impacts at the country level. It was noted 
that there was a need to strengthen the capacity in the Pacific region to work on UPR 
recommendations and those of other international human rights mechanisms. The Board 
was also informed of the UPR pre-session workshop in South Africa and the formal 
requests for assistance received from States: Burkina Faso, Ecuador, Cape Verde, 
Democratic Republic of Congo and Ecuador.  
</p>
<p>59.  The Board was informed of the two UPR Trust Funds and their distinct purposes for 
the Universal Periodic Review to facilitate States&#8217; participation in the UPR process and to 
assist States to implement follow-up recommendations. It was encouraged to note the 
participation and partnership of the UNCT in the preparation of documents for the UPR 
pre-session process.  
</p>
<p>60. On a concluding note, the Board was interested in the second cycle of the UPR and 
specifically pointed out its interest in a second round of visits and missions to both large </p>


<p>and small States and encouraged the Office to document this process. It enquired about the 
strategy the Office had for participation of NGOs, including in the follow-up process, and 
noted the importance of all mechanisms of treaty bodies, special procedures and UPR, and 
the interaction of States with each of the processes. The Board thanked the Office for the 
update on UPR and noted its appreciation of the UPR website as a useful resource for its 
work. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Human Rights Treaties  
</b></p>
<p>61. The Board was updated on the increase in ratification by States of treaties, which has 
resulted in an increase in the work of the related treaty bodies. It was informed of progress 
in reporting on UPR follow-up, an area in which States have shown keen interest and was 
updated on the establishment of new treaty bodies and inter-governmental working groups 
for possible adoption of new treaties and the evolution of work from purely traditional 
human rights work to new and challenging areas such as the rights of elderly persons, 
mercenaries and private security companies. The Board was updated on the workload of the 
Office in terms of supporting 74 weeks of treaty bodies' sessions and the consultative 
meetings that have been organized in Dublin, Marrakesh and Poznan by the treaty bodies to 
strengthen their working methods. The treaty bodies are also undertaking a review to 
harmonize their working methods and simplify their reporting process, and considering the 
inclusion of informal consultations and brainstorming sessions to include civil society and 
States. The treaty bodies are considering the question of ways in which the 
recommendations can be implemented at the country level and have held follow-up 
workshops to address this in an integrated and systematic approach. The Board was 
informed of the ongoing consideration of integrating recommendations for mechanisms 
such as UPR and special procedures to ensure a unified approach.  
</p>
<p>62. The Board members noted their appreciation of treaty bodies&#8217; work as an 
independent mechanism and recommended strengthening the monitoring of implementation 
of the recommendations. With regard to members of treaty bodies, the Board recommended 
the adoption of guidelines and procedures to be developed by the High Commissioner to 
facilitate nomination by Member States. The Board also emphasized the need for treaty 
bodies to have greater contact with the field presences to maximize the impact of their 
work. OHCHR acknowledged that there was potential to institutionalize the linkages with 
the field through the existing field presences including informal information-sharing 
meetings to ensure coordinated approaches with other United Nations agencies and the 
UNCTs.  
</p>
<p>63.  The acceptance of the UPR process was acknowledged and treaty bodies were faced 
with the challenge of becoming more robust and successful in their operations. The Board 
acknowledged the valuable normative work undertaken by the treaty bodies in 
strengthening the implementation of UPR recommendations. The Board emphasized the 
importance for treaty bodies to build on previous treaty body recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Rule of Law and Democracy 
</b></p>
<p>64.  The Board was updated on the work undertaken by the Rule of Law and Democracy 
Section in the technical cooperation activities in collaboration with other parts of OHCHR, 
by providing assistance in the development of norms and standards including the 
implementation of best practices in the field. The Board was informed of the work in 
combating impunity which was designed to initiate a programme to support national 
accountability in the field by focusing on different investigation mechanisms &#8211; </p>


<p>commissions of enquiry in particular. The Board learned of the development of a policy 
tool for policymakers and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>65.  The Board learned of the importance of establishing national independent 
commissions of inquiry, which was recently emphasized by the High Commissioner. The 
Office has also prepared a report on guidance on a witness and victim protection framework 
at the 15th session of the Human Rights Council. The strategic plan for the Office in this 
area is to continue to work on accountability on gross violations, establishment of national 
commissions of inquiry, and accountability with regard to prosecutions at national level. 
The Board also learned about the concerns in Latin America regarding the impact of 
organized crime on provision of public security. The Board appreciated the Office&#8217;s efforts 
to advise on transitional justice by setting standards, providing advice and capacity-building 
initiatives. The Board was pleased to learn of the production of tools containing collections 
of best practices from the United Nations field operations in the area of transitional justice.  
</p>
<p>66. The Board enquired on the issue of traditional justice and the need for sharing of 
ideas and was informed that experts in constitutional law in Colombia have incorporated 
traditional justice into jurisprudence and noted that more research into their co-existence 
was essential. The Board acknowledged the work of the Section and emphasized that the 
independence of national institutions was paramount to their success. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Anti-Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Board was pleased to note the reinforcement of the capacity of the Anti-
Discrimination Section of the Research and Right to Development Division of OHCHR. In 
the context of servicing mechanisms, the Section had continued to work with the various 
working groups comprised of Government representatives and independent eminent experts 
as well as the ad hoc committee on complementary standards to address gaps in normative 
agendas on racial discrimination. With regard to thematic and project work, the Section has 
held practical activities in the field to assist States to draw up national action plans to 
address racism and racial discrimination. In this regard two workshops were held in Africa 
in collaboration with l&#8217;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie for French-speaking 
States. There are ongoing preparations for a workshop with English-speaking African 
countries in December 2010 in Addis Ababa. The Board was also interested in the 
establishment of an anti-discrimination database in the future and was informed of plans to 
address the issue of promotion of anti-discrimination in collaboration with sports 
organizations. It was sensitized to the support required for activities related to the 
International Year for the People of African Descent in 2011. 
</p>
<p>68. The Board learned of the activities on the follow-up to the Durban Review 
Conference and the preparations for Human Rights Day 2010 on the theme: human rights 
defenders acting against discrimination. In conclusion the Board thanked the Section for its 
update and acknowledged their achievements.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>At the conclusion of the sessions, the Board members, along with senior staff 
members of OHCHR, had the opportunity to hold an interactive briefing and dialogue 
with Member States. The purpose was to inform and update Member States on the 
background, structure and operations of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund 
for Technical Cooperation, and to present the financial status of the Fund and 
activities supported by the Voluntary Fund. The session was well attended and 
interest was shown by the Member States in the following issues: the proportion of </b></p>


<p><b>funding received by field presences, whether funding was made available for UPR-
related activities in the field, the ratio of staff and activity costs of the voluntary fund 
and the criteria of selection of activities supported by the fund. The Chairperson 
ended the session by thanking the Member States for their support for the Fund and 
their continued interest in the work of OHCHR.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth sessions of the Board of Trustees of the 
Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation are planned from 26 to 29 May 2011 and 
from 31 October to 4 November 2011 respectively. </b></p>
