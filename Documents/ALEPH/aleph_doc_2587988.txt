12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the proposed Credit Date.
(iii) The Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Revolving
Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City
47
time) on the applicable Credit Date by wire transfer of same day funds in Dollars at the Revolving
Administrative Agent’s Principal Office. Except as provided herein, upon satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions precedent specified herein, the Revolving Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of
such Swing Line Loans available to the U.S. Borrower promptly upon receipt from such Swing Line
Lender on the applicable Credit Date by causing an amount of same day funds in Dollars equal to the
proceeds of all such Swing Line Loans received by the Revolving Administrative Agent from such
Swing Line Lender to be credited to the account of the U.S. Borrower at the Revolving Administrative
Agent’s applicable Principal Office, or to such other account as may be designated in writing to the
Revolving Administrative Agent by the U.S. Borrower.
(iv) With respect to any Swing Line Loans which have not been voluntarily prepaid by the U.S.
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.13(a) or repaid pursuant to Section 2.03(a) above, the Swing Line
Lender may at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, deliver to the Revolving Administrative
Agent (with a copy to the Borrower Representative), no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at
least one (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed Credit Date, a notice (which shall be deemed
to be a Borrowing Notice given by the Borrower Representative) requesting that with regard to any
Swing Line Loan outstanding on such date, each Lender holding a U.S. Revolving Commitment make
U.S. Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to the U.S. Borrower on such Credit Date in an
amount equal to the amount of such Swing Line Loans (the “Refunded Swing Line Loans”) in order to
repay such outstanding Swing Line Loans. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, (1) the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by the Lenders other than the Swing
Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by the Revolving Administrative Agent to the Swing Line
Lender (and not to any Borrower) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the applicable
Refunded Swing Line Loans and (2) on the day such Revolving Loans are made, the Swing Line
Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the
proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by the Swing Line Lender to the U.S. Borrower, and such portion
of the Swing Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans
and shall no longer be due under the Swing Line Note of the Swing Line Lender but shall instead
constitute part of the Swing Line Lender’s outstanding Revolving Loans to the U.S. Borrower and
shall be due under the applicable Revolving Loan Note issued by the U.S. Borrower to the Swing
Line Lender. If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to the Swing Line Lender
should be recovered by or on behalf of the U.S. Borrower from the Swing Line Lender in bankruptcy,
by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be
ratably shared among all Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.17.
(v) If for any reason Revolving Loans are not made pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(iv) in an amount
sufficient to repay any amounts owed to the Swing Line Lender in respect of any outstanding Swing
Line Loans on or before the third Business Day after demand for payment thereof by the Swing Line
Lender, each Lender holding a U.S. Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees
to, have purchased a participation in any outstanding Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Pro
Rata Share of the applicable unpaid amount together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one
48
(1) Business Day’s notice from the Swing Line Lender, each Lender holding a U.S. Revolving
Commitment shall deliver to such Swing Line Lender an amount equal to its respective participation
in the applicable unpaid amount in same day funds at the Principal Office of such Swing Line Lender.
In order to evidence such participation each Lender holding such a Revolving Commitment agrees to
enter into a participation agreement at the request of the Swing Line Lender in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Line Lender. In the event any Lender holding such a
Revolving Commitment fails to make available to the Swing Line Lender the amount of such Lender’s
participation as provided in this paragraph, such Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover such
amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon for three (3) Business Days at the
rate customarily used by such Swing Line Lender for the correction of errors among banks and
thereafter at the Base Rate.
(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (1) each Lender’s obligation to make
Revolving Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)(iv) and each Lender’s obligation to purchase a participation in any unpaid Swing Line
Loans pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall be absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, any Loan Party or
any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event
of Default; (C) any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial
or otherwise) or prospects of any Loan Party; (D) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document by any party thereto; or (E) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, that such obligations of each Lender are
subject to the condition that the Swing Line Lender had not received prior notice from the U.S.
Borrower or the Required Lenders that any of the conditions under Section 3.02 to the making of the
applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans were not satisfied at the
time such Refunded Swing Line Loans or unpaid Swing Line Loans were made; and (2) the Swing
Line Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loans (A) if it has elected not to do so
after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or Event of Default, (B) it does not in
good faith believe that all conditions under Section 3.02 to the making of such Swing Line Loan have
been satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders or (C) at a time when any Lender is a Defaulting
Revolving Lender, unless such Swing Line Lender has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it
and the Borrower Representative to eliminate such Swing Line Lender’s risk with respect to the
Defaulting Revolving Lender’s participation in such Swing Ling Loan, including by the U.S. Borrower
cash collateralizing such Defaulting Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Swing
Line Loans.

and (y) the date which is one year from the date of issuance of such standby Letter of Credit (it being
understood that if a Letter of Credit has an expiration date after the U.S. Revolving Termination Date,
the obligations of the Revolving Lenders with respect to such Letter of Credit will terminate on the
U.S. Revolving Termination Date; and (6) unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable Issuing Bank,
in no event shall any commercial Letter of Credit (x) have an expiration date later than the earlier of
(1) the U.S. Revolving Commitment Termination Date and (2) the date which is 180 days from the

Canadian Dollars at any time, and the amount of the U.S. Borrower’s reimbursement obligations
under Section 2.04(d) for any amounts paid by the Issuing Bank in connection with any such U.S.
Letter of Credit, shall be the Dollar Equivalent thereof, as determined on the most recent Valuation
Date or, if later, the date of reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.04(d).
(ii) During the Canadian Revolving Commitment Period, subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each Canadian Issuing Bank agrees to issue Canadian Letters of Credit for the account of the
Canadian Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof in the aggregate amount up to but not exceeding the
Canadian Letter of Credit Sublimit; provided, that (1) each Canadian Letter of Credit shall be

(x) the Canadian Revolving Commitment Termination Date and (y) the date which is one year from
the date of issuance of such standby Letter of Credit (it being understood that if a Letter of Credit has
an expiration date after the Canadian Revolving Termination Date, the obligations of the Revolving
Lenders with respect to such Letter of Credit will terminate on the Canadian Revolving Termination
Date); and (6) unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable Issuing Bank, in no event shall any
commercial Canadian Letter of Credit (x) have an expiration date later than the earlier of (1) the
Canadian Revolving Commitment Termination Date and (2) the date which is 180 days from the date

otherwise unacceptable to the Issuing Bank in its reasonable discretion.
50
(iii) Subject to the foregoing, each Issuing Bank may agree that a standby Letter of Credit shall
automatically be extended for one or more successive periods not to exceed one year each, unless
such Issuing Bank elects not to extend for any such additional period; provided, that such Issuing
Bank shall not extend any such Letter of Credit if it has received written notice that an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing at the time such Issuing Bank must elect to allow such extension;
provided, further, that at any time when any Lender is a Defaulting Revolving Lender, no Issuing Bank
shall be required to issue, renew or extend any Letter of Credit unless such Issuing Bank has entered
into arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower Representative to eliminate such Issuing Bank’s
risk with respect to the participation in Letters of Credit of the Defaulting Revolving Lender, including
by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the U.S. Letter of Credit
Usage or the Canadian Letter of Credit Usage, as applicable.
(b) Notice of Issuance. Whenever a Borrower desires the issuance of a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver
to the Revolving Administrative Agent an Issuance Notice (together with a completed application for
Letter of Credit in such form as the applicable Issuing Bank may specify) no later than 12:00 p.m.
(New York City time) at least three (3) Business Days (in the case of standby Letters of Credit) or five
(5) Business Days (in the case of commercial Letters of Credit), or in each case such shorter period as
may be agreed to by the applicable Issuing Bank in any particular instance, in advance of the
proposed date of issuance. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02, the
applicable Issuing Bank shall issue the requested Letter of Credit only in accordance with such
Issuing Bank’s standard operating procedures. Upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit or
amendment or modification to a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent and each Lender with an applicable
Revolving Commitment of such issuance, amendment or modification which notice shall be
accompanied by a copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment or modification to a Letter of Credit and
the amount of such Lender’s respective participation in such Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section 2.04(e).
(c) Responsibility of the Issuing Bank With Respect to Requests for Drawings and Payments. In
determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the
applicable Issuing Bank shall be responsible only to examine the documents delivered under such
Letter of Credit with reasonable care so as to ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. As between any Borrower and the
applicable Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or
misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by the applicable Issuing Bank by, the respective beneficiaries
of such Letters of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the
applicable Borrower pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or
transferee at law or under any other agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
the applicable Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application
for and
51
issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring
or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any
reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions
required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not
they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter
of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of
Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising
from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank, including any Governmental Acts; none of the
above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Bank’s rights or powers
hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing and in furtherance thereof, no action taken or omitted by an
Issuing Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit or any documents and certificates
delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith and in the absence of gross negligence and
willful misconduct (as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction), shall give rise to any liability on the part of such Issuing Bank to any Borrower.
(d) Reimbursement by the Borrowers of Amounts Drawn or Paid Under Letters of Credit. In the event
an Issuing Bank has determined to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit, it shall immediately notify
the Borrower Representative, the Revolving Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent, and
the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank on or before the Business Day immediately
following the date on which such drawing is honored (the “Reimbursement Date”) in an amount in
Dollars (or Canadian Dollars, as applicable) and in same day funds equal to the amount of such
honored drawing; provided that with respect to any reimbursement obligations of the U.S. Borrower
arising from the presentment to the Issuing Bank of a draft under a U.S. Letter of Credit denominated
in Canadian Dollars, the U.S. Borrower may make payment in Canadian Dollars only if such payment
is received by the Issuing Bank on the date such draft is paid by the Issuing Bank and shall make
payment thereafter in the Dollar Equivalent of such draft (as determined by the Issuing Bank on the
date such draft is paid); provided, that anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
(i) unless the Borrower Representative shall have notified the Revolving Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the
date such drawing is honored that the applicable Borrower intends to reimburse the Issuing Bank for
the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Loans, the
applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have given a timely Borrowing Notice to the Revolving
Administrative Agent requesting (x) with respect to any U.S. Letter of Credit, that Lenders with U.S.
Revolving Commitments to make U.S. Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the
Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such
honored drawing or (y) with respect to any Canadian Letter of Credit, that Lenders with Canadian
Revolving Commitments make Canadian Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans or Canadian
Prime Rate Loans, as applicable, on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Canadian Dollars
equal to the amount of such honored drawing, and (ii) subject to satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions specified in Section 3.02, such Lenders with Revolving Commitments shall, on the
Reimbursement Date, make such Revolving Loans that are
52
Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as applicable, in the Dollar Equivalent amount of
such honored drawing (or the Canadian Dollar amount as applicable with respect to Canadian Prime
Rate Loans), the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by the Revolving Administrative Agent to
reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the amount of such honored drawing; provided, further, that
if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by such Issuing Bank on the
Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the amount of such honored drawing, the applicable
Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to
the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving
Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this Section 2.04(d) shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender with a Revolving Commitment from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the terms and
conditions set forth herein, and each Borrower shall retain any and all rights it may have against any
such Lender resulting from the failure of such Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this
Section 2.04(d).
(e) Lenders’ Purchase of Participations in Letters of Credit. Immediately upon the issuance of each
U.S. Letter of Credit, each Lender having a U.S. Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to have
purchased, and hereby agrees to irrevocably purchase, from the applicable Issuing Bank a
participation in such U.S. Letter of Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to
such Lender’s Pro Rata Share (with respect to the U.S. Revolving Commitments) of the Dollar
Equivalent of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn
thereunder. Immediately upon the issuance of each Canadian Letter of Credit, each Lender having a
Canadian Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to have purchased, and hereby agrees to
irrevocably purchase, from the applicable Issuing Bank a participation in such Canadian Letter of
Credit and any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender’s Pro Rata Share
(with respect to the Canadian Revolving Commitments) of the maximum amount which is or at any
time may become available to be drawn thereunder. In the event that the applicable Borrower shall
fail for any reason to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank as provided in Section 2.04(d), such
Issuing Bank shall promptly notify each Lender with an applicable Revolving Commitment of the
unreimbursed amount of such honored drawing and of such Lender’s respective participation therein
based on such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Commitments. Each Lender with
a U.S. Revolving Commitment shall make available to the applicable Issuing Bank an amount equal
to its respective participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of such Issuing Bank
specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day
(under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such office of the Issuing Bank is located) after the date
notified by such Issuing Bank. Each Lender with a Canadian Revolving Commitment shall make
available to the applicable Issuing Bank an amount equal to its respective participation, in Dollars or
Canadian Dollars, as applicable, and in same day funds, at the office of such Issuing Bank specified
in such notice, not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day (under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which such office of the Issuing Bank is located) after the date notified by
such Issuing Bank. In the event that any Lender with a U.S. Revolving Commitment or Canadian
Revolving Commitment, as applicable, fails to make available to the applicable Issuing Bank on such
Business Day the amount of such Lender’s participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this
Section 2.04(e), the applicable Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from
such Lender together with interest thereon for three (3) Business Days at the rate customarily used by
the applicable Issuing Bank for the correction of errors among banks and thereafter, in respect of U.S.
Letters
53
of Credit, at the Base Rate, and in respect of Canadian Letters of Credit, at the Canadian Prime Rate.
In the event the applicable Issuing Bank shall have been reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant to
this Section 2.04(e) for all or any portion of any drawing honored by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Bank shall distribute to each Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it
under this Section 2.04(e) with respect to such honored drawing such Lender’s Pro Rata Share (with
respect to the applicable Revolving Commitments) of all payments subsequently received by the
applicable Issuing Bank from the applicable Borrower in reimbursement of such honored drawing
when such payments are received. Any such distribution shall be made to a Lender at its primary
address set forth below its name on Schedule 1.01(d) or at such other address as such Lender may
request.
(f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of each Borrower to reimburse an Issuing Bank for drawings
honored under Letters of Credit issued by it and to repay any Revolving Loans made by the Lenders
pursuant to Section 2.04(d) and the obligations of the Lenders under Section 2.04(e) shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms hereof under all
circumstances including any of the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of
any Letter of Credit; (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which any Borrower
or any Lender may have at any time against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or
any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other
Person or, in the case of a Lender, against any Borrower, whether in connection herewith, the
transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction
between any Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was
procured); (iii) any draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in
any respect; (iv) payment by an Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft
or other document which does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) any
adverse change in the business, general affairs, assets, liabilities, operations, management, condition
(financial or otherwise), stockholders’ equity, results of operations or value of any Loan Party; (vi) any
breach hereof or any other Loan Document by any party thereto; (vii) the fact that an Event of Default
or a Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or (viii) any other circumstance or happening
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
(g) Indemnification. Without duplication of any obligation of any Borrower under Section 10.02 or
10.03, in addition to amounts payable as provided herein, each Borrower hereby agrees to protect,
indemnify, pay and save harmless each applicable Issuing Bank from and against any and all claims,
demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable fees,
expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which such Issuing
Bank may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter
of Credit by such Issuing Bank, other than as a result of (1) the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Issuing Bank (as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction) or (2) the wrongful dishonor by such Issuing Bank of a proper demand for payment made
under any Letter of Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing Bank to honor a drawing under
any such Letter of Credit as a result of any Governmental Act.
54
(h) Resignation and Removal of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank
upon 60 days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent, the
Lenders and the Borrower Representative. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written
agreement among the Borrower Representative, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank (provided that no consent of the replaced Issuing
Bank will be required if the replaced Issuing Bank has no Letters of Credit or reimbursement
Obligations with respect thereto outstanding) and the successor Issuing Bank. The Revolving
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement or resignation of such Issuing
Bank. At the time any such replacement or resignation shall become effective, the applicable
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced or resigned Issuing Bank.
From and after the effective date of any such replacement or resignation, (i) any successor Issuing
Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall
be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all
previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement or resignation of an Issuing
Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto to the extent that Letters of
Credit issued by it remain outstanding and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such
replacement or resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or to renew
existing Letters of Credit.
(i) Determination of Exchange Rate. On each Valuation Date with respect to each outstanding Letter
of Credit denominated in Canadian Dollars, the applicable Issuing Bank shall determine the
Exchange Rate as of such Valuation Date and shall promptly notify the Revolving Administrative
Agent and the Borrower thereof and of the Dollar Equivalent of all such Letters of Credit issued by it
outstanding on such Valuation Date. The Exchange Rate so determined shall become effective on
such Valuation Date and shall remain effective until the next succeeding Valuation Date.
Section 2.05 Pro Rata Shares; Availability of Funds.
(a) Pro Rata Shares. All Loans shall be made, and all participations purchased, by the Lenders
simultaneously and proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no
Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other Lender’s obligation to
make a Loan requested hereunder or purchase a participation required hereby nor shall any Term
Loan Commitment or any Revolving Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a
result of a default by any other Lender in such other Lender’s obligation to make a Loan requested
hereunder or purchase a participation required hereby.
(b) Availability of Funds. Unless the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving Loans,
the Revolving Administrative Agent, shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the applicable
Credit Date that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent or, if such
borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, the amount of such Lender’s
Loan requested on such Credit Date, the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving
Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, may assume that such Lender has made such amount
available to the Administrative
55
Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, on such Credit
Date and the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the Revolving
Administrative Agent, may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to, make available to the
applicable Borrower a corresponding amount on such Credit Date. If such corresponding amount is
not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the
Revolving Administrative Agent, by such Lender, the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of
Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to recover such corresponding
amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from such Credit
Date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of
Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by the Administrative
Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, for the
correction of errors among banks for three (3) Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. If such
Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s or, if such
borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent’s, demand therefor, the
Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent,
shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the applicable Borrower shall immediately pay such
corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving Loans, the
Revolving Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date
until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or, if such borrowing is of Revolving
Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, at the rate payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans for
such Class of Loans. Nothing in this Section 2.05(b) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
obligation to fulfill its Term Loan Commitment and Revolving Commitment hereunder or to prejudice
any rights that any Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender
hereunder.
Section 2.06 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Term Loans and the Revolving Loans, if any,
made on the Restatement Date shall be applied by the U.S. Borrower to consummate the
Transactions and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Revolving
Loans, Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit made after the Restatement Date shall be applied by
the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower for working capital and general corporate purposes of
the Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries, including Permitted Acquisitions. The proceeds of
the Incremental Term Loans shall be applied by the U.S. Borrower for general corporate purposes,
including Permitted Acquisitions. No portion of the proceeds of any Credit Extension shall be used in
any manner that causes or might cause such Credit Extension or the application of such proceeds to
violate Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X of the Board of Governors or any other regulation
thereof or to violate the Exchange Act.
Section 2.07 Evidence of Debt; Registers; Notes.
(a) Lenders’ Evidence of Debt. Each Lender shall maintain on its internal records an account or
accounts evidencing the Obligations of each Borrower to such Lender, including the amounts of the
Loans made by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof.
(b) Registers. The Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it) shall maintain at its
Principal Office a register for the recordation of the names, addresses of, and
56
the principal and stated interest owing to, the Lenders and the Term Loans of each Lender from time
to time (the “Term Loan Register”). The Revolving Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent
appointed by it) shall maintain at its Principal Office a register for the recordation of the names,
addresses of, and the principal and stated interest owing to, the Lenders and the Revolving
Commitment and Revolving Loans of each Lender from time to time (the “Revolving Commitment
Register”). The Registers shall be available for inspection by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower
Representative or any Lender (but solely with respect to any entry relating to such Lender’s Loans) at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Administrative Agent
and the Revolving Administrative Agent (as applicable) shall record, or shall cause to be recorded, in
the Term Loan Register or the Revolving Commitment Register, as applicable, the Revolving
Commitments and the Loans in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.06, and each repayment
or prepayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans, and any such recordation shall be
conclusive and binding on the applicable Borrower and each Lender, absent manifest error; provided,
that failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any
Lender’s Revolving Commitment or any Borrower’s Obligations in respect of any Loan. Each
Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent to
serve as such Borrower’s agent solely for purposes of maintaining the Term Loan Register and the
Revolving Commitment Register as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.07, and such
Borrower hereby agrees that, to the extent the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative
Agent serves in such capacity, the Administrative Agent and its officers, directors, employees, agents,
sub-agents and affiliates shall constitute “Indemnitees.”
(c) Notes. If so requested by any Lender by written notice to the Borrower Representative (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Restatement Date, or at any
time thereafter, the applicable Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable
and if so specified in such notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender pursuant to
Section 10.06) on the Restatement Date (or, if such notice is delivered after the Restatement Date,
promptly after the Borrower Representative’s receipt of such notice) a Note or Notes to evidence such
Lender’s Tranche B-1 Term Loan, Tranche B-2 Term Loan, Incremental Term Loan, Revolving Loan
or Swing Line Loan, as the case may be.
Section 2.08 Interest on Loans.
(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, each Class of Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal
amount thereof from the date made through repayment (whether by acceleration or otherwise) thereof
as follows:
(i) in the case of Term Loans and Revolving Loans:
(A) if a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; or
(B) if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin; or
57
(C) if a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, at the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and
(ii) in the case of Swing Line Loans, at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans.
(b) The basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any Loan (except a Swing Line Loan
which can be made and maintained as a Base Rate Loan only), and the Interest Period with respect
to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be selected by the applicable Borrower and notified to the
Administrative Agent or, if relating to Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent pursuant
to the applicable Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be; provided,
that until the date on which the Arrangers notify the Borrower Representative that the primary
syndication of the Loans and Revolving Commitments has been completed, as determined by the
Arrangers, the Term Loans shall be maintained as Base Rate Loans. If on any day a Loan is
outstanding with respect to which a Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice has not
been delivered to the Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, the Revolving Administrative Agent) in
accordance with the terms hereof specifying the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest,
then for that day such Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan, or if in Canadian Dollars, a Canadian Prime
Rate Loan.
(c) In connection with (i) Term Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans there shall be no more than
seven (7) Interest Periods outstanding at any time and (ii) Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Rate
Loans there shall be no more than three (3) Interest Periods outstanding at any time. In the event a
Borrower fails to specify between a Base Rate Loan or a Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable
Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, such Loan (if outstanding as a Dollar
denominated Eurodollar Rate Loan) shall be automatically converted into a Base Rate Loan on the
last day of the then-current Interest Period for such Loan (or if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan shall
remain as, or (if not then outstanding) shall be made as, a Base Rate Loan). In the event a Borrower
fails to specify an Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable Borrowing Notice or
Conversion/Continuation Notice, such Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period
of one month. As soon as practicable after 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate
Determination Date, the Administrative Agent or, with regard to Revolving Loans, the Revolving
Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans
for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall
promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the applicable
Borrower and each Lender.
(d) Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.08(a) shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans
and Canadian Prime Rate Loans on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as the case may be and
(ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual
number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the
date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with
respect to a Term Loan, the last Interest Payment Date with respect to such Term Loan or, with
respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of such
conversion, as the case may be, shall be included, and
58
the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan
or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of such
conversion, as the case may be, shall be excluded; provided, that if a Loan is repaid on the same day
on which it is made, one day’s interest shall be paid on that Loan.
(e) Except as otherwise set forth herein, interest on each Loan (i) shall accrue on a daily basis and
shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect to interest accrued on and to
each such payment date; (ii) shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be payable in arrears upon any
prepayment of such Loan, whether voluntary or mandatory, to the extent accrued on the amount being
prepaid; and (iii) shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be payable in arrears at maturity of such
Loan, including final maturity of such Loan; provided, that with respect to any voluntary prepayment of
a Base Rate Loan, accrued interest shall instead be payable on the applicable Interest Payment Date.
(f) Each Borrower agrees to pay to the applicable Issuing Bank, with respect to drawings honored
under any Letter of Credit issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing Bank in respect of
each such honored drawing from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date such
amount is reimbursed by or on behalf of the applicable Borrower at a rate equal to (i) for the period
from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the applicable Reimbursement Date, the rate
of interest otherwise payable hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans
(or, if such amount paid is denominated in Canadian Dollars, Canadian Prime Rate Loans) and
(ii) thereafter, a rate which is 2.00% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable
hereunder with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans (or, if such amount paid is
denominated in Canadian Dollars, Canadian Prime Rate Loans).
(g) Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.08(f) shall be computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year
for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues, and shall be payable on
demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related drawing under a Letter of Credit is
reimbursed in full. Promptly upon receipt by the applicable Issuing Bank of any payment of interest
pursuant to Section 2.08(f), such Issuing Bank shall distribute to each applicable Lender, out of the
interest received by such Issuing Bank in respect of the period from the date such drawing is honored
to but excluding the date on which the Issuing Bank is reimbursed for the amount of such drawing
(including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans), the amount that
such Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the letter of credit fee that would have
been payable in respect of such Letter of Credit for such period if no drawing had been honored under
such Letter of Credit. In the event an Issuing Bank shall have been reimbursed by the applicable
Lenders for all or any portion of such honored drawing, such Issuing Bank shall distribute to each
Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under Section 2.04(e) with respect to such honored
drawing such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any interest received by such Issuing Bank in respect of
that portion of such honored drawing so reimbursed by the applicable Lenders for the period from the
date on which such Issuing Bank was so reimbursed by the applicable Lenders to but excluding the
date on which such portion of such honored drawing is reimbursed by the applicable Borrower.
(h) For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), (i) whenever any interest under
this Agreement is calculated using a rate based on a year of 360 days or 365 days,
59
as the case may be, the rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual
rate, is equivalent to (x) the applicable rate based on a year of 360 days or 365 days, as the case may
be, (y) multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the period for which such
interest or fee is payable (or compounded) ends, and (z) divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be,
(ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under
this Agreement, and (iii) the rates of interest stipulated in this Agreement are intended to be nominal
rates and not effective rates or yields.
Section 2.09 Conversion/Continuation.
(a) Subject to Section 2.18 and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and then
be continuing, each Borrower shall have the option:
(i) to convert at any time all or any part of any Term Loan or U.S. Revolving Loan equal to $1,000,000
(or, in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan, $500,000) and integral multiples of $1,000,000
(or, in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan, $100,000) in excess of that amount from one
Type of Loan to another Type of Loan; provided, that a Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be converted
on the expiration of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan unless the U.S.
Borrower shall pay all amounts due under Section 2.18 in connection with any such conversion; or
(ii) upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all
or any portion of such Loan equal to $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that
amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan; or
(iii) to convert at any time all or any part of a Canadian Revolving Loan equal to CN$1,000,000 or
CN$500,000 in the case of a conversion to a Canadian Prime Rate Loan and integral multiples
thereof (or, in the case of conversion to a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, CN$500,000) in excess of that
amount for any Type of Loan to another Type of Loan; provided, that a Eurodollar Rate Loan may only
be converted on the expiration of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan unless
the Canadian Borrower shall pay all amounts due under Section 2.18 in connection with any such
conversion.
(b) The Borrower Representative shall deliver a Conversion/Continuation Notice to the Administrative
Agent (or, with regard to Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent) no later than 10:00
a.m. (New York City time) at least one (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date
(in the case of a conversion to and from a Base Rate Loan) and at least three (3) Business Days in
advance of the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date (in the case of a conversion to or from, or a
continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). Except as otherwise provided herein, a
Conversion/Continuation Notice for conversion to, or continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and the applicable Borrower
shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith.
Section 2.10 Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
under Section 8.01(a), (f), (g) or (i), amounts not paid when due (which, in the
60
case of interest payments, will be to the extent permitted by applicable law) shall thereafter bear
interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other
applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate (the “Default Rate”) that is 2.00% per
annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder with respect to the applicable
Loans (or, in the case of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate which is 2.00% per annum in
excess of the interest rate otherwise payable hereunder for Base Rate Loans that are Revolving
Loans); provided, that in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the expiration of the Interest Period
in effect at the time any such increase in interest rate is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
thereupon become Base Rate Loans, as applicable, and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon
demand at a rate which is 2.00% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable
hereunder for Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for
in this Section 2.10 is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of
any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender.
Section 2.11 Fees.

Letter of Credit as are in accordance with the Issuing Bank’s standard schedule for such charges and
as in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may be.
(d) All fees referred to in Section 2.11(a), 2.11(b) and 2.11(c)(i) shall be calculated on the basis of a
360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on
March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year during the Revolving Commitment

Restatement Date. Such closing fees shall be in all respects fully earned, due and payable on the
Restatement Date and non-refundable and non-creditable thereafter.
62
(f) In addition to any of the foregoing fees, each Borrower agrees to pay to Agents such other fees in
the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon.

provided, that in the event any Incremental Term Loans are made, such Incremental Term Loans shall
be repaid on each Installment Date occurring on or after the applicable Increased Amount Date as set
forth in the applicable Joinder Agreement (including, if such Incremental Term Loans are documented
as an increase in an existing Class of Term Loans).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) such Installments shall be reduced in connection with any
voluntary or mandatory prepayments of the Tranche B-1 Term Loans or the Tranche B-2 Term
63
Loans, as the case may be, in accordance with Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15, as applicable; (y) the

hereunder with respect thereto, shall, in any event, be paid in full no later than the Tranche B-1 Term
Loan Maturity Date and the Tranche B-2 Term Loan Maturity Date, respectively; and (z) Incremental
Term Loans, together with all other amounts owed hereunder with respect thereto, shall, in any event,
be paid in full no later than the applicable Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date.
Section 2.13 Voluntary Prepayments/Commitment Reductions.
(a) Voluntary Prepayments.
(i) Any time and from time to time (1) with respect to Base Rate Loans, the U.S. Borrower may prepay
any such Loans on any Business Day in whole or in part, in an aggregate minimum amount of

may prepay any such Base Rate Loans on any Business Day in whole or in part in an aggregate
minimum amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $50,000 in excess of that amount; (2) with
respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower may prepay any such
Loans on any Business Day in whole or in part in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and
integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount; (3) with respect to Swing Line Loans, the U.S.
Borrower may prepay any such Loans on any Business Day in whole or in part in an aggregate

(4) with respect to Canadian Prime Rate Loans, the Canadian Borrower may prepay any such Loans
on any Business Day in whole or in part, in an aggregate minimum amount of C$100,000 and integral
multiples of C$50,000 in excess of that amount.
(ii) All such prepayments shall be made (1) upon not less than one (1) Business Day’s prior written
notice in the case of Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans; (2) upon not less than three
(3) Business Days’ prior written notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans; and (3) upon written

by 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date required (and the Administrative Agent, the Revolving
Administrative Agent or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly transmit such original
notice for Term Loans, Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans, as the case may be, by telefacsimile or
telephone to each Lender). Upon the giving of any such notice, the principal amount of the Loans
specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the prepayment date specified therein. Any
such voluntary prepayment shall be applied as specified in Section 2.15(a).
(b) Voluntary Commitment Reductions.
(i) Each Borrower may, upon not less than three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice confirmed in
writing to the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent (which original written
notice the Administrative Agent shall
64
promptly transmit by telefacsimile or telephone to each applicable Lender), at any time and from time
to time terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part, without premium or penalty, the Revolving
Commitments in an amount up to the amount by which the Revolving Commitments exceed the Total
Utilization of Revolving Commitments at the time of such proposed termination or reduction; provided,
that any such partial reduction of (x) the U.S. Revolving Commitments shall be in an aggregate
minimum amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount and
(y) the Canadian Revolving Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $100,000 and
integral multiples of $50,000 in excess of that amount.
(ii) A Borrower’s notice to the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent shall
designate the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such termination or reduction and the amount
of any partial reduction, and such termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be
effective on the date specified in such Borrower’s notice and shall reduce the Revolving Commitment
of each Lender proportionately to its Pro Rata Share thereof.
(c) Below-Par Purchases. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.13 or
any other provision of this Agreement and without otherwise limiting the rights in respect of
prepayments of the Loans of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries or the rights of any Term Lender
(as defined below) to receive payments of the Term Loans at par value, so long as no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the U.S. Borrower may repurchase outstanding Term Loans
pursuant to this Section 2.13(c) on the following basis:
(i) (i) The U.S. Borrower may make one or more offers (each, an “Offer”) to repurchase all or any
portion of the Term Loans (such Term Loans, the “Offer Loans”), provided that, (A) the U.S. Borrower
delivers notice of its intent to make such Offer to the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business
Days in advance of the launch of any proposed Offer, (B) upon the launch of such proposed Offer, the
U.S. Borrower delivers an irrevocable notice of such Offer to the Administrative Agent (and upon
receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender holding a Term Loan (each such Lender, a “Term Lender”) thereof) indicating (1) the last date
on which such Offer may be accepted, (2) the maximum dollar amount of such Offer and (3) the
repurchase price per dollar of principal amount of such Offer Loans at which the U.S. Borrower is
willing to repurchase such Offer Loans (which price shall be below par), (C) the maximum dollar
amount of each Offer shall be an amount reasonably determined by the U.S. Borrower in consultation
with the Administrative Agent prior to the making of any such Offer; (D) the U.S. Borrower shall hold
such Offer open for a minimum period of days to be reasonably determined by the Administrative
Agent and the applicable Borrower prior to the making of any such Offer; (E) a Term Lender who
elects to participate in the Offer may choose to sell all or part of such Term Lender’s Offer Loans;
(F) such Offer shall be made to all Term Lenders holding the Offer Loans on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the respective principal amount then due and owing to the Term Lenders; provided,
further that, if any Term Lender elects not to participate in the Offer, either in whole or in part, the
amount of such Term Lender’s Offer Loans not being tendered shall be excluded in calculating the
pro rata amount applicable to the balance of such Offer Loans and (G)
65
such Offer shall be conducted pursuant to such procedures the Administrative Agent may establish in
consultation with the U.S. Borrower (which shall be consistent with this Section 2.13(c)) and that a
Lender must follow in order to have its Offer Loans repurchased, which procedures may include a
requirement that the U.S. Borrower represent and warrant that it does not have any material non-

shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of an Authorized Officer demonstrating the
calculation of the amount of the applicable net proceeds or Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, as the
case may be. In the event that the Borrower Representative shall subsequently determine that the
actual amount received exceeded the amount set forth in such certificate, the U.S. Borrower shall
promptly make an additional prepayment of the Term Loans and/or the Revolving Commitments shall
be permanently reduced in an amount equal to such excess, and the Borrower Representative shall

(a) Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type of Loans. Any prepayment of any Loan pursuant to
Section 2.13(a) shall be applied as specified by or on behalf of the Borrower Representative in the
applicable notice of prepayment; provided that any voluntary prepayment pursuant to this
Section 2.15(a) must be applied pro rata to all Term Loans of the same Class (but may be applied to
(x) any Class of Term Loans (and, for the avoidance of doubt, prepayments of the Term Loans do not
have to be applied to all Classes of Term Loan) and (y) the Installments thereof, in each case as
specified by the Borrower Representative); and provided further, that in the event the Borrower
Representative fails to specify the Loans (including, in the case of the Term Loans, the Class) to
which any such prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied as follows:
first, to repay outstanding Swing Line Loans of the U.S. Borrower to the full extent thereof;
second, to repay outstanding Revolving Loans of such Borrower to the full extent thereof; and
third, if such prepayment is made by (or on behalf of) the U.S. Borrower, to prepay the Term Loans on
a pro rata basis (in accordance with the respective outstanding principal amounts thereof); and further
applied on a pro rata basis to reduce the scheduled remaining Installments of principal of the Tranche
B-1 Term Loans and Tranche B-2 Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans.
69
(b) Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type of Loans. Any amount required to be paid
pursuant to Sections 2.14(a) through 2.14(e) shall be applied as follows:
first, to prepay to the next four (4) scheduled Installments of the Term Loans on a pro rata basis (in
accordance with the respective outstanding principal amounts thereof) and thereafter applied on a pro
rata basis to the remaining scheduled Installments of principal of the Term Loans on a pro rata basis
(in accordance with respective outstanding principal amounts thereby); provided that prior to the
Tranche B-1 Term Loan Maturity Date the U.S. Borrower may elect to have such payments applied
solely with respect to the Tranche B-1 Term Loans;
second, to prepay the Swing Line Loans to the full extent thereof and to permanently reduce the
Revolving Commitments by the amount of such prepayment;
third, to prepay the Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof and to further permanently reduce the
Revolving Commitments by the amount of such prepayment;
fourth, to prepay outstanding reimbursement obligations with respect to Letters of Credit and to further
permanently reduce the Revolving Commitments by the amount of such prepayment;
fifth, to cash collateralize Letters of Credit and to further permanently reduce the Revolving
Commitments by the amount of such cash collateralization; and
sixth, to further permanently reduce the Revolving Commitments to the full extent thereof.
(c) Application of Prepayments of Loans to Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans. Considering
each Class of Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to Base
Rate Loans (or, if applicable, Canadian Prime Rate Loans) to the full extent thereof before application
to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments
required to be made by any Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(c).
Section 2.16 General Provisions Regarding Payments.
(a) All payments by any Borrower of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in
Dollars (or with respect to Revolving Loans in Canadian Dollars, Canadian Dollars) in same day
funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to the
Administrative Agent or, with respect to any payments related to Revolving Loans, the Revolving
Administrative Agent, not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date due at the Principal
Office designated by the Administrative Agent or, with respect to any payments related to Revolving
Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Lenders. For purposes of
computing interest and fees, funds
70
received by the Administrative Agent or, with respect to any payments related to Revolving Loans, the
Revolving Administrative Agent, after that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid
by the applicable Borrower on the next succeeding Business Day.
(b) All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan (other than voluntary prepayments of
Revolving Loans, Base Rate Loans and Canadian Prime Rate Loans) shall be accompanied by
payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments
(and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when interest is due and payable
with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest then due and payable before
application to principal.
(c) The Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it) or, with respect to Revolving
Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it), shall promptly
distribute to each Lender at such address as such Lender shall indicate in writing, such Lender’s
applicable Pro Rata Share of all payments and prepayments of principal and interest due hereunder,
together with all other amounts due thereto, including all fees payable with respect thereto, to the
extent received by the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, if any Conversion/ Continuation Notice is
withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its
Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent, or the Revolving
Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall give effect thereto in apportioning payments received
thereafter.
(e) Subject to the provisos set forth in the definition of “Interest Period” as they may apply to Revolving
Loans, whenever any payment to be made hereunder with respect to any Loan shall be stated to be
due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day and, with respect to Revolving Loans only, such extension of time shall be included in
the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the Revolving Commitment fees hereunder.
(f) Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative
Agent, as applicable, to charge the Borrowers’ respective accounts, with the Administrative Agent and
the Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable, in order to cause timely payment to be made to the
Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent of all principal, interest, fees and
expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts for that purpose).
(g) The Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall deem any
payment by or on behalf of any Borrower hereunder that is not made in same day funds prior to 12:00
p.m. (New York City time) to be a non-conforming payment. Any such payment shall not be deemed to
have been received by the Administrative Agent or, as applicable, the Revolving Administrative
Agent, until the later of (i) the time such funds become available funds, and (ii) the applicable next
Business Day. The Administrative Agent or, with regard to Revolving Loans, the Revolving
Administrative Agent, shall give prompt telephonic notice to the Borrower Representative and each
applicable Lender (confirmed in writing) if any
71
payment is non-conforming. Any non-conforming payment may constitute or become a Default or
Event of Default in accordance with the terms of Section 8.01(a). Interest shall continue to accrue on
any principal as to which a non-conforming payment is made until such funds become available funds
(but in no event less than the period from the date of such payment to the next succeeding applicable
Business Day) at the Default Rate from the date such amount was due and payable until the date
such amount is paid in full.
(h) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and not otherwise been waived, and the maturity of the
Obligations shall have been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.01, all payments or proceeds received
by Agents hereunder in respect of any of the Obligations, shall be applied in accordance with the
application arrangements described in Section 9.2 of the Pledge and Security Agreement.
Section 2.17 Ratable Sharing. The Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall,
whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied in
accordance with the terms hereof), through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker’s lien, by
counterclaim or cross-action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or
otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy
Code, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest,
amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to such
Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the “Aggregate Amounts Due” to
such Lender) which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the
Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater
payment shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent and each
other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase
participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation
simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate
Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be
shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided, that if all or part
of such proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered
from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, those
purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to
such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Borrower
expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so
purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker’s lien, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any
and all monies owing by any Borrower to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were
owed the amount of the participation held by that holder. The provisions of this Section 2.17 shall not
be construed to apply to (a) any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with
the express terms of this Agreement or (b) any payment obtained by any Lender as consideration for
the assignment or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or other Obligations owed to it.
Section 2.18 Making or Maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans.
(a) Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. In the event that the Administrative Agent (or, with
regard to Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent)
72
shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, that by
reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market adequate and fair means do not exist
for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent (or, with regard to Revolving Loans, the Revolving
Administrative Agent) shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in
writing) to the Borrower Representative and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no
Loans may be made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as the Administrative
Agent (or, with regard to Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent) notifies the Borrower
Representative and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist and
(ii) any Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by any Borrower with respect to
the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by such
Borrower.
(b) Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar Rate Loans. In the event that on any date any Lender
shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become
unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental
rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule,
regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith
would not be unlawful) or (ii) has become impracticable, as a result of contingencies occurring after
the Restatement Date which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market or the
position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an “Affected
Lender” and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent and, if such Lender holds Revolving
Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent, of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent (or, with regard to Revolving Loans, the Revolving Administrative Agent) shall promptly
transmit to each other applicable Lender). If the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative
Agent receives a notice from (x) any Lender pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence or (y) a
notice from Lenders constituting the Required Lenders pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, then (1) the obligation of the Lenders (or, in the case of any notice pursuant to clause (i) of
the preceding sentence, such Lender) to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by each Affected Lender, (2) to the
extent such determination by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being
requested by any Borrower pursuant to a Borrowing Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the
Lenders (or, in the case of any notice pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, such Lender)
shall make such Loan as (or continue such Loan as or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a
Base Rate Loan, (3) the Lenders’ (or, in the case of any notice pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding
sentence, such Lender’s) obligations to maintain their respective outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans
(the “Affected Loans”) shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period
then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law and (4) the Affected Loans
shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates to a
Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by the Borrower Representative pursuant to a Borrowing
Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Borrower Representative shall have the option,
subject to the provisions of Section
73
2.18(c), to rescind such Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice as to all Lenders by
giving notice (by telefacsimile) to the Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, the Revolving
Administrative Agent) of such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its
determination as described above (which notice of rescission the Administrative Agent (or, if
applicable, the Revolving Administrative Agent) shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).
(c) Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest Periods. Each Borrower shall
compensate each Lender for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest
paid by such Lender to Lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans
and any loss, expense or liability sustained by such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-
employment of such funds but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain:
(i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan
does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Borrowing Notice, or a conversion to or continuation of
any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Conversion/Continuation
Notice; (ii) if any prepayment or other principal payment of, or any conversion of, any of its Eurodollar
Rate Loans occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan; or (iii) if
any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of
prepayment given by the applicable Borrower or the Borrower Representative. Such Lender shall
deliver to the Borrower Representative a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail any
amount or amounts such Lender is entitled to receive under this Section 2.18(c), which statement
shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such
Lender the amount shown as due on any such statement within five (5) Business Days after the
Borrower Representative’s receipt of such statement.
(d) Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans
at, to or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of such Lender.
(e) Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Calculation of all amounts payable to
a Lender under this Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19 shall be made as though such Lender had
actually funded each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar
deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a
maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit
from an offshore office of such Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United States of
America; provided, that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it
sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts
payable under this Section 2.18 and under Section 2.19.
Section 2.19 Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy.
(a) Compensation For Increased Costs and Taxes. In the event that any Lender (which term shall
include the Issuing Banks for purposes of this Section 2.19(a)) shall determine (which determination
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all
74
parties hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or
in the interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the introduction of any new law,
treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of a court or governmental
authority, in each case that becomes effective after the Restatement Date (a “Change in Law”), or
compliance by such Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the
Restatement Date by any central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law): (i) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve
(including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit,
compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements
with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate);
or (ii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting such
Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations hereunder or the London interbank market;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make,
making or maintaining Loans hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such
Lender (or its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, the applicable
Borrower shall within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the statement referred to in the next
sentence, pay such additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different
method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as
may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts
received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower Representative (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent (and, if applicable, the Revolving Administrative Agent)) a written
statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to
such Lender under this Section 2.19(a), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all
parties hereto absent manifest error.
(b) Capital Adequacy Adjustment. In the event that any Lender (which term shall include the Issuing
Banks for purposes of this Section 2.19(b)) shall have determined that a Change in Law after the
Restatement Date regarding capital adequacy, liquidity requirements, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its
applicable lending office) with any guideline, request or directive regarding capital adequacy or
liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority,
central bank or comparable agency, in each case, after the Restatement Date, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender’s Loans or Revolving Commitment or
Letters of Credit, or participations therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or
the Letters of Credit, to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling corporation could
have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance
(taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to
capital adequacy or liquidity requirements), then from time to time, within five (5) Business Days after
receipt by the Borrower Representative from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next
sentence, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as
shall compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an after-tax basis
75
for such reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower Representative (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent and, if applicable the Revolving Administrative Agent) a written statement,
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to Lender
under this Section 2.19(b), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
absent manifest error.
(c) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand
compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.19 shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the
Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.19 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six
(6) months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the
Borrower Representative of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and
of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six (6)-month
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(d) Dodd-Frank Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, publications, orders, guidelines and
directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith shall be deemed to have been adopted and
gone into effect after the Restatement Date regardless of when adopted, enacted or issued.
(e) Basel III. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all requests, rules, publications, orders,
guidelines and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign
regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to have been
adopted and gone into effect after the Restatement Date regardless of when adopted, enacted or
issued.
Section 2.20 Taxes; Withholding, Etc.
(a) Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by or on behalf of any Loan Party hereunder
and under other Loan Document shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of,
and without any deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Tax imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority.
(b) Withholding of Taxes. If any Loan Party or any other Person is required by law to make any
deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax from any sum paid or payable by or on behalf of
any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or any Lender (which term shall include the Issuing Bank
for purposes of this Section 2.20(b)) under any of the Loan Documents: (i) the Borrower
Representative shall notify the Administrative Agent and, if applicable the Revolving Administrative
Agent, of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as the Borrower
Representative becomes aware of it; (ii) the applicable Borrower shall pay any such Indemnified Tax
before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is
imposed on any Loan Party) for its own
76
account or (if that liability is imposed on the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent
or such Lender) on behalf of and in the name of the Administrative Agent, the Revolving
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be; (iii) the sum payable by such Loan Party in
respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the
extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of any deduction, withholding or payment (including
any deduction, withholding or payment on such increased amount) with respect to any Indemnified
Tax, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction,
withholding or payment been required or made; and (iv) within thirty (30) days after the due date of
payment of any Indemnified Tax which it is required by clause (ii) above to pay, the Borrower
Representative shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and, if applicable the Revolving
Administrative Agent evidence satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction, withholding
or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority.
(c) Evidence of Exemption From Withholding Tax. Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent, on or before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement and
thereafter when reasonably requested by either Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such forms,
documentation and other information as will permit payments to such Lender hereunder to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “Non-U.S. Lender”) shall, to the
extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower
Representative, (i) on or prior to the Restatement Date (in the case of each Existing Lender) or (ii) on
or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case
of each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the
Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its
discretion), (i) two (2) original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (claiming benefits of
an applicable tax treaty), W-8ECI, W-8EXP and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor forms),
properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under
the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the
Administrative Agent to establish that such Lender is not subject to (or is subject to a reduced rate of)
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to such
Lender under any of the Loan Documents or (ii) if such Lender is relying on the so-called “portfolio
interest exception,” a Certificate re Non-Bank Status together with two (2) original copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form), properly completed and duly executed by
such Lender, and such other documentation and information required under the Internal Revenue
Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent to
establish that such Lender is not subject to (or is subject to a reduced rate of) deduction or withholding
of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender under any of the
Loan Documents. Each Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for United States federal income tax purposes (a
“U.S. Lender”) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative on or prior to
the Restatement Date (or, if later, on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this
Agreement) two (2) original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any
77
successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, certifying that such U.S.
Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax, or otherwise prove that
it is entitled to such an exemption. Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other
evidence with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to this
Section 2.20(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms,
certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such
forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender
shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower Representative two
(2) new original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, W-8IMY
and/or W-9 (or, in each case, any successor form), or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two
(2) original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form), as the case
may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation and
information required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower
Representative or the Administrative Agent to confirm or establish that such Lender is not subject to
(or is subject to a reduced rate of) deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
respect to payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents, or notify the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower Representative of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other
evidence. No Borrower shall be required to pay any additional amount to any Non-U.S. Lender under
Section 2.20(b)(iii) if such Lender shall have failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other
evidence required by in the first sentence of this Section 2.20(c) or (2) to notify the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower Representative of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other
evidence, as the case may be; provided, that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of
this Section 2.20(c) on the Restatement Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to
which it became a Lender, as applicable, nothing in this last sentence of Section 2.20(c) shall relieve
any Borrower of its respective obligations to pay any additional amounts pursuant this Section 2.20 in
the event that, as a result of any Change in Law, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver
forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not
subject to withholding as described herein. Furthermore, if a payment made to a Lender under any
Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained
in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver
to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time
or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal
Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such
Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such
payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.20(c), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to
FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(d) Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.20(b), each Borrower shall timely pay all Other Taxes
to the relevant Governmental Authorities in accordance with applicable law. Each Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent official receipts or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in respect of any Other Taxes payable hereunder promptly
after payment of such Other Taxes.
78
(e) Each Borrower and Holdings shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Revolving Administrative Agent and any Lender (which term shall include Issuing Bank for purposes
of this Section 2.20(e)) for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes, in each case arising
in connection with payments made under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document (including any such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.20) paid by the Administrative Agent, the
Revolving Administrative Agent or Lender or any of their respective Affiliates and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Loan Party shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Such payment shall be due within thirty (30) days of such Loan
Party’s receipt of such certificate.
(f) If a Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent, in good faith and in its
sole discretion, receives a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including any additions to
tax, interest and penalties) with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts under this
Section 2.20, it shall pay over such refund to the applicable Borrower (including any additions to tax,
interest or penalties received with respect thereto), but only to the extent of additional amounts paid by
such Borrower under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving
rise to such refund, and net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or Agent
(including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund); provided that such Borrower, upon the
request of such Lender or Agent, agrees to repay as soon as reasonably practicable the amount paid
over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) to such Lender or Agent in the event such Lender or Agent is required to
repay such refund to a Governmental Authority. This Section 2.20(f) shall not be construed to require
any Lender or Agent to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
Section 2.21 Obligation to Mitigate. Each Lender (which term shall include the Issuing Banks for
purposes of this Section 2.21) agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender
responsible for administering its Loans or Letters of Credit, as the case may be, becomes aware of the
occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Lender to become an
Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive payments under Section 2.18, 2.19 or
2.20, it shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable
legal or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue, fund or maintain its Credit
Extensions, including any Affected Loans, through another office of such Lender or (b) take such other
measures as such Lender may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would
cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which
would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20 would
be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, the making, issuing,
funding or maintaining of such Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit through such other
79
office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely
affect such Revolving Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit or the interests of such Lender;
provided, that such Lender shall not be obligated to utilize such other office pursuant to this
Section 2.21 unless the Borrower Representative agrees to pay all incremental expenses incurred by
such Lender as a result of utilizing such other office as described above. A certificate as to the amount
of any such expenses payable by the Borrower Representative pursuant to this Section 2.21 (setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender to the
Borrower Representative (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.
Section 2.22 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if any obligations of any Lender to purchase participations in or otherwise refinance or
support any Swing Line Loans or Letters of Credit exist at the time any Revolving Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender (such Lender, a “Defaulting Revolving Lender”) then:
(a) all obligations of the applicable Defaulting Revolving Lender to purchase participations in or
otherwise refinance or support such Swing Line Loans and Letters of Credit shall be reallocated
among the non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders of the applicable Class in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share thereof, but only to the extent (i) (x) with respect to Swing Line Loans and
U.S. Letters of Credit, the sum of the non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders’ Pro Rata Shares of the Total
Utilization of U.S. Revolving Commitments plus such Defaulting Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share
of U.S. Revolving Exposure do not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders’ U.S.
Revolving Commitments, and (y) with respect to Canadian Letters of Credit, the sum of the non-
Defaulting Revolving Lenders’ Pro Rata Shares of the Total Utilization of Canadian Revolving
Commitments plus such Defaulting Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of Canadian Revolving
Exposure do not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders’ Canadian Revolving
Commitments and (ii) in each case, the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 are satisfied at such time;
(b) if the reallocation described in clause (a) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the
applicable Borrower shall (i) first, within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative
Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent, prepay any outstanding Swing Line Loans to the extent
the obligations of the applicable Defaulting Revolving Lender to purchase participations in or
otherwise refinance or support Swing Line Loans have not been reallocated pursuant to clause
(a) above and (ii) second, within three (3) Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent
or the Revolving Administrative Agent, cash collateralize such Defaulting Revolving Lender’s Pro
Rata Share of the obligations to purchase participations in or otherwise refinance or support Letters of
Credit (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (a) above) for so long as such
obligations are outstanding; and
(c) if the obligations of the applicable Defaulting Revolving Lender to purchase participations in or
otherwise refinance or support Letters of Credit are reallocated among the non-Defaulting Revolving
Lenders pursuant to clause (a) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11
shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders’ Pro Rata Shares.
80
Section 2.23 Removal or Replacement of a Lender. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, in the event that: (a) (i) any Lender (an “Increased-Cost Lender”) is or becomes an
Affected Lender or is or becomes entitled to receive payments under Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20 and
(ii) the circumstances which have caused such Lender to be an Affected Lender or which entitle such
Lender to receive such payments shall remain in effect; or (b) (i) any Lender shall become a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender’s default shall remain in effect and (iii) such Defaulting
Lender shall fail to cure the default as a result of which it has become a Defaulting Lender within five
(5) Business Days thereafter; or (c) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification,
termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions hereof as contemplated by
Section 10.05(b), the consent of Required Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or
more of such other Lenders (each a “Non-Consenting Lender”) whose consent is required shall not
have been obtained; then, with respect to each such Increased-Cost Lender, Defaulting Lender or
Non-Consenting Lender (the “Terminated Lender”), the Borrower Representative may, by giving
written notice to the Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so, elect to
cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its
outstanding Loans and its Revolving Commitments, if any, in full to one or more Eligible Assignees
(each a “Replacement Lender”) in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.06 and the Borrower
Representative shall pay the fees, if any, payable thereunder in connection with any such assignment
from an Increased-Cost Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender or a Defaulting Lender shall pay the fees, if
any, payable thereunder in connection with any such assignment from such Defaulting Lender;
provided, that (1) on the date of such assignment, the Replacement Lender shall pay to Terminated
Lender an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest
on, all outstanding Loans of the Terminated Lender, (B) an amount equal to all unreimbursed
drawings that have been funded by such Terminated Lender, together with all then unpaid interest
with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount equal to all accrued but theretofore unpaid fees
owing to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.11; (2) on the date of such assignment, the
applicable Borrower shall pay any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant to
Section 2.13(c), 2.18(c), 2.19 or 2.20; or otherwise as if it were a prepayment and (3) in the event such
Terminated Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time
of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Terminated Lender was a Non-
Consenting Lender; provided, that the Borrower Representative may not make such election with
respect to any Terminated Lender that is also an Issuing Bank unless, prior to the effectiveness of
such election, the Borrower Representative shall have caused each outstanding Letter of Credit
issued thereby to be cancelled. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender
and the termination of such Terminated Lender’s Revolving Commitment, if any, such Terminated
Lender shall no longer constitute a “Lender” for purposes hereof; provided, that any rights of such
Terminated Lender to indemnification hereunder shall survive as to such Terminated Lender. Each
Lender agrees that if the Borrower Representative exercises its option hereunder to cause an
assignment by such Lender as a Non-Consenting Lender or Terminated Lender, such Lender shall,
promptly after receipt of written notice of such election, execute and deliver all documentation
necessary to effectuate such assignment in accordance with Section 10.06. In the event that a Lender
does not comply with the requirements of the immediately preceding sentence within one
(1) Business Day after receipt of such notice, each Lender hereby authorizes and directs the
Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent (as applicable) to execute and deliver
such
81
documentation as may be required to give effect to an assignment in accordance with Section 10.06
on behalf of a Non-Consenting Lender, Defaulting Lender or Terminated Lender and any such
documentation so executed by the Administrative Agent shall be effective for purposes of
documenting an assignment pursuant to Section 10.06.
Section 2.24 Incremental Facilities. The Borrower Representative may by written notice to the
Administrative Agent elect to request (A) prior to the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, an
increase to the existing Revolving Commitments (any such increase, the “Incremental Revolving
Commitments”) and/or (B) the increase in or the establishment of one or more new term loan
commitments (the “Incremental Term Loan Commitments”), by an amount not in excess of the greater
of (i) $200,000,000 in the aggregate and not less than $10,000,000 individually (or such lesser
amount which shall be approved by the Administrative Agent or such lesser amount that shall
constitute the difference between $200,000,000 and all such Incremental Revolving Commitments
and Incremental Term Loan Commitments obtained prior to such date) and (ii) up to an additional
amount of Incremental Term Loans or increases to the Incremental Revolving Commitments so long
as the Secured Leverage Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis) is no more than 3.50:1.00, in each
case, with respect to any Incremental Revolving Commitments, assuming a borrowing of the
maximum amount of Loans available thereunder; provided that, in either case, Incremental Revolving
Commitments shall not exceed $50,000,000 in the aggregate. Each such notice shall specify (A) the
date (each, an “Increased Amount Date”) on which the Borrower Representative proposes that the
Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable, shall be
effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such
notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent and (B) the identity of each Lender or other Person that
is an Eligible Assignee (each, an “Incremental Revolving Loan Lender” or “Incremental Term Loan
Lender”, as applicable) to whom the Borrower Representative proposes any portion of such
Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable, be
allocated and the amounts of such allocations and any Lender approached to provide all or a portion
of the Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments may elect or
decline, in its sole discretion, to provide an Incremental Revolving Commitment or an Incremental
Term Loan Commitment, as applicable. Such Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental
Term Loan Commitments shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date; provided that
(1) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving
effect to such Incremental Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as
applicable; (2) both before and after giving effect to the making of any Incremental Term Loans, each
of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 shall be satisfied or waived; (3) the U.S. Borrower shall be in
compliance with the financial covenant set forth in Section 6.07 (assuming for this purpose that such
financial covenant is in effect) as of the last day of the most recently ended four Fiscal Quarter period
for which financial statements are available), after giving effect to such Incremental Revolving
Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable; (4) the Incremental Revolving
Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable, shall be effected pursuant to
one or more Joinder Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower Representative, the
Incremental Revolving Loan Lender or Incremental Term Loan Lender, as applicable, and the
Administrative Agent, and each of which shall be recorded in the Revolving Commitment Register or
the Term Loan Register, as applicable, and each Incremental Revolving Loan Lender and
Incremental Term Loan Lender shall be subject to the requirements set forth in
82
Section 2.20(c); (5) the Borrower Representative shall make (or cause to be made) any payments
required pursuant to Section 2.18(c) in connection with the Incremental Revolving Commitments or
Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable; and (6) the Borrower Representative shall
deliver or cause to be delivered any legal opinions or other documents (including modifications of
Mortgages and title insurance endorsements or policies) reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent in connection with any such transaction. Any Incremental Term Loans made on an Increased
Amount Date may be designated a separate series (a “Series”) of Incremental Term Loans for all
purposes of this Agreement or, if requested by the U.S. Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent, may be designated as an increase to an existing Class of Term Loans. If such
Incremental Term Loans are designated as an increase to an existing Class of Term Loans, the terms
and provisions of such Incremental Term Loans shall be identical to the Class of Term Loans so
increased.
On any Increased Amount Date on which Incremental Revolving Commitments are effected, subject
to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (a) each of the applicable Revolving Lenders
shall assign to each of the Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders, and each of the Incremental
Revolving Loan Lenders shall purchase from each of the applicable Revolving Loan Lenders, at the
principal amount thereof (together with accrued interest), such interests in the applicable Revolving
Loans outstanding on such Increased Amount Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving
effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Loans will be held by existing
applicable Revolving Loan Lenders and Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders ratably in accordance
with their Revolving Commitments after giving effect to the addition of such Incremental Revolving
Commitments to the Revolving Commitments, (b) each Incremental Revolving Commitment shall be
deemed for all purposes a Revolving Commitment and each Loan made thereunder (an “Incremental
Revolving Loan”) shall be deemed, for all purposes, a Revolving Loan and (c) each Incremental
Revolving Loan Lender shall become a Lender with respect to the Incremental Revolving
Commitment and all matters relating thereto.
On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Term Loan Commitments are effective,
subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each Incremental Term Loan
Lender shall make a Loan to the U.S. Borrower (an “Incremental Term Loan”) in an amount equal to
its Incremental Term Loan Commitment and (ii) each Incremental Term Loan Lender shall become a
Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Term Loan Commitment and the Incremental Term
Loans made pursuant thereto.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt of the Borrower
Representative’s notice of each Increased Amount Date and in respect thereof (y) the Incremental
Revolving Commitments and the Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders or the Series of Incremental
Term Loan Commitments and the Incremental Term Loan Lenders of such Series, as applicable and
(z) in the case of each notice to any applicable Revolving Loan Lender, the respective interests in
such Revolving Loan Lender’s Revolving Loans, in each case subject to the assignments
contemplated by this Section.
The terms and provisions of the Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Loan Commitments
shall be, except as otherwise set forth herein or in the Joinder Agreement, identical to the Term Loans
of the same Class (other than Incremental Term Loans). The terms
83
and provisions of the Incremental Revolving Loans shall be identical to the Revolving Loans;
provided that if the Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders require an interest rate in excess of the
interest rate or commitment fees in excess of the commitment fees then applicable to the Revolving
Loans or Revolving Commitments, the interest rate on the Revolving Loans and the commitment fees
on the Revolving Commitments shall be increased to equal such required rate without further consent
of the affected Lenders. In any event (i) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of all Incremental Term
Loans of any Series shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Revolving
Loans, the Tranche B-1 Term Loans or the Tranche B-2 Terms Loans (whichever is longer (except by
virtue of amortization of or prepayment of Indebtedness prior to such date of determination)) and, for
the avoidance of doubt, no Incremental Term Loans may be designated as an increase to the Tranche
B-1 Term Loans, (ii) the applicable Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date of each Series shall be no
shorter than the latest of the final maturity of the Revolving Loans, the Tranche B-1 Term Loans and
the Tranche B-2 Term Loans, and (iii) the yield applicable to the Incremental Term Loans of each
Series shall be determined by the applicable Borrower and the applicable new Lenders and shall be
set forth in each applicable Joinder Agreement; provided, however, that the yield applicable to the
Incremental Term Loans (after giving effect to all interest rate floors, upfront or similar fees or original
issue discount payable with respect to such Incremental Term Loans (but, excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any arranging, underwriting or similar fees) based on the assumed four-year
average life for the applicable facilities)) shall not be greater than the applicable interest rate
(including the Applicable Margin) payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as amended
through the date of such calculation with respect to the Term Loans (other than Incremental Term
Loans to the extent the terms governing such Incremental Term Loans do not so provide) plus
0.50% per annum. Each Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect
such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or
appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent to effect the provisions of this Section 2.24
(including that such Joinder Agreement may elect to have the Incremental Term Loans constitute part
of the same Class as those Term Loans made on the Restatement Date and the Administrative Agent
may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that all such Incremental Term
Loans be treated as the same Class as those Term Loans made on the Restatement Date for all
purposes under the Loan Documents (including to ensure that such Incremental Term Loans or
Incremental Revolving Loans share ratably in each payment made with respect to the Term Loans or
Revolving Loans, as applicable)). If the yield applicable to the Incremental Term Loans exceeds the
applicable interest rate with respect to the existing Term Loans by more than 0.50% per annum, the
applicable interest rate with respect to the existing Term Loans shall be increased (without further
consent of the affected Lenders) so that such yield is not more than 0.50% per annum in excess of
such rate.
Section 2.25 Appointment of Borrower Representative. Each Borrower hereby appoints the Borrower
Representative as its agent, attorney-in-fact and representative for the purpose of (i) making any
borrowing requests or other requests required under this Agreement, (ii) the giving and receipt of
notices by and to Borrowers under this Agreement, (iii) the delivery of all documents, reports, financial
statements and written materials required to be delivered by Borrowers under this Agreement, and
(iv) all other purposes incidental to any of the foregoing. Each Borrower agrees that any action taken
by the Borrower Representative as the agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of the Borrowers
shall be binding upon each Borrower to the same extent as if directly taken by such Borrower.

Section 4.20 Employee Benefit Plans. Holdings, each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable provisions and
requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have performed in all
material respects all their obligations under each Employee Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit
Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that such Employee
Benefit Plan is so qualified or is maintained pursuant to a prototype or volume submitter plan for
which it relies on the IRS opinion or advisory letter and to the knowledge of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries nothing has occurred subsequent to the issuance of such determination letter which
would cause such Employee Benefit Plan to lose its qualified status. No liability to the PBGC (other
than required premium payments), has been or is expected to be incurred by Holdings, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. No
ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that could reasonably be expected to

Revenue Code or similar state laws, no liability exists under any Employee Benefit Plan that provides
health or welfare benefits (through the purchase of insurance or otherwise) for any retired or former
employee of Holdings, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates except for
liabilities that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The present value
of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each Pension Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by Holdings, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates (determined as of the
end of the most recent plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial valuation for such Pension Plan) did not exceed the aggregate
current fair market value of the assets of such Pension Plan except
93
when such excess could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the
most recent valuation date for each Multiemployer Plan, the potential liability of Holdings, its
Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete or partial withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan (within the meaning of Section 4203 or Section 4205 of ERISA), when
aggregated with such potential liability for a complete or partial withdrawal from all Multiemployer
Plans could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except for instances of
non-compliance or default which could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, Holdings, each of its Subsidiaries and each of their ERISA Affiliates have complied with the
requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with respect to each Multiemployer Plan and are not in
“default” (as defined in Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer
Plan.

incurrence of any Obligation by any Loan Party on any date on which this representation and warranty
is made, shall be, Solvent.
Section 4.22 Compliance with Statutes, Etc. Each of Holdings and its Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all applicable statutes, regulations and orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, all
Governmental Authorities, in respect of the conduct of its business and the ownership of its assets
and property (including compliance with Environmental Law with respect to any Real Estate Asset or
governing its business and the requirements of any Governmental Authorizations issued under any
Environmental Law with respect to any such Real Estate Asset or the operations of Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries), except such non-compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 4.23 Disclosure. No representation or warranty of any Loan Party contained in any Loan
Document or in any other documents, certificates or written statements furnished to any Agent or
Lender by or on behalf of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact (known to Holdings or the Borrower Representative, in the case of any document not
furnished by either of them) necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same were made. Any projections and pro forma
financial information contained in such materials are based upon good faith estimates and
assumptions believed by Holdings and the Borrower Representative to be reasonable at the time
made, it being recognized by Lenders that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as
facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may differ
from the projected results and such differences may be material.
Section 4.24 PATRIOT Act.

Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, and each of the foreign assets control regulations of the

enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto, and (ii) the PATRIOT Act. No part of the
proceeds of the Loans shall be used, directly or indirectly, for any
94

candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or
direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended.
(b) To the knowledge of the Borrowers, no Loan Party or any Subsidiary of such Loan Party, is (i) a
person on the list of “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons” or (ii) currently subject to
any U.S. sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury
Department (“OFAC”). The proceeds of the Loans or the Letters of Credit will not be used for the
purpose of financing the activities of any person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered
by OFAC.
Section 4.25 Intellectual Property. Except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each of the Loan Parties owns, or is licensed to use,
all Intellectual Property necessary for or used in the conduct of its business as currently conducted,
(ii) no claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the
ownership, registration or use of any Intellectual Property of the Loan Parties or the validity or
effectiveness of any Intellectual Property of the Loan Parties, nor does any Loan Party know of any
valid basis for any such claim and (iii) the use of Intellectual Property by each of the Loan Parties

efforts to coordinate any visits or inspections made pursuant to this Section 5.06 so as to minimize
inconvenience to the Loan Parties.

been made subject to the Lien of the Security Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of Secured Parties, at the time of the acquisition thereof (or within a reasonable time after the

inability of such Loan Party to obtain a landlord’s consent and/or a Record Document following
commercially reasonable efforts to do so, and the concurrent inability of such Loan Party to deliver a
Mortgage encumbering such Material Real Estate Asset which is a Leasehold Property shall not be
deemed to be a failure to satisfy this Section 5.11(a). In addition to the foregoing, in the case of the

such appraisals as are required by law or regulation of Real Estate Assets with respect to which the

of Environmental Laws or a release of Hazardous Materials at the Real Estate Asset.

ARTICLE VII.
GUARANTY
Section 7.01 Guaranty of the Obligations. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.02, Guarantors
(including with respect to the Obligations of the Canadian Borrower, the U.S. Borrower) jointly and
severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guaranty to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
benefit of the Beneficiaries the due and punctual Payment in Full of all Obligations other than any
Excluded Swap Obligations when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required
prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or
117
otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under
Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)) (collectively, the “Guaranteed
Obligations”). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Excluded Foreign Subsidiary
(including, without limitation, the Canadian Borrower (for so long as it is an Excluded Foreign
Subsidiary)) guaranty the Obligations of the U.S. Borrower or of any other Domestic Subsidiary that is
a Loan Party.
Section 7.02 Contribution by Guarantors. All Guarantors desire to allocate among themselves
(collectively, the “Contributing Guarantors”), in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising
under this Guaranty. Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by a
Guarantor (a “Funding Guarantor”) under this Guaranty such that its Aggregate Payments exceeds its
Fair Share as of such date, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the
other Contributing Guarantors in an amount sufficient to cause each Contributing Guarantor’s
Aggregate Payments to equal its Fair Share as of such date. “Fair Share” means, with respect to a
Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (a) the ratio of (i) the Fair
Share Contribution Amount with respect to such Contributing Guarantor to (ii) the aggregate of the
Fair Share Contribution Amounts with respect to all Contributing Guarantors multiplied by (b) the
aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such date by all Funding Guarantors under this
Guaranty in respect of the obligations Guaranteed. “Fair Share Contribution Amount” means, with
respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, the maximum aggregate amount
of the obligations of such Contributing Guarantor under this Guaranty that would not render its
obligations hereunder or thereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance
under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any comparable applicable provisions of
state law; provided, that solely for purposes of calculating the “Fair Share Contribution Amount” with
respect to any Contributing Guarantor for purposes of this Section 7.02, any assets or liabilities of
such Contributing Guarantor arising by virtue of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnification or any rights to or obligations of contribution hereunder shall not be considered as
assets or liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor. “Aggregate Payments” means, with respect to a
Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (1) the aggregate amount
of all payments and distributions made on or before such date by such Contributing Guarantor in
respect of this Guaranty (including in respect of this Section 7.02), minus (2) the aggregate amount of
all payments received on or before such date by such Contributing Guarantor from the other
Contributing Guarantors as contributions under this Section 7.02. The amounts payable as
contributions hereunder shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment or
distribution is made by the applicable Funding Guarantor. The allocation among Contributing
Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this Section 7.02 shall not be construed in any way to
limit the liability of any Contributing Guarantor hereunder. Each Guarantor is a third party beneficiary
to the contribution agreement set forth in this Section 7.02.
Section 7.03 Payment by Guarantors. Subject to Section 7.02, Guarantors hereby jointly and severally
agree, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Beneficiary
may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of any
Borrower to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether
at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including
amounts that would become due but for the operation of the
118
automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)), Guarantors shall
upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in Cash, to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of
Beneficiaries, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guaranteed
Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations
(including interest which, but for a Borrower becoming the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy
Code, would have accrued on such Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed
against any such Borrower for such interest in the related bankruptcy case) and all other Guaranteed
Obligations then owed to Beneficiaries as aforesaid.
Section 7.04 Liability of Guarantors Absolute. Each Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder
are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than
Payment in Full of the Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality
thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows:
(a) this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and not of collectability. This Guaranty is a
primary obligation of each Guarantor and not merely a contract of surety;
(b) the Administrative Agent may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between any Borrower and any Beneficiary with respect
to the existence of such Event of Default;
(c) the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any Borrower
and the obligations of any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the obligations of any
Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such Guarantor
whether or not any action is brought against any Borrower or any of such other guarantors and
whether or not any Borrower is joined in any such action or actions;
(d) payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not all, of the Guaranteed Obligations shall in no way
limit, affect, modify or abridge any Guarantor’s liability for any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations
which has not been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent is
awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any Guarantor’s covenant to pay a portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release such Guarantor from its
covenant to pay the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations that is not the subject of such suit, and such
judgment shall not, except to the extent satisfied by such Guarantor, limit, affect, modify or abridge any
other Guarantor’s liability hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(e) any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without
affecting the validity or enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment,
discharge or termination of any Guarantor’s liability hereunder, from time to time may (i) renew,
extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or
terms of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or
accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the
payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the Guaranteed
Obligations and take and hold security for the
119
payment hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substitute,
compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any
security for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person (including any other Guarantor) with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit
of such Beneficiary in respect hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations and direct the order or manner of
sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that such Beneficiary may have against any such
security, in each case as such Beneficiary in its discretion may determine consistent herewith or the
applicable Hedge Agreements and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any
such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any
such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates to impair or extinguish
any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against any
Borrower or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights available to
it under the Loan Documents or any Hedge Agreements; and
(f) this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall
not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other
than Payment in Full of the Obligations), including the occurrence of any of the following, whether or
not any Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to
assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of
court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any
right, power or remedy (whether arising under the Loan Documents or any Hedge Agreements, at law,
in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto,
or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the
terms or provisions (including provisions relating to events of default) hereof, any of the other Loan
Documents, any of the Hedge Agreements or any agreement or instrument executed pursuant thereto,
or of any other guaranty or security for the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case whether or not in
accordance with the terms hereof or such Loan Document, such Hedge Agreement or any agreement
relating to such other guaranty or security; (iii) the Guaranteed Obligations, or any agreement relating
thereto, at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the
application of payments received from any source (other than payments received pursuant to the other
Loan Documents or any of the Hedge Agreements or from the proceeds of any security for the
Guaranteed Obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness
other than the Guaranteed Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the Guaranteed
Obligations, even though any Beneficiary might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all
of the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) any Beneficiary’s consent to the change, reorganization or
termination of the corporate structure or existence of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries and to any
corresponding restructuring of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue
perfection of a security interest in any collateral which secures any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(vii) any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which any Borrower may allege or assert against any
Beneficiary in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of
warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury; and
(viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might in any
manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations.
120
Section 7.05 Waivers by Guarantors. Each Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of Beneficiaries:
(a) any right to require any Beneficiary, as a condition of payment or performance by such Guarantor,
to (i) proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from
any Borrower, any such other guarantor or any other Person, (iii) proceed against or have resort to
any balance of any Deposit Account or credit on the books of any Beneficiary in favor of any Borrower
or any other Person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Beneficiary whatsoever;
(b) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense
of any Borrower or any other Guarantor including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of
validity or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating
thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of any Borrower or any other Guarantor from any
cause other than Payment in Full of the Obligations; (c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of
law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other
respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (d) any defense based upon any Beneficiary’s
errors or omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed Obligations, except behavior which
amounts to bad faith; (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or
might be in conflict with the terms hereof and any legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor’s
obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor’s liability
hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and
(iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Beneficiary protect, secure, perfect or insure
any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentments,
protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including
acceptance hereof, notices of default hereunder, the Hedge Agreements or any agreement or
instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to any Borrower and
notices of any of the matters referred to in Section 7.04 and any right to consent to any thereof; and
(g) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or
exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms hereof.
Section 7.06 Guarantors’ Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, Etc. Until the Obligations shall have
been Paid in Full, each Guarantor hereby waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that
such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor or any of
its assets in connection with this Guaranty or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations
hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by
statute, under common law or otherwise and including (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower with respect
to the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy
that any Beneficiary now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower, and (c) any benefit of, and
any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary. In
addition, until the Obligations shall have been Paid in Full, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of
any right of contribution such Guarantor may have against any other guarantor (including any other
121
Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any such right of contribution as contemplated by
Section 7.02. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the
exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth
herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of
subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against any Borrower or
against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such Guarantor may have against any
such other guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Beneficiary may have against
any Borrower, to all right, title and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such collateral or security,
and to any right any Beneficiary may have against such other guarantor. If any amount shall be paid to
any Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution
rights at any time when all Obligations shall not have been Paid in Full, such amount shall be held in
trust for the Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the
Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 7.07 Subordination of Other Obligations. Any Indebtedness of any Borrower or any Guarantor
now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (the “Obligee Guarantor”) is hereby subordinated in right of
payment to the Guaranteed Obligations, and any such Indebtedness collected or received by the
Obligee Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for
the Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the
Guaranteed Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the
Obligee Guarantor under any other provision hereof.
Section 7.08 Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in effect
until all of the Obligations shall have been Paid in Full. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives
any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.
Section 7.09 Authority of Guarantors or the Borrowers. It is not necessary for any Beneficiary to
inquire into the capacity or powers of any Guarantor or any Borrower or the officers, directors or any
agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any of them.
Section 7.10 Financial Condition of the Borrowers. Any Credit Extension may be made to any
Borrower or continued from time to time, and any Hedge Agreements may be entered into from time to
time, in each case without notice to or authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or
other condition of such Borrower at the time of any such grant or continuation or at the time such
Hedge Agreement is entered into, as the case may be. No Beneficiary shall have any obligation to
disclose or discuss with any Guarantor its assessment, or any Guarantor’s assessment, of the
financial condition of any Borrower. Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from
the Borrowers on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of the Borrowers and their
ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents and Hedge Agreements, and each
Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of the
Borrowers and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed
Obligations. Each
122
Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of any Beneficiary to disclose any
matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of any Borrower now known or
hereafter known by any Beneficiary.
Section 7.11 Bankruptcy, Etc.
(a) So long as any Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding, no Guarantor shall, without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions of Required Lenders,
commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency
case or proceeding of or against any Borrower or any other Guarantor. The obligations of Guarantors
hereunder shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by
any case or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership,
reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of any Borrower or any other Guarantor or by any defense
which any Borrower or any other Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of
any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.
(b) Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any case or proceeding referred to in
clause (a) above (or, if interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by
operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case or proceeding, such interest as would
have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations if such case or proceeding had not been
commenced) shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it is the intention of Guarantors
and Beneficiaries that the Guaranteed Obligations which are guaranteed by Guarantors pursuant
hereto should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve any
Borrower of any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantors shall permit any trustee in
bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar Person to
pay the Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of the Administrative Agent in respect of, any such
interest accruing after the date on which such case or proceeding is commenced.
(c) In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid by the applicable
Borrower, the obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or
be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or
recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise,
and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations
for all purposes hereunder.
Section 7.12 Discharge of Guaranty Upon Sale of Guarantor. If all of the Equity Interests of any
Guarantor or any of its successors in interest hereunder shall be sold or otherwise disposed of
(including by merger or consolidation) in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, the
Guaranty of such Guarantor or such successor in interest, as the case may be, hereunder shall
automatically be discharged and released without any further action by any Beneficiary or any other
Person effective as of the time of such Asset Sale.
123

relating to such item(s) of Indebtedness, in each case beyond the grace period, if any, provided

Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of such holder or holders), to cause, that Indebtedness to
become or be declared due and payable (or redeemable) prior to its stated maturity or the stated
maturity of any underlying obligation, as the case may be; provided, that clause (ii) of this

Lender will be permitted to exercise any remedies with respect to an Event of Default in respect of the
financial covenant set forth in Section 6.07 until the date, if any, on which the Revolving Commitments
have been terminated and the Revolving Loans have been accelerated as a result of such breach of
the covenant set forth in Section 6.07; or
(d) Breach of Representations, Etc. (i) Any Specified Representation or any Company Representation
shall prove to have been inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) any representation or warranty in
Article IV (other than those included in the foregoing clause (i)), was inaccurate as of the Restatement
Date in any material respect (provided that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any
representations and warranties that are already qualified by materiality or material adverse effect in
the text thereof); provided further that such inaccuracy will not be an Event of Default hereunder if
within 30 days of the Restatement Date,
124
reasonable steps are being taken so as to remedy such Default within such period and such
inaccuracy is remedied within such period and (iii) at any time after the Restatement Date, any
representation, warranty, certification or other statement made or deemed made by any Loan Party in
any Loan Document or in any statement or certificate at any time given by any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries in writing pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall be false
in any material respect as of the date made or deemed made or, to the extent that any such

adverse effect in the text thereof, such representation, warranty, certification or other statement shall
be false in any respect as of the date made or deemed made; or

compliance with any term contained herein or any of the other Loan Documents, other than any such

under any applicable federal or state law; or (ii) an involuntary case shall be commenced against
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other applicable

Section 8.02 Right to Cure. (a) In the event that the U.S. Borrower fails to comply with the covenant
set forth in Section 6.07 and, within ten (10) Business Days thereof if (i) Holdings issues Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Equity Interests) for cash or otherwise receive cash contributions on
account of its existing Equity Interests (the “Specified Equity Contribution”) and the net cash proceeds
from such issuance or contribution (the “Cure Amount”) are contributed to the U.S. Borrower) and
(ii) upon the receipt by the U.S. Borrower of such Cure Amount, the Loans are prepaid in an amount
equal to the Cure Amount pursuant to Section 2.14(f), then, the covenant set forth in such Section 6.07
shall be recalculated, giving effect to a pro forma increase to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for such
four fiscal quarter period in an amount equal to the Cure Amount, but without giving effect to such
prepayment of Loans. Any such pro forma adjustment to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA shall be
provided solely for the purpose of determining the existence of a Default or an Event of Default under
the covenant set forth in Section 6.07 with respect to any four fiscal quarter period that includes the
fiscal quarter for which such Specified Equity Contribution was exercised (and with respect to each
such fiscal quarter, such prepayment shall not be given effect) and not for any other purpose under
any Loan Document.
(b) If, after the exercise of the Specified Equity Contribution and the recalculations pursuant to clause
(a) above, Holdings shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the covenant set forth in
Section 6.07 during such four fiscal quarter period, Holdings shall be deemed to have satisfied the
requirements of such covenant as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though
there had been no failure to comply therewith at
127
such date, and the applicable Default or Event of Default under Section 8.01 that had occurred shall
be deemed cured; provided that during the term of this Agreement (i) the Specified Equity Contribution
shall be exercised in no more than two (2) Fiscal Quarters in each four consecutive fiscal quarter
period, (ii) the Specified Equity Contribution shall be exercised no more than four (4) times, (iii) with
respect to any exercise of the Specified Equity Contribution, the Cure Amount shall be no greater than
the amount required to cause Holdings to be in compliance with the covenant set forth in
Section 6.07, (iv) such Specified Equity Contribution may only be exercised from the date on which
financial statements are required to be delivered with respect to the then-applicable fiscal quarter until
the expiration of the tenth Business Day after such date, (v) other than for purposes of Section 3.02,
no Event of Default under Section 6.07 shall be deemed to have occurred until the aforementioned
tenth Business Day occurs without exercise of the Specified Equity Contribution, (vi) the increase to
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA represented by the exercise of the Specified Equity Contribution shall
be solely for the purpose of curing the failure to comply with the financial covenant set forth in
Section 6.07 and not for any other purpose, including the calculation of determining pricing, financial
ratio based conditions or any basket amount or exception otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
(vii) the proceeds of any such Specified Equity Contribution shall have been contributed to the U.S.
Borrower as cash equity and (viii) there shall be no pro forma reduction in Indebtedness with the
proceeds of any Specified Equity Contribution for determining compliance with Section 6.07 in the
quarter in which such Specified Equity Contribution is made.
ARTICLE IX.
AGENTS
Section 9.01 Appointment of Agents. KeyBank is hereby appointed the Syndication Agent hereunder,
and each Lender hereby authorizes KeyBank to act as the Syndication Agent in accordance with the
terms hereof and the other Loan Documents. Barclays Bank is hereby appointed the Administrative
Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents and each Lender hereby authorizes Barclays Bank to act as the Administrative
Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms
hereof and the other Loan Documents. PNC Bank and Wells Fargo Securities are hereby appointed
the Co-Documentation Agents hereunder, and each Lender hereby authorizes PNC Bank and Wells
Fargo Securities to act as the Co-Documentation Agents in accordance with the terms hereof and the
other Loan Documents. Each Agent hereby agrees to act in its capacity as such upon the express
conditions contained herein and the other Loan Documents, as applicable. The provisions of this
Article IX (other than as expressly provided herein) are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the
Lenders and no Loan Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions of
this Article IX (other than as expressly provided herein). In performing its functions and duties
hereunder, each Agent shall act solely as an agent of the Lenders and does not assume and shall not
be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries. The Syndication Agent and each of the Co-Documentation
Agents, without consent of or notice to any party hereto, may assign any and all of their respective
rights or obligations hereunder to any of their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, each of the Arrangers, the
Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent and the Co-Documentation Agents are named as such for
recognition purposes only, and in their respective
128
capacities as such shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document; it being understood and agreed that each of the Arrangers, the
Bookrunners, Syndication Agent and the Co-Documentation Agents shall be entitled to all
indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Agents provided herein and in the other Loan
Documents and all of the other benefits of this Article IX. Without limitation of the foregoing, none of
the Arrangers, the Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent nor the Co-Documentation Agents in their
respective capacities as such shall, by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, have
any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, Loan Party or any other Person.
Section 9.02 Powers and Duties. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent to take such action
on such Lender’s behalf and to exercise such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated or granted to such Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers, rights and remedies as are reasonably incidental thereto. In the
event that any obligations (other than the Obligations) are permitted to be incurred hereunder and
secured by Liens permitted to be incurred hereunder on all or a portion of the Collateral, each Lender
authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into intercreditor agreements, subordination agreements
and amendments to the Security Documents to reflect such arrangements on terms acceptable to the
Administrative Agent. Each Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities that are expressly
specified herein and the other Loan Documents. Each Agent may exercise such powers, rights and
remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or employees. No Agent shall have, by
reason hereof or any of the other Loan Documents, a fiduciary relationship or other implied duties in
respect of any Lender; and nothing herein or any of the other Loan Documents, expressed or implied,
is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon any Agent any obligations in respect hereof
or any of the other Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Agreement and in the other
Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied
(or express) obligations arising under the agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is
used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties.
Section 9.03 General Immunity.
(a) No Responsibility for Certain Matters. No Agent shall be responsible to any Lender for the
execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency hereof or
any other Loan Document, or for the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien, or for any
representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or
oral statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or certificates or any other
documents furnished or made by any Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf of any Loan Party or to
any Agent or Lender in connection with the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated
thereby or for the financial condition or business affairs of any Loan Party or any other Person liable
for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall any Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements
contained in any of the Loan Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or as to the
existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Default or as to the value or sufficiency of
any Collateral or as to the satisfaction of
129
any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein (other than confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to such Agent) or to inspect the properties, books or records of Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries or to make any disclosures with respect to the foregoing. Anything contained
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Revolving
Administrative Agent shall have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of outstanding
Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts thereof.
(b) Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent nor any of its officers, partners, directors, employees or agents
shall be liable to the Lenders (i) for any action taken or omitted by any Agent (A) under or in
connection with any of the Loan Documents or (B) with the consent or at the request of the Required
Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders
specified by this Agreement) except to the extent caused by such Agent’s gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or
(ii) for any failure of any Loan Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document. No Agent shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents,
have any duty to disclose or be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any
Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by such Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity. Each Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any
action (including the failure to take an action) in connection herewith or any of the other Loan
Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or
thereunder unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof from
Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under
Section 10.05) and, upon receipt of such instructions from Required Lenders (or such other Lenders,
as the case may be), such Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or
to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions and shall not be
required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to
liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law. Without prejudice to the generality
of the foregoing, (i) each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be
protected in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Holdings and
its Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a result of such Agent acting or
(where so instructed) refraining from acting hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents in
accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to
give such instructions under Section 10.05).
(c) Delegation of Duties. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under
this Agreement or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by it. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and
powers by or through their respective Affiliates. The exculpatory, indemnification and other provisions
of this Section 9.03 and of Section 9.06 shall apply to any of the Affiliates of the Administrative Agent,
the Revolving Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the
130
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities of the Administrative Agent,
Revolving Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable. All of the rights, benefits, and
privileges (including the exculpatory and indemnification provisions) of this Section 9.03 and of
Section 9.06 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of any such sub-agent, and shall
apply to their respective activities as sub-agent as if such sub-agent and Affiliates were named herein.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to each sub-agent appointed by the
Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent, (i) such sub-agent shall be a third party
beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such rights, benefits and privileges (including
exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third
party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such rights, benefits and
privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or
joinder of any other Person, against any or all of Loan Parties and the Lenders, (ii) such rights,
benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) shall not be
modified or amended without the consent of such sub-agent, and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have
obligations to the Administrative Agent or, as applicable, the Revolving Administrative Agent, and not
to any Loan Party, Lender or any other Person and no Loan Party, Lender or any other Person shall
have any rights, directly or indirectly, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, against such sub-agent.
(d) Notice of Default or Event of Default. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default
or Event of Default unless and until written notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given
to such Agent by a Loan Party or a Lender. In the event that the Administrative Agent or the Revolving
Administrative Agent shall receive such a notice, the Administrative Agent or the Revolving
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders, provided that failure to give such notice
shall not result in any liability on the part of the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative
Agent.
Section 9.04 Agents Entitled to Act as Lender. The agency hereby created shall in no way impair or
affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, any Agent in its
individual capacity as a Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the
Letters of Credit, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder in its capacity as a
Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as if it were not performing the duties and
functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term “Lender” shall, unless the context clearly otherwise
indicates, include each Agent in its individual capacity. Any Agent and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory or other business with Holdings or any of its Affiliates as if it were not performing the
duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any Borrower for services
in connection herewith and otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that pursuant to such activities, the Agents or their Affiliates may receive information
regarding any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party (including information that may be subject
to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the
Agents and their Affiliates shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.
131
Section 9.05 Lenders’ Representations, Warranties and Acknowledgment.
(a) Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own independent investigation of the
financial condition and affairs of Holdings and its Subsidiaries in connection with Credit Extensions
hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness
of Holdings and its Subsidiaries. No Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its
possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have
any responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to
Lenders.
(b) Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement, an Assignment Agreement or a
Joinder Agreement and funding its Loans on the Original Closing Date or Restatement Date, as
applicable, or by the funding of any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Loans, as the
case may be, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved,
each Loan Document and each other document required to be approved by any Agent, Required
Lenders or Lenders, as applicable on the Original Closing Date or Restatement Date, as applicable,
or as of the date of funding of such Loans.
Section 9.06 Right to Indemnity. Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally agrees to
indemnify each Agent, to the extent that such Agent shall not have been reimbursed by any Loan
Party (and without limiting its obligation to do so), for and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and
disbursements) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or
performing its duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity as
such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents;
provided, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such
Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction. If any indemnity furnished to any Agent for any purpose shall, in the
opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call for additional
indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional
indemnity is furnished; provided, that in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to indemnify
any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense
or disbursement in excess of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof; and provided, further, that this
sentence shall not be deemed to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability,
obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement described in
the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence.
Section 9.07 Successor Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Swing Line Lender.
(a) The Administrative Agent shall have the right to resign at any time by giving prior written notice
thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower Representative, and, if the Administrative Agent is deemed
insolvent or becomes the subject of an insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization proceeding, or if the Administrative Agent or any substantial part of its property
becomes the subject of an appointment of a receiver, intervenor or
132
conservator, or a trustee or similar officer becomes the subject of a bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy
Code or under any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or hereafter in effect,
the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time thereafter by an instrument or concurrent
instruments in writing delivered to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent and
signed by Required Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall have the right to appoint a financial
institution to act as the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent hereunder, subject to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower Representative and the Required Lenders, and the
Administrative Agent’s resignation shall become effective on the earlier of (i) the acceptance of such
successor the Administrative Agent by the Borrower Representative and the Required Lenders or
(ii) the thirtieth day after such notice of resignation. Upon any such notice of resignation or any such
removal, if a successor the Administrative Agent has not already been appointed by the retiring the
Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days’ notice
to the Borrower Representative, to appoint a successor the Administrative Agent; provided that so
long as no Default or Event of Default exists, such appointment shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Borrower Representative. If neither Required Lenders nor the Administrative Agent have appointed a
successor Administrative Agent, then the Required Lenders shall be deemed to have succeeded to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring the Administrative
Agent; provided, that until a successor the Administrative Agent is so appointed by Required Lenders
or the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent, by notice to the Borrower Representative and
Required Lenders, may retain its role as the Collateral Agent under any Security Document. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor the
Administrative Agent, that successor the Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed the
Administrative Agent and the retiring or removed the Administrative Agent shall promptly (i) transfer to
such successor the Administrative Agent all sums, Securities and other items of Collateral held under
the Security Documents, together with all records and other documents necessary or appropriate in
connection with the performance of the duties of the successor the Administrative Agent under the
Loan Documents, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor the Administrative Agent such
amendments to financing statements, and take such other actions, as may be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the assignment to such successor the Administrative Agent of the
security interests created under the Security Documents, whereupon such retiring or removed the
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. Except as
provided above, any resignation or removal of Barclays Bank or its successor as the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute the resignation or removal of Barclays Bank or its
successor as the Collateral Agent. After any retiring or removed the Administrative Agent’s
resignation or removal hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative
Agent hereunder. Any successor the Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to this Section shall,
upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor the Collateral Agent for all purposes
hereunder. If Barclays Bank or its successor as the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section has
resigned as the Administrative Agent but retained its role as the Collateral Agent and no successor
the Collateral Agent has become the Collateral Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, Barclays Bank or its successor may resign as the Collateral Agent upon notice to the
Borrower Representative and Required Lenders at any time.
133
(b) In addition to the foregoing, the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days’
prior written notice thereof to Lenders and the Borrower Representative. The Administrative Agent
shall have the right to appoint a financial institution as the Collateral Agent hereunder, subject to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower Representative and the Required Lenders and the Collateral
Agent’s resignation shall become effective on the earlier of (i) the acceptance of such successor
Collateral Agent by the Borrower Representative and the Required Lenders or (ii) the thirtieth day
after such notice of resignation. Upon any such notice of resignation, Required Lenders shall have the
right, upon five (5) Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, to appoint a successor
Collateral Agent provided that so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, such appointment shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower Representative. Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as the Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, that the successor Collateral
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the Security Documents, and the
retiring Collateral Agent under this Agreement shall promptly (i) transfer to such successor Collateral
Agent all sums, Securities and other items of Collateral held hereunder or under the Security
Documents, together with all records and other documents necessary or appropriate in connection
with the performance of the duties of the successor Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the
Security Documents, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Collateral Agent or otherwise
authorize the filing of such amendments to financing statements, and take such other actions, as may
be necessary or appropriate in connection with the assignment to such successor Collateral Agent of
the security interests created under the Security Documents, whereupon such retiring Collateral
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the Security
Documents. After any retiring Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder as the Collateral Agent, the
provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement or the Security Documents while it was the
Collateral Agent hereunder.
(c) The Revolving Administrative Agent shall have the right to resign at any time by giving prior written
notice thereof to the Revolving Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative.
The Revolving Administrative Agent shall have the right to appoint a financial institution to act as the
Revolving Administrative Agent hereunder, subject to the reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower
Representative and the Required Revolving Lenders, and the Revolving Administrative Agent’s
resignation shall become effective on the earlier of (i) the acceptance of such successor Revolving
Administrative Agent by the Borrower Representative and the Required Revolving Lenders or (ii) the
thirtieth day after such notice of resignation. Upon any such notice of resignation, if a successor
Revolving Administrative Agent has not already been appointed by the retiring Revolving
Administrative Agent, Required Revolving Lenders shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days’
notice to the Borrower Representative, to appoint a successor Revolving Administrative Agent;
provided that so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, such appointment shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower Representative. If neither Required Revolving Lenders nor the Revolving
Administrative Agent have appointed a successor Revolving Administrative Agent, then the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have succeeded to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent. After any retiring Revolving
Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder as the Revolving Administrative Agent, the provisions of
this Section 9.07 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was the
134
Revolving Administrative Agent hereunder. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the
Revolving Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Revolving Administrative Agent, that
successor Revolving Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Revolving Administrative Agent whereupon such
retiring Revolving Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.
(d) Any resignation or removal of PNC Bank or its successor as the Revolving Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Section shall also constitute the resignation or removal of PNC Bank or its successor
as the Swing Line Lender, and any successor Revolving Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to
this Section shall, upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Swing Line
Lender for all purposes hereunder. In such event (i) the U.S. Borrower shall prepay any outstanding
Swing Line Loans made by the retiring or removed Revolving Administrative Agent in its capacity as
Swing Line Lender, (ii) upon such prepayment, the retiring or removed Revolving Administrative
Agent and Swing Line Lender shall surrender any Swing Line Note held by it to the U.S. Borrower for
cancellation and (iii) the U.S. Borrower shall issue, if so requested by the successor Revolving
Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender, a new Swing Line Note to the successor Revolving
Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender, in the principal amount of the Swing Line Sublimit
then in effect and with other appropriate insertions.
Section 9.08 Security Documents and Guaranty.
(a) Agents under Security Documents and Guaranty. Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes
the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable,
on behalf of and for the benefit of Secured Parties, to be the agent for and representative of Secured
Parties with respect to the Guaranty, the Collateral and the Security Documents; provided, that neither
the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall owe any
fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of care, duty of disclosure or any other obligation whatsoever to any
holder of Obligations with respect to any Hedge Agreement. Subject to Section 10.05, without further
written consent or authorization from any Secured Party, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable may execute any documents or
instruments necessary to (i) in connection with a sale or disposition of assets permitted by this
Agreement, release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of such sale or
other disposition of assets or to which Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to
give such consent under Section 10.05) have otherwise consented or (ii) release any Guarantor from
the Guaranty pursuant to Section 7.12 or with respect to which Required Lenders (or such other
Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 10.05) have otherwise consented.
(b) Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guaranty. Anything contained in any of the Loan
Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, each Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (i) no Secured
Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guaranty,
it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised
solely by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the
135
Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the
Security Documents may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent and (ii) in the event of a
foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or
other disposition, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of
such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and
representative of Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual
capacities unless Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose
of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the
Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account
of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other
disposition.
(c) Rights under Swap Contracts and Cash Management Products. No Swap Contract nor any
document governing any Cash Management Product shall create (or be deemed to create) in favor of
any Lender Counterparty that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management or
release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Guarantor under the Loan Documents except as
expressly provided in Section 10.05(c)(v) of this Agreement and Section 9.2 of the Pledge and
Security Agreement. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, such Lender Counterparty shall be
deemed to have appointed the Collateral Agent as its agent and agreed to be bound by the Loan
Documents as a Secured Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this clause (c).
(d) Release of Collateral and Guarantees, Termination of Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when all Obligations have been Paid in
Full, upon request of the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative
Agent, and the Collateral Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender or any
Lender Counterparty) take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all
Collateral, and to release all guarantee obligations provided for in any Loan Document. Any such
release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such guarantee
obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the
Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Borrower or any Guarantor, or
upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar
officer for, any Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.
Section 9.09 Withholding Taxes. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative
Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable, may withhold from any payment to any
Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If any payment has been made by
the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent to any Lender without the applicable
withholding Tax being withheld and the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent
has paid over the applicable withholding Tax to the Internal Revenue Service or other Governmental
Authority, or the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that
the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable, did not properly
withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was
not delivered or was
136
not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent or the
Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable, of a change in circumstance which rendered the
exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable, fully for all
amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative
Agent, as applicable, as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all
expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.
Section 9.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law or any other judicial proceeding
relative to any Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan
shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled
and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (a) to file and prove a claim for the
whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other
Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the other Secured Parties (including fees,
disbursements and other expenses of counsel) allowed in such judicial proceeding and (b) to collect
and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute
the same. Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in
any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and other Secured Party to make
such payments to the Administrative Agent. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize
the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or other
Secured Party any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender or other Secured Party to authorize the Administrative Agent to
vote in respect of the claim of such Person or in any such proceeding.

provided, that no notice to any Agent shall be effective until received by such Agent; provided, further,
that any
137
such notice or other communication shall at the request of the Administrative Agent or the Revolving
Administrative Agent, as applicable, be provided to any sub-agent appointed pursuant to
Section 9.03(c) hereto as designated by the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative
Agent, as applicable, from time to time.
(b) Electronic Communications.
(i) Notices and other communications to the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative
Agent, the Swing Line Lender, Lenders and any Issuing Bank hereunder may be delivered or
furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites, including
the Platform) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent or, in the case of notices
to the Revolving Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender or any Issuing Bank, approved by such
Person; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or an Issuing Bank
pursuant to Article II if such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, has notified the

(ii) Each Loan Party understands that the distribution of material through an electronic medium by the
Administrative Agent, Revolving Administrative Agent, a Lender or Issuing Bank is not necessarily
secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution and agrees
and assumes the risks associated with such electronic distribution, except to the extent caused by the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Administrative Agent, Revolving Administrative Agent,
Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction.
(iii) The Platform and any Approved Electronic Communications are provided “as is” and “as
available”. None of the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors or representatives (the “Agent Affiliates”) warrant the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness
of the Approved Electronic Communications or the Platform and each expressly disclaims liability for
errors or omissions in the Platform
138
and the Approved Electronic Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory,
including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third
party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects is made by the Agent Affiliates in connection
with the Platform or the Approved Electronic Communications. Each party hereto agrees that no
Agent has any responsibility for maintaining or providing any equipment, software, services or any
testing required in connection with any Approved Electronic Communication or otherwise required for
the Platform. In no event shall any Agent nor any of the Agent Affiliates have any liability to any Loan
Party, any Lender or any other Person for damages of any kind, whether or not based on strict liability
and including (A) direct or damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
arising out of any Loan Party’s or any Agent’s transmission of communications through the internet,
except to the extent the liability of any such Person if found in a final ruling by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct or (B) indirect,
special, incidental or consequential damages. No Agent or Agent Affiliate shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through
internet, electronic, telecommunications or other information transmission systems, except to the
extent same resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or Agent
Affiliate (to the extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
judgment).
(iv) Each Loan Party, each Lender, the Issuing Bank and each Agent agrees that the Administrative
Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, store any Approved Electronic Communications on the
Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agent’s customary document retention procedures and
policies.
(v) All uses of the Platform shall be governed by and subject to, in addition to this Section 10.01,
separate terms and conditions posted or referenced in such Platform and related agreements
executed by the Lenders and their Affiliates in connection with the use of such Platform.
(vi) Any notice of Default or Event of Default may be provided by telephonic notice if confirmed
promptly thereafter by delivery of written notice thereof.

modifications thereto; (b) all the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for the Borrower
Representative and the other Loan Parties; (c) the reasonable fees, out-of-pocket expenses and

(including the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any agents employed or retained by
the Collateral Agent and its counsel) in connection with the custody or preservation of any of the
Collateral; (f) all other actual and reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each
Agent in connection with the syndication of the Loans and Commitments; and (g) all actual costs and
expenses, (including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of (i) a single firm of
counsel for the Administrative Agent, (ii) a single firm of counsel for the other Agents and Lenders,
(iii) local and/or special counsel in each applicable jurisdiction and (iv) in the case of any actual or
perceived conflict of interest (as determined by the applicable indemnified person) separate firms of

Lender in enforcing any Obligations of or in collecting any payments due from any Loan Party
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. All amounts due under this Section 10.02 shall be due
and payable within ten (10) days after demand therefor.
Section 10.03 Indemnity.
(a) In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to Section 10.02, whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, each Loan Party agrees to defend (subject to Indemnitees’
rights to selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless, each Agent, the Arrangers, the
Bookrunners, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and Lender and the officers, partners,
members, directors, trustees, shareholders, advisors, employees, representatives, attorneys,
controlling persons, agents, sub-agents and Affiliates of each of the Agents, the Arrangers, the
Bookrunners, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and Lender, as well as the respective heirs,
successors and assigns of the foregoing (each, an “Indemnitee”), from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities; provided, that no Loan Party shall have any obligation to any Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise
(i) from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee, in each case, as determined by
a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) from or out of any dispute
among Indemnified Persons (other than a dispute involving claims against the Administrative Agent,
the Revolving Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Arrangers, the Bookrunners or any other
agent or co-agent (if any) designated by the Arrangers with respect to the credit facilities hereunder, in
each case in their respective capacities as such, or the Arrangers or any Bookrunner, solely in
connection with its syndication activities as contemplated hereunder) that a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined in a final and non-appealable decision did not involve an act or omission
of the Loan Parties. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Loan Party agrees not to assert and hereby waives all rights for contribution or any other rights of
recovery against any Indemnitee with respect to all Indemnified Liabilities relating to or arising out of
any Environmental Claim or related to any actual or alleged presence, release of, or
140
exposure to, any Hazardous Materials; provided, that any Loan Party (i) shall not have any obligation
to any Indemnitee hereunder and (ii) may assert and does not waive any rights for contribution or
recovery with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities or Environmental Claim arising from or related to
any Release of Hazardous Materials on, upon or into real property, to the extent such Liabilities arise
and are incurred as a result of any Indemnitee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct following
foreclosure or deed in lieu or other similar transfer of such real property and are attributable solely to
acts of such Indemnitee. To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold
harmless set forth in this Section 10.03 may be unenforceable in whole or in part because they are
violative of any law or public policy, the applicable Loan Party shall contribute the maximum portion
that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.
(b) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Loan Party shall assert, and each Loan Party hereby
waives, any claim against each Agent, the Arrangers, the Bookrunners, the Issuing Bank, the Swing
Line Lender and Lender and their respective Affiliates, officers, partners, members, directors, trustees,
shareholders, advisors, employees, representatives, attorneys, controlling persons, agents and sub-
agents on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) (whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract, tort or duty
imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out of, in connection with, as a result of or in any
way related to this Agreement or any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby or referred to herein or therein, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the
transmission of information through the Internet, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof or any
act or omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and each Loan Party hereby waives,
releases and agrees not to sue upon any such claim or any such damages, whether or not accrued
and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through
internet, electronic, telecommunications or other information transmission systems, except to the
extent same resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee (to
the extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment).
(c) The Loan Parties agrees that any indemnification or other protection provided to any Indemnitee
pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.03 thereof) or any other
Loan Document (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement and each an “Existing Loan Document”)
shall survive the effectiveness of this Agreement and any indemnification or other protection provided
to any Indemnitee pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement, any other Existing Loan Document, this
Agreement (including pursuant to this Section 10.03) or any other Loan Document shall (i) survive
Payment in Full of all Obligations and (ii) inure to the benefit of any Person that was at any time an
Indemnitee under the Existing Credit Agreement, any other Existing Loan Document, this Agreement
or any other Loan Document; provided, that any indemnification or other protection provided to any
Indemnitee shall be subject to the same limitations and terms set forth in the Existing Credit
Agreement, the other Existing Loan Documents, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
including, without limitation, such limitations set forth in Section 10.03(a) of this Agreement and the
Existing Credit Agreement with respect to an Indemnitee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
141
(d) All amounts due under this Section 10.03 shall be due and payable within ten (10) days after
demand therefor.
Section 10.04 Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not
by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event
of Default each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender except to the extent prohibited by law) is
hereby authorized by each Loan Party at any time or from time to time subject to the consent of the
Administrative Agent or Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), without notice to any Loan Party or to any other Person (other
than the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative Agent, as applicable), any such notice
being hereby expressly waived to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (time or demand, provisional or final, general or special,
including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not
including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against and on account of the obligations and liabilities
of any Loan Party to such Lender hereunder, the Letters of Credit and participations therein and under
the other Loan Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising out of or
connected hereto, the Letters of Credit and participations therein or with any other Loan Document,
irrespective of whether or not (a) such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) such
obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees to
notify the Borrowers promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
Section 10.05 Amendments and Waivers.
(a) Required Lenders’ Consent. Subject to the additional requirements of Sections 10.05(b) and
10.05(c) and except as provided in Section 2.24 and Sections 10.05(d) and (e), no amendment,
supplement, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, or consent to
any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written

executed counterpart thereof); provided that all Loans held by a Sponsor Affiliated Lender shall be
disregarded for purposes of this Section 10.05(a).

142
(ii) waive, reduce or postpone any scheduled repayment (but not prepayment) of principal;

included in the determination of “Required Lenders” or “Pro Rata Share” on substantially the same
basis as the Term Loan Commitments, the Term Loans, the Revolving Commitments and the
Revolving Loans are included on the Original Closing Date or Restatement Date, as applicable;
(viii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially all of the Guarantors from the
Guaranty except as expressly provided in the Loan Documents;

provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, all Lenders shall be deemed directly and adversely affected
thereby with respect to any amendment described in clauses (vii), (viii), (ix) and (x).

Documents, or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall:

or all or substantially all of the Guarantors from the Guaranty except as expressly provided in the Loan
Documents without the written consent of each Lender Counterparty with Obligations then

any Loan of a Defaulting Lender be reduced, in each case without the consent of such Lender and
(y) in the case of any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each
affected Lender that by its terms, affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected
Lenders shall require the consent of each such Defaulting Lender; or
144
(viii) amend any condition for any Credit Extensions set forth in Section 3.02 without the consent of
Lenders holding more than 50.0% of the aggregate Revolving Exposure of all Lenders;
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any waiver, amendment, supplement or other
modification with respect to Section 6.07 (or, for purposes of the financial covenant set forth in
Section 6.07, the definition of “Leverage Ratio” or any defined terms set forth in the definition of
“Leverage Ratio” or any defined term used therein) shall require the written consent only of the U.S.
Borrower and the Required Revolving Lenders.
(d) Refinancing Amendments. In addition, notwithstanding Sections 10.05(a), (b) and (c), this
Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower
Representative and the Lenders providing the Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to permit
the refinancing of all outstanding Term Loans of a tranche (“Refinanced Term Loans”) with a
replacement term loan (“Replacement Term Loans”) hereunder; provided that (i) the aggregate
principal amount of such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount
of such Refinanced Term Loans, (ii) the Applicable Margin with respect to such Replacement Term
Loans (or similar interest rate spread applicable to such Replacement Term Loans) shall not be
higher than the Applicable Margin for such Refinanced Term Loans (or similar interest rate spread
applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans) immediately prior to such refinancing, (iii) the Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans at the time of such refinancing (except to the
extent of nominal amortization for periods where amortization has been eliminated as a result of
prepayment of the Term Loans) and (iv) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term Loans
shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Term
Loans than, those applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to
provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the latest final maturity of the
Term Loans in effect immediately prior to such refinancing (and, without limiting the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent are authorized to amend any Security Document to the
extent necessary to ensure that all such Term Loans or Revolving Commitments are provided with the
benefit of the applicable Security Documents on a pari passu basis with the other Obligations).
(e) Extensions of Maturity. In addition and notwithstanding Sections 10.05(a), (b) and (c), the
Agreement may be amended to extend the maturity date of any Term Loan or Revolving
Commitments hereunder; in each case with the consent solely of the Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent and Lenders providing such extended Term Loans or extended Revolving Commitments as
applicable; provided that such extended Term Loans or Revolving Commitments otherwise meet the
requirements set forth in clauses (i), (iii) (with respect to Term Loans only) and (iv) of the preceding
clause (d) (and, without limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are
authorized to amend any Security Document to the extent necessary to ensure that all such Term
Loans or Revolving Commitments (including as so extended) are provided with the benefit of the
applicable Security Documents on a pari passu basis with the other Obligations). For the avoidance
of doubt, the Applicable Margin with respect to any such extended Term Loans or Revolving
Commitments may be greater than the Applicable Margin applicable to non-extended Term Loans or
Revolving Commitments and such extended Term Loans or Revolving Commitments may be deemed
to constitute a separate Class of Term Loans or Revolving Commitments.
145
(f) Limitation on Rights of Sponsor Affiliates Lenders. No Sponsor Affiliate Lender shall have any right,
(i) to consent to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other such action with respect to
any of the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) to require any Agent or other
Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, (iii) to otherwise vote on any matter related to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, (iv) to attend any meeting with any Agent or Lender or receive any information from
any Agent or Lender or (v) to make or bring any claim, in its capacity as a Lender, against the Agent or
any Lender with respect to the duties and obligations of such Persons under the Loan Documents, but
no amendment, modification or waiver shall deprive such Sponsor Affiliate Lender of its share of any
payments which the Lenders are entitled to share on a pro rata basis or disproportionately affects
such Sponsor Affiliate Lender more adversely than any other Lender of the same Class.
(g) Execution of Amendments, Etc. The Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to,
with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, supplements, modifications, waivers or
consents on behalf of such Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. In the case of any waiver, the parties
hereto shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event Default, or
impair any right consequent thereon. No notice to or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall
entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any
amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this
Section 10.05 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if
signed by a Loan Party, on such Loan Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.05, if the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower Representative shall have jointly identified an obvious or manifest error or any error
or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents,
then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative shall be permitted to amend such
provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any
other party to any Loan Document if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders
within five (5) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary provided herein, no consent of any Lender shall be required in connection with the
marking of any amendment to any Loan Document of the type described in Section 2.24 hereof which
states in such Section that no consent of any Lender, other than the applicable Incremental Revolving
Loan Lender or Incremental Term Loan Lender, is required.
Section 10.06 Successors and Assigns; Participations.
(a) Generally. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
146
and the successors and permitted assigns of Lenders. No Loan Party’s rights or obligations
hereunder nor any interest therein may be assigned or delegated by any Loan Party without the prior
written consent of all Lenders (and any purported assignment or delegation without such consent
shall be null and void).
(b) Register. Each Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent and
Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders and
owners of the corresponding Commitments and Loans listed therein for all purposes hereof, and
notwithstanding anything else herein, no assignment or transfer of any such Commitment or Loan
shall be effective, in each case, unless and until recorded in the Register following receipt of a fully
executed Assignment Agreement effecting the assignment or transfer thereof, together with the
required forms and certificates regarding Tax matters and any fees payable in connection with such
assignment, in each case, as provided in Section 10.06(d). Each assignment shall be recorded in the
Register promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent (or the Revolving Administrative
Agent, as applicable) of the fully executed Assignment Agreement and all other necessary documents
and approvals, prompt notice thereof shall be provided to the Borrower Representative and a copy of
such Assignment Agreement shall be maintained, as applicable. The date of such recordation of a
transfer shall be referred to herein as the “Assignment Effective Date.” Any request, authority or
consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is
listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder,
assignee or transferee of the corresponding Commitments or Loans.
(c) Right to Assign. Each Lender shall have the right at any time to sell, assign or transfer all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, including all or a portion of its Commitment
or Loans owing to it or other Obligations (provided, that pro rata assignments shall not be required
and each assignment shall be of a uniform, and not varying, percentage of all rights and obligations
under and in respect of any applicable Loan and any related Commitments):
(i) to any Person meeting the criteria of clause (i) of the definition of the term of “Eligible Assignee”
upon the giving of notice to the Administrative Agent and, in the case of assignments of Revolving
Loans or Revolving Commitments, notice to the Revolving Administrative Agent and, if such Eligible
Assignee is not, or is not an Affiliate of a Revolving Lender, the applicable Issuing Bank and Swing
Line Lender;
(ii) to any Person meeting the criteria of clause (ii) or (iii) of the definition of the term of “Eligible
Assignee” upon giving of notice to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent and, in
the case of assignments of Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments to any such Person (except
in the case of assignments made by or to Barclays Bank), consented to by each of the Borrower
Representative (provided that the Borrower Representative shall be deemed to have consented to
any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within
five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof), the Revolving Administrative Agent with
respect to assignments of Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments, the applicable Issuing
Banks and the Swing Line Lender (such consents not to be (x) unreasonably withheld or delayed or
(y) in the case of the Borrower Representative,
147
required at any time an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing); provided, that further each
such assignment pursuant to this Section 10.6(c)(ii) shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than
(A) $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by the Borrower Representative, the
Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent) or as shall constitute the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender) with respect to
the assignment of the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans and (B) $1,000,000 (or such
lesser amount as may be agreed to by the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent or
as shall constitute the aggregate amount of the Tranche B-1 Term Loans, Tranche B-2 Term Loans or
with respect to Incremental Term Loans constituting a separate Series, such Incremental Term Loans
of such Series of the assigning Lender) with respect to the assignment of Term Loans; provided, that
the Related Funds of any individual Lender may aggregate their Loans for purposes of determining
compliance with such minimum assignment amounts; and
(iii) if the Eligible Assignee is a Sponsor Affiliated Lender, such assignment may be of Term Loans
only and (1) after giving effect to such assignment, to all other assignments and participations with all
Sponsor Affiliated Lenders and to all Offer Loans purchased and cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.13(c), the aggregate principal amount of all Loans and Commitments then held by all
Sponsor Affiliated Lenders (whether by assignment, participation, or other derivative transaction) shall
not exceed 20% of the sum of (x) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Term Loans then
outstanding and (y) the aggregate Revolving Exposure of all Lenders then outstanding, and (2) such
Sponsor Affiliated Lender shall execute a waiver in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent that it shall have no right whatsoever, so long as such Person is a Sponsor
Affiliate Lender (A) to consent to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other such action
with respect to any of the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except to the extent set
forth in Section 10.05(f), (B) to require any Agent or other Lender to undertake any action (or refrain
from taking any action) with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (C) to attend (or
receive any notice of) any meeting, conference call or correspondence with any Agent or Lender or
receive any information from any Agent or Lender, (D) to have access to the Platform (including,
without limitation, that portion of the Platform that has been designated for “private-side” Lenders) or
(E) to make or bring any claim, in its capacity as Lender, against the Agent or any Lender with respect
to the duties and obligations of such Persons under the Loan Documents, but no amendment,
modification or waiver shall deprive any Sponsor Affiliated Lender of its share of any payments which
the Lenders are entitled to share on a pro rata basis hereunder. By purchasing or being assigned the
Loans and by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, each Sponsor Affiliated Lender
acknowledges and agrees that the Loans owned by it shall be non-voting under sections 1126 and
1129 of the Bankruptcy Code in the event that any proceeding thereunder shall be instituted by or
against any Borrower or any other Loan Party.
(d) Mechanics. Assignments and assumptions of Term Loans and Term Loan Commitments by
Lenders shall be effected by manual execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent (and, with
respect to any assignment of Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments, the Revolving
Administrative Agent) of an Assignment Agreement. Assignments
148
made pursuant to the foregoing provision shall be effective as of the Assignment Effective Date. In
connection with all assignments there shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent (and, with
respect to any assignment of Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments, the Revolving
Administrative Agent) such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to United States
federal income Tax withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be
required to deliver pursuant to Section 2.20(c), together with payment to the Administrative Agent (or,
in the case of any assignment of Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments, the Revolving
Administrative Agent) of a registration and processing fee of $3,500 (except that no such registration
and processing fee shall be payable (y) in connection with an assignment by or to Barclays Bank or
any Affiliate thereof or (z) in the case of an assignee which is already a Lender or is an Affiliate or
Related Fund of a Lender or a Person under common management with a Lender).
(e) Representations and Warranties of Assignee. Each Lender, upon execution and delivery hereof or
upon succeeding to an interest in the Commitments and Loans, as the case may be, represents and
warrants as of the Original Closing Date, the Restatement Date or as of the Assignment Effective
Date, as applicable, that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) it has experience and expertise in the
making of or investing in commitments or loans such as the applicable Commitments or Loans, as the
case may be; and (iii) it shall make or invest in, as the case may be, its Commitments or Loans for its
own account in the ordinary course and without a view to distribution of such Commitments or Loans
within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being
understood that, subject to the provisions of this Section 10.06, the disposition of such Commitments
or Loans or any interests therein shall at all times remain within its exclusive control).
(f) Effect of Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 10.06, as of the
“Assignment Effective Date” (i) the assignee thereunder shall have the rights and obligations of a
“Lender” hereunder to the extent of its interest in the Loans and Commitments as reflected in the
applicable Register(s) and shall thereafter be a party hereto and a “Lender” for all purposes hereof;
(ii) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have
been assigned to the assignee, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the
termination hereof, including under Section 10.08) and be released from its obligations hereunder
(and, in the case of an assignment covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s
rights and obligations hereunder, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto on the Assignment
Effective Date; provided, that anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary
notwithstanding, (y) the Issuing Bank shall continue to have all rights and obligations thereof with
respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and the
reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder and (z) such assigning Lender shall continue to be
entitled to the benefit of all indemnities hereunder as specified herein with respect to matters arising
out of the prior involvement of such assigning Lender as a Lender hereunder); (iii) the Commitments
shall be modified to reflect any Commitment of such assignee and any Revolving Commitment of
such assigning Lender, if any; and (iv) if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of any Note
hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly
thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable Notes to the Administrative Agent for cancellation,
and thereupon the applicable Borrower shall issue and deliver new Notes, if so requested by the
assignee and/or assigning Lender, to such assignee and/or to such assigning Lender, with
appropriate insertions,
149
to reflect the new Revolving Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of the assignee and/or the
assigning Lender. Subject to Section 10.06(b), any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply the requirements of this Section 10.06 shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with Section 10.06(g). Any assignment by a Lender pursuant to this
Section 10.06 shall not in any way constitute or be deemed to constitute a novation, discharge,
rescission, extinguishment or substitution of the Indebtedness hereunder, and any Indebtedness so
assigned shall continue to be the same obligation and not a new obligation.
(g) Participations.
(i) Each Lender shall have the right at any time to sell one or more participations to any Person (other
than Holdings, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates) in all or any part of its Commitments,
Loans or in any other Obligation; provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents, the Lenders and the
Issuing Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
(ii) The holder of any such participation, other than an Affiliate of the Lender granting such
participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder
except with respect to any amendment, modification or waiver that would (A) extend the final
scheduled maturity of any Loan, Note or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is not extended
beyond the Revolving Commitment Termination Date) in which such participant is participating, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon (except in connection with a
waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount
thereof, or increase the amount of the participant’s participation over the amount thereof then in effect
(it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the
Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in
any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participant’s
participation is not increased as a result thereof), (B) consent to the assignment or transfer by any
Loan Party of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or (C) release all or substantially
all of the Guarantors or the Collateral under the Security Documents (except as expressly provided in
the Loan Documents) supporting the Loans hereunder in which such participant is participating.
(iii) Each Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18(c),
2.19 and 2.20 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section; provided, that (x) a participant shall not be entitled to receive
any greater payment under Section 2.18(c), 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the
participation to such participant is made with the Borrower Representative’s prior written consent and
(y)
150
a participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.20 unless the applicable Borrower is
notified of the participation sold to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of such
Borrower, to comply with Section 2.20 as though it were a Lender; provided, further, that, except as
specifically set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence, nothing herein shall require any notice to
the Borrower Representative’s or any other Person in connection with the sale of any participation. To
the extent permitted by law, each participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.04 as
though it were a Lender; provided, that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17 as
though it were a Lender.
(iv) Each Lender that sells a participation shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and
address of each participant and the principal amounts of each participant’s interest in the
Commitments, Loans and other Obligations held by it (the “Participant Register”). The entries in the
Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such Commitments,
Loans and other Obligations as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding
any notice to the contrary. Any such Participant Register shall be available for inspection by the
Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the Revolving Administrative Agent at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(h) Certain Other Assignments and Participations. In addition to any other assignment or participation
permitted pursuant to this Section 10.06 any Lender may assign and/or pledge (without the consent of
any Borrower or any Agent) all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations owed by or to such
Lender, and its Notes, if any, to secure obligations of such Lender including any Federal Reserve
Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors and any operating
circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided, that no Lender, as between any Borrower
and such Lender, shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such
assignment and pledge; provided, further, that in no event shall the applicable Federal Reserve Bank,
pledgee or trustee, be considered to be a “Lender” or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to
take or omit to take any action hereunder.
Section 10.07 Independence of Covenants, Etc.. All covenants, conditions and other terms hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or
condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, conditions or other terms, the fact that it would be
permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant,
condition or other term shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action
is taken or condition exists.
Section 10.08 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. All representations,
warranties and agreements made herein shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and the
making of any Credit Extension as long as the Obligations shall not have been Paid in Full.
Notwithstanding anything herein or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of each Loan Party
set forth in Sections 2.18(c), 2.19, 2.20, 10.02 and 10.03 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in
Sections 2.17, 9.03(b), 9.06, 9.09 and 10.04 shall survive the payment of the Loans, the cancellation
or expiration of the Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the
termination hereof.
151
Section 10.09 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay or course of dealing on the part
of any Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any
default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or
privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. The rights,
powers and remedies given to each Agent and each Lender hereby are cumulative and shall be in
addition to and independent of all rights, powers and remedies existing by virtue of any statute or rule
of law or in any of the other Loan Documents or any of the Hedge Agreements. Any forbearance or
failure to exercise, and any delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair
any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the
further exercise of any such right, power or remedy. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
making of any Credit Extension shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default,
regardless of whether any Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default or Event of Default at the time of the making of any such Credit Extension.
Section 10.10 Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither any Agent nor any Lender shall be under
any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other Person or against or in
payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that any Loan Party makes a payment or
payments to the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to the
Administrative Agent or Revolving Administrative Agent, on behalf of Lenders), or any Agent or
Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments
or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended
to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
Section 10.11 Severability. In case any provision in or obligation hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in
and of itself affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The
parties hereto shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace any invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid, legal and enforceable provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as reasonably possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
Section 10.12 Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders’ Rights. The obligations of
Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall be responsible for the obligations or Commitment
of any other Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any
152
other Loan Document, and no action taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to
constitute Lenders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The
amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent debt,
and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out hereof and it shall not be
necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such
purpose.
Section 10.13 Table of Contents and Headings. The Table of Contents hereof and Article and
Section headings herein are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part hereof for any other purpose, modify or amend the terms or conditions hereof, be
used in connection with the interpretation of any term or condition hereof or be given any substantive
effect.
Section 10.14 APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE

OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY LOAN
PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

OF ANY JUDGMENT.

154
Section 10.17 Confidentiality. Each Agent and each Lender (which term shall for the purposes of this
Section 10.17 include the Issuing Bank) shall hold all non-public information regarding the Loan
Parties and their Subsidiaries and their businesses identified as such by the Borrower Representative
and obtained by such Agent or such Lender pursuant to the requirements hereof in accordance with
such Agent’s and such Lender’s customary procedures for handling confidential information of such
nature, it being understood and agreed by the Borrower Representative that, in any event, the
Administrative Agent may disclose such information to the Lenders and each Agent and each Lender
may make (i) disclosures of such information to Affiliates or Related Funds of such Lender or Agent
and to their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and advisors (and to
other Persons authorized by a Lender or Agent to organize, present or disseminate such information
in connection with disclosures otherwise made in accordance with this Section 10.17); provided that

disclosure, such rating agency be instructed to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential
information relating to the Loan Parties received by it from any Agent or any Lender, (iv) disclosures in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document,
(v) disclosures required or requested by any governmental agency or representative thereof or by the
NAIC or pursuant to legal or judicial process (in which case the disclosing Agent or Lender agrees, to
the extent practicable and not prohibited by applicable law, to inform the Borrower Representative
promptly thereof prior to such disclosure) and (vi) disclosure to the extent requested or required by
regulatory authorities (in which case the disclosing Agent or Lender agrees, to the extent practicable
and not prohibited by applicable law, to inform the Borrower Representative promptly thereof prior to
such disclosure); provided, that unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each
Lender and each Agent shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower Representative of any
request by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such request in
connection with any examination of the financial condition or other routine examination of such
Lender by such governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to
disclosure of such information. In addition, each Agent and each Lender may disclose the existence
of this Agreement and the information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar services
providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection
with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
155
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each party (and each of their respective
employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons without limitation of
any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
all materials of any kind (including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to any such
party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, any information relating to the tax
treatment or tax structure shall remain subject to the confidentiality provisions hereof (and the
foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent reasonably necessary to enable the parties hereto,
their respective Affiliates, and their respective Affiliates’ directors and employees to comply with
applicable securities laws. For this purpose, “tax structure” means any facts relevant to the federal
income tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement but does not include
information relating to the identity of any of the parties hereto or any of their respective Affiliates.
Section 10.18 Usury Savings Clause. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate
interest rate charged with respect to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection
therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law, shall not exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this
Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made
hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due
hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of
interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made
hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided
for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated
rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted
by law, each Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, or the Revolving Administrative Agent,
as applicable, an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount
of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of Lenders and each Borrower to conform strictly to
any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any
consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess
shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender’s option be applied to
the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the applicable Borrower.
Section 10.19 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (and by
different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which when so executed and delivered shall
be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
other electronic transmission will be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.
Section 10.20 Effectiveness; Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and any fee letter or commitment letter entered into in connection with the
Amendment Agreement, represent the entire agreement of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, the Agents,
the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender, the Arrangers, the Bookrunners and the Lenders with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are
156
no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent, Issuing Bank, Swing Line
Lender, the Arrangers or any of the Bookrunners or Lender relative to the subject matter hereof or
thereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents. Nothing in this
Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, express or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto and thereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted
hereunder and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, Affiliates of each of the Agents and
Lenders, holders of participations in all or any part of a Lender’s Commitments, Loans or in any other
Obligations, and the Indemnitees) any rights, remedies, obligations, claims or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement
shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of any Agent, the
Issuing Bank or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement.
Section 10.21 PATRIOT Act. Each Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Administrative
Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the
requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies
each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other
information that shall allow such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Administrative
Agent, as applicable, to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.
Section 10.22 Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and
words of like import in any Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures
or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system,
as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic
Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act.
Section 10.23 No Fiduciary Duty. Each Agent, each Lender, the Arrangers, the Bookrunners, the
Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and their respective Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of
this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrowers,
their respective stockholders and/or their respective Affiliates. Each Borrower agrees that nothing in
the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency
relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and the
Borrowers, their respective stockholders or their respective Affiliates, on the other. The Loan Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the
exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions
between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other, and (ii) in connection
therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary
responsibility in favor of the Borrowers, their stockholders or their respective Affiliates with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the
process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will
advise any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to
157
the Borrowers except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender
is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Borrower, its management,
stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the
Borrowers have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent each deemed
appropriate and that each is responsible for making its own respective independent judgment with
respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Borrower agrees that it will not
claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or
similar duty to any Borrower, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
Section 10.24 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another
currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking
procedures, the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on
the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment in given. The obligation of any Borrower in
respect of such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”)
other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day
following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment
Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the
Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so
purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from the applicable
Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom
such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased
is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative
Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may
be entitled thereto under applicable Law).
Section 10.25 Effect of Restatement. This Agreement shall, except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, supersede the Existing Credit Agreement from and after the Restatement Date with respect to
the Loans and Letters of Credit outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement as of the
Restatement Date. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree, however, that (a) this Agreement and
all other Loan Documents executed and delivered herewith do not constitute a novation or termination
of the Obligations (under and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and the other Loan
Documents as in effect prior to the Restatement Date except to the extent such Obligations are repaid
on the Restatement Date and (b) such Obligations are in all respects continuing with only the terms
being modified as provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The parties hereto
further acknowledge and agree that all references in the other Loan Documents to the Existing Credit
Agreement shall be deemed to refer without further amendment to this Agreement. In addition, unless
specifically amended hereby, each of the Loan Documents and Exhibits and Schedules to the
Existing Credit Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and, if applicable, in the forms
attached to the Existing Credit Agreement, and with the effect that from and after the Restatement
Date all references therein shall be references to this Agreement.

Grantor in respect of the Material Intellectual Property or any portion thereof. In connection
with such collections, such Grantor may take (and, at the Collateral Agent’s reasonable
direction, shall take) such action as such Grantor or the Collateral Agent may deem reasonably
necessary or advisable to enforce collection of such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time following the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to notify, or require any Grantor to notify, any obligors with
respect to any such amounts of the existence of the security interest created hereby.
SECTION 7.ACCESS; RIGHT OF INSPECTION AND FURTHER ASSURANCES; ADDITIONAL
GRANTORS.
7.1 Access; Right of Inspection. Subject to the provisions and limitations set forth in
Section 5.06 of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall at all times have full and free
access during normal business hours to all the books, correspondence and records of each
Grantor, and the Collateral Agent and its representatives may examine the same, take extracts
therefrom and make photocopies thereof, and each Grantor agrees to render to the Collateral
Agent, at the Collateral Agent’s cost and expense, such clerical and other assistance as may
be reasonably requested with regard thereto. The Collateral Agent and its representatives shall
at all times also have the right to enter any premises of each Grantor and inspect any property
of each Grantor where any of the Collateral of such Grantor granted pursuant to this
Agreement is located for the purpose of inspecting the same, observing its use or otherwise
protecting its interests therein.
7.2 Further Assurances.
21
(a) Each Grantor agrees that from time to time, at the expense of such Grantor, that it shall
promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further
action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the Collateral Agent may reasonably
request, in order to create and/or maintain the validity, perfection or priority of and protect any
security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable the Collateral Agent to
exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor shall:
(i) file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, record security
interests in Intellectual Property and execute and deliver such other agreements, instruments,
endorsements, powers of attorney or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the
Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to effect, reflect, perfect and preserve the
security interests granted or purported to be granted hereby;
(ii) take all actions necessary to ensure the recordation of appropriate evidence of the liens
and security interest granted hereunder in any Intellectual Property with any intellectual
property registry in which said Intellectual Property is registered or issued or in which an
application for registration or issuance is pending, including, without limitation, the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, the various Secretaries
of State, and the foreign counterparts on any of the foregoing;
(iii) at the Collateral Agent’s request, appear in and defend any action or proceeding that may
affect such Grantor’s title to or the Collateral Agent’s security interest in all or any part of the
Collateral; and
(iv) furnish the Collateral Agent with such information regarding the Collateral, including,
without limitation, the location thereof, as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request from
time to time.
(b) Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file a Record or Records, including,
without limitation, financing or continuation statements, Intellectual Property Security
Agreements and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, in any jurisdictions
and with any filing offices as the Collateral Agent may determine, in its sole discretion, are
necessary or advisable to perfect or otherwise protect the security interest granted to the
Collateral Agent herein. Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same
manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that
describes such property in any other manner as the Collateral Agent may determine, in its sole
discretion, is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security interest
in the Collateral granted to the Collateral Agent herein, including, without limitation, describing
such property as “all assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, developed or created”
or words of similar effect. Each Grantor shall furnish to the Collateral Agent from time to time
statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral and such other
reports in connection with the Collateral as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, all in
reasonable detail.
(c) Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to modify this Agreement after
obtaining such Grantor’s approval of or signature to such modification by amending Schedule
5.2 (as such schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time) to include
reference to any right, title or interest in any existing Intellectual Property or any Intellectual
Property acquired or developed by any Grantor after the execution hereof or to delete any
reference to any right, title or interest in any Intellectual Property in which any Grantor no
longer has or claims any right, title or interest.
22
7.3 Additional Grantors. From time to time subsequent to the date hereof, additional Persons
may become parties hereto as additional Grantors (each, an “Additional Grantor”), by
executing a Pledge Supplement. Upon delivery of any such Pledge Supplement to the
Collateral Agent, notice of which is hereby waived by Grantors, each Additional Grantor shall
be a Grantor and shall be as fully a party hereto as if Additional Grantor were an original
signatory hereto. Each Grantor expressly agrees that its obligations arising hereunder shall
not be affected or diminished by the addition or release of any other Grantor hereunder, nor by
any election of Collateral Agent not to cause any Subsidiary of Borrower to become an
Additional Grantor hereunder. This Agreement shall be fully effective as to any Grantor that is
or becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any other Person becomes or fails to become
or ceases to be a Grantor hereunder.
SECTION 8. COLLATERAL AGENT APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.
8.1 Power of Attorney. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent (such
appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Grantor’s attorney-in-fact, with full
authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor, the Collateral
Agent or otherwise, from time to time as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in
the Collateral Agent’s discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument that the
Collateral Agent may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of
this Agreement, in each case in accordance with applicable law, including, without limitation,
the following:
(a) to obtain and adjust insurance required to be maintained by such Grantor or paid to the
Collateral Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement;
(b) to ask for, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give acquittance and
receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in respect of any of the Collateral;
(c) to receive, endorse and collect any drafts or other instruments, documents and chattel
paper in connection with clause (b) above;
(d) to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that the Collateral Agent
may deem necessary or desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to
enforce the rights of the Collateral Agent with respect to any of the Collateral;
(e) to prepare, sign, and file for recordation in any intellectual property registry, appropriate
evidence of the lien and security interest granted herein in any Intellectual Property in the
name of such Grantor as debtor;
(f) to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to perform or comply or cause
performance or compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
access to pay or discharge taxes or Liens (other than Permitted Liens) levied or placed upon
or threatened against the Collateral, the legality or validity thereof and the amounts necessary
to discharge the same to be determined by the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion, any such
payments made by the Collateral Agent to become obligations of such Grantor to the Collateral
Agent, due and payable immediately without demand; and
23
(g) generally to sell, transfer, lease, license, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or
otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent
were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to do, at the Collateral Agent’s option
and such Grantor’s expense, at any time or from time to time, all acts and things that the
Collateral Agent deems reasonably necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the
Collateral and the Collateral Agent’s security interest therein in order to effect the intent of this
Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.
This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until this Agreement
is terminated.
8.2 No Duty on the Part of Collateral Agent or Secured Parties. The powers conferred on the
Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect the interests of the Secured Parties in the
Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party
to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be
accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such
powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be
responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.
8.3 Appointment Pursuant to Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent has been appointed as
collateral agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The rights, duties, privileges, immunities
and indemnities of the Collateral Agent hereunder are subject to the provisions of the Credit
Agreement.
SECTION 9. REMEDIES.
9.1 Generally.
(a) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may
exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided for
herein or otherwise available to it at law or in equity, all the rights and remedies of the Collateral
Agent on default under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) to
collect, enforce or satisfy any Secured Obligations then owing, whether by acceleration or
otherwise, and also may pursue any of the following separately, successively or
simultaneously:
(i) require any Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it shall at its expense and
promptly upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral
as directed by the Collateral Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place to be
designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties;
(ii) enter onto the property where any Collateral is located and take possession thereof with or
without judicial process;
(iii) prior to the disposition of the Collateral, store, process, repair or recondition the Collateral
or otherwise prepare the Collateral for disposition in any manner to the extent the Collateral
Agent deems appropriate; and
24
(iv) without notice except as specified below or under the UCC, sell, assign, lease, license (on
an exclusive or nonexclusive basis) or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof
in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Collateral Agent’s offices or
elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or
prices and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem commercially reasonable.
(b) The Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the
Collateral at any public or private (to the extent to the portion of the Collateral being privately
sold is of a kind that is customarily sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely
distributed standard price quotations) sale in accordance with the UCC and the Collateral
Agent, as collateral agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for
the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any
portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale made in accordance with the UCC, to use and
apply any of the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any
Collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale. Each purchaser at any such sale shall
hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and
each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) all rights of redemption,
stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of
law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice
of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days notice to such Grantor of the time and
place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute
reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn
any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed
therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it
was so adjourned. Each Grantor agrees that it would not be commercially unreasonable for the
Collateral Agent to dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof by using Internet sites that
provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the
reasonable capability of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets. Each Grantor
hereby waives any claims against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the
price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price
which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first
offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. If the proceeds of
any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Secured
Obligations, Grantors shall be liable for the deficiency and the fees of any attorneys employed
by the Collateral Agent to collect such deficiency. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of
any of the covenants contained in this Section will cause irreparable injury to the Collateral
Agent, that the Collateral Agent has no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and,
as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section shall be specifically
enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert
any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a
defense that no default has occurred giving rise to the Secured Obligations becoming due and
payable prior to their stated maturities. Nothing in this Section shall in any way limit the rights
of the Collateral Agent hereunder.
(c) The Collateral Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the
Collateral. The Collateral Agent may specifically disclaim or modify any warranties of title or the
like. This procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness
of any sale of the Collateral.
25
(d) The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to marshal any of the Collateral.
9.2 Application of Proceeds. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all
proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, any collection from, or
other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied in full or in part by the
Collateral Agent against, the Secured Obligations in the following order of priority: first, to the
payment of all costs and expenses of such sale, collection or other realization, including
reasonable compensation to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Revolving
Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel, and all other expenses,
liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and
Revolving Administrative Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts for which the
Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and Revolving Administrative Agent are entitled to
indemnification hereunder (in their respective capacities as Collateral Agent, Administrative
Agent and Revolving Administrative Agent and not as a Lender) and all advances made by the
Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or Revolving Administrative Agent for the account of
the applicable Grantor, and to the payment of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by the
Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or Revolving Administrative Agent in connection with
the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the Credit Agreement, all in
accordance with the terms hereof or thereof; second, to the extent of any excess of such
proceeds, to the payment of all other Secured Obligations for the ratable benefit of the Lenders
and the Lender Counterparties; and third, to the extent of any excess of such proceeds, to the
payment to or upon the order of the applicable Grantor or to whosoever may be lawfully
entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.
9.3 Sales on Credit. If Collateral Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit, Grantor will be
credited only with payments actually made by purchaser and received by Collateral Agent and
applied to indebtedness of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the
Collateral, Collateral Agent may resell the Collateral and the Grantors shall be credited with
proceeds of the sale.
9.4 Investment Related Property. Each Grantor recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, the Collateral
Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Investment Related
Property conducted without prior registration or qualification of such Investment Related
Property under the Securities Act and/or such state securities laws, to limit purchasers to
those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the Investment Related Property for their
own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each
Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable
than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public
offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act) and,
notwithstanding such circumstances, each Grantor agrees that any such private sale shall be
deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Collateral Agent
shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any
Investment Related Property for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to
register it for a form of public sale requiring registration under the Securities Act or under
applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would, or should, agree to so register it. If
the Collateral Agent determines to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Investment Related
Property, upon written request, each Grantor shall and shall cause each issuer of any Pledged
Stock to be sold hereunder, each partnership and each limited liability company from time to
time to furnish to the Collateral Agent all such information as the Collateral Agent may request
in order to determine the number and nature of
26
interest, shares or other instruments included in the Investment Related Property which may
be sold by the Collateral Agent in exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from
time to time in effect.
9.5 Grant of Intellectual Property License. For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent,
during the continuance of an Event of Default, to exercise rights and remedies under Section 9
hereof at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and
remedies, and for no other purpose, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, to the
extent assignable, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of
royalty or other compensation to such Grantor), subject, in the case of Trademarks, to
sufficient rights to quality control and inspection in favor of such Grantor to avoid the risk of
invalidation of such Trademarks, to use, assign, license or sublicense any of the Intellectual
Property now owned or hereafter acquired, developed or created by such Grantor, wherever
the same may be located. Such license shall include access to all media in which any of the
licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the
compilation or printout hereof and shall terminate upon Payment in Full of the Obligations.
9.6 Intellectual Property.
(a) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in addition to the other rights
and remedies provided herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event
of Default:
(i) the Collateral Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to bring suit or otherwise
commence any action or proceeding in the name of any Grantor, the Collateral Agent or
otherwise, in the Collateral Agent’s sole discretion, to enforce any Intellectual Property rights
of such Grantor, in which event such Grantor shall, at the request of the Collateral Agent, do
any and all lawful acts and execute any and all documents required by the Collateral Agent in
aid of such enforcement, and such Grantor shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse and
indemnify the Collateral Agent as provided in Section 12 hereof in connection with the exercise
of its rights under this Section 9.6, and, to the extent that the Collateral Agent shall elect not to
bring suit to enforce any Intellectual Property rights as provided in this Section 9.6, each
Grantor agrees to use all reasonable measures, whether by action, suit, proceeding or
otherwise, to prevent the infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of any of
such Grantor’s rights in the Intellectual Property by others and for that purpose agrees to
diligently maintain any action, suit or proceeding against any Person so infringing,
misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating as shall be necessary to prevent such
infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation;
(ii) upon written demand from the Collateral Agent, each Grantor shall grant, assign, convey or
otherwise transfer to the Collateral Agent or such Collateral Agent’s designee all of such
Grantor’s right, title and interest in and to any Intellectual Property and shall execute and
deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry out
the intent and purposes of this Agreement;
(iii) each Grantor agrees that such an assignment and/or recording shall be applied to reduce
the Secured Obligations outstanding only to the extent that the Collateral Agent (or any other
Secured Party) receives cash proceeds in respect of the sale of, or other realization upon, any
such Intellectual Property;
27
(iv) within five (5) Business Days after written notice from the Collateral Agent, each Grantor
shall make available to the Collateral Agent, to the extent within such Grantor’s power and
authority, such personnel in such Grantor’s employ on the date of such Event of Default as the
Collateral Agent may reasonably designate, by name, title or job responsibility, to permit such
Grantor to continue, directly or indirectly, to produce, advertise and sell the products and
services sold or delivered by such Grantor under or in connection with any Trademarks or
Trademark Licenses, such persons to be available to perform their prior functions on the
Collateral Agent’s behalf and to be compensated by the Collateral Agent at such Grantor’s
expense on a per diem, pro-rata basis consistent with the salary and benefit structure
applicable to each as of the date of such Event of Default; and
(v) the Collateral Agent shall have the right to notify, or require each Grantor to notify, any
obligors with respect to amounts due or to become due to such Grantor in respect of any
Intellectual Property of such Grantor, of the existence of the security interest created herein, to
direct such obligors to make payment of all such amounts directly to the Collateral Agent, and,
upon such notification and at the expense of such Grantor, to enforce collection of any such
amounts and to adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same
manner and to the same extent as such Grantor might have done.
(b) If (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and, by reason of cure, waiver, modification,
amendment or otherwise, no longer be continuing, (ii) no other Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, (iii) an assignment or other transfer to the Collateral Agent of any
rights, title and interests in and to any Intellectual Property of such Grantor shall have been
previously made and shall have become absolute and effective, and (iv) the Secured
Obligations shall not have become immediately due and payable, upon the written request of
any Grantor, the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to such Grantor, at such
Grantor’s sole cost and expense, such assignments or other transfer as may be necessary to
reassign to such Grantor any such rights, title and interests as may have been assigned to the
Collateral Agent as aforesaid, subject to any disposition thereof that may have been made by
the Collateral Agent; provided, after giving effect to such reassignment, the Collateral Agent’s
security interest granted pursuant hereto, as well as all other rights and remedies of the
Collateral Agent granted hereunder, shall continue to be in full force and effect; and provided
further, the rights, title and interests so reassigned shall be free and clear of any other Liens
granted by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties.
9.7 Cash Proceeds; Deposit Accounts. (a) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in addition to the rights of the Collateral Agent specified in Section 6.5 with respect
to payments of Receivables, all proceeds of any Collateral received by any Grantor consisting
of cash, checks and other near-cash items (collectively, “Cash Proceeds”) shall be held by
such Grantor in trust for the Collateral Agent, segregated from other funds of such Grantor,
and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Collateral Agent in the
exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Collateral Agent, if
required) and held by the Collateral Agent in a Collateral Account. Any Cash Proceeds
received by the Collateral Agent (whether from a Grantor or otherwise) may, in the sole
discretion of the Collateral Agent, (A) be held by the Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of
the Secured Parties, as collateral security for the Secured Obligations (whether matured or
unmatured) and/or (B) then or at any time thereafter may be applied by the Collateral Agent
against the Secured Obligations then due and owing.
28
(b) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may
apply the balance from any Deposit Account or instruct the bank at which any Deposit
Account is maintained to pay the balance of any Deposit Account to or for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent.
SECTION 10. COLLATERAL AGENT.
The Collateral Agent has been appointed to act as Collateral Agent hereunder by Lenders and,
by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, the other Secured Parties. The Collateral Agent
shall be obligated, and shall have the right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to
exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action
(including, without limitation, the release or substitution of Collateral), solely in accordance
with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of
this Section, each Secured Party, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall
have no right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral hereunder, it being understood
and agreed by such Secured Party that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised
solely by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of
this Section.
SECTION 11. CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF LOANS.
This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall remain in
full force and effect until the Payment in Full of all Secured Obligations, be binding upon each
Grantor, its successors and assigns, and inure, together with the rights and remedies of the
Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and its successors,
transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the
terms of the Credit Agreement, any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any Loans held
by it to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the
benefits in respect thereof granted to Lenders herein or otherwise. Upon the Payment in Full of
all Secured Obligations, the security interest granted hereby shall automatically terminate
hereunder without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party and all
rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors. Upon any such termination the Collateral
Agent shall, at the Grantors’ expense, execute and deliver to the Grantors or otherwise
authorize the filing of such documents as the Grantors shall reasonably request, including
financing statement amendments to evidence such termination and shall deliver to the
applicable Grantor any Collateral of such Grantor held by the Collateral Agent hereunder.
Upon any disposition of property permitted by the Credit Agreement, the Liens granted herein
shall be deemed to be automatically released and such property shall automatically revert to
the applicable Grantor with no further action on the part of any Person. The Collateral Agent
shall, at the applicable Grantor’s expense, execute and deliver or otherwise authorize the filing
of such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, including financing statement amendments to
evidence such release and shall deliver to the applicable Grantor any Collateral of such
Grantor held by the Collateral Agent hereunder, to the extent applicable.
SECTION 12. STANDARD OF CARE; COLLATERAL AGENT MAY PERFORM.
The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the
Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the
exercise of reasonable care in the custody of any Collateral in its possession and the
accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have no
duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against
prior
29
parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to
have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral in its possession
if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Collateral Agent
accords its own property and in compliance with applicable laws. Neither the Collateral Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand,
collect or realize upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be
under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any
Grantor or otherwise. If any Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein after the
applicable cure period with respect thereto, the Collateral Agent may itself perform, or cause
performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in
connection therewith shall be payable by each Grantor under Section 10.02 of the Credit
Agreement.
SECTION 13. MISCELLANEOUS.
Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be given in
accordance with Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement. No failure or delay on the part of the
Collateral Agent in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of
any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power,
right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or
privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.
In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby. All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such
covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within
the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default if such action is taken or condition exists. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Grantors and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. No Grantor shall, without the prior written consent of the Collateral
Agent given in accordance with the Credit Agreement, assign any right, duty or obligation
hereunder. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and
understanding between the Grantors and the Collateral Agent and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings between such parties relating to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. Accordingly, the Loan Documents may not be contradicted by evidence of prior,
contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral
agreements between the parties. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple
separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are
physically attached to the same document. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission will be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER
AND ALL CLAIMS AND CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT LAW, TORT LAW OR OTHERWISE SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE
30
STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS THAT
WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW (OTHER THAN ANY
MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF THE UCC RELATING TO THE LAW GOVERNING PERFECTION
AND THE EFFECT OF PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST GRANTED HEREBY).
THE PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT UNDER THE HEADINGS “CONSENT TO
JURISDICTION” AND “WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL” ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY THIS
REFERENCE AND SUCH INCORPORATION SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THE
CREDIT AGREEMENT.

the Issuer will promptly notify the Collateral Agent and the Pledgor thereof; and
(d) This Uncertificated Securities Control Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation

Section 6. Voting Rights. Until such time as the Collateral Agent shall otherwise instruct the
Issuer in writing, the Pledgor shall have the right to vote the Pledged Shares. The Collateral
Agent agrees with the Pledgor that the Collateral Agent shall not deliver any such instructions

SECURITIES ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT
This Securities Account Control Agreement dated as of [            ], 20[    ] (this “Agreement”)
among [                    ] (the “Debtor”), Barclays Bank PLC, as collateral agent for the Secured
Parties (together with its successors and assigns, the “Collateral Agent”) and [                    ], in
its capacity as a “securities intermediary” as defined in Section 8-102 of the UCC (in such
capacity, the “Securities Intermediary”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall
have the meaning assigned thereto in the U.S. Pledge and Security Agreement, dated August
[    ], 2010, among the Debtor, the other Grantors party thereto and the Collateral Agent (as
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Security
Agreement”). All references herein to the “UCC” shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as
in effect in the State of New York.
Section 1. Establishment of Securities Account. The Securities Intermediary hereby confirms
and agrees that:
(a) The Securities Intermediary has established account number [IDENTIFY ACCOUNT
NUMBER] in the name “[IDENTIFY EXACT TITLE OF ACCOUNT]” (such account and any
successor account, the “Securities Account”) and the Securities Intermediary shall not
change the name or account number of the Securities Account without the prior written
consent of the Collateral Agent;
(b) All securities or other property underlying any financial assets credited to the Securities
Account shall be registered in the name of the Securities Intermediary, indorsed to the
Securities Intermediary or in blank or credited to another securities account maintained in the
name of the Securities Intermediary and in no case will any financial asset credited to the
Securities Account be registered in the name of the Debtor, payable to the order of the Debtor
or specially indorsed to the Debtor except to the extent the foregoing have been specially
indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank;
(c) All property delivered to the Securities Intermediary pursuant to the Security Agreement will
be promptly credited to the Securities Account; and
(d) The Securities Account is a “securities account” within the meaning of Section 8-501 of the
UCC.
Section 2. “Financial Assets” Election. The Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that each
item of property (including, without limitation, any investment property, financial asset,
security, instrument, general intangible or cash) credited to the Securities Account shall be
treated as a “financial asset” within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.
Section 3. Control of the Securities Account. If at any time the Securities Intermediary shall
receive any order from the Collateral Agent directing transfer or redemption of any financial
asset relating to the Securities Account, the Securities Intermediary shall comply with such
entitlement order without further consent by the Debtor or any other person. If the Debtor is
otherwise entitled to issue entitlement orders and such orders conflict with any entitlement
order issued by the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary shall follow the orders issued
by the Collateral Agent.
EXHIBIT C-1
Section 4. Subordination of Lien; Waiver of Set-Off. In the event that the Securities Intermediary
has or subsequently obtains by agreement, by operation of law or otherwise a security interest
in the Securities Account or any security entitlement credited thereto, the Securities
Intermediary hereby agrees that such security interest shall be subordinate to the security
interest of the Collateral Agent. The financial assets and other items deposited to the
Securities Account will not be subject to deduction, set-off, banker’s lien, or any other right in
favor of any person other than the Collateral Agent (except that the Securities Intermediary
may set off (i) all amounts due to the Securities Intermediary in respect of customary fees and
expenses for the routine maintenance and operation of the Securities Account and (ii) the face
amount of any checks which have been credited to such Securities Account but are
subsequently returned unpaid because of uncollected or insufficient funds).
Section 5. Choice of Law. This Agreement and the Securities Account shall each be governed
by the laws of the State of New York. Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for
purposes of the UCC, New York shall be deemed to be the Securities Intermediary’s
jurisdiction (within the meaning of Section 8-110 of the UCC) and the Securities Account (as
well as the securities entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by the laws of the State of
New York.
Section 6. Conflict with Other Agreements.
(a) In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any other
agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail;
(b) No amendment or modification of this Agreement or waiver of any right hereunder shall be
binding on any party hereto unless it is in writing and is signed by all of the parties hereto;
(c) The Securities Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that:
(i) There are no other control agreements entered into between the Securities Intermediary and
the Debtor with respect to the Securities Account;
(ii) It has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement, will not enter into, any
agreement with any other person relating to the Securities Account and/or any financial assets
credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with entitlement orders (as defined
in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the UCC) of such other person; and
(iii) It has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement, will not enter into, any
agreement with the Debtor or the Collateral Agent purporting to limit or condition the obligation
of the Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders as set forth in Section 3 hereof.
Section 7. Adverse Claims. Except for the claims and interest of the Collateral Agent and of the
Debtor in the Securities Account, the Securities Intermediary does not know of any claim to, or
interest in, the Securities Account or in any “financial asset” (as defined in Section 8-102(a) of
the UCC) credited thereto. If any person asserts any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim
(including any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar
process) against the Securities Account or in any financial asset carried therein, the Securities
Intermediary will promptly notify the Collateral Agent and the Debtor thereof.
EXHIBIT C-2
Section 8. Maintenance of Securities Account. In addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of
the Securities Intermediary to honor entitlement orders as agreed in Section 3 hereof, the
Securities Intermediary agrees to maintain the Securities Account as follows:
(a) Notice of Sole Control. If at any time the Collateral Agent delivers to the Securities
Intermediary a Notice of Sole Control in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, the
Securities Intermediary agrees that after receipt of such notice, it will take all instruction with
respect to the Securities Account solely from the Collateral Agent.
(b) Voting Rights. Until such time as the Securities Intermediary receives a Notice of Sole
Control pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 8, the Debtor shall direct the Securities
Intermediary with respect to the voting of any financial assets credited to the Securities
Account.
(c) Permitted Investments. Until such time as the Securities Intermediary receives a Notice of
Sole Control signed by the Collateral Agent, the Debtor may deliver entitlement orders with
respect to the Securities Account and shall direct the Securities Intermediary with respect to
the selection of investments to be made for the Securities Account; provided, however, that
the Securities Intermediary shall not honor any instruction to purchase any investments other
than investments of a type described on Exhibit B hereto.
(d) Statements and Confirmations. The Securities Intermediary will promptly send copies of all
statements, confirmations and other correspondence concerning the Securities Account
and/or any financial assets credited thereto simultaneously to each of the Debtor and the
Collateral Agent at the address for each set forth in Section 12 of this Agreement.
(e) Tax Reporting. All items of income, gain, expense and loss recognized in the Securities
Account shall be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and all state and local taxing
authorities under the name and taxpayer identification number of the Debtor.
Section 9. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Securities Intermediary. The
Securities Intermediary hereby makes the following representations, warranties and
covenants:
(a) The Securities Account has been established as set forth in Section 1 above and such
Securities Account will be maintained in the manner set forth herein until termination of this
Agreement; and
(b) This Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Securities Intermediary,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or limiting creditors’ rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability.
Section 10 Indemnification of Securities Intermediary. The Debtor and the Collateral Agent
hereby agree that (a) the Securities Intermediary is released from any and all liabilities to the
Debtor and the Collateral Agent arising from the terms of this Agreement and the compliance
of the Securities Intermediary with the terms hereof, except to the extent that such liabilities
arise from the Securities Intermediary’s negligence and (b) the Debtor, its successors and
assigns shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Securities Intermediary from and
against any and all
EXHIBIT C-3
claims, actions and suits of others arising out of the terms of this Agreement or the compliance
of the Securities Intermediary with the terms hereof, except to the extent that such arises from
the Securities Intermediary’s negligence, and from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, costs, charges, counsel fees and other expenses of every nature and character
arising by reason of the same, until the termination of this Agreement. This Section does not
apply to any costs, damages, liabilities or losses attributable to the gross negligence or
intentional misconduct of the Securities Intermediary.
Section 11. Successors; Assignment. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and
shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective corporate successors or
heirs and personal representatives who obtain such rights solely by operation of law. The
Collateral Agent may assign its rights hereunder only with the express written consent of the
Securities Intermediary and by sending thirty (30) days prior written notice (or such time as the
Debtor may agree) of such assignment to the Debtor.

DEPOSIT ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT
This Deposit Account Control Agreement dated as of [                    ], 20[    ] (this “Agreement”)
among [                    ] (the “Debtor”), Barclays Bank PLC, as collateral agent for the Secured
Parties (together with its successors and assigns, the “Collateral Agent”) and [                    ], in
its capacity as a “bank” as defined in Section 9-102(a) of the UCC (in such capacity, the
“Financial Institution”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning
assigned thereto in the U.S. Pledge and Security Agreement, dated August [    ], 2010, among
the Debtor, the other Grantors party thereto and the Collateral Agent (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Security Agreement”). All
references herein to the “UCC” shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the
State of New York.
Section 1. Establishment of Deposit Account. The Financial Institution hereby confirms and
agrees that:
(a) The Financial Institution has established account number [IDENTIFY ACCOUNT NUMBER]
in the name “[IDENTIFY EXACT TITLE OF ACCOUNT]” (such account and any successor
account, the “Deposit Account”) and the Financial Institution shall not change the name or
account number of the Deposit Account without the prior written consent of the Collateral
Agent and, prior to delivery of a Notice of Sole Control in substantially the form set forth in
Exhibit A hereto, the Debtor; and
(b) The Deposit Account is a “deposit account” within the meaning of Section 9-102(a)(29) of
the UCC.
Section 2. Control of the Deposit Account. If at any time the Financial Institution shall receive
any instructions originated by the Collateral Agent directing the disposition of funds in the
Deposit Account, the Financial Institution shall comply with such instructions without further
consent by the Debtor or any other person. The Financial Institution hereby acknowledges that
it has received notice of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Deposit Account
and hereby acknowledges and consents to such lien. If the Debtor is otherwise entitled to
issue instructions and such instructions conflict with any instructions issued the Collateral
Agent, the Financial Institution shall follow the instructions issued by the Collateral Agent.
Section 3. Subordination of Lien; Waiver of Set-Off. In the event that the Financial Institution
has or subsequently obtains by agreement, by operation of law or otherwise a security interest
in the Deposit Account or any funds credited thereto, the Financial Institution hereby agrees
that such security interest shall be subordinate to the security interest of the Collateral Agent.
Money and other items credited to the Deposit Account will not be subject to deduction, set-
off, banker’s lien, or any other right in favor of any person other than the Collateral Agent
(except that the Financial Institution may set off (i) all amounts due to the Financial Institution
in respect of customary fees and expenses for the routine maintenance and operation of the
Deposit Account and (ii) the face amount of any checks which have been credited to such
Deposit Account but are subsequently returned unpaid because of uncollected or insufficient
funds).
EXHIBIT D-1
Section 4. Choice of Law. This Agreement and the Deposit Account shall each be governed by
the laws of the State of New York. Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for
purposes of the UCC, New York shall be deemed to be the Financial Institution’s jurisdiction
(within the meaning of Section 9-304 of the UCC) and the Deposit Account shall be governed
by the laws of the State of New York.
Section 5. Conflict with Other Agreements.
(a) In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any other
agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail;
(b) No amendment or modification of this Agreement or waiver of any right hereunder shall be
binding on any party hereto unless it is in writing and is signed by all of the parties hereto; and
(c) The Financial Institution hereby confirms and agrees that:
(i) There are no other agreements entered into between the Financial Institution and the Debtor
with respect to the Deposit Account [other than                     ]; and
(ii) It has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement, will not enter into, any
agreement with any other person relating the Deposit Account and/or any funds credited
thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with instructions originated by such
persons as contemplated by Section 9-104 of the UCC.
Section 6. Adverse Claims. The Financial Institution does not know of any liens, claims or
encumbrances relating to the Deposit Account. If any person asserts any lien, encumbrance or
adverse claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or
similar process) against the Deposit Account, the Financial Institution will promptly notify the
Collateral Agent and the Debtor thereof.
Section 7. Maintenance of Deposit Account. In addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of
the Financial Institution to honor instructions as set forth in Section 2 hereof, the Financial
Institution agrees to maintain the Deposit Account as follows:
(a) Notice of Sole Control. If at any time the Collateral Agent delivers to the Financial Institution
a Notice of Sole Control in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, the Financial
Institution agrees that after receipt of such notice, it will take all instruction with respect to the
Deposit Account solely from the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent agrees that prior to the
delivery of the Notice of Sole Control, the Financial Institution may follow all instructions from
the Debtor with respect to the Deposit Account.
(b) Statements and Confirmations. The Financial Institution will promptly send copies of all
statements, confirmations and other correspondence concerning the Deposit Account
simultaneously to each of the Debtor and the Collateral Agent at the address for each set forth
in Section 11 of this Agreement; and
(c) Tax Reporting. All interest, if any, relating to the Deposit Account, shall be reported to the
Internal Revenue Service and all state and local taxing authorities under the name and
taxpayer identification number of the Debtor.
EXHIBIT D-2
Section 8. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Financial Institution. The
Financial Institution hereby makes the following representations, warranties and covenants:
(a) The Deposit Account has been established as set forth in Section 1 and such Deposit
Account will be maintained in the manner set forth herein until termination of this Agreement;
and
(b) This Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Financial Institution, except
as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or limiting creditors’ rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability.
Section 9. Indemnification of Financial Institution. The Debtor and the Collateral Agent hereby
agree that (a) the Financial Institution is released from any and all liabilities to the Debtor and
the Collateral Agent arising from the terms of this Agreement and the compliance of the
Financial Institution with the terms hereof, except to the extent that such liabilities arise from
the Financial Institution’s negligence and (b) the Debtor, its successors and assigns shall at all
times indemnify and save harmless the Financial Institution from and against any and all
claims, actions and suits of others arising out of the terms of this Agreement or the compliance
of the Financial Institution with the terms hereof, except to the extent that such arises from the
Financial Institution’s negligence, and from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
costs, charges, counsel fees and other expenses of every nature and character arising by
reason of the same, until the termination of this Agreement. This Section does not apply to any
costs, damages, liabilities or losses attributable to the gross negligence or intentional
misconduct of the Securities Intermediary.
Section 10. Successors; Assignment. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and
shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective corporate successors or
heirs and personal representatives who obtain such rights solely by operation of law. The
Collateral Agent may assign its rights hereunder only with the express written consent of the
Financial Institution and by sending thirty (30) days prior written notice (or such lesser time as
Debtor may agree) of such assignment to the Debtor.
Section 11 Notices. Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be
given under this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to have been properly given when

2
“UCC” means the Uniform Commercial Code of New York or, if the creation, perfection and
enforcement of any security interest herein granted is governed by the laws of a state other
than New York, then, as to the matter in question, the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in
that state.
1.2 Interpretation. References to “Sections” shall be to Sections of this Mortgage unless
otherwise specifically provided. Section headings in this Mortgage are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Mortgage for any other
purpose or be given any substantive effect. The rules of construction set forth in Section 1.03
of the Credit Agreement shall be applicable to this Mortgage mutatis mutandis. If any conflict or
inconsistency exists between this Mortgage and the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement
shall govern.
SECTION 2. GRANT
To secure the Payment In Full, and the full performance of, the Obligations, Mortgagor
MORTGAGES, GRANTS, BARGAINS, ASSIGNS, SELLS and CONVEYS WITH POWER OF
SALE (if available under applicable state law), to Mortgagee the Mortgaged Property, subject,
however, to the Permitted Liens, TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Mortgaged Property to
Mortgagee, and Mortgagor does hereby bind itself, its successors and assigns to WARRANT
AND FOREVER DEFEND the title to the Mortgaged Property unto Mortgagee for so long as any
of the Obligations remain outstanding, upon the trust, terms and conditions contained herein.
SECTION 3. WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS
3.1 Title. Mortgagor represents and warrants to Mortgagee that except for the Permitted Liens,
(a) Mortgagor owns the Mortgaged Property free and clear of any liens, claims or interests, and
(b) this Mortgage creates valid, enforceable first priority liens and security interests against the
Mortgaged Property.
3.2 First Lien Status. Mortgagor shall preserve and protect the first lien and security interest
status of this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents to the extent related to the Mortgaged
Property. If any lien or security interest other than a Permitted Lien is asserted against the
Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor shall promptly, and at its expense, (a) give Mortgagee a
detailed written notice of such lien or security interest (including origin, amount and other
terms), and (b) pay the underlying claim in full or take such other action so as to cause it to be
released.
3.3 Payment and Performance. Mortgagor shall pay and perform the Obligations in full when
they are required to be performed as required under the Loan Documents.
3.4 Replacement of Fixtures and Personalty. Except as otherwise permitted in the Credit
Agreement, Mortgagor shall not, without the prior written consent of Mortgagee, permit any of
the Fixtures or Personalty to be removed at any time from the Land or Improvements, unless
the removed item is removed temporarily for maintenance and repair or, if removed
permanently, is obsolete and is replaced by an article of equal or better suitability and value,
owned by Mortgagor subject to the liens and security interests of this Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents, and free and clear of any other lien or security interest except such as may
be permitted under the Credit Agreement or first approved in writing by Mortgagee.
3.5 Inspection. Mortgagor shall permit Mortgagee, and Mortgagee’s agents, representatives
and employees to inspect the Mortgaged Property and all books and records of Mortgagor
located thereon, and to conduct such environmental and engineering studies as set forth in
the Credit Agreement.
3.6 Covenants Running with the Land. All Obligations contained in this Mortgage are intended
by Mortgagor and Mortgagee to be, and shall be construed as, covenants running with the
Mortgaged Property. As used herein, “Mortgagor” shall refer to the party named in the first
paragraph of this Mortgage and to any subsequent owner of all or any portion of the
Mortgaged Property. All Persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Mortgaged
Property shall be deemed to have notice of, and be bound by, the terms of the Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents; however, no such party shall be entitled to any
rights thereunder without the prior written consent of Mortgagee. In addition, all of the
covenants of Mortgagor in any Loan Document party thereto are incorporated herein by
reference and, together with covenants in this Section, shall be covenants running with the
land.
3
3.7 Condemnation Awards and Insurance Proceeds. Except as otherwise stated in the Credit
Agreement: (i) Mortgagor assigns all awards and compensation to which it is entitled for any
condemnation or other taking, or any purchase in lieu thereof, to Mortgagee and authorizes
Mortgagee to collect and receive such awards and compensation and to give proper receipts
and acquittances therefor, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement; (ii) Mortgagor assigns
to Mortgagee all proceeds of any insurance policies insuring against loss or damage to the
Mortgaged Property, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement; and (iii) Mortgagor
authorizes Mortgagee to collect and receive such proceeds and authorizes and directs the
issuer of each of such insurance policies to make payment for all such losses directly to
Mortgagee, instead of to Mortgagor and Mortgagee jointly, subject to the terms of the Credit
Agreement.
3.8 Change in Tax Law. Upon the enactment of or change in (including, without limitation, a
change in interpretation of) any applicable law subjecting Mortgagee or any of the Lenders to
any tax or changing the basis of taxation of mortgages, deeds of trust, or other liens or debts
secured thereby, or the manner of collection of such taxes so as to affect this Mortgage, the
Obligations or Mortgagee, and the result is to increase the taxes imposed upon or the cost to
Mortgagee of maintaining the Obligations, or to reduce the amount of any payments receivable
hereunder, then, and in any such event, Mortgagor shall, on demand, pay to Mortgagee and
the Lenders additional amounts to compensate for such increased costs or reduced amounts,
provided that if any such payment or reimbursement shall be unlawful, or taxable to
Mortgagee, or would constitute usury or render the Obligations wholly or partially usurious
under applicable law, then Mortgagor shall pay or reimburse Mortgagee or the Lenders for
payment of the lawful and non-usurious portion thereof.
3.9 Mortgage Tax. Mortgagor shall (i) pay when due any tax imposed upon it or upon
Mortgagee or any Lender or Lender Counterparty pursuant to the tax law of the state in which
the Mortgaged Property is located in connection with the execution, delivery and recordation
of this Mortgage and any of the other Loan Documents, subject, however, to Mortgagor’s right
to contest the amount or validity thereof in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and
(ii) prepare, execute and file any form required to be prepared, executed and filed in connection
therewith.
3.10 Reduction Of Secured Amount. In the event that the amount secured by the Mortgage is
less than the Obligations, then the amount secured shall be reduced only by the last and final
sums that the Borrowers repay (or are repaid on behalf of the Borrowers) with respect to the
Obligations and shall not be reduced by any intervening repayments of the Obligations unless
arising from the Mortgaged Property. So long as the balance of the Obligations exceeds the
amount secured, any payments of the Obligations shall not be deemed to be applied against,
or to reduce, the portion of the Obligations secured by this Mortgage. Such payments shall
instead be deemed to reduce only such portions of the Obligations as are secured by other
collateral located outside of the state in which the Mortgaged Property is located or as are
unsecured.
3.11 Prohibited Transfers. Except as permitted by the Credit Agreement, Mortgagor shall not,
without the prior written consent of Mortgagee, sell, lease or convey all or any part of the
Mortgaged Property.
SECTION 4. DEFAULT AND FORECLOSURE
4.1 Remedies. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Mortgagee may, at
Mortgagee’s election, exercise any or all of the following rights, remedies and recourses:
(a) declare the Obligations to be immediately due and payable, without further notice,
presentment, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand or action of
any nature whatsoever except as provided in the Credit Agreement, whereupon the same shall
become immediately due and payable; and (b) exercise all rights and remedies provided in the
Loan Documents or at law or in equity.
4.2 Entry and Foreclosure. If Mortgagor remains in possession of the Mortgaged Property after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and without Mortgagee’s
prior written consent, Mortgagee may (a) invoke any legal remedies to dispossess Mortgagor;
(b) hold, lease, develop, manage, operate or otherwise use the Mortgaged Property upon such
terms and conditions as Mortgagee may deem reasonable under the circumstances (making
such repairs, alterations, additions and improvements and taking other actions, from time to
4
time, as Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable), and apply all Rents and other amounts
collected by Mortgagee in connection therewith in accordance with the provisions hereof;
(c) institute proceedings for the complete foreclosure of this Mortgage, either by judicial action
or by power of sale, in which case the Mortgaged Property may be sold for cash or credit in
one or more parcels. With respect to any notices required or permitted under the UCC,
Mortgagor agrees that ten (10) days’ prior written notice shall be deemed commercially
reasonable. At any such sale by virtue of any judicial proceedings, power of sale, or any other
legal right, remedy or recourse, the title to and right of possession of any such property shall
pass to the purchaser thereof, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, Mortgagor shall be
completely and irrevocably divested of all of its right, title, interest, claim, equity, equity of
redemption, and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, in and to the property sold and
such sale shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against Mortgagor, and against all
other Persons claiming or to claim the property sold or any part thereof, by, through or under
Mortgagor. Mortgagee or any of the Lenders may be a purchaser at such sale and if Mortgagee
is the highest bidder, Mortgagee shall credit the portion of the purchase price that would be
distributed to Mortgagee against the Obligations in lieu of paying cash. In the event this
Mortgage is foreclosed by judicial action, appraisement of the Mortgaged Property is waived;
and/or (d) make application to a court of competent jurisdiction for, and obtain from such court
as a matter of strict right and without notice to Mortgagor or regard to the adequacy of the
Mortgaged Property for the repayment of the Obligations, the appointment of a receiver of the
Mortgaged Property, and Mortgagor irrevocably consents to such appointment. Any such
receiver shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers in similar cases, including the
full power to rent, maintain and otherwise operate the Mortgaged Property upon such terms as
may be approved by the court, and shall apply such Rents in accordance with the provisions
hereof.
4.3 Separate Sales. The Mortgaged Property may be sold in one or more parcels and in such
manner and order as Mortgagee in its sole discretion may elect; the right of sale arising out of
the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default shall not be exhausted by any one or
more sales.
4.4 Remedies Cumulative, Concurrent and Nonexclusive. Mortgagee shall have all rights,
remedies and recourses granted in the Loan Documents and available at law or equity
(including the UCC), which rights (a) shall be cumulated and concurrent, (b) may be pursued
separately, successively or concurrently against Mortgagor or others obligated under the
Loan Documents, or against the Mortgaged Property, or against any one or more of them, at
the sole discretion of Mortgagee or the Lenders, (c) may be exercised as often as occasion
therefor shall arise, and the exercise or failure to exercise any of them shall not be construed
as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy or recourse, and (d) are intended to
be, and shall be, nonexclusive.
4.5 Release of and Resort to Collateral. Mortgagee may release, regardless of consideration,
any part of the Mortgaged Property without, as to the remainder, in any way impairing,
affecting, subordinating or releasing the lien or security interest created in or evidenced by the
Loan Documents or their status as a first priority lien and security interest in and to the
Mortgaged Property. For payment of the Obligations, Mortgagee may resort to any other
security in such order and manner as Mortgagee may elect.
4.6 Waiver of Redemption, Notice and Marshalling of Assets. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, Mortgagor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and releases (a) all benefit that
might accrue to Mortgagor by virtue of any present or future statute of limitations or law or
judicial decision exempting the Mortgaged Property from attachment, levy or sale on execution
or providing for any stay of execution, exemption from civil process, redemption or extension
of time for payment; (b) all notices of any Event of Default or of Mortgagee’s election to
exercise or the actual exercise of any right, remedy or recourse provided for under the Loan
Documents except as provided in the Credit Agreement; and (c) any right to a marshalling of
assets or a sale in inverse order of alienation. The Borrowers waive the statutory right of
redemption and equity of redemption.
4.7 Discontinuance of Proceedings. If Mortgagee or the Lenders shall have proceeded to
invoke any right, remedy or recourse permitted under the Loan Documents and shall thereafter
elect to discontinue or abandon it for any reason, Mortgagee or the Lenders shall have the
unqualified right to do so and, in such an event, Mortgagor and Mortgagee or the Lenders shall
be restored to their former positions with respect to the Obligations, the Obligations, the Loan
Documents, the Mortgaged Property and otherwise, and the rights, remedies, recourses and
powers of Mortgagee or the Lenders shall continue as if the right, remedy or recourse had
never been invoked, but no such discontinuance or abandonment shall waive any Event of
Default which may then exist or the right of Mortgagee or the Lenders thereafter to exercise
any right, remedy or recourse under the Loan Documents for such continuing Event of
Default.
5
4.8 Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale of, and the Rents and other amounts
generated by the holding, leasing, management, operation or other use of the Mortgaged
Property, shall be applied by Mortgagee (or the receiver, if one is appointed) in accordance
with Section 2.15 of the Credit Agreement.
4.9 Occupancy After Foreclosure. Any sale of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof will
divest all right, title and interest of Mortgagor in and to the property sold. Subject to applicable
law, any purchaser at a foreclosure sale will receive immediate possession of the property
purchased. If Mortgagor retains possession of such property or any part thereof subsequent
to such sale, Mortgagor will be considered a tenant at sufferance of the purchaser, and will, if
Mortgagor remains in possession after demand to remove, be subject to eviction and removal,
forcible or otherwise, with or without process of law.
4.10 Additional Advances and Disbursements; Costs of Enforcement. If any Event of Default
exists, Mortgagee and each of the Lenders shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure
such Event of Default in the name and on behalf of Mortgagor in accordance with the Credit
Agreement. All sums advanced and expenses incurred at any time by Mortgagee or any
Lender under this Section, or otherwise under this Mortgage or any of the other Loan
Documents or applicable law, shall bear interest from the date that such sum is advanced or
expense incurred if not repaid within five (5) days after demand therefor, to and including the
date of reimbursement, computed at the rate or rates at which interest is then computed on the
Obligations, and all such sums, together with interest thereon, shall be secured by this
Mortgage. Mortgagor shall pay all expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses) of or incidental to the perfection and enforcement of this Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents, or the enforcement, compromise or settlement of the Obligations or any
claim under this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, and for the curing thereof, or for
defending or asserting the rights and claims of Mortgagee or the Lenders in respect thereof, by
litigation or otherwise.
4.11 No Mortgagee in Possession. Neither the enforcement of any of the remedies under this
Section, the assignment of the Rents and Leases under Section 5, the security interests under
Section 6, nor any other remedies afforded to Mortgagee or the Lenders under the Loan
Documents, at law or in equity shall cause Mortgagee or any Lender to be deemed or
construed to be a mortgagee in possession of the Mortgaged Property, to obligate Mortgagee
or any Lender to lease the Mortgaged Property or attempt to do so, or to take any action, incur
any expense, or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability whatsoever under any of
the Leases or otherwise.
SECTION 5. ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES
5.1 Assignment. In furtherance of and in addition to the assignment made by Mortgagor herein,
Mortgagor hereby absolutely and unconditionally assigns, transfers and conveys to
Mortgagee all of its right, title and interest in and to all Leases, whether now existing or
hereafter entered into, and all of its right, title and interest in and to all Rents. This assignment
is an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only. So long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Mortgagor shall have a revocable
license from Mortgagee to exercise all rights extended to the landlord under the Leases,
including the right to receive and collect all Rents and to hold the Rents in trust for use in the
payment and performance of the Obligations and to use the Rents in a manner not prohibited
by the Credit Agreement. The foregoing license is granted subject to the conditional limitation
that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, whether or not legal proceedings have
commenced, and without regard to waste, adequacy of security for the Obligations or solvency
of Mortgagor, the license herein granted shall automatically expire and terminate, without
notice by Mortgagee (any such notice being hereby expressly waived by Mortgagor).
5.2 Perfection Upon Recordation. Mortgagor acknowledges that Mortgagee has taken all
reasonable actions necessary to obtain, and that upon recordation of this Mortgage Mortgagee
shall have, to the extent permitted under applicable law, a valid and fully perfected, first priority,
present assignment of the Rents arising out of the Leases and all security for such Leases
subject to the Permitted Liens and in the case of security deposits, rights of depositors and
requirements of law. Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that upon recordation of this
Mortgage Mortgagee’s interest in the Rents shall be deemed to be fully perfected, “choate” and
enforced as to Mortgagor and
6
all third parties, including, without limitation, any subsequently appointed trustee in any case
under the Bankruptcy Code, without the necessity of commencing a foreclosure action with
respect to this Mortgage, making formal demand for the Rents, obtaining the appointment of a
receiver or taking any other affirmative action.
5.3 Bankruptcy Provisions. Without limitation of the absolute nature of the assignment of the
Rents hereunder, Mortgagor and Mortgagee agree that (a) this Mortgage shall constitute a
“security agreement” for purposes of Section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) the security
interest created by this Mortgage extends to property of Mortgagor acquired before the
commencement of a case in bankruptcy and to all amounts paid as Rents, and (c) such
security interest shall extend to all Rents acquired by the estate after the commencement of
any case in bankruptcy.
SECTION 6. SECURITY AGREEMENT
6.1 Security Interest. This Mortgage constitutes a “security agreement” on personal property
within the meaning of the UCC and other applicable law and with respect to the Personalty,
Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds,
Insurance and Condemnation Awards. To this end, Mortgagor grants to Mortgagee a first
priority security interest in the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property

the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax
Refunds, Proceeds, Insurance and Condemnation Awards sent to Mortgagor at least ten

substance reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee, such financing statements and such further
assurances as Mortgagee may, from time to time, reasonably consider necessary to create,

required or permitted by law to so create, perfect and preserve such security interest.
Mortgagor’s chief executive office is at the address set forth in the Credit Agreement.

attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest and with full power of substitution,
(a) to execute and/or record any notices of completion, cessation of labor or any other notices
that Mortgagee deems appropriate to protect Mortgagee’s interest, if Mortgagor shall fail to do
so within ten (10) days after written request by Mortgagee, (b) upon the issuance of a deed
pursuant to the foreclosure of this Mortgage or the delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, to

necessary to create, perfect or preserve Mortgagee’s security interests and rights in or to any

Event of Default, to perform any obligation of Mortgagor hereunder; provided, that
(i) Mortgagee shall not under any circumstances be obligated to perform any obligation of
Mortgagor; (ii) any sums advanced by Mortgagee in such performance shall be added to and
included in the Obligations and shall bear interest at the rate or rates at which interest is then
computed on the Obligations provided that from the date incurred said advance is not repaid
within five (5) days demand therefor; (iii) Mortgagee as such attorney-in-fact shall only be
accountable for such funds as are actually received by Mortgagee; and (iv) Mortgagee shall
not be liable to Mortgagor or any other person or entity for any failure to take any action which
it is empowered to take under this Section.

SECTION 8. MORTGAGEE AS AGENT
Mortgagee has been appointed to act as Mortgagee hereunder by Lenders and, by their
acceptance of the benefits hereof, Lender Counterparties. Mortgagee shall be obligated, and
shall have the right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action (including the release or
substitution of Mortgaged Property), solely in accordance with this Mortgage and the Credit
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Lender
Counterparty, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no right
individually to realize upon any of the Mortgaged Property, it being understood and agreed by
such Lender Counterparty that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by
Mortgagee for the benefit of Lenders and Lender Counterparties in accordance with the terms
of the Credit Agreement. Mortgagee shall at all times be the same Person that is Administrative
Agent under the Credit Agreement. Written notice of resignation by Administrative Agent
pursuant to terms of the Credit Agreement shall also constitute notice of resignation as
Mortgagee under this Mortgage; removal of Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Credit Agreement shall also constitute removal as Mortgagee under this Mortgage; and
appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Agreement shall also constitute appointment of a successor Mortgagee under this Mortgage.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent under the terms of the
Credit Agreement by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring or removed Mortgagee under this Mortgage as set forth in the Credit
Agreement, whereupon such retiring or removed Mortgagee shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations under this Mortgage thereafter accruing as set forth in the Credit
Agreement.
SECTION 9. TERMINATION AND RELEASE.
Upon the Payment In Full of the Obligations, or otherwise in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Credit Agreement, Mortgagee, at Mortgagor’s expense, shall release the liens
and security interests created by this Mortgage or reconvey the Mortgaged Property to
Mortgagor.
SECTION 10. LOCAL LAW PROVISIONS
[to be provided, if any, by local counsel or title company]
SECTION 11. MULTI-SITE REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Mortgagor acknowledges that this Mortgage is one of a number of Mortgages and other
security documents (“Other Mortgages”) that secure the Obligations. Mortgagor agrees that,
subject to the terms of Section 9 hereof, the lien of this Mortgage shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not in any manner be affected or impaired by any acts or omissions
whatsoever of Mortgagee, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the lien hereof
shall not be impaired by any acceptance by Mortgagee of any security for or guarantees of the
Obligations, or by any failure, neglect or omission on the part of Mortgagee to realize upon or
protect any Obligation or any collateral security therefor including the Other Mortgages.
Subject to the terms of Section 9 hereof, the lien of this Mortgage shall not in any manner be
impaired or affected by any release (except as to the property released), sale, pledge,
surrender, compromise, settlement, renewal, extension, indulgence, alteration, changing,
modification or disposition of any of the Obligations or of any of the collateral security therefor,
including the Other Mortgages or any guarantee thereof, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, Mortgagee may at its discretion foreclose, exercise any power of sale, or
exercise any other remedy available to it under any or all of the Other Mortgages without first
exercising or enforcing any of its rights and remedies hereunder. Such exercise of
Mortgagee’s rights and remedies under any or all of the Other Mortgages shall not in any
manner impair the Obligations hereby secured or the lien of this Mortgage and any exercise of
the rights and remedies of Mortgagee hereunder shall not impair the lien of any of the Other
Mortgages or any of Mortgagee’s rights and remedies thereunder. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, Mortgagor specifically consents and agrees that Mortgagee may
exercise its rights and remedies hereunder and under the Other Mortgages separately or
concurrently and in any order that it may deem appropriate and waives any right of
subrogation.

Mortgage shall be given in accordance with the notice provisions of the Credit Agreement to
the address set forth therein.
12.2 Severability. In case any provision in or obligation under this Mortgage shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. All covenants hereunder shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of
such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be
within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

PERFECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE LIENS AND SECURITY INTERESTS HEREIN
GRANTED SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE

12.4 Credit Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency with the terms of this
Mortgage and the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement shall control.
12.5 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence of this Mortgage.

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS
WAIVER IN ITS RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER
WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL
COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS
FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE,
MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN
BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 12.6 AND
EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER WILL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO

of any appraisement, valuation, stay, marshalling of assets, extension, redemption or
moratorium law now or hereafter in force and effect so as to prevent or hinder the enforcement
of the provisions of this Mortgage or the indebtedness secured hereby, or any agreement
between Mortgagor and Mortgagee or any rights or remedies of Mortgagee.

contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral
agreements between the parties.
12.11 Counterparts. This Mortgage is being executed in several counterparts, all of which are

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable

1. Landlord hereby (a) waives and releases unto Collateral Agent and its successors and
assigns any and all rights granted by or under any present or future laws to levy or distraint for

INTERCOMPANY NOTE
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower and certain Subsidiaries of
the U.S. Borrower (collectively, the “Group Members” and each, a “Group Member”) which are
party to this intercompany note (the “Promissory Note”) promises to pay to the order of such
other Group Member as makes loans to such Group Member (each Group Member which
borrows money pursuant to this Promissory Note is referred to herein as a “Payor” and each
Group Member which makes loans and advances pursuant to this Promissory Note is referred
to herein as a “Payee”), on demand, in lawful money of the United States of America, in
immediately available funds and at the appropriate office of the Payee, the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of all loans and advances heretofore and hereafter made by such Payee to
such Payor and any other indebtedness now or hereafter owing by such Payor to such Payee
as shown either on Schedule A attached hereto (and any continuation thereof) or in the books
and records of such Payee. The failure to show any such Indebtedness or any error in
showing such Indebtedness shall not affect the obligations of any Payor hereunder.
Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given
to such terms in the Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of August [    ], 2010 (as it may
be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”), by and among
Fairmount Minerals Holdings, Inc., Fairmount Minerals, Ltd. (the “U.S. Borrower”), Lake Shore

Securities LLC and KeyBank National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents, Barclays Bank
PLC, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as
Revolving Administrative Agent and PNC Bank, National Association and The Huntington
National Bank as Co-Documentation Agents.
The unpaid principal amount hereof from time to time outstanding shall bear interest at a rate
equal to the rate as may be agreed upon in writing from time to time by the relevant Payor and
Payee. Interest shall be due and payable as may be agreed upon in writing from time to time by
the relevant Payor and Payee. Upon demand for payment of any principal amount hereof,
accrued but unpaid interest on such principal amount shall also be due and payable. Interest
shall be paid in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available
funds. Interest shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year
consisting of 365 days.
Each Payor and any endorser of this Promissory Note hereby waives presentment, demand,
protest and notice of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights
hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.
This Promissory Note has been pledged by each Payee that is a Borrower or a Guarantor to
the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as security for such Payee’s
Obligations, if any, under the Credit Agreement, the Pledge and Security Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to which such Payee is a party and subject to the terms of the Pledge
and Security Agreement. Each Payor acknowledges and agrees that the Collateral Agent may
exercise all the rights of the Payees under this Promissory Note and will not be subject to any
abatement, reduction, recoupment, defense, setoff or counterclaim available to such Payor.
Each Payee agrees that any and all claims of such Payee against any Payor or any endorser of
this Promissory Note, or against any of their respective properties, shall be subordinate and
subject in right of payment to the Obligations of such Payor that is a Borrower or a Guarantor
until all of the Obligations have been performed and Paid in Full. Notwithstanding any right of
any Payee to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any Payor, all rights,
Liens and security interests of such Payee, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever
existing, in any assets of any Payor that is a Borrower or a Guarantor (whether constituting
part of the security or collateral given to the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to
secure payment of all or any part of the Obligations or otherwise) shall be and hereby are
subordinated to the rights of the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party in such assets. Except
as expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement, the Payees shall have no right to possession
of any such asset or to foreclose upon, or exercise any other remedy in respect of, any such
asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the Obligations shall have
been Paid in Full.
EXHIBIT L-1
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in any other Loan Document or in
any such promissory note or other instrument, this Promissory Note (i) replaces and
supersedes any and all promissory notes or other instruments which create or evidence any
loans or advances made on or before the date hereof by any Group Member to any other
Group Member, and (ii) shall not be deemed replaced, superseded or in any way modified by
any promissory note or other instrument entered into on or after the date hereof which
purports to create or evidence any loan or advance by any Group Member to any other Group
Member.
THIS PROMISSORY NOTE AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO
CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF ANY LAW
OTHER THAN THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
From time to time after the date hereof, additional Subsidiaries of the Group Members may
become parties hereto by executing a counterpart signature page to this Promissory Note
(each additional Subsidiary, an “Additional Payor”). Upon delivery of such counterpart
signature page to the Payees, notice of which is hereby waived by the other Payors, each
Additional Payor shall be a Payor and shall be as fully a party hereto as if such Additional
Payor were an original signatory hereof. Each Payor expressly agrees that its obligations
arising hereunder shall not be affected or diminished by the addition or release of any other
Payor hereunder. This Promissory Note shall be fully effective as to any Payor that is or
becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any other Person becomes or fails to become or
ceases to be a Payor hereunder.
Each Payee is hereby authorized to record all loans and advances made by such Payee to any
Payor (all of which shall be evidenced by this Promissory Note) and all repayments or
prepayments thereof, on its books and records, such books and records constituting prima
facie evidence of the accuracy of the information contained therein.
This Promissory Note may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
