<p><b>I. INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance gives an account of the 
communications sent to Governments by the Special Rapporteur between 31 January 2006 
and 30 April 2007.1 It also contains in summary form the replies received from 
Governments to his communications during the same period, as well as observations of the 
Special Rapporteur where appropriate. Replies to communications which were received by 
the Special Rapporteur after 30 April 2007 will be reflected in his next communications 
report. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II. SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>2. On 11 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, sent an 
allegation letter concerning a raid on a political meeting held by a local branch of the PCJSS 
(Chittagong Hill Tracts United Peoples&#8217; Party), a political organization linked to the 
indigenous peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. According to the information received, on 19 June 2006, activists and leaders of 
the Sama Adhikar Andolan (Chittagong Hill Tracks Equal Rights Movement), a political 
organization supported by the Government of Bangladesh and linked to Bengali settlers, 
violently intervened at the PCJSS meeting, shouting communal slogans and violently 
attacking PCJSS members and supporters. It is alleged that the attackers destroyed chairs, 
tables, doors and windows in the hall. They subsequently set fire to the national flag, the 
party flag and the curtains. <b>Mr. Poushe Thowai Marma, Mr. Kon Owai Mro, Ms. Sonari 
Tripura, Ms. Pongo Mro, Mr. Thowaimra Mro, and Mr. Mra Owai Marma</b> were 
injured during the attack. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sadhuram Tripura</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Chinghla Mong Chak</b>, PCJSS 
leaders, had to flee, as they were targeted by the attackers. Reports indicated that the local 
police and army did not intervene during the attack. It was alleged that the deputy for 
security of the PCJSS conference, a police sub-inspector, and a group of policemen were 
deployed in the conference hall but did not react to the violence. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern at what appeared to be related to a 
general situation of discrimination against the indigenous peoples of the Chittagong Hill 
Tracts. In this regard, reference was made to a book published in 2006 by Mohammad 
Humayun Kabirm, Deputy Commissioner of the Khagrachari Hill District (<i>Khagrachari 
</i></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>1 General statistical information on communications sent by special procedures is available on the OHCHR 
website: www.ohchr.org. </p>

<i>2001-2005</i>), in which he stated, inter alia, that indigenous peoples were &#8220;infiltrators&#8221;, 
&#8220;settlers&#8221;, &#8220;anti-Bengali&#8221; and &#8220;wild and uncivilized tribes&#8221;.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bangladesh for the letter sent on 
14 July 2006 acknowledging receipt of the communication and assuring him that the 
contents had been forwarded to the concerned authorities for necessary inquiry and actions. 
However, he regrets that, at the time this report was finalized, no reply to the 
communication had been received from the Government.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up on this case. In the event that no 
response is received from the Government, he will no longer treat this case as a mere 
allegation but as a proven fact.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Chile 
</b></p>
<p><b>Comunicaciones enviadas  
</b></p>
<p>7. El 6 de marzo de 2006, el Relator Especial, juntamente con el Relator Especial 
sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n, el Relator Especial 
sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas 
y la Representante Especial del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de 
los derechos humanos, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con la Sra. <b>Luisa Ana 
Calfunao Paillalef</b> y la Sra. <b>Juana Rosa Calfunao Paillalef</b>. La Sra. Calfunao Paillalef es 
lonko (autoridad tradicional) y portavoz de la comunidad ind&#237;gena Mapuche de Juan 
Paillalef, ubicada en la comuna de Cunco, IX Regi&#243;n, en Temuco. Su situaci&#243;n fue objeto 
de varias comunicaciones por parte de distintos mecanismos especiales de la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos de fechas 23 de agosto y 22 de octubre de 2004, 2 de septiembre y 29 
de diciembre de 2005, y 12 de enero de 2006.  
 
</p>
<p>8. Seg&#250;n las nuevas informaciones recibidas, el 22 de febrero de 2006 se habr&#237;a le&#237;do 
la sentencia que habr&#237;a concluido el juicio iniciado la audiencia del 13 de febrero del mismo 
a&#241;o, y que se habr&#237;a desarrollado el 17 de febrero de 2006. La sentencia habr&#237;a impuesto 
una pena de 61 d&#237;as de &#8220;presidio menor en su grado m&#237;nimo&#8221; por el delito de &#8220;des&#243;rdenes 
p&#250;blicos&#8221; a las dos imputadas y penas accesorias de suspensi&#243;n de cargo y oficio p&#250;blico 
durante el tiempo de condena. Adicionalmente, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la Sra. Juana 
Rosa Calfunao habr&#237;a recibido otra pena de 61 d&#237;as de presidio por el delito de &#8220;amenaza a 
carabineros&#8221;. Debido al grado de las penas impuestas, el Tribunal de oficio les habr&#237;a 
concedido el beneficio de la remisi&#243;n condicional de la pena, bajo observaci&#243;n de la 
Gendarmer&#237;a de Chile, por un lapso de un a&#241;o. Adem&#225;s, ambas habr&#237;an sido condenadas a 
pagar los costos del juicio. 
 
</p>
<p>9. La Sra. Juana Rosa Calfunao tiene otro proceso pendiente desde el 4 de enero de 
2006 por los mismos delitos de &#8220;des&#243;rdenes p&#250;blicos&#8221; y &#8220;amenazas a carabineros&#8221;. En caso 
de confirmarse la presente condena, se podr&#237;a solicitar  el agravante de reiteraci&#243;n contenida </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1

</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>en el art&#237;culo 397 del nuevo C&#243;digo Procesal Penal Chileno, lo que se traducir&#237;a en una 
eventual pena para el segundo proceso que podr&#237;a llegar hasta los tres a&#241;os y un d&#237;a. La 
fecha de la audiencia de este segundo proceso no ha sido fijada por el momento.  
</p><p> 
10. Se expresan graves temores de que estas condenas formen parte de una campa&#241;a de 
hostigamiento contra las se&#241;oras Juana Rosa Calfunao Paillalef y Luisa Ana Calfunao 
Paillalef y est&#233;n relacionadas con la labor que ambas personas realizan en la defensa de los 
derechos de su comunidad ind&#237;gena, en particular con sus recientes protestas reclamando 
una indemnizaci&#243;n al Ministerio de Obras P&#250;blicas por la construcci&#243;n (supuestamente 
ilegal) de un camino privado que pasa por el centro de la comunidad rural mapuche.  
 
</p>
<p>11. El 11 de mayo de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243;, juntamente con el Relator 
Especial sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n, el Relator Especial sobre la independencia de 
los magistrados y abogados, el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos 
y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y 
protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en la lucha contra el 
terrorismo y la Representante Especial del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos, un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n de 
<b>Patricia Troncoso</b>, <b>Patricio Marileo Saravia</b>, <b>Jaime Marileo Saravia </b>y <b>Juan Carlos 
Huenulao Lienmil</b>, l&#237;deres y simpatizantes mapuches condenados a m&#225;s de 10 a&#241;os de 
prisi&#243;n bajo la acusaci&#243;n  de &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221;.  
 
</p>
<p>12. Su situaci&#243;n ya hab&#237;a sido objeto de una comunicaci&#243;n personal enviada por el 
Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales de 
los ind&#237;genas a la Presidenta Sra. Michelle Bachelet, el d&#237;a 21 de abril de 2006. Con 
anterioridad, el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas envi&#243; comunicaciones al Gobierno chileno expresando su 
preocupaci&#243;n por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista a presos mapuches por hechos 
relacionados con la lucha social por la tierra y los leg&#237;timos reclamos ind&#237;genas.  
 
</p>
<p>13. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en agosto de 2004 Patricia Troncoso, Patricio 
Marileo Saravia, Jaime Marileo Saravia y Juan Carlos Huenulao Lienmil habr&#237;an sido 
condenados a penas de diez anos y un d&#237;a de prisi&#243;n despu&#233;s de haber sido acusados del 
delito de &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221;, bajo la Ley Antiterrorista N.&#186; 18314, por un incendio 
causado en el predio conocido como Poluco Podenco. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n 
recibida, el juicio habr&#237;a presentado irregularidades y las declaraciones de los testigos 
habr&#237;an presentado contradicciones.  
 
</p>
<p>14. Patricia Troncoso, Patricio Marileo Saravia, Jaime Marileo Saravia y Juan Carlos 
Huenulao Lienmil se encontrar&#237;an en la ciudad del Angol y desde el 13 de marzo de 2006 
mantendr&#237;an la huelga de hambre en protesta por las fuertes condenas recibidas y por la 
aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista (que se utiliza con frecuencia en relaci&#243;n con las 
reclamaciones agrarias y las reclamaciones para pedir un nivel de vida adecuado de los 
mapuches). Su estado de salud se habr&#237;a deteriorado gravemente tras m&#225;s de 55 d&#237;as de 
huelga de hambre. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 6  
</p><p> 
15.  Se nota con mucha preocupaci&#243;n que los jueces hayan podido aplicar la ley de 
manera discriminatoria;  mientras que por los delitos contra la propiedad se aplican 
generalmente multas o penas de prisi&#243;n muy cortas, en el caso de los mapuches, los jueces 
calificar&#237;an estos mismos delitos como actos de terrorismo y aplicar&#237;an penas de prisi&#243;n 
muy severas, de por lo menos 10 a&#241;os.  
 
</p>
<p>16. Se expresan graves temores de que la aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley Antiterrorista en este

<p><b>Respuestas del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>17. Por carta con fecha 23 de noviembre de 2006, el Gobierno de Chile transmiti&#243; la 
siguiente informaci&#243;n en respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n urgente del 6 de marzo de 2006 
relativa a <b>Luisa Ana Calfunao Paillalef y Juana Rosa Calfunao Paillalef</b>. El Gobierno 
inform&#243; de que el 15 de noviembre de 2006 se celebr&#243; en el Tribunal de Garant&#237;as de 
Temuco la sesi&#243;n por los des&#243;rdenes acaecidos el 2 y 4 de enero de 2006 en contra de la 
Sra. Juana Calfunao. Dicha sesi&#243;n debi&#243; suspenderse, ya que la imputada y otras 10 
personas agredieron a los fiscales y a otros funcionarios, quienes sufrieron lesiones, 
aparentemente menores. Tras la golpiza, fueron detenidos seis mujeres y cuatro hombres. El 
hijo de la Sra. Calfunao, el Sr. Jorge Landeros Calfunao, que tambi&#233;n particip&#243; en la 
golpiza, huy&#243; y fue detenido el d&#237;a 16 de noviembre de 2006. Tras el ataque a los 
funcionarios, el abogado de la Sra. Calfunao, el Sr. Freddy Barriga, habr&#237;a renunciado a 
representarla. El Gobierno inform&#243; asimismo de que el d&#237;a 20 de noviembre, el Tribunal de 
Garant&#237;a de Temuco conden&#243; a la Sra. Juana Calfunao a 150 d&#237;as de presidio por los 
des&#243;rdenes ocurridos en enero de 2006, y record&#243; que la Sra. Calfunao cumpl&#237;a  
actualmente una pena remitida por des&#243;rdenes p&#250;blicos y amenazas a carabineros por 
hechos ocurridos en diciembre de 2005.  
 
</p>
<p>18. Por carta con fecha 23 de mayo de 2006, en respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n urgente 
del 11 de mayo de 2006 relativa a <b>Patricia Troncoso</b>, <b>Patricio Marileo Saravia</b>, <b>Jaime 
Marileo Saravia </b>y <b>Juan Carlos Huenulao Lienmil, </b>el gobierno de Chile inform&#243; que los 
hechos por los que fueron condenados el se&#241;or Huenulao, los se&#241;ores Marileo y la se&#241;ora 
Troncoso se encontraban previamente tipificados como delitos en la ley penal y en la ley 
antiterrorista, con su pena correspondiente (delito de incendio). Seg&#250;n las informaciones del 
gobierno, el incendio de los fundos Poluco y Podenco, zona cuya propiedad pertenece a la 
empresa forestal MININCO, ocasion&#243; un da&#241;o cercano a los 600.000 d&#243;lares de los Estados 
Unidos.  
 
</p>
<p>19. En cuanto a los antecedentes judiciales, los inculpados, de acuerdo con el p&#225;rrafo 3 
del art&#237;culo 19 de la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica de Chile, contaron con defensa jur&#237;dica desde el 
inicio de la causa, defensa que fue proporcionada por la Defensor&#237;a Penal P&#250;blica. A su vez, 
tambi&#233;n hicieron uso de recursos que proporciona la ley para impugnar las resoluciones 
judiciales: recurso de nulidad, amparo y revisi&#243;n. En consecuencia, el Gobierno informa de 
que no existe duda alguna de que se cumplieran los principios del debido proceso.  </p>

</p>
<p>20. En referencia a la invocaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista, el Gobierno inform&#243; de que la 
Presidenta de la Rep&#250;blica, Sra. Michelle Bachelet, se hab&#237;a comprometido a que el 
ejecutivo no invocara la aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley Antiterrorista, al hacer la denuncia o querella 
que corresponda, cuando en hechos futuros tipificados como delitos por la Ley 
Antiterrorista y que puedan ser juzgados por la ley com&#250;n se vean involucrados ind&#237;genas 
en procesos de reivindicaciones de tierras. De todas maneras, el Gobierno resalt&#243; que en el 
caso concreto del delito de incendio, la pena que establece el C&#243;digo Penal es tan grave 
como la que establece la Ley Antiterrorista. 
 
</p>
<p>21. El Gobierno de Chile destac&#243; que los Senadores Alejandro Navarrro y Jaime 
Naranjo presentaron un proyecto de ley con el objeto de modificar el Decreto Ley N.&#186; 321 
sobre la libertad condicional. Dicho proyecto establece la posibilidad de otorgar la libertad 
condicional a los condenados a penas privativas de libertad por delitos contemplados en la 
Ley 18314 (Ley Antiterrorista), y a los condenados por delitos sancionados en otros cuerpos 
legales, en causas relacionadas con reivindicaciones violentas de derechos consagrados en 
la Ley 19253 (Ley Ind&#237;gena), siempre que los hechos punibles hayan ocurrido entre el 1.&#186; de 
enero de 1997 y el 1.&#186; de enero de 2006, y los mismos condenados suscriban en forma 
previa una declaraci&#243;n inequ&#237;voca y favorable a la no utilizaci&#243;n de la violencia en la 
reivindicaci&#243;n de derechos establecidos en la Ley 19253 y en el derecho internacional de los 
pueblos ind&#237;genas. 
 
</p>
<p>22. El 15 de mayo de 2006, el Ministro del Interior comunic&#243; que el Gobierno hab&#237;a 
asignado &#8220;suma urgencia&#8221; a la tramitaci&#243;n del Proyecto de Ley para modificar el Decreto 
Ley 321. Con motivo de la presentaci&#243;n del citado proyecto, el 14 de mayo de 2006, los 
cuatro afectados mencionados anteriormente depusieron temporalmente la huelga de 
hambre, a la espera de los resultados de la tramitaci&#243;n del proyecto de ley. El Gobierno 
especific&#243; que esta situaci&#243;n no responde a una persecuci&#243;n pol&#237;tica hacia el movimiento 
ind&#237;gena o mapuche.  
 
</p>
<p>23. A su vez, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; los siguientes antecedentes:  
 
<i> a</i>) La ofensiva, a partir de 1999,  por parte de sectores minoritarios ligados a la 
reivindicaci&#243;n de derechos territoriales ind&#237;genas destinada a ejecutar acciones contra 
empresas forestales y agricultores en algunas provincias de la VIII y la IX regiones, 
consistentes en ocupaciones ilegales, robos y hurtos, incendios de bosques y plant&#237;os, 
edificaciones y casas patronales, maquinaria agr&#237;cola y forestal, veh&#237;culos y ataques a 
trabajadores y brigadistas forestales, carabineros y propietarios de los predios y sus familias 
e incluso a miembros de comunidades mapuches por no aceptar estos m&#233;todos de acci&#243;n. 
Estas acciones se diferenciaron de la conducta de la gran mayor&#237;a de las organizaciones 
ind&#237;genas quienes no recurren a la violencia para reivindicar sur leg&#237;timas aspiraciones;  
</p>
<p><i> b</i>) La aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley Antiterrorista, invocada frente a situaciones de extrema 
gravedad en nueve procesos de 2001 hasta la fecha; en la actualidad, existen 9 personas de 
ascendencia ind&#237;gena condenadas por esta Ley;  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 8  
 
<i> c</i>) Las acciones judiciales iniciadas estuvieron encaminadas a castigar a los autores 
de delitos y no al pueblo mapuche;  
</p>
<p><i> d</i>) El reconocimiento como leg&#237;tima, por parte del Estado de Chile, de la demanda 
de los pueblos ind&#237;genas, en especial la del mapuche. Desde 1993, la Ley Ind&#237;gena N.&#186; 
19253 ha permitido traspasar unas 400.000 hect&#225;reas de tierra a m&#225;s de 500 comunidades a 
lo largo de todo el pa&#237;s;  
</p>
<p><i> e</i>) El hecho de que el Ejecutivo no puede, bajo circunstancia alguna, revisar, 
modificar o anular un fallo judicial.

<p>24. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Chile por sus respuestas a las 
comunicaciones de 6 de marzo y de 11 de mayo de 2006. 
 
</p>
<p>25. El Relator Especial expresa su preocupaci&#243;n por el caso de las se&#241;oras Juana Rosa 
Calfunao Paillalef y Luisa Ana Calfunao Paillalef, en la medida que los actos por las que se 
las acusa puedan estar relacionadas con sus actividades en defensa de los derechos de su 
comunidad ind&#237;gena. El Relator Especial considera que la situaci&#243;n merece una atenci&#243;n 
urgente por parte del Gobierno y agradecer&#237;a recibir informaci&#243;n actualizada. 
 
</p>
<p>26. El Relator expresa su satisfacci&#243;n por el hecho de que Patricia Troncoso, Patricio 
Marileo Saravia, Jaime Marileo Saravia y Juan Carlos Huenulao Lienmil abandonaran la 
huelga de hambre sin que se produjeran da&#241;os irreversibles para su salud. El Relator 
Especial se congratula del anuncio realizado por la Presidenta de Chile indicando que el 
ejecutivo no invocar&#225; la aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley Antiterrorista, al hacer la denuncia o querella 
que corresponda, cuando en hechos futuros tipificados como delitos por la Ley 
Antiterrorista y que puedan ser juzgados por la ley com&#250;n, se vean involucrados ind&#237;genas 
en procesos de reivindicaciones de tierras. En este sentido, el Relator Especial agradecer&#237;a 
recibir informaci&#243;n sobre el estado actual de las discusiones referentes a la modificaci&#243;n de 
la legislaci&#243;n antiterrorista actualmente en vigor.

<p>28. Por carta con fecha 20 de diciembre de 2006, el Gobierno de Colombia transmiti&#243; 
la siguiente informaci&#243;n en respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n urgente de 21 de noviembre 2006, 
enviada por el Relator Especial, juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre la independencia 
de los magistrados y abogados, relativa al homicidio del Sr.<b> Orlando Valencia, </b>l&#237;der 
afrodescendiente de la comunidad de Curbarad&#243;. 
 
</p>
<p>29. El 15 de octubre de 2005, Orlando Valencia desapareci&#243; a manos de grupos 
paramilitares en el casco urbano de Bel&#233;n de Bajira, 15 minutos despu&#233;s de que fuera 
detenido por la polic&#237;a durante tres horas. El 26 octubre de 2005, las autoridades habr&#237;an 
informado de que se habr&#237;a encontrado el cuerpo sin vida de Orlando Valencia. El Sr. 
Valencia ser&#237;a la &#250;ltima de una serie de 111 v&#237;ctimas de las comunidades afrodescendientes 
del Curbarad&#243; Jiguamiand&#243; desde 1996 por asesinatos o desapariciones forzadas.  
 
</p>
<p>30. A ra&#237;z de estos sucesos, el Gobierno inform&#243; de que el Juzgado Primero de lo 
Penal del Circuito Especializado de Antioquia conden&#243; a 14 a&#241;os y tres meses de prisi&#243;n a 
&#193;lvaro Padilla Medina, por su coautor&#237;a en el homicidio del dirigente comunal Orlando 
Valencia. El material probatorio recaudado por un fiscal de la Unidad Nacional de Derechos 
Humanos llev&#243; al Sr. Padilla a aceptar en diligencia de sentencia anticipada los cargos por 
los que fue sentenciado. Los hechos materia de investigaci&#243;n ocurrieron el 15 de octubre de 
2005 en Bel&#233;n de Bajir&#225; (Antioquia), donde el Sr. Valencia, representante de la comunidad 
de Caracol&#237;, fue subido a la fuerza en una moto por dos hombres, integrantes de los grupos 
de autodefensa. El cuerpo baleado del Sr. Valencia fue encontrado nueve d&#237;as despu&#233;s en un 
paraje de la vereda Boca de S&#225;balo, jurisdicci&#243;n del municipio de Chigorod&#243; (Antioquia). 
Para la &#233;poca de su asesinato el l&#237;der comunitario estaba al frente del proceso de defensa de 
las tierras de las negritudes. A este proceso hay otros cinco vinculados. <b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>31. El Relator Especial considera que este caso ilustra especialmente la agravaci&#243;n de 
la situaci&#243;n de derechos humanos en Colombia, tal y como se indica en el informe sobre su 
visita a Colombia (E/CN.4/2004/18/Add.3), as&#237; como la connivencia y la complicidad entre 
los grupos paramilitares y ciertos elementos de las fuerzas armadas y de la polic&#237;a y 
miembros del Parlamento pertenecientes al partido dominante. La cantidad de fosas 
comunes descubiertas recientemente ilustra la magnitud de los asesinatos pol&#237;ticos y de las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales contra l&#237;deres de comunidades aut&#243;ctonas afrocolombianas y 
defensores de derechos humanos. La responsabilidad y la complicidad del Gobierno son 
directamente imputables. El Relator Especial invita al Consejo de Derechos Humanos a 
destinar una atenci&#243;n especial y urgente a estas graves violaciones de derechos humanos en 
Colombia y a condenarlas con la m&#225;xima fuerza.

<p>32. Le 1er f&#233;vrier 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur la situation des droits de l'homme et des libert&#233;s fondamentales des populations 
autochtones, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture et l&#8217;Experte ind&#233;pendante sur les questions 
relatives aux minorit&#233;s, a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant la situation de M. 
<b>Maurice Sandima, </b>M. <b>Jean-Pierre Mossondo, </b>M. <b>Pota </b>et un<b> groupe de pygm&#233;es 
Mbendjele</b>. Des renseignements ont &#233;t&#233; re&#231;us concernant les incidents survenus entre les 
mois d&#8217;ao&#251;t et octobre 2005, dont auraient &#233;t&#233; victimes des membres de la communaut&#233; 
pygm&#233;e, et en particulier les personnes mentionn&#233;s ant&#233;rieurement.   
</p>
<p>33. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, M. Maurice Sandima, pygm&#233;e Mbendjele, aurait &#233;t&#233; 
battu par des Eco gardes, employ&#233;s par le Gouvernement pour surveiller les for&#234;ts, 
d&#233;shabill&#233; devant des femmes et des enfants, et se serait fait dire par ses agresseurs &#171; Tu 
n&#8217;es qu&#8217;un Pygm&#233;e, je peux te tuer avec mon arme et rien n&#8217;arrivera &#187;. Il aurait perdu une 
dent et se serait fait bris&#233; deux c&#244;tes dans l&#8217;attaque. M. Jean-Pierre Mossondo, porte-parole 
d&#8217;un village Mbendjele, aurait &#233;t&#233; battu par des Eco gardes sur la base de suspicions selon 
lesquelles il aurait &#233;t&#233; chasseur, alors qu&#8217;au moment des faits il a &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233; qu&#8217;il ne 
portait pas de fusil de chasse et qu&#8217;aucun gibier n&#8217;avait &#233;t&#233; trouv&#233; sur lui. Outre les coups et 
blessures, M. Mossondo aurait &#233;t&#233; forc&#233; de payer une amende &#224; un Eco garde appel&#233; Apena. 
M. Pota, &#233;galement pygm&#233;e Mbendjele, aurait &#233;t&#233; battu, ligot&#233;, puis abandonn&#233; en pleine 
for&#234;t par des Eco gardes, alors qu&#8217;aucun &#233;l&#233;ment n&#8217;aurait pu laisser supposer que M. Pota 
&#233;tait un chasseur. Un groupe de pygm&#233;es Mbendjele, accompagn&#233;s d&#8217;observateurs de 
l&#8217;Observatoire congolais des droits de l&#8217;homme (OCDH), aurait &#233;t&#233; brutalement fouill&#233;s par 
des Eco gardes, sans raison ni aucun m&#233;nagement.  
</p>
<p>34. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, plusieurs autres incidents r&#233;cents font &#233;tat de 
nombreux cas de violence et de discrimination &#224; l&#8217;encontre des pygm&#233;es Mbendjele, ainsi 
que d&#8217;une atmosph&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;rale de violence r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;e voire syst&#233;matique des Eco gardes

<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>37. On 24 November 2005, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning 
cartoons representing the prophet Mohammad published in a Danish newspaper. According 
to the information received, cartoons representing the prophet Muhammad in a defamatory 
and derogatory manner were published in the newspaper <i>Jyllands Posten</i> in the course of 
September 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.1, paras. 20-27).  
 
</p>
<p>38. Subsequent to its response dated 24 January 2006, which has already been reflected 
in the previous communications report (see E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.1), the Government of 
Denmark informed the Special Rapporteurs in further letters dated 31 January 2006, 3 
February 2006 and 16 March 2006 about recent developments concerning this issue. On 31 
January 2006, the Danish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, made a statement in 
which he said that the Danish Daily, <i>Jyllands Posten</i>, had apologized for the indisputable 
offence to the Muslim world. He hoped that the apology would contribute to comforting 
those who had been hurt. The Prime Minister reported that the apology had been received 
positively by Muslim communities in Denmark and that they had pledged support for the 
efforts made. He also called on all parties to abstain from any statement or action that would 
create further tension. In an interview on the TV news channel Al-Arabyia on 2 February 
2006, the Prime Minister stressed the value he attached to the close relationship based on 
mutual respect and friendship between Denmark and the Muslim world.  
 
</p>
<p>39. On 16 March 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that the 
Danish Director of Public Prosecutions had decided not to institute criminal proceeding in 
the case of the article &#8220;The Face of Muhammed&#8221;, which was published on 30 September 
2005, as in his opinion there had been a violation neither of section 140 of the Danish 
Criminal Code (mockery or scorn of religious doctrines or acts of worship of any lawfully 
existing religious community in Denmark) nor of section 266b of the Danish Criminal Code 
(public statement or imparting other information by which a group of people are threatened, 
scorned or degraded on account of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religion or 
sexual inclination). The decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot be appealed 
to a higher administrative authority, as stipulated in section 99 (3) of the Administration of 
Justice Act. Furthermore, the Director stressed that although there was no basis for 
instituting criminal proceedings in this case, it should be noted that both provisions of the 
Danish Criminal Code contain a restriction of the freedom of expression. To the extent 
publicly made expressions fall within the scope of these rules there is, therefore, no free and 
unrestricted right to express opinions about religious subjects. It is thus not a correct 
description of existing law that, as stated in the article in <i>Jyllands Posten</i>, it is incompatible 
with the right to freedom of expression to demand special consideration for religious 
feelings and that one has to be prepared to put up with &#8220;scorn, mockery and ridicule&#8221;.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 12  
 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government's additional responses and 
encourages the Government to continue its efforts to increase mutual understanding and 
religious tolerance.  
 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his opinion that the political context in Denmark, 
in particular the xenophobic and Islamophobic platform of a party to the government 
coalition, should have been taken into account by the Director of Public Prosecutions in 
determining whether, on the basis of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the balance between freedom of expression and freedom of religion and restrictions 
and limitations on those rights had not been deliberately violated. Furthermore, the 
Government should have been more sensitive to the international ideological context of a 
threat of a clash of civilizations and religions and, in particular, the impact of the cartoons 
associating Islam with terrorism. 
 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur refers to the joint press release issued with the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur for the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 8 February 2006. 
Furthermore, he reiterates the conclusions and recommendations contained in his latest 
report on the situation of Muslims and Arab peoples in various parts of the world 
(E/CN.4/2006/17) and the joint report with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief (A/HRC/2/3) submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 1/107 on 
incitement to racial and religious hatred and the promotion of tolerance.

<p><b>Dominican Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>43. In the absence of an answer from the Government of the Dominican Republic 
concerning his communication of 7 September 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006 /16/Add.1, paras. 
28-30), the Special Rapporteur is forced to consider the following case no longer an  
allegation, but a proven fact.  
</p>
<p>44. According to the information received, <b>more than 3,000 Haitians</b> were detained 
and <b>over 1,000 deported</b> without consideration of their legal status in the country. Those 
with the legal right to remain and Dominicans of Haitian origin had their papers confiscated 
and were deported along with undocumented migrants. Reports were also received of 
increasing violent attacks against Haitians, including three persons who were burnt alive by 
a gang and have since died. The reports received indicated a racial connotation in the 
targeting, detention and deportation of Haitians.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the positive reply from the Government of the 
Dominican Republic, dated March 2007, to his request to carry out a visit to the country 
together with the independent expert on minority issues in October 2007. The Special 
Rapporteur and the independent expert intend to study in situ the allegations received. </p>

Safari-photo insoutenable. Des enfants, on en ramasse &#224; la pelle dans ce pays (est-ce un 
pays ou un cimeti&#232;re ?) o&#249; le taux de f&#233;condit&#233; des femmes est le plus &#233;lev&#233; au monde. Neuf

<p>49. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a not&#233; que ces d&#233;clarations interviendraient apr&#232;s la 
pol&#233;mique suscit&#233;e par les propos prononc&#233;s le 15 novembre 2006 par le pr&#233;sident socialiste 
de la r&#233;gion Languedoc-Roussillon, <b>Georges Fr&#234;che</b>, concernant la composition de l&#8217;&#233;quipe 
de France de football. M. Fr&#234;che aurait d&#233;clar&#233; : &#171; Dans cette &#233;quipe, il y a neuf Blacks sur 
onze. La normalit&#233; serait qu&#8217;il y en ait trois ou quatre. Ce serait le reflet de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Mais 
l&#224;. S&#8217;il y en a autant, c&#8217;est parce que les Blancs sont nuls &#187;. Enfin, ces d&#233;clarations 
s&#8217;inscriraient dans la lign&#233;e des propos du philosophe fran&#231;ais, <b>Alain Finkielkraut</b>, qui 
dans une interview au quotidien isra&#233;lien <i>Haaretz</i> du 18 novembre 2005 d&#233;clarait : &#171; On 
nous dit que l&#8217;&#233;quipe de France est ador&#233;e par tous parce qu&#8217;elle est black-blanc-beur. [...] 
En r&#233;alit&#233;, aujourd&#8217;hui, elle est black-black-black, ce qui fait ricaner toute l&#8217;Europe &#187;.

<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement

sp&#233;cial en date du 22 d&#233;cembre 2006.  
</p>
<p>51. Le Gouvernement a not&#233; que plusieurs r&#233;actions officielles et publiques ont fait 
suite aux propos de M. Sevran pour les condamner fermement. Dans ce sens, le Ministre de 
la culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, s'est dit &#171; extr&#234;mement choqu&#233; &#187; sur RTL, une 
station de radio fran&#231;aise, et a d&#233;clar&#233; : &#171; En tant que ministre et citoyen fran&#231;ais, je trouve 
que les propos de Pascal Sevran sont scandaleux, inadmissibles et racistes. Je suis 
extr&#234;mement choqu&#233; (...) Au-del&#224; du choquant, c'est passible de la loi &#187;. Interrog&#233; mardi 19 
d&#233;cembre sur Europe 1 sur l'initiative du Niger, qui a d&#233;cid&#233; de porter plainte contre 
l'animateur, la Ministre d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;e &#224; la coop&#233;ration et au d&#233;veloppement, Brigitte Girardin a 
d&#233;clar&#233;: &#171; Je comprends tout &#224; fait car ces propos, ces &#233;crits sont tout &#224; fait scandaleux et 
jettent le discr&#233;dit sur tout un continent et aussi sur l'action de la France en mati&#232;re de 
d&#233;veloppement dans ce continent &#187;. Elle a ajout&#233; : &#171; Ce genre de propos absolument 
inacceptables doivent &#234;tre sanctionn&#233;s &#187;.  </p>

52. Le Gouvernement fran&#231;ais a &#233;galement indiqu&#233; que la direction de France 2 a lanc&#233; 
un s&#233;v&#232;re avertissement &#224; M. Sevran mais a refus&#233; de prendre des sanctions, les propos en 
cause n'ayant pas &#233;t&#233; tenus &#224; l'antenne. Cependant, le Directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de la cha&#238;ne a 
convoqu&#233; l'animateur pour lui demander de pr&#233;senter ses excuses. Le PDG de France 
T&#233;l&#233;visions, Patrick de Carolis, a &#233;voqu&#233; la possibilit&#233; d'introduire une nouvelle clause dans 
les contrats des animateurs, leur imposant &#171; le respect des valeurs et l'&#233;thique de la 
t&#233;l&#233;vision publique &#187;.  
</p>
<p>53. &#201;voquant &#171; une sortie par le haut de cette pol&#233;mique &#187;, le pr&#233;sident de SOS 
Racisme, Dominique Sopo, a annonc&#233; avoir rencontr&#233; Pascal Sevran &#171; afin d'&#233;tudier ce qu'il 
&#233;tait possible de r&#233;aliser afin d'&#233;clairer dans la s&#233;r&#233;nit&#233; et la p&#233;dagogie les r&#233;alit&#233;s actuelles 
de l'Afrique &#187;. &#192; l'issue d'une discussion constructive, et au cours de laquelle les ambig&#252;it&#233;s 
ont pu &#234;tre lev&#233;es, Pascal Sevran a accept&#233; le principe de se rendre en Afrique afin d'y 
r&#233;aliser un reportage traitant de ces probl&#233;matiques, reprenant ainsi la proposition lanc&#233;e par 
SOS Racisme quelques jours auparavant. Une rencontre doit avoir lieu avec l'Association de 
la presse panafricaine (APPA) afin de discuter des modalit&#233;s et de l'axe de ce voyage. 
</p>
<p>54. Enfin, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que, dans le respect des dispositions de l'article 
11 du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale relatives au secret de l'enqu&#234;te et de l'instruction, que le 
28 d&#233;cembre 2006, la R&#233;publique du Niger, en la personne du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral du 
Gouvernement de ce pays, et la Ligue contre le racisme et l'antis&#233;mitisme (LICRA) ont 
d&#233;pos&#233; une plainte avec constitution de partie civile du chef de provocation &#224; la haine 
raciale, devant le Doyen des juges d'instruction du tribunal de grande instance de Paris, &#224; 
raison du passage du livre de M. Sevran, cit&#233; plus haut. La plainte d&#233;pos&#233;e est en attente du 
versement de la consignation fix&#233;e par le magistrat instructeur. 
</p>
<p>55. Concernant les propos prononc&#233;s par le pr&#233;sident socialiste de la r&#233;gion 
Languedoc-Roussillon,  Georges Fr&#234;che, sur la composition de l&#8217;&#233;quipe de France de 
football, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que l'ensemble de la classe politique fran&#231;aise a 
r&#233;prouv&#233; vivement et publiquement ces assertions. Dans ce sens, le Pr&#233;sident de la 
R&#233;publique, Jacques Chirac, a condamn&#233; ces propos &#171;avec la plus grande fermet&#233;&#187; et 
rappel&#233; que &#171;la R&#233;publique garantit l'&#233;galit&#233; des citoyens sans distinction d'origine ou de 
religion&#187;. Ces d&#233;clarations ont &#233;galement d&#233;clench&#233; une vague de protestations au sein du 
Parti de M. Fr&#234;che. Ainsi, le Premier secr&#233;taire du Parti socialiste, Fran&#231;ois Hollande, a jug&#233; 
ces d&#233;clarations &#171; inacceptables &#187; et demand&#233; &#224; Georges Fr&#234;che, d&#233;j&#224; suspendu des 
instances dirigeantes du Parti socialiste pour des propos qualifiant les Harkis (Alg&#233;riens 
ayant collabor&#233; avec la France au moment la lutte pour l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance de l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie) de sous 
hommes, de s'expliquer &#171; imm&#233;diatement &#187;. S&#233;gol&#232;ne Royal, candidate du parti socialiste &#224; 
la Pr&#233;sidence de la R&#233;publique a, elle aussi, jug&#233; ces propos &#171; insupportables &#187;. Le 27 
janvier dernier, les 33 membres de la commission des conflits du Parti socialiste ont vot&#233; &#224; 
l'unanimit&#233; l'exclusion de M. Fr&#234;che du Parti socialiste pour ses d&#233;clarations. Auparavant, le 
21 novembre 2006, Pascal Cl&#233;ment, Garde des Sceaux, a lui-m&#234;me ordonn&#233; qu'une enqu&#234;te 
p&#233;nale soit diligent&#233;e. Le jour o&#249; la communication a &#233;t&#233; envoy&#233;e, le Gouvernement a 
indiqu&#233; que les investigations, men&#233;es sous le contr&#244;le du procureur de la R&#233;publique pr&#233;s 
le tribunal de grande instance de Montpellier &#233;taient toujours en cours. 
</p>
<p>56. Le Gouvernement fran&#231;ais a indiqu&#233; que les propos de M. Finkielkraut portant 
&#233;galement sur la composition de l&#8217;&#233;quipe de football de France, ont fait l'objet d'une plainte 
d&#233;pos&#233;e par le Collectif des fils et filles d'Africains d&#233;port&#233;s (COFFAD) et le Mouvement 
pour une nouvelle humanit&#233; (MNH) devant le tribunal de grande instance de Paris qui avait 
renvoy&#233; M. Finkielkraut devant la 17&#232;me chambre du tribunal correctionnel de Paris. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Entendue le 12 d&#233;cembre 2006, cette plainte a &#233;t&#233; rejet&#233;e pour irrecevabilit&#233;, en raison des 
statuts du COFFAD. Le COFFAD ayant interjet&#233; appel contre cette d&#233;cision, l'affaire sera 
r&#233;examin&#233;e par la 11&#232;me chambre correctionnelle de la Cour d'Appel de Paris le 26 avril 
</p><p>2007. 
</p>
<p>57. Enfin, le Gouvernement a voulu assurer au Rapporteur sp&#233;cial que la France 
n'entend tol&#233;rer ni le racisme ni sa banalisation, qui sont de graves atteintes aux principes 
fondateurs de sa d&#233;mocratie. Le Pr&#233;sident de la R&#233;publique a r&#233;affirm&#233; cet engagement dans 
son allocution &#224; l&#8217;occasion de la pr&#233;sentation de ses v&#339;ux pour l'ann&#233;e 2007 en d&#233;clarant 
que l&#8217;enjeu majeur &#233;tait l'unit&#233; et le rassemblement autour des valeurs qui font la France : la 
libert&#233;, l'humanisme, le respect, et notamment le respect de la diversit&#233; et des diff&#233;rences, 
ainsi que le combat contre le racisme. Le Garde des Sceaux l'a &#233;galement rappel&#233;, l'ann&#233;e 
pass&#233;e, lors de la r&#233;union des procureurs g&#233;n&#233;raux et des magistrats r&#233;f&#233;rents en mati&#232;re de 
lutte contre le racisme et l'antis&#233;mitisme, en soulignant que &#171; la France a toujours eu comme 
volont&#233; d'assurer la coexistence de tous ses enfants par notre pacte r&#233;publicain, sans 
exclusive et sans exclusion &#187;. Cette volont&#233; politique de donner aux autorit&#233;s publiques les 
moyens de lutter contre le racisme et la discrimination raciale s'appuie sur un arsenal 
l&#233;gislatif important qui tente d'appr&#233;hender les diverses formes d'expression et de 
manifestation du racisme et de la x&#233;nophobie. 
</p>
<p>58. Le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que, dans le Code p&#233;nal et dans d'autres textes, sont 
qualifi&#233;es crime les discriminations raciales, ethniques ou religieuses commises dans le 
cadre des actes de la vie courante ou visant &#224; compromettre la reconnaissance d'un droit, de 
m&#234;me qu'un certain nombre de comportements d'une exceptionnelle gravit&#233;. De surcro&#238;t, un 
certain nombre d'actes graves sont &#233;galement qualifi&#233;s crime en ce qu'ils tendent soit &#224; 
favoriser la commission d'un acte raciste ou &#224; justifier de tels actes, soit en ce qu'ils 
constituent une atteinte &#224; l'honneur ou &#224; la dignit&#233; des personnes appartenant &#224; des 
communaut&#233;s raciales ou religieuses. Ainsi, la loi p&#233;nale incrimine et sanctionne les propos 
ou &#233;crits de type discriminatoire qui portent atteinte &#224; l'ordre public. Cependant, la loi 
n'interdit pas express&#233;ment la critique des croyances, des opinions, des philosophies, m&#234;me 
faites sur un ton pol&#233;mique. Elle laisse aux tribunaux le soin de savoir d&#233;celer, derri&#232;re la 
l&#233;gitime discussion des points de vue adverses, les violences racistes m&#234;me indirectement 
formul&#233;es et insidieuses.  
</p>
<p>59. Forts de ces moyens l&#233;gaux, les services de police et de police judiciaire ont 
resserr&#233; leur coordination et travaillent en liaison &#233;troite avec les parquets. Un &#171; M&#233;mento 
proc&#233;dural de lutte contre le racisme et l'antis&#233;mitisme &#224; l'usage des services de police et de 
gendarmerie &#187; demande &#224; &#171; toutes les autorit&#233;s publiques de faire preuve de vigilance dans 
la pr&#233;vention et de la plus grande fermet&#233; dans la poursuite et la r&#233;pression des actes 
antis&#233;mites et racistes &#187;. Enfin, le Garde des Sceaux dans une circulaire en date du 18 
novembre 2003 invite les procureurs &#224; faire preuve de la plus grande s&#233;v&#233;rit&#233; &#224; l'encontre 
des crimes et d&#233;lits &#224; caract&#232;re raciste ou antis&#233;mite. 
</p>
<p>60. Finalement, le Gouvernement a soulign&#233; que la France, par les r&#233;actions publiques 
de sa classe politique, par sa l&#233;gislation sans cesse am&#233;lior&#233;e ainsi que par son action 
pr&#233;ventive et r&#233;pressive, est r&#233;solument engag&#233;e &#224; lutter contre le racisme et toutes ses 
manifestations. </p>

&#233;conomiques et politiques, et par le recyclage de st&#233;r&#233;otypes et stigmates caract&#233;ristiques de 
la construction historique de la rh&#233;torique raciste. Il consid&#232;re que les propos de M. Sevran, 
qui s&#8217;inscrivent dans cette tendance, franchissent une ligne rouge tr&#232;s grave par la 
r&#233;it&#233;ration des vieux st&#233;r&#233;otypes du racisme anti-Noir, notamment son animalit&#233; et sa 
sexualit&#233; et, plus grave encore, par l&#8217;appel &#224; la st&#233;rilisation de populations africaines qui, 
comme forme d&#8217;extermination biologique d&#8217;un groupe ou d&#8217;une communaut&#233; ethnique ou

</p>
<p>63.  Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial consid&#232;re que la gravit&#233; extr&#234;me de ces propos, qui conforte

</p>
<p>64. Le Rapporteur a exprim&#233; sa vive inqui&#233;tude quant au fait que ces d&#233;clarations

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>65. On 21 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, sent an urgent appeal concerning a questionnaire introduced in the Land of 
Baden-W&#252;rttemberg<b> </b>which<b> </b>was to be answered by citizens of the 57 member States of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) who apply for German citizenship.  </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 17 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>66. According to the information received, on 1 January 2006, the Ministry of the 
Interior of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg introduced a questionnaire directed principally at Muslims 
who want to obtain German citizenship. They are required to fill out a 30-question 
questionnaire concerning a number of issues, including attitudes towards equality between 
men and women, homosexuality and freedom of religion. The questionnaire included 
questions such as: &#8220;Where do you stand on the statement that a wife should obey her 
husband and that he can hit her if she fails to do so?&#8221;; &#8220;Imagine that your adult son comes to 
you and says he is homosexual and plans to live with another man. How do you react?&#8221;; 
&#8220;What do you think if a man in Germany is married to two women at the same time?&#8221; and 
&#8220;Were the perpetrators of the attacks of September 11 freedom fighters or terrorists?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteurs expressed their concern that an obligation imposed only 
on the citizens of the 57 member States of OIC could be discriminatory, especially 
considering the large Turkish community living in Germany. It was further reported that, 
under the new legislation, those who pass the test can have their citizenship revoked if they 
are found guilty of acting in conflict with their responses to the questions.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>68. On 28 March 2006, the Government of Germany replied to the communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 21 February 2006. The Government explained that the 
naturalization of foreigners in Germany is carried out by each Land, as provided by the 
Nationality Act, which was effective from 1 January 2006. One requirement of that Act is 
that persons who wish to become naturalized citizens must declare their allegiance to the 
principles of freedom and democracy enshrined in the Basic Law and that they are not 
engaging and have never engaged in activities opposed to these principles or to the 
existence or security of the State.  
</p>
<p>69. The Interior Ministry of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg had adopted a so-called &#8220;guide for 
conducting interviews&#8221; to examine applicants&#8217; compliance with this requirement. The 
naturalization authorities are supposed to use this guide only in case of doubt of an 
individual applicant&#8217;s allegiance to the constitutional principles of freedom and democracy. 
There is no intent to make applicants answer all 30 questions provided in the guide. The 
authorities are free to choose the questions.  
</p>
<p>70. The Interior Ministry in a decree of 17 January 2006 clarified that the questions in 
the interview guide were not intended for use only with Muslim applicants, but were to be 
used with all applicants for naturalization in case of doubts regarding their allegiance to the 
constitutional principles of freedom and democracy. Muslim applicants are, therefore, not 
treated differently from other applicants. The Ministry also stated that the naturalization 
authorities as a rule were not aware of the religious affiliation of applicants, due to the fact 
that the application form did not ask for this information. As a result, it would be impossible 
to target Muslim applicants for questioning. Although 60 per cent of naturalized immigrants 
in Baden-W&#252;rttemberg came from OIC member States, in the majority of the cases the 
authorities had no doubts about their allegiance to the freedom and democracy principles 
and did not ask them questions from the interview guide. Furthermore, the Minister of the 
Interior has announced that he will evaluate the use of the interview guide after six months 
and assess its practical effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>71. So far, there has only been one complaint from an applicant for naturalization 
regarding the interview guide. This applicant refused to answer the questions posed by the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 18  
 
naturalization authorities and the person&#8217;s application for naturalization was rejected. The 
Ministry is not aware of any other complaints or rejected applications.  
</p>
<p>72. Once a person has become a naturalized citizen, his or her citizenship may be 
revoked only if he or she wilfully deceived the authorities with regard to matters relevant 
for naturalization. The possibility of this type of fraud is limited, as most of the questions 
taken from the interview guide are intended to elicit applicants&#8217; attitudes and opinions. In 
any case, under article 16 (1) of the Basic Law, no German may be deprived of his or her 
citizenship.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Germany for the detailed 
response provided, indicating that Muslim applicants are not treated differently from other 
applicants for naturalization. However, he is of the opinion that this guide cannot be 
separated from the post-11 September ideological climate that associates Islam with 
terrorism and promotes a clash of civilizations and values between Europe and the Islamic 
world. Indeed, this association has been denounced by some media and human rights 
organizations in Germany. The &#8220;ethical suspicion&#8221; underlying the rationale of the guide and 
the replies received are similar to that of the dominant argument against the entry of Turkey 
into the European Union. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up on and monitor the 
implementation of this guide and its extension to other L&#228;nder in Germany. He invites the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to pay particular attention to this 
development when examining the next report of Germany.

<p>74. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent an allegation letter concerning <b>Theo 
Alexandridis</b>, legal counsel with the Greek Helsinki Monitor (GHM), and other staff 
members of GHM, an organization that monitors and reports on human rights violations in 
Greece, including violations against the Roma community.  
</p>
<p>75. According to the information received, on 19 April 2005, the Greek Minister of 
Health and the Secretary-General of Social Solidarity publicly accused certain non-
governmental organizations of &#8220;existing only on paper&#8221; and of &#8220;publishing negative reports 
on the basis of unreliable, exaggerated and misleading information on the victims of the 
smuggling of human beings in Greece, in order to obtain an increase in funding from the 
Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#8221;. It was reported that GHM was specifically named in 
these accusations. Reports indicated that GHM has lodged a complaint against the Minister 
of Health and the Secretary-General of Social Solidarity.  
</p>
<p>76. Subsequently, on 13 October 2005, Mr. Alexandridis was arrested and detained in 
the Psair neighbourhood of Aspropyrgos, near Athens. It was reported that Mr. Alexandridis 
had gone to the police station to lodge a complaint against parents of non-Roma children 
who had allegedly committed violent acts against demonstrators who were protesting 
against the expulsion of Roma children from a school in the area. It was alleged that after he </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1

</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>had filed the complaint, Mr. Alexandridis was told he was under arrest and was detained for 
four hours before being released without charge. Moreover, the president of the Pupils&#8217; 
Parents Association allegedly lodged a complaint against Mr. Alexandridis for &#8220;libel&#8221; and 
&#8220;defamation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>77. It was also reported that, on 20 January 2006, the Head of the Appeals Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office stated during a radio interview that all Roma were criminals and announced that 
&#8220;perpetrators, instigators and accomplices&#8221; of Roma people who had helped them in a case 
concerning the alleged forced expulsion of Roma families in the Makrigianni area of Patras 
would be &#8220;called on to take the stand&#8221;, specifically including among this group 
representatives of GHM.  The Head of the Appeals Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is also said to have 
stated in the same radio interview that he had opened an inquiry into the involvement of 
GHM in petitioning the First Instance Prosecutor to open a criminal investigation into 
alleged illegal evictions and attacks against Roma people in Makrigianni.

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to this communication had been 
received from the Government of Greece at the time this report was finalized. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up on this case. In the event that no 
response is received from the Government, he will no longer treat the case as a mere 
allegation but as a proven fact.

<p><b>Communications sent  
</b></p>
<p>80. On 6 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture, sent an allegation letter concerning <b>Sekar Arjunan (Rajasekar)</b>, 
aged 32, a shopkeeper from Raja Thottam, Peravallur, Chennai. According to the 
information received, on 22 July 2005, eight police officers, all dressed in civilian clothing, 
approached Mr. Arjunan while he was standing near a fruit shop near the Central Prison in 
Chennai. The officers beat him and kicked him with their boots in the abdominal region. 
They then took him by car to Sangeetha lodge near Permbur Railway Station, where they 
locked him in a room on the second floor. Later that day, they took him to Sembiam Police 
Station and locked him in a dark room until 26 July. While he was there, he was beaten and 
deprived of food. On 26 July, he was taken to K-5 Peravallur Police Station, where he was 
put in a room on the third floor. He was stripped naked and beaten with an iron pipe, which 
resulted in a fracture to his right knee. The officers also subjected him to verbal caste-
related abuse and placed a pistol to his forehead, threatening to kill him.  
</p>
<p>81. Moreover, it was alleged that the police officers brought false criminal charges 
against him and that he was remanded in custody by Judicial Magistrate&#8217;s Court No. Five, 
Egmore. He was sent to the Central Prison in Chennai. Sekar Arjunan&#8217;s mother had 
previously submitted a complaint to the State Human Rights Commission in Chennai 
requesting it to take action against the same police officials for killing her younger son, 
Ramesh. She had refused to withdraw the complaint, despite being pressured to do so by the 
alleged perpetrators. The names of the police officers are Sub-Inspector John Miller, 
Inspector Anbuselvam, Sub-Inspector Boopalan, Constable Koyilraj, Constable Vinod, </p>

</p>
<p>82. On 8 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an 
allegation letter concerning <b>the alleged gang rape of a 22-year-old woman</b> belonging to 
the indigenous Nut community (a Scheduled Tribe) in Sirsi village, Chandauli District, 
Uttar Pradesh. According to the information received, on 14 January 2006, at 1 a.m., four 
men from nearby Hinauti village allegedly went to the house of the victim&#8217;s family. All four 
men belong to the upper-caste Singh community. The men assaulted the victim&#8217;s family 
members and chased them away, leaving the victim alone in the house. Allegedly, the four 
men then forcibly took her to a field 1 km away from her house where they gang-raped her 
for three hours. When she became unconscious, they threw her onto a nearby railway line, 
where she was found hours later by another villager.  
</p>
<p>83. The victim's family reported the incident to the Chandauli Police Station and 
lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against the four men under section 376 of the 
Indian Penal Code and under section 3 (2) and section 5 of the Scheduled Caste and 
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. Reportedly, however, the police tried 
to delay action against the alleged perpetrators. Under intense pressure from the Nut 
community, the police finally arrested the alleged perpetrators more than 40 hours after the 
rape allegedly took place.  
</p>
<p>84. The members of the Nut community in Sirsi village live in very poor conditions on 
Government-owned land and make their living from begging. Conversely, the members of 
the Singh community are large landowners and wield considerable influence in the region. 
Without wishing to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, concern was expressed that 
the victim could be threatened and pressured to withdraw her complaint against the four 
Singh men.  
</p>
<p>85. On 11 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, sent an 
allegation letter concerning a dispute that took place on 27 August 2005 between several 
members of the Jat and Dalit communities resulting in the <b>death of</b> <b>one member of the Jat 
community</b>. Upon complaint to the police, four Dalits were immediately arrested and 
charged, and a manhunt was organized to arrest the remaining allegedly responsible 
persons. Subsequently, on 28 August, the Jat community reportedly convened a <i>Maha 
Panchayat</i> (a Grand Caste court) and gave the police and the administration an ultimatum: 
if within 48 hours the guilty persons were not apprehended and justice done, the Jats would 
burn the entire Balmiki Basti (Dalit district), near Samata Chowk, Gohana, Sonepat, 
Haryana. Fearing reprisal from the Jats, some 1,500-2,000 Dalits had fled their homes in 
Balmiki Basti by 30August 2005.  
</p>
<p>86. It was further reported that, on 31 August, while a second <i>Maha</i> <i>Panchayat</i> was 
taking place, a large group of about 1,500&#8211;2,000 armed members of the Jat community 
entered Balmiki Basti and, in four hours, burned 55 to 60 Dalit houses, destroying or 
stealing valuables. The report indicated that about 150-200 policemen were present at the 
scene but took no action. It was further alleged by some witnesses that the police asked the 
Jat rioters not to burn any shop or house that belonged to a non-Dalit.  </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 21 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>87. Reports indicated that several measures to redress the situation were taken, 
including reconstructing the burnt houses at government cost, helping children in the 
affected Dalit families to return to school and organizing nutrition programmes for children 
under the age of 5 years. However, local Dalits contest the claim that the Government has 
paid Rs 100,000 compensation to 55 affected Dalit families. A probe by the Central Bureau 
of Investigation (CBI) was ordered. Allegedly, the CBI report into the incident described it 
as a simple case of arson, allowing many who were involved to remain unindicted even 
though the FIR implicated the Jat community in Gohana in the burning of the Dalit houses.  
</p>
<p>88. On 8 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning the <b>reported 
murder of</b> <b>S.B., wife of B.B., their daughter P. and their two sons S. and R.,</b> all 
belonging to the Dalit community in the village of Khairlanji, Bhandara District, 
Maharashtra. 
</p>
<p>89. On 3 September 2006, a local Dalit policeman was allegedly beaten up by upper-
caste members of the community. B.B., S., P. and R. reportedly testified against alleged 
perpetrators, leading to their arrest. It was reported that on the same day, at about 6 p.m., a 
mob of 200-300 upper-caste villagers, many armed with axes and <i>ubhari</i> (a stick with a 
metal spike), stormed their home and dragged S. B. and her three children out of their house 
where they were stripped naked, beaten and driven to the main village square.  B. B. was 
not at home at the time. Upper- caste men then gang-raped S.B. and her daughter for over 
an hour while bystanders, including upper-caste women, verbally incited the rapists. One of 
P.`s brothers was ordered to have sex with her and when he refused, he was beaten on his 
genitals.  P. was hit on her breasts with an axe and beaten and stabbed with <i>ubhari</i> on her 
genitals. All four persons were hacked to death and the bodies thrown in a canal.  
</p>
<p>90. As of 30 November, although an FIR had been filed, the vast majority of the 
perpetrators, including those who were allegedly involved in the gang rape and murder, had 
not been arrested or charged. Many Dalit families in the village are afraid to testify and, 
reportedly, only one eyewitness has come forward to testify. 
</p>
<p>91. On 26 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
allegation letter concerning an attack against <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ravikumar</b>, a member of the Legislative 
Assembly of the Kaaumannarkoil constituency, owing allegiance to the Vidudalai 
Chruthaiga, the Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), in Sedapalayam village, Cuddalore District, 
Tamil Nadu. Mr. Ravikumar also served as state president of the People&#8217;s Union for Civil 
Liberties, Tamil Nadu-Pondicherry, and was elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative 
Assembly in 2006. 
 
92. According to the information received, on 2 January 2007, Mr. Ravikumar 
sustained injuries to his hands and legs during an alleged attack by a group of 
approximately 100 police officers, including Delta police personnel, in Sedapalayam village 
during a funeral procession for Mr. Siva, a Dalit youth who had been murdered on 1 
January 2007. Twenty-eight other members of DPI were also injured in the attack. Mr. 
Ravikumar was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College in Chennai on 3 January 
2007 and discharged three days later. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 22  
</p><p> 
93. According to reports, the funeral procession was attacked by police officers in 
response to an attempt by some individuals attending the funeral to set fire to houses 
belonging to the alleged perpetrators of Mr. Silva&#8217;s murder. Dalit youths who later went to 
the hospital for medical treatment were reportedly arrested by police on charges of 
attempted murder.  
 
</p>
<p>94. Prior to the events of 2 January 2007, Mr. Ravikumar had reportedly been in 
contact with Gagandeep Singh Bedi, District Collector, Cuddalore, and M. Karunanidhi, 
Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, urging them to ensure that an immediate investigation was 
carried out into Mr. Silva&#8217;s murder, and that the perpetrators were brought to justice. He 
also appealed to the police and the district administration to ensure that law and order was 
maintained during the funeral.  
 
</p>
<p>95. Concern is expressed that Mr. Silva&#8217;s funeral procession was violently suppressed 
by the authorities and that excessive police force may have been used against peaceful 
participants in the funeral. Concern is also raised that Mr. Ravikumar may have been 
targeted due to his high-profile work in defence of the human rights of Dalits. The Special 
Rapporteurs do not condone the violence allegedly committed by members of the public, 
namely the attempt to burn the houses of those perceived to have been responsible for Mr. 
Silva&#8217;s death, and hope that diligent, impartial and thorough police investigations are carried 
out in relation to both alleged incidents. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>96. On 29 May 2006, the Government of India replied to the communication sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on 11 May 2006 indicating the steps taken by the Government 
following the dispute that took place on 27 August 2005 between several members of the Jat 
and Dalit communities resulting in the death of one member of the Jat community. It was 
reported that the Government of Haryana State had instituted an inquiry by the Central 
Bureau of Investigation to investigate the incidents. It was further stated that a case had 
been filed against the 23 accused and that four persons had been arrested by the police; that 
the Deputy Superintendent of Police and the Sub-Inspector of Police had been suspended 
and that departmental action was being taken against them; that the 54 houses which were 
identified as severely affected had been reconstructed and that grants of 5.4 million rupees 
had been given to the 54 families severely affected. It was further noted that a departmental 
grant of 275,000 rupees had been given to 55 other persons affected by the riots, an amount 
of 200,000 rupees had been distributed as daily allowances, and 33.26 rupees in 
compensation had been given to 144 families for loss of their belongings during the riots. It 
was also reported that those who had left their houses at the time of the incident had 
returned to them. 
 
</p>
<p>97. The Government further explained that the National Human Rights Commission of 
India had taken <i>suo motu</i> cognizance of the incident. After considering the case, the 
Commission expressed appreciation for the sensitivity and promptness shown by the State 
Government of Haryana in awarding compensation, repairing and reconstructing the houses 
of the victims and taking action against those responsible. A press release in this regard 
issued by the Commission was attached to the Government&#8217;s communication.  </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of India for the response provided 
to the communication sent on 11 May 2006. In his view, the response confirms not only the 
political will but also the legal strategy of the Government to combat caste-based 
discrimination. However, he is particularly alarmed at the cultural depth of this form of 
discrimination in many parts of the countryside and by the continuing violence faced by the 
Dalit community. 
 
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to the other communications had been 
received at the time this report was finalized. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up 
on theses cases. In the event that no response is received from the Government, he will no 
longer treat the cases as mere allegations but as proven facts.  
 
</p>
<p>100. The Special Rappporteur wishes to refer to the invitation to visit India which he 
requested from the Government in 2004 and 2006 and which has remained unanswered. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates his interest in visiting India with a view to investigating all 
forms of racial discrimination, including caste-based discrimination, which he considers to 
be an integral part of his mandate, in the framework of a regional visit that would also cover 
Pakistan and Nepal. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>101. In the absence of an answer from the Government of India concerning his 
communication of 16 August 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006 /16/Add.1, para. 33), the Special 
Rapporteur is forced to consider the following case no longer as allegations but as proven 
fact.  
</p>
<p>102. According to the information received, on 5 August 2005, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Lenin 
Raghuvanshi,</b> a human rights defender with the Peoples&#8217; Vigilance Committee for Human 
Rights (PVCHR), an organization working for the Dalits and &#8220;lower-caste&#8221; communities in 
Varanasi, received a telephone call from a man (whose identity is known to the experts) 
demanding that <b>S.N. Giri, </b>his associate,<b> </b>withdraw as a candidate from an election due to be 
held in Belwa village on 17 August 2005.  Furthermore, on 7 August 2005, Dr. 
Raghuvanshi allegedly received another phone call from the same person threatening that if 
his associate did not withdraw, Dr. Raghuvanshi, his family and Mr. Giri would be shot 
dead.  Dr. Raghuvanshi recorded the phone conversation and lodged a complaint with the 
Senior Superintendent of the Police and the District Magistrate.  He reportedly also faxed a 
complaint to the Chief Minister of the state.  It was reported that on 10 August 2005, 
<b>Anupam Nagvanshi</b>, field coordinator for PVCHR, was surrounded by a number of people 
connected to the village authorities (whose identities are known to the experts), who asked 
her why she was encouraging the Dalits and &#8220;lower caste&#8221; people to vote in the upcoming 
election.  Ms. Nagvanshi was allegedly threatened with death if she returned to Belwa 
village. Ms. Nagvanshi telephoned the police at approximately 6 p.m. on 10 August 2005 
but no officer was dispatched.  She then sent a written complaint by registered post to 
Phoolpur Police Station.  It was reported that no action was taken by the Phoolpur police.<b> </b></p>

freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, the independent expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>173 members of 
the Nematollah Sufi Muslim community</b>.  
 
</p>
<p>104. According to the information received, on 13 February 2006, they were arrested for 
participating in a peaceful protest, which was reportedly violently suppressed by the 
security forces and members of the Hojatieh and Fatemiyon pro-Government groups.  The 
protest was against an order by the security forces to evacuate the community's place of 
worship, known as the Hosseiniye. At the time the communication was sent, the 173 
individuals were reportedly being interrogated at Fajr Prison in Qom and there were 
concerns that they were being tortured in order to force them to sign pre-prepared false 
confessions stating that the protest had political motivations and was linked to anti-
Government groups. The relatives of the detainees were unable to obtain official 
information about their whereabouts and the detainees had not had access to lawyers. 
Lawyer Bahman Nazari was arrested when he approached officials in an attempt to 
represent the detainees.  
 
</p>
<p>105. Reports indicated that the protest had started on 9 February 2006. On 13 February 
2006, there were hundreds of protesters present in and around the Hosseiniye. At about 3 
p.m. the security forces set a deadline for the protesters to evacuate the Hosseiniye. 
Members of the Fatemiyon and Hojatieh groups also reportedly surrounded the place of 
worship, shouting slogans such as &#8220;Death to Sufis&#8221; and &#8220;Sufism is a British plot&#8221;, and 
distributed leaflets alleging that Sufis are enemies of Islam. The security forces moved in at 
about 4 p.m. and stormed the building, using tear gas and explosives. They beat many of the 
protesters. The next day, the Hosseiniye was demolished by bulldozers. Approximately 
1,200 protesters were arrested and taken away on buses to unknown locations. The 
detainees were interrogated and many were allegedly tortured or ill-treated. Most of them 
were subsequently released; however, 173 were still being held at the time of the 
communication.  According to the information received, those who were released were 
required as a condition of their release to sign papers agreeing not to attend any Sufi 
gatherings in Qom. Some were required to sign documents renouncing Sufism.  
 
</p>
<p>106. It was also reported that arrest warrants had been issued for the main Sufi preacher 
in Qom, Seyed Ahmadi Shariati, and the four lawyers who had previously been acting on 
behalf of the group. Their names are Amir Eslami, Omid Behrouzi, Gholamreza Harsimi 
and Farshid Yadollahi. This incident occurred amid concerns about increasing demonization 
of the Sufi Muslim group. In September 2005, a religious jurist in Qom, Ayatollah Hossein 
Nouri-Hamedani, called for a crackdown on Sufi groups in Qom.

<p>107. On 22 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding <b>52 members of the Nematollahi Sufi Muslim community</b> and their two 
lawyers, <b>Farshad Yadollahi</b> and <b>Omid Behroozi</b>, who are among the 173 members of the 
Nematollah Sufi Muslim community arrested on 13 February 2006 and the subject of the 
communication sent on 1 March 2006, to which no response had been received at the time 
this communication was sent.  
 
</p>
<p>108. According to new information received, on 3 May 2006, 52 members of the 
Nematollahi Sufi Muslim community and their two lawyers, Farshad Yadollahi and Omid 
Behroozi, were convicted on charges of &quot;disobeying the orders of government officials&quot; and 
&quot;disturbing public order&quot;. For the former charge, 25 individuals were fined 10 million 
Iranian rials (equivalent to more than US$ 1,000) and the rest were fined 5 million Iranian 
rials (equivalent to more than US$ 500). For the latter charge, they were sentenced to one 
year&#8217;s imprisonment and 74 lashes. After their release, they would be obliged to report to 
the security officials every month for a period of two years. It was further reported that 
Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi were barred from practising their profession for five 
years. All of them were released on bail and were given 20 days to appeal the judgment.  
 
</p>
<p>109. On 24 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the independent expert on 
minority issues, sent an allegation letter concerning the <b>Azeri Turk minority community</b>. 
According to the information, Azeri Turks are mainly Shia Muslims and are the largest 
minority in Iran, consisting of about 25-30 per cent of the population. They are located 
mainly in the north and north-west of Iran. Reports indicate that, as Shia Muslims, they are 
generally not the main target of discrimination in Iran. However, there exists a growing 
demand for better recognition of their cultural and linguistic rights, including 
implementation of their right to education through the Turkish language. Those who 
actively seek Azeri Turkish cultural and linguistic identity can reportedly be viewed with 
suspicion by the authorities and accused of such charges as &quot;promoting pan-Turkism&quot;.  
 
</p>
<p>110. Examples include the case of Mohammad Reza, Mostafa Evezpoor and Morteza, 
who were the subject of a joint communication sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture on 10 May 2006, and the case of Saleh Malla Abbasi, who was the 
subject of a communication sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 18 
May 2006. According to the information received, the &#8220;Iran Newspaper&#8221; published an 
article with a cartoon depicting Azeri Turks as &#8220;cockroaches&#8221; living in toilets, and urging 
that their food supplies be cut off. This has reportedly triggered protests and hunger strikes 
in universities in Iran.

<b>Observations

<p>111. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to these communications had been 
received from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran at the time this report was 
finalized.

</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications  
</b></p>
<p>113. On 7 February 2006, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran replied to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of 12 December 2005 concerning a speech made by President 
Ahmadinejad on 26 October 2005 in which, according to the information received, he said 
that the State of Israel should be &#8220;wiped off the map&#8221;, that Israel is a &#8220;disgraceful blot&#8221; and 
that &#8220;anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation&#8217;s fury&#8221; (see 
E/CN.4/2006 /16/Add.1, para. 41).  
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur refers to the reply of the Government, which was 
circulated as an official document of the sixty-second session of the Commission on Human 
Rights (E/CN.4/2006/G/10).  
</p>
<p>115. In its reply, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, after reiterating his 
commitment to cooperation with the thematic mandates of the Commission on Human 
Rights, informed the Special Rapporteur that human life was sacred, irrespective of race, 
religion or belief, and that no one had the right to ethnic, racial or religious cleansing, which 
it wholly condemned.  
</p>
<p>116. The Government further indicated that the President&#8217;s remarks were made in 
response to a &#8220;research question&#8221; and deserved an academic answer; the emotionally and 
politically charged environment was counter to the freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>117. It also stated that the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran distinguishes 
between the Jewish religion and Zionism. He has underlined that Jews constitute a 
respectable minority in the Islamic countries, including Iran, and have lived in peace and 
security, enjoying freedom of religion and participation in social and political life in their 
respective societies. In contrast, the President considers that Zionism is an ideology based 
on hegemonic desires and political ambitions, articulated by colonial Powers and artificially 
injected into the Middle East for their purposes. The systematic oppression of the 
Palestinian people by Israel during last half century cannot be forgotten and is known to the 
fair and justice-oriented peoples of the world. Various documents of the United Nations and 
its human rights machinery, including the special procedures, unambiguously attest to the 
atrocities perpetuated in the Occupied Territories by the Zionist regime. 
</p>
<p>118. Furthermore, the Government reported that it has become a daily practice of 
American and Israeli officials to call for a &#8220;regime change&#8221; in Iran, stigmatizing Iran as part 
of the &#8220;axis of evil&#8221; and threatening Iran with a full-scale attack against its infrastructure. 
The Government indicated that it is a legitimate question to ask why these statements do not 
motivate the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s sensitivity. Finally, the Government raised the question of 
whether these remarks advocate &#8220;hostility and violence&#8221;, which are prohibited under article 
20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>119. The Special Rapporteur refers to his general report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/4/19), in which he states that the amalgamation of the State of Israel with all 
Jewish communities, be in the Diaspora or living in Israel, the stereotyping of the Jewish 
people and the non-recognition of their cultural, religious and political diversity constitute 
the root causes of a new form of anti-Semitism. The Special Rapporteur has indicated in his 
report on defamation of religions and global efforts to combat racism, anti-Semitism, 
Christianophobia and Islamophobia (E/CN.4/2005 /18/Add.4) that he does not equate anti-
Zionism with anti-Semitism, even if certain forms of anti-Zionism can hide manifestations 
of anti-Semitism. However, the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran has crossed a line 
by calling for the &#8220;wiping off the map&#8221; of a State Member of the United Nations and by 
organizing a conference in Tehran which questioned the historic truth of the extermination 
of Jews in Europe by Nazi Germany, in order, as indicated by the Government of Iran in the 
note verbale addressed to the Special Rapporteur on 5 March 2007, &#8220;to open a window of 
opportunity for all those who have given the issue a thought from all over the world to 
present their case &#8220;. The Special Rapporteur considers that, by organizing this conference, 
the President of Iran has demonstrated his intention to legitimize revisionism of other forms 
of racism, in particular by inviting, in addition to prominent figures in European anti-
Semitic revisionism such as Robert Faurisson, symbols of anti-Black racism in the United 
States of America such as David Duke, one of the former leaders of the American Ku Klux 
Klan. The participation in the conference of the Ku Klux Klan, a group whose ideology of 
racial superiority has resulted in the most serious racist crimes committed against Afro-
descendants in the United States, shows an alarming degree of insensitivity towards 
historical and current victims of racism.<b>

<p><b>Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>120. On 3 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the independent expert 
on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, sent an allegation letter concerning 
<b>discrimination against Berbers</b> in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.  
 
</p>
<p>121. The information received alleged the existence of discriminatory legislation in 
respect of the Berber culture and identity, such as law No. 24 of the Libyan year 1369 
(1991), which prevents people from using any language other than Arabic in the country. 
Allegedly, these laws forbid all literature and writing which is not in Arabic, and therefore 
the use of the Berber language. It was also alleged that it is forbidden to give children 
names of Berber origin.   
 
</p>
<p>122. It was also alleged that the Government deliberately holds back the development of 
regions with Berber communities. For example, the only hospital in the region of Zouara 
was closed in the 1980s and has not been reopened, and there was no hospital in the region 
at the time this communication was sent. Similarly, the water projects in the country have </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 28  
 
deliberately excluded the regions of Nefoussa and Zouara. The information received also 
indicated that the Libyan education system and schoolbooks do not take into account the 
Berber component in Libya&#8217;s geography, history and culture. Allegations also report that 
persons working for the defence of the Berber community, culture and identity have been 
harassed and ill-treated. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>123. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to this communication had been 
received from the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya at the time this report was 
finalized. 
</p>
<p>124. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up on this case. In the event that no 
response is received from the Government, he will no longer treat the case as mere 
allegation but as proven fact.<b>

<p><b>Myanmar 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>125. In the absence of an answer from the Government of Myanmar concerning his 
communication of 3 March 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006 /16/Add.1, para. 49), the Special 
Rapporteur is forced to consider the following case no longer as an allegation but as a 
proven fact.  
</p>
<p>126. According to information received the <b>Rohingyas</b>, a Muslim ethnic minority living 
in northern Rakhine State (historically known as Arakan), western Myanmar, are targeted 
because of their ethnicity and suffer widespread discrimination at the hands of the 
authorities under policies that do not affect other ethnic minorities to the same extent. 
Moreover, despite the fact that the ancestors of the Rohingyas have resided in Myanmar for 
many generations, the State Peace and Development Council denies their existence as a 
separate ethnic group and considers them to be merely permanent residents of the country, 
as a result of which a majority of Rohingyas would not be able to qualify for citizenship and 
are stateless. In addition, the freedom of movement of the Rohingyas is severely restricted. 
They are virtually confined to their respective villages, unable to access medical and 
educational services, due, inter alia, to the fact that, should they wish to travel outside their 
respective villages, they would require official authorization and must pay a fee which in 
many cases they cannot afford. This restriction, which is not applied to the Rakhine 
population in Rakhine State, seriously affects their standard of living, particularly with 
regard to food security. When Rohingyas nevertheless do attempt to travel without 
authorization, if apprehended, they are reportedly arrested and imprisoned. Moreover, 
security forces are said often to subject Rohingyas to forced labour. They are also said to be 
subjected to arbitrary taxation and confiscation of their land without compensation, and 
furthermore are required to seek and pay for official permission to marry, which in some 
cases is reported to cost the equivalent of several years&#8217; wages;  payment does not 
necessarily guarantee that permission will be granted. Concern was expressed that the 
restrictions and violations of the human rights of the Rohingyas are especially serious 
owing to the fact that they appear to be targeted specifically because of their ethnicity.  </p>

<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>127. The Special Rapporteur refers to the press release of 2 April 2007 issued jointly 
with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the independent 
expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. In the press 
release the experts called on the Government of Myanmar to take urgent measures to 
eliminate discriminatory practices against members of the Muslim minority in northern 
Rakhine State, generally known as the Rohingyas, and to ensure that no further 
discrimination is practised against persons belonging to this community. <b>

<p><b>Nepal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>128. On 10 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief, sent an allegation letter concerning attacks on <b>members of 
the</b> <b>Dalit community in Doti District, Nepal</b>. According to the information received, on 26 
August 2006, Dalit women were harassed by the priest of Shivalaya temple and local men 
when they attempted to worship on the occasion of Teej, a Hindu festival. They were 
eventually barred from entering the temple. Reports indicated that, on 16 September 2006, 
the District Administrative Officer issued a formal notice stating that Dalits have the right to 
enter and worship at public temples, and that those who choose to discriminate on the basis 
of caste, in whatever form, will be prosecuted. However, when Dalit worshippers visited the 
Saileswori temple of Dipayal in Silgadhi, Doti District, on 17 September 2006, their 
worship was disrupted by upper-caste people who physically attacked them with knives and 
other weapons, alleging that the Dalits had been acting in an offensive manner.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>129. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to his communications had been 
received from the Government of Nepal at the time this report was finalized. 
</p>
<p>130. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up on this case. In the event that no 
response is received from the Government, he will no longer treat the case as mere 
allegation but as proven fact.  
</p>
<p>131. The Special Rappporteur refers to the invitation to visit Nepal that he requested 
from the Government in 2004 and 2006, which has remained unanswered. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates his interest in visiting Nepal, in particular to study the issue of caste-
based discrimination, which he considers to be an integral part of his mandate, in the 
framework of a regional visit that would also cover India and Pakistan.  
 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications

<p>132. In a letter dated 4 January 2006, the Government responded to a communication 
sent on 17 November 2004 regarding the alleged rape of S.S. from Inruwa, Sunsari (see 
E/CN.4/2005/18/Add.1. para. 32). On 17 May 2004, at around 11 p.m., 8 to 10 masked </p>

persons attacked the family of S.S. and forcefully took her to a nearby pond belonging to 
D.B. S. was found dead in the pond; she had been gang-raped. According to the 
Government&#8217;s information, the police immediately arrested some local youths on suspicion 
of involvement in the incident, but they were found not to have any connection with the 
incident and were released. As the case was investigated, the police on 29 November 2004 
arrested M.P., M.C., T.N.S.K., K.R.C., D.Y. and R.K.C, permanent residents of 
Bhawanipur, India, and currently residing in Dumraha in Sunsari District. The Government 
indicated that they were produced before the competent authority for trial. On 28 December 
2004, the accused were remanded to pre-trial detention in the District Jail, Morang by the 
order of the Sunsari District Court. M.C. and R.K.C. were released by the court on the 
condition that they report to the court on a specified date. According to the information 
provided, the court has also issued a warrant order.

<p>sp&#233;cial se voit dans l&#8217;obligation de consid&#233;rer le cas suivant non plus comme une all&#233;gation 
mais comme un fait av&#233;r&#233;. 
</p>
<p>136. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le Niger ne poss&#233;derait pas encore de l&#233;gislation 
sp&#233;ciale prohibant toutes formes de traite des personnes et l&#8217;&#233;rigeant en crime. En outre, des 
renseignements indiqueraient que le comit&#233; des experts du Minist&#232;re de justice responsable 
des politiques contre la traite des personnes n&#8217;existerait plus. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, 
le Niger serait devenu un pays de transit pour le trafic de femmes et jeunes filles, certaines 
&#226;g&#233;es seulement de 15 ans, en provenance du Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, B&#233;nin, Burkina Faso et 
Gabon et &#224; destination du Maghreb et de l&#8217;Europe, o&#249; elles seraient forc&#233;es de se prostituer, 
ou encore du Proche-Orient, o&#249; elles seraient exploit&#233;es pour du travail domestique forc&#233;. 
Dans certains cas, ces femmes et jeunes filles seraient &#233;galement forc&#233;es &#224; se prostituer sur 
le territoire du Niger, en particulier dans les r&#233;gions de Zinder, Maradi et &#224; Niamey. L&#8217;acc&#232;s 
limit&#233; &#224; l&#8217;&#233;ducation, illustr&#233; par un taux d&#8217;alphab&#233;tisation des femmes extr&#234;mement bas (9,3 
% en 2002), rendraient les femmes et les jeunes particuli&#232;rement vuln&#233;rable &#224; ce type de 
promesses. Les informations indiqueraient &#233;galement que, dans de nombreuses r&#233;gions du 
Niger, les syst&#232;mes d&#8217;esclavage, historiquement r&#233;pandus au Niger, se seraient transform&#233;s 
en des syst&#232;mes discriminatoires, de castes. Les femmes et des jeunes filles provenant des 
castes d&#8217;anciens esclaves se trouveraient plus expos&#233;es au trafic d&#8217;&#234;tres humains, dans la 
mesure o&#249; elles seraient consid&#233;r&#233;es comme issues d&#8217;une strate sociale inf&#233;rieure. En outre, 
certains riches propri&#233;taires fonciers utiliseraient leurs moyens financiers pour g&#233;n&#233;rer des 
situations de servitude. De v&#233;ritables relations &#171; ma&#238;tre-esclave &#187;, dans lesquelles des 
personnes et leurs descendants sont consid&#233;r&#233;es et trait&#233;es comme la propri&#233;t&#233; personnelle 
d&#8217;une tierce personne, continueraient &#233;galement d&#8217;exister. Dans ce type de cas, les victimes 
seraient forc&#233;es d&#8217;&#233;lever le b&#233;tail, d&#8217;accomplir les travaux agricoles ou domestiques du 
ma&#238;tre en &#233;change d&#8217;un peu de nourriture et d&#8217;un endroit o&#249; dormir. Malgr&#233; l&#8217;entr&#233;e en 
vigueur des lois prohibant et criminalisant l&#8217;esclavage et les pratiques assimil&#233;es en avril 
2004, les renseignements communiqu&#233;s indiqueraient que certains agents publics 
cautionneraient d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment certaines pratiques constituant des crimes au regard de la loi. 
Selon les informations communiqu&#233;es, l&#8217;attitude de certaines autorit&#233;s ferait obstruction au 
travail des organisations de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile et des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme contre 
l&#8217;esclavage au Niger. En particulier, le 28 avril 2005, le Gouvernement aurait arr&#234;t&#233; <b>Ilguilas 
Weila</b>, Pr&#233;sident de l&#8217;ONG Timidria, et <b>Alassane Biga</b>, Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral du bureau de 
Timidria &#224; Tillab&#233;ri. Ce cas a d&#233;j&#224; fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un appel urgent de la Pr&#233;sidente-Rapporteur 
du Groupe de travail sur la d&#233;tention arbitraire, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la 
protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression et le Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du 
Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, en date du 
18 mai 2005. Les experts remercient le Gouvernement pour sa r&#233;ponse prompte et d&#233;taill&#233;e 
du 20 mai 2005 (0003742/MAE/C/SG) dans laquelle il informe que Ilguilas Weila et 
Alassane Biga seraient accus&#233;s de faux et de tentative d&#8217;escroquerie. Selon les derniers 
renseignements des experts, les deux hommes auraient &#233;t&#233; remis en libert&#233; sous caution 
mais la Cour n&#8217;aurait pas rendu d&#8217;ordonnance de non-lieu. Les experts demeurent par 
cons&#233;quent pr&#233;occup&#233;s par la situation de ces deux d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme. 
Enfin, certaines autres pratiques traditionnelles repr&#233;sentant des formes de traite des 
personnes existeraient toujours au Niger. En particulier, celles consistant en ce que les 
parents incapables d&#8217;assurer l&#8217;alimentation de leurs enfants ou pensant ainsi mieux pourvoir 
&#224; leur &#233;ducation, confieraient leurs jeunes fils &#226;g&#233;s sept &#224; douze ans &#224; des enseignants 
religieux (les &#171; marabouts &#187;). Certains marabouts forceraient leurs &#233;l&#232;ves &#224; mendier, fixant 
un quota journalier pour chacun. D&#8217;autres marabouts obligeraient leurs &#233;l&#232;ves &#224; effectuer de 
durs travaux manuels. Beaucoup des parents ne seraient pas conscients de ces pratiques </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 32  
 
lorsqu&#8217;ils confieraient leurs enfants aux marabouts. D&#8217;autres n&#8217;ignoreraient pas la situation, 
mais ils consid&#233;raient le travail des enfants comme faisant partie de la culture nig&#233;rienne.

<p><b>Poland 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>137. On 26 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding the third annual Krakow March for Tolerance, which was due to take place in 
Krakow, Poland, on 28 April 2006. The Krakow March for Tolerance<b> </b>is a peaceful march 
organized by the Campaign against Homophobia in Poland and aims to provide a platform 
for discussion about tolerance, antidiscrimination and respect for the rights of all persons 
regardless of their perceived sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>138. According to the information received, a number of organizations had indicated 
their fear that past violence against this type of peaceful demonstration was likely to occur 
on this occasion. In 2004 peaceful participants in the Krakow March for Tolerance were 
victims of physical attacks by extreme nationalist groups. In November 2005 demonstrators 
in Poznan were reportedly harassed and intimidated by members of a right-wing group 
known as the All Polish Youth. At both events it was reported that the police stood by and 
failed to protect the demonstrators from being harassed and intimidated by members of the 
All Polish Youth who shouted discriminatory slogans at them including &quot;Let's get the fags&quot;, 
and &quot;We'll do to you what Hitler did to the Jews&quot;.  Furthermore, when the police did 
intervene it was reportedly in a violent manner and against the peaceful demonstrators.  
</p>
<p>139. The Poznan event had already been brought to the attention of the Government of 
Poland in a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 5 December 2005 
(see E/CN.4/2006 /16/Add.1, paras. 72-73).  
</p>
<p>140. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative expressed 
their continued concern about the reported harassment of human rights defenders 
campaigning for equality and against discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation, 
and encouraged the Government of Poland to protect participants in the Krakow March for 
Tolerance against any possible discriminatory or hateful abuse.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>141. On 14 June 2006, the Government of Poland sent a reply to the urgent appeal sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 26 April 2006, informing him that the Krakow authorities had 
taken all the necessary measures to ensure that freedom of assembly was not restricted. Two 
gatherings were authorized to take place on 28 April 2006: the March of Krakow Tradition 
and Culture and the March of Tolerance. To avoid possible confrontation with the former, 
the organizers of the March of Tolerance proposed a procession route in consultation with 
the Krakow police. Since the organizers of both public gatherings in Krakow met all the 
legal requirements necessary to conduct a demonstration, there were no grounds for 
prohibiting either the March of Tolerance or the March of Krakow Tradition and Culture. 
Thus, the municipal authorities ensured freedom of peaceful assembly to participants in 
both demonstrations.  </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 33 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>142. The Government further reported that meetings with the organizers had been held 
to ensure the security of the participants. At the same time, it was agreed that 
representatives of the Krakow municipal authorities would also participate in the security 
operation. Seeing that in the past participants in the March of Tolerance had been attacked 
by hooligans, the police decided that special security measures should be engaged to protect 
the gathering. A total of 435 police officers were assigned to protect both demonstrations, 
the great majority of whom provided security for the March of Tolerance. 
</p>
<p>143. When the counter-demonstrators became aggressive, the police formed a cordon 
around the marchers, protecting them from possible incidents. Two attempts were made to 
block the procession. The police responded by ordering the troublemakers to disperse, and 
then used force against them. Theses measures were commensurate with the situation, and 
excessive force was avoided in restoring public order and security. During the operation, the 
police detained 11 individuals for disturbing the peace.  
</p>
<p>144. The Government indicated that the Krakow municipal authorities, while 
recognizing that some demonstrations might irritate or upset individuals who opposed their 
ideas or objectives, acted on the correct assumption that people should be free to organize 
demonstrations without fear of violence on the part of their opponents. Such fear could 
prevent associations or groups from openly expressing their views on various important 
social issues. True freedom of peaceful assembly must not be limited solely to abstention 
from intervention by the State; sometimes it requires the competent authorities to become 
actively involved. In ensuring the security of the march, police allowed participants to 
safely manifest their views. 
</p>
<p>145. Finally, the Government noted that these measures were concordant with 
international human rights agreements binding on Poland, and also the Declaration on the 
Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and 
Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, adopted by the 
General Assembly on 9 December 1998.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>146. On 21 February 2006, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter 
dated 5 December 2005 concerning the banning of assemblies organized by the sexual 
minority community in Warsaw (June 2004 and May 2005) and Poznan (November 2005). 
The Government of Poland indicated that it did not share the concern expressed by the 
Special Rapporteur in connection with the abolition of the Office of the Government 
Plenipotentiary, at the same time determining that &#8220;tasks pertaining to the prevention of all 
forms of discrimination shall be implemented by the Minister of Labour and Social Policy 
and the remaining members of the Council of Ministers, as competent.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>147. Pursuant to an ordinance issued by the Prime Minister on 9 December 2005 
concerning the statute of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, a department for 
women&#8217;s affairs, the family and prevention of discrimination was established within the 
structure of the Ministry. In accordance with the Ministry&#8217;s rules of procedure, the 
department &#8220;is responsible for coordination of actions connected with the status of women 
and the family in society, and implements tasks concerning the prevention of discrimination 
in all spheres of social, economic and political life, with the exception of matters concerning 
the prevention of ethnic discrimination&#8221; (ordinance of the Minister of Labour and Social 
Policy of 30 December 2005 introducing the rules of procedure of the Ministry of Labour </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1

and Social Policy). The above circumstances indicate that protection against discrimination 
will now be broader than in the past, since it will not be restricted to issues of gender 
inequality. 
</p>
<p>148. In the information received, the Government listed some articles of its national 
legislation to show that regulations of Polish law guarantee freedom of assembly and 
provide for the possibility of its restriction. On 18 January 2006 the Constitutional Tribunal 
of Poland ruled that article 65 of the law on road traffic of 20 of June 1997 in the part 
incorporating the word &#8220;assemblies&#8221; was incompatible with article 57 of the Polish 
Constitution, which ensures everyone&#8217;s right to organize peaceful assemblies and 
participate in them and provides for its restriction only by statute. The ruling of the 
Constitutional Tribunal has enormous practical significance for the implementation of the 
right of assembly. In addition to ascertaining the unconstitutionality of the cited provision of 
the law on road traffic, invoked by the local authorities in prohibiting the assemblies, it also 
contains a catalog of guidelines for the local authorities concerning their future conduct, so 
as to ensure that their decisions comply with the law and Poland&#8217;s international obligations.  
</p>
<p>149. Concerning the compatibility of the prohibition of the right to be free from all 
forms of discrimination, the Government of Poland pointed to rulings of the European Court 
of Human Rights and the European Commission on Human Rights which show that in all 
the situations where the local authorities prohibited the organization of assemblies and their 
organizers appealed against unfavourable decisions, the competent appellate organs or 
courts had issued judgements quashing the decisions prohibiting the assemblies. In other 
words, all the decisions of the administrative organs issued in contravention of domestic 
laws, and which could be seen as contradicting Poland&#8217;s international obligations, were 
annulled and are no longer binding in the domestic legal order. 
</p>
<p>150. The Government of Poland reported also on the training for law enforcement 
officials concerning the rights of sexual minorities. Problems pertaining to discrimination 
are discussed during training provided by State institutions to many professional groups. 
One example of such training was the PHARE 2002 project &#8220;Strengthening Anti-
Discrimination Policies&#8221; implemented by the Secretariat of the Government Plenipotentiary 
for Equal Status of Women and Men. A key component of the project consisted in preparing 
a model and programme of training on the prevention of and fight against discrimination on 
the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender and religion. The training was 
designed to provide representatives of different professional groups with the knowledge 
needed to identify and counter discriminatory phenomena and to sensitize them to the 
possibility of discrimination against different social groups. An additional, long-term 
assumption of the project was that it would lead to the implementation of similar training by 
professional associations, thus increasing the number of persons sensitized to discrimination 
and prepared to counteract it effectively. 
</p>
<p>151. The Polish authorities have also taken steps to train judicial officials. A programme 
of continuing anti-discrimination training for judges and prosecutors has been launched, 
with special emphasis on labour law and social security issues and due reference to the 
preventive measures and anti-discrimination legislation of the European Union. The project 
is a continuing undertaking. Police officers are another professional group provided with 
intensive training. The Government has launched a National Programme against Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (2004-2009) designed to sensitize the 
public to problems of xenophobia, racism and anti-Semitism and to support the related </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 35 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>research. The project includes training for police, border and customs officers and prison 
staff. 
</p>
<p>152. Poland ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 3 March 
1977, thus guaranteeing to all persons on its territory and subject to its jurisdiction full 
protection of the rights and freedoms envisaged under the Covenant. Discrimination, 
including against groups of different sexual orientation, is prohibited in a number of legal 
acts. Any person who has been denied equal treatment may pursue appropriate claims. 
Protection against discrimination on different grounds is explicitly provided in the 
Constitution, as well as civil, criminal and labour law. Since 1 May 2004 Poland has also 
been bound by directives obligating EU member States to ensure individual assistance to 
victims of discrimination in pursuing their claims connected with discrimination.  In 
particular, the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 1997 (art. 32) provides that all 
persons are equal before the law, have the right to equal treatment by public authorities and 
cannot be discriminated against for whatever reason in political, social or economic life. 
The Penal Code of 1997 (arts. 256 and 257) prohibits the instigation of hatred because of 
national, ethnic, racial and religious differences or non-denominationalism, and similarly 
insulting behaviour. The Civil Code of 1964 (arts. 23 and 24 in connection with art. 415) 
also provides victims of discrimination with the possibility of seeking damages. Under the 
Civil Code victims may invoke provisions protecting personal interests to claim damages or 
compensation. Also, the Labour Code of 1974 prohibits any direct or indirect discrimination 
in employment, employee recruitment and in work relations. 
</p>
<p>153. It should be emphasized that the legal regulations prohibiting discrimination grant 
persons of different sexual orientation the same legal protection as that enjoyed by other 
persons whose rights have been violated through discrimination. The prohibition of 
discrimination against all persons in political, social and economic life is a constitutional 
principle. It is obvious that this also encompasses the prohibition of discrimination on the 
ground of sexual orientation. The prohibition of this type of discrimination is contained in 
numerous international agreements to which Poland is a party. Since the Constitution 
stipulates that an international agreement ratified upon prior consent granted by statute has 
precedence over statutes if such an agreement cannot be reconciled with the provisions of 
such statutes, it should be understood that full institutional protection against all forms of 
discrimination is ensured within the Polish legal order. <b>

<p>154. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its detailed responses to his 
communications. <b>

</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent  
</b></p>
<p>155. On 21 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the 
murder of<b> Samba Lampsar</b>, a Senegalese student and active member of African Unity, an 
NGO working for the promotion of tolerance and the elimination of racism in St. 
Petersburg.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 36  
</p><p> 
156. According to the information received, on 7 April 2006, Mr. Lampsar and several 
other students of African origin were attacked by an unidentified person while walking in 
the city centre, after having participated in a weekly celebration of intercultural friendship 
between Russians and foreigners. The assailant was hiding beside the club where the 
gathering took place and blocked the students' way, shouting Nazi slogans. He shot at the 
students as they tried to escape, and killed Mr. Lampsar. The murderer then ran away. A 
shotgun bearing a swastika and the inscription &#8220;White Power&#8221; was later found in the area. 
Prior to the incident, Mr. Lampsar had actively participated in anti-racism events; in 
particular, he had been giving anti-racism lessons in several schools in St. Petersburg.  
</p>
<p>157. It was reported that the public prosecutor opened an investigation into this case 
under article 105-2 of the Russian Criminal Code (murder aggravated by racial or national 
hatred). The Special Rapporteur expressed his deepest concern regarding the assassination 
of Samba Lampsar, which seems to have occurred in a climate of increasing hostility 
towards foreigners, minorities and human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>158. On 25 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on the right to education and the independent expert on minority issues, sent an urgent 
appeal concerning<b> discriminatory treatment of Georgians by the Russian authorities. 
</b>According to the information received, persons of Georgian origin, whether newly arrived 
in Russia or members of the long-resident ethnic Georgian community, were the specific 
target of discriminatory practices and measures allegedly undertaken in response to the 
arrest in Georgia of four Russian military officers on 27 September 2006.  
</p>
<p>159. Between 6 and 16 October, 682 Georgian nationals and stateless people from 
Georgia were deported and on 17 October another 150 people were expelled. Several 
hundred were said to be held in detention centres in Moscow in very harsh conditions, 
deprived of sufficient nutrition and medical aid while awaiting expulsion. The experts had 
been informed about the death of. Tengiz Togonidze, a Georgian citizen aged 58, during his 
transfer from St. Petersburg to Moscow on a bus packed with people. Reports indicated that 
Mr. Togonidze, who suffered from cardiac asthma, spent five days in detention in St. 
Petersburg without receiving proper medical assistance.  
</p>
<p>160. Many of these people had their legal visas or residence permits cancelled on 
arbitrary pretexts. It was reported that some of the deportees were refugees from Abkhazia, 
among them stateless persons or holders of old Soviet passports whose papers were 
destroyed by police officers. It was alleged that these practices were also taking place in 
other Russian cities. It was also reported that some of the deportees, including women and 
children, were transferred to Abkhazia and were allegedly asked to pay approximately US$ 
1,000 per person to travel to the territory under the jurisdiction of the Government of 
Georgia. Reportedly, courts were issuing deportation rulings automatically, without taking 
into consideration the circumstances of each case, violating procedural norms and depriving 
persons of Georgian origin of their right to a hearing before the court and to legal 
assistance.  
</p>
<p>161. The experts were also informed about instructions for the implementation of Order 
No. 0215 of the Department of the Interior of the St. Petersburg and Leningrad region of 30 
September 2006, requesting all police units to make the maximum effort to find and deport 
persons of Georgian origin illegally located on Russian territory. Police officers were 
instructed to initiate court proceedings for cases of violations by persons of Georgian origin </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>of rules regarding foreign citizens that were punishable only with the most serious measure 
of deportation.  
</p>
<p>162. Moreover, according to the information received, on 6 October 2006, various 
schools in Russia were requested to provide specific information on pupils from Georgia, 
including Russian pupils of Georgian origin, as well as their families and their families&#8217; 
possible whereabouts. It was reported that this request was aimed at identifying illegal 
migrants in order to be able to deport them to Georgia. Similar instructions were given by 
Russian authorities to three Russian schools in Georgia. On 3 October 2006, pupils and 
teachers with Georgian citizenship were not admitted to the schools affiliated with the 
Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation in Tbilisi, Batumi and Akhalkalaki, Georgia. 
Notices were posted on the door stating that access to the schools was prohibited to 
Georgian citizens. The information received also indicated that several raids had been 
carried out in different Russian cities against different businesses owned by or employing 
persons of Georgian origin.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>163. On 14 August 2006, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to the 
communication of 21 April 2006. The Government indicated that that the body of S. 
Lampsar was discovered on 7 April 2006 in the vicinity of No. 17, 5th Krasnoarmeiskaya 
Street, with gunshot wounds to the neck and upper back. Forensic analysis indicated that the 
victim died owing to massive blood loss. The Government stated that the St. Petersburg 
Admiralty district procurator's office opened criminal case No. 203048 on the evidence of 
an offence contrary to article 105, paragraph 2 (k), of the Criminal Code of the Russian 
Federation (homicide motivated by ethnic or religious hatred or enmity or blood feud). A 
crime response unit established to investigate the offence proceeded to conduct a number of 
investigations and inquiries. Seven active members of the &quot;Mad Crowd&quot; extremist youth 
group were arrested on suspicion of committing the offence, including the perpetrators, 
D.A. Borovikov and A.O. Milyugin, whose guilt was confirmed by eyewitness testimony. 
Mr. Borovikov was killed in a firefight with law enforcement officers. In the course of the 
investigation, it was established that the above-mentioned gang had been involved in seven 
homicides and two serious woundings in St. Petersburg and Leningrad province. The 
Government noted that the existence of this criminal gang has prompted the St. Petersburg 
procurator's office to open a criminal case under article 209 of the Criminal Code 
(thuggery); the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation is overseeing the 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>164. On 20 February 2007, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to the 
communication of 25 October 2006.  It indicated that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation and the Federal Migration Service, which operates under its authority, 
exercise, within their established fields of competence, the authority to prevent and put a 
stop to administrative offences, enforce public order and monitor compliance by foreigners 
and stateless persons with the rules governing residence and temporary sojourn in the 
Russian Federation. They do so in strict accordance with the law, which they apply without 
exception to all foreigners irrespective of their citizenship, and, consequently, there is no 
emphasis placed on detecting violations of federal law by Georgian citizens in particular. In 
this regard, it was pointed out that Georgians constitute nowhere near the majority of the 
illegal migrants deported from Russia; migrants from Central Asia, for example, are far 
more numerous. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 38  
</p><p> 
165. According to Federal Migration Service figures, Georgian citizens were guilty of 
27,438 administrative offences in 2006. Over the same period, the courts issued 5,622 
orders for the deportation of Georgian citizens from the Russian Federation. Deportation 
was subject, in all instances, to the relevant court order becoming enforceable. There were 
thus no grounds to assert that Georgians are being subjected to mass deportation on account 
of their ethnic background. It was further noted that all the Georgian citizens detained for 
breaches of the rules governing sojourn in the Russian Federation, including Mr. 
Togonidze, were held until immediately before their deportation from Russia in holding 
centres under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs where they were provided 
with beds, toiletries, food and medical attention and were able to receive messages from 
friends and relatives. Together with other Georgians awaiting deportation, Mr. Togonidze 
was taken to Moscow by bus on 16 October 2006. His state of health worsened at 
Domodedovo Airport; an emergency medical team was called and began resuscitation 
procedures. Despite all efforts, Mr. Togonidze passed away. According to the findings of 
the expert from the Forensic Bureau at the City of Moscow Health Department, Mr. 
Togonidze&#8217;s death was caused by methadone poisoning (methadone is a narcotic). 
</p>
<p>166. In addition, the Government&#8217;s reply indicated that between July and November 
2006, the authorities in Moscow launched 245 sets of criminal proceedings against ethnic 
Georgians, detained 273 individuals under article 91 (grounds for detention of a suspect) of 
the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, arrested 258 individuals and referred 224 cases 
involving ethnic Georgians to the courts; they also detained 28 individuals wanted for 
various crimes. It was noted that the city procurator's office had determined that the 
criminal proceedings were brought legally and for good reason, and that preventive 
measures were applied with due regard for current legislation. In addition, the Office of the 
Moscow City Procurator had received no complaints from Georgian citizens to the effect 
that their rights and liberties had been violated or that they had been subjected to 
discrimination on grounds of their nationality. It was further noted that there have been no 
established instances of extortion in connection with the enforcement of article 18.8 of the 
Russian Code of Administrative Offences. 
</p>
<p>167. The Government noted that, during checks by the Moscow City Procurator's 
Office, it was discovered that the individuals concerned were being legally held in holding 
centres and legally deported from the Russian Federation, and that staff at holding centres 
No. 1 and No. 2 requested the district courts to amend violation orders issued against 
citizens of the Republic of Georgia on the basis of erroneous personal data. This was in 
breach of article 30.11 of the Russian Code of Administrative Offences since the cases were 
not brought to the city procurator's office so that protests could be lodged against the orders. 
Contrary to the administrative legislation in force, the courts issued instructions to correct 
the personal data on the strength of which Georgian citizens were being deported from the 
Russian Federation. Given these breaches of the law, on 24 November 2006 the Office of 
the Moscow City Procurator lodged with the Moscow Municipal Court 22 protests, relating 
to 11 individuals, against the district courts&#8217; instructions to correct personal data and against 
the rulings in cases of administrative offences. So far, the Municipal Court has upheld 16 of 
the protests relating to the 11 individuals; the remainder are still under consideration. Where 
the protests have been upheld, the courts&#8217; instructions have been set aside and the cases 
have been referred back to the district courts for fresh examination.  
</p>
<p>168. The Government also noted that the Ministry of Education and Science, the Federal 
Education Agency and the Federal Education and Science Inspectorate reported that they 
had at their disposal no information about discrimination against students of Georgian </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1

</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>nationality or the establishment of lists of such students and their families with a view to 
their future prosecution and deportation from Russia. Upon checking, the Moscow City 
Education Department uncovered instances in which Internal Affairs employees, on the 
pretext of verifying compliance with the law on migration, had made unwarranted demands 
on schools and other institutions to furnish the personal details of ethnic Georgian pupils 
and their parents. The Moscow City Internal Affairs Authority conducted official 
investigations into these cases and the culprits were punished. The head of the Authority, 
Mr. V.V. Pronin, sent a telegram to all Authority offices notifying staff that violating 
citizens&#8217; rights during the performance of routine duties would not be tolerated and 
reminding them to maintain ethical standards of professional conduct.  
</p>
<p>169. Finally, the Government indicated that, in a bid to forestall events giving rise to 
nationalistic feelings in society, State procurators in the constituent entities of the Russian 
Federation were instructed on 5 December 2006 to monitor the observance by Internal 
Affairs organs of foreigners&#8217; and stateless persons&#8217; rights and freedoms with increased 
vigilance. The Russian Ministry of Education and Science is taking steps to prevent displays 
of xenophobia in educational institutions.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>170. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its 
replies to the communications sent on 21 April 2006 and 25 October 2006. The Special

<p>171. In the absence of an answer from the Government of Saudi Arabia concerning his 
communication of 12 April 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006 /16/Add.1, para. 87), the Special 
Rapporteur is forced to consider the following case no longer as an  allegation but as a 
proven fact. 
</p>
<p>172. According to information received, a cartoon was published in <i>Arab News</i>, an 
English- language daily newspaper published by the State corporation Saudi Research and 
Publishing Company, depicting rats wearing Star of David skullcaps. The rats were shown 
scurrying backwards and forwards through holes in the wall of an edifice bearing the sign 
&#8220;Palestine House&#8221;. It is reported that this image replicates a scene taken from the Nazi film 
&#8220;Jew Suess&#8221;, which depicts Jews as vermin to be eradicated by mass extermination. This 
scene had also been used in the media during the Hitler regime. <b>

<p><b>Slovenia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>173. On 20 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, the independent expert on minority issues and the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to education, sent an allegation letter concerning the <b>unresolved status of individuals 
removed from the Slovenian registry</b> <b>of permanent residents in 1992</b>,<b> </b>who are often 
referred to as &#8220;erased&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>174. According to the information received, before the dissolution of the Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), its citizens were citizens of one of the constituent 
republics as well as being citizens of SFRY. After Slovenia&#8217;s independence, citizens of 
other republics having permanent residence in Slovenia could apply for Slovenian 
citizenship by 26 December 1991. On 26 February 1992, at least 18,305 individuals were 
removed from the Slovenian registry of permanent residents, pursuant to provisions of the 
Foreign Citizens Act, and their records were transferred to the registry of foreigners. The 
Government did not legislate to regulate the legal status of the citizens of other former 
SFRY republics who had been permanent residents in Slovenia, resulting in the &#8220;erasures&#8221;.  
The 18,305 &#8220;erased&#8221; were mainly people from other former Yugoslav republics who had 
been living in Slovenia and had not applied or had been refused Slovenian citizenship in 
1991 and 1992, after Slovenia became independent.  
</p>
<p>175. It was reported that some of the affected persons were born in Slovenia but, based 
on the republican citizenship and birthplace of their parents, had remained citizens of other 
Yugoslav republics. Others had moved to Slovenia from other Yugoslav republics before 
the dissolution of SFRY. A majority of them are non-Slovene or of mixed ethnicity, 
including a significant number of members of Roma minority communities. A number of 
former officers of the Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army had not applied for, or were refused, 
Slovenian citizenship, often on the grounds that they had participated in the war against 
Slovenia or were otherwise perceived as not being loyal to Slovenia.  
</p>
<p>176. In 1999, the Slovenian Constitutional Court ruled that the &#8220;erasure&#8221; violated the 
principle of equality and was unconstitutional. In the same year, the Act on the Regulation 
of the Status of Citizens of Other Successor States to the Former SFRY in the Republic of 
Slovenia was adopted, allowing those affected to apply within three months for Slovenian 
citizenship. However, the legislation did not apply retroactively, resulting in the exclusion 
of those who were expelled from Slovenia or prevented from entry or re-entry as a result of 
the &#8220;erasure&#8221;. In 2002, Amendments to the Act on Citizenship entered into force, offering a 
one-year opportunity for those who had a registered permanent address in Slovenia on 23 
December 1990, and who had lived there since, to apply for Slovenian citizenship. 
However, the Amendments also excluded those individuals who had been forced to leave 
the country as a result of the &#8220;erasure&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>177. In 2003, the Slovenian Constitutional Court ruled the Act on the Regulation of the 
Status of Citizens of Other Successor States to the Former SFRY in the Republic of 
Slovenia unconstitutional. Following the ruling, the &#8220;technicalities bill&#8221;, a legislative 
measure aimed at reinstating the status of individuals removed from the population registry, 
was adopted by the Slovenian parliament in October 2003, but the bill was rejected at the 
subsequent referendum. The Constitutional Court issued a further decision in December </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 41 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2003 stating that the decision of April 2003 could be considered as sufficient legal basis for 
issuing decisions on permanent residence with retroactive effect, without there being any 
need for specific legislation. On this basis, the Slovenian Ministry of the Interior began in 
February 2004 to issue individual written decisions, stating that those concerned were 
permanently resident in Slovenia with retroactive effect. This practice was discontinued in 
July 2004.   
</p>
<p>178. As a result, &#8220;erased&#8221; persons, reportedly still numbering about 6,000, continued to 
live in Slovenia without Slovenian citizenship or permanent residence permit, being treated 
as &#8220;illegal&#8221; foreigners or stateless persons. This had a significant negative effect on their 
exercise of various human rights. The affected individuals have had significantly limited or 
no access to a wide range of social services, including comprehensive health care. Reports 
indicate, for example, that some of those who were in need of medical treatment have not 
had access to it since their &#8220;erasure&#8221;. Some &#8220;erased&#8221; persons had to pay the full amount for 
basic medical treatment, unlike Slovene citizens and those with permanent residence. Some 
children who were removed from the registry of permanent residents in 1992, or whose 
parents were removed from the registry, lost access to secondary education. It is reported 
that the situation had improved in the past years, but for some of the &#8220;erased&#8221;, who lost 
many years of education or had to delay the completion of their studies, the negative impact 
remained. It was also reported that many of the &#8220;erased&#8221; lost their jobs or could no longer 
be legally employed. There were also reports of job dismissals. Another negative impact of 
the &#8220;erasure&#8221; is the loss or a significant reduction of their entitlement to a pension. This had 
serious negative effects on their right to social security and an adequate standard of living.  
</p>
<p>179. Furthermore, without wishing to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, the 
Special Rapporteurs and the independent expert expressed their concern at the ongoing 
negative and reportedly disproportionate effects with regard to the access of persons 
belonging to Roma minority communities in a range of fields, particularly regarding 
housing conditions, employment, health and education. By virtue of their situation as a 
minority without a &#8220;kin State&#8221;, these persons were placed in an even more disadvantageous 
position than &#8220;erased&#8221; persons belonging to other ethnic groups, as they have faced greater 
difficulties in regulating their status elsewhere in the former SFRY.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>180. On 26 June 2006, the Government of Slovenia replied to the communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 20 April 2006, explaining that the major political 
rearrangement of Central and Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 1990s and the 
formation of new States have resulted in a wide variety of members of non-Slovenian 
minority, ethnic or religious groups living in the territory of Slovenia. Among them are 
members of the nations of the former Yugoslavia: Albanians, Bosnians, Montenegrins, 
Croats, Macedonians, Muslims and Serbs as well as a certain number of Roma, living 
scattered across Slovenia in larger numbers as a result of the contemporary migration 
processes from other areas of the former SFRY. Migration from the former SFRY to larger 
towns in the territory of Slovenia such as Ljubljana, Maribor, Celje, Velenje and Jesenice 
took place for economic, political and military reasons, and numerous measures have been 
introduced by the State aimed at integrating them into the social environment in the shortest 
possible time.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 42  
</p><p> 
181. The Government affirmed that Slovenia, as a democratic country, is aware of the 
needs of immigrants from the former SFRY and that its regulations must be in accordance 
with international legal norms. As regards statutory regulation of the status of members of 
other nations and nationalities living in the Republic of Slovenia, the first measure 
addressing this was the 1990 Statement of Good Intentions, which guarantees all rights 
established in the Constitution to the Italian and Hungarian ethnic minorities, the right to a 
multifaceted development of their culture and language as well as the right to obtain 
citizenship of Slovenia if they wished. Along the same lines, the Constitutional Act 
Implementing the Basic Constitutional Charter on the Independence and Sovereignty of the 
Republic of Slovenia stipulates that  
</p>
<p>&quot;citizens of other republics who on the day of the plebiscite on the independence and 
sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia, 23 December 1990, were registered as 
permanent residents of and actually live in the Republic of Slovenia shall have, 
except in the cases specified in Article 16 of this Act, equal rights and duties as the 
citizens of the Republic of Slovenia until they acquire citizenship of the Republic of 
Slovenia under Article 40 of the Citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia Act or until 
the expiry of the time limits determined in Article 81 of the Aliens Act.&quot; 
</p>
<p>182. The Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia does not contain any provisions 
directly applicable to special protection of the members of nations of the former Yugoslavia 
in the Republic of Slovenia or other minority ethnic communities in the Republic of 
Slovenia, who may exercise their rights in accordance with articles 14, 61 and 62 of the 
Slovenian Constitution, which enable them to preserve their national, linguistic and cultural 
identity. Also, bilateral agreements concluded between the Government of Slovenia and the 
Government of the home country of the minority ethnic group or immigrants concerned 
serve as legal bases for the status of members of nations of the former Yugoslavia who live 
in the Republic of Slovenia.  
</p>
<p>183. With reference to the allegations, the Government of Slovenia noted that the 
statement that there are still 6.000 stateless persons and persons without a permanent 
residence permit residing in the Republic of Slovenia is not accurate. It was reported that, as 
early as 2001, of the total number of 18,305 persons who lost their permanent residence 
owing to their unregulated status, there still remained 4,205 persons in the register of 
permanent residents who failed to regulate their status in the period from Slovenia's 
independence until 2001. The Government&#8217;s information on persons who were registered as 
permanent residents on the day of independence and who failed to apply for citizenship of 
the Republic of Slovenia or for a residence permit afterwards shows that citizens of other 
successor States to the former SFRY were not erased from the register, but were required to 
regulate their status in compliance with legislation governing migration. In the initial period 
the majority of them did not apply for Slovenian citizenship, even though it could be 
obtained under extremely favourable conditions (registered permanent residence in the 
Republic of Slovenia and payment of an administrative fee of approximately &#8364;3). The 
Constitutional Court of the Republic of Slovenia, in its decision No. U-1-246/02-28 of 3 
Apri12003, ruled that the time limit for filing an application according to the 1999 Act 
Regulating the Legal Status of Citizens of Former Yugoslavia Living in the Republic of 
Slovenia was too short. Since the publication of this decision, it was again possible to file an 
application for a permanent residence permit in compliance with this Act; however, only 
124 persons had regulated their status by the spring of 2006.  </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p>184. In the field of health care, the problem of the so-called &quot;erased&quot; did not actually 
appear until two years ago. These persons do not have health insurance because they have 
more or less been dismissed from employment, have no citizenship, and are often also 
unsettled (i.e. without a permanent residence) and consequently without health insurance. 
Nevertheless, these persons have had access to emergency health services, which are/were 
paid for by the Ministry of Health in accordance with article 7 of the Health Care and 
Health Insurance Act. Therefore, with regard to the right to health care, the so-called 
&quot;erased&quot; have always had access to emergency medical treatment.  
</p>
<p>185. With reference to the enrolment in secondary school of some children from the 
former Yugoslavia, the Government pointed out that, in accordance with the competent 
ministry's instructions, secondary schools had to enroll all children whose status was 
unresolved (refugees and asylum-seekers included). Their right to secondary education has 
never been violated. Slovenia complies with all international regulations on the right to 
education. Decision No. U-I-31/04-14 of 1 December 2005 of the Constitutional Court 
stipulated that the condition for the acquisition of the right to child benefit was fulfilled if a 
child legally resided in the Republic of Slovenia, which was proved with a certificate of 
registration of residence in the Republic of Slovenia. On the basis of this constitutional 
decision, the Parental Protection and Family Benefits Act (Official Gazette RS, No. 47/06 - 
amendments) was amended; article 67 stipulates that the acquisition of the right to child 
benefit is no longer subject to the permanent residence of a child.  
</p>
<p>186. As regards the conditions for the acquisition of work permits for the citizens of 
successor States to the former SFRY, the Government stated that the transitional provisions 
of the former Employment of Aliens Act (Official Gazette RS, No. 33/92) provided for 
special conditions for the acquisition of work permits for these persons. Article 23, 
paragraph 1, of the Act stipulates that the citizens of other republics of the former SFRY 
should be issued with a personal work permit valid for a period of one year if, upon the 
entry into force of the Act in the Republic of Slovenia (i.e. 18 July 1992), they were in an 
employment relationship and had worked in Slovenia for less than 10 years; they were in an 
employment relationship for a definite or indefinite period of time as working migrants; or 
they were registered with the Employment Service of Slovenia and were entitled to social 
welfare benefit in accordance with regulations on employment and insurance in case of 
unemployment. In 1992, 18,853 personal work permits were issued in accordance with that 
provision and upon the expiry of the permit the employer had to apply for an extension. If 
the employer did not apply for an extension, the alien's employment relationship terminated. 
Under article 23, paragraph 2, of the Act, the citizens of other republics of the former SFRY 
who upon the entry into force of the Act were in an employment relationship in Slovenia 
and had worked there for at least 10 years, working migrants excepted, could acquire a 
personal work permit for an indefinite period. In 1992, 13,350 such work permits for an 
indefinite period of time were issued in accordance with this provision.  
</p>
<p>187. The Government further explained that a work permit under article 23 of the 
Employment of Aliens Act had to be applied for within 90 days of the entry into force of the 
Act. If an alien applied for citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia in accordance with article 
40, paragraph 1, of the Citizenship Act of the Republic of Slovenia and was refused, that 
person could acquire a personal work permit if he or she applied for it within 90 days of the 
entry into force of the Employment of Aliens Act, or of the decision to refuse citizenship 
becoming final if the decision became final after the entry into force of the Act (article 24, 
paragraph 1, of the Employment of Aliens Act). Aliens receiving a negative decision on </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 44  
 
their application for citizenship under article 40, paragraph 2 or 3, of the Citizenship Act 
could not acquire a work permit.  
</p>
<p>188. If a personal work permit was not applied for within the set deadline, the 
employment relationship was terminated when the decision on the termination of 
employment became final. Therefore, the acquisition of a work permit in accordance with 
article 23 of the Employment of Aliens Act was not preconditioned by any alien status or 
residence registration, but mainly by an employment relationship in Slovenia and the 
periods of employment. In accordance with the general provisions of the former 
Employment of Aliens Act (art. 8), the acquisition of a personal work permit valid for an 
indefinite period of time was subject to the alien's residence in Slovenia for more than 10 
years on the basis of a permanent residence permit; the issuing of other work permits (work 
permit applied for by an employer, personal work permit valid for a limited period) was not 
subject to a regulated alien status. The Government explained that &#8220;alien status&#8221; does not 
imply that a person cannot enter the Slovene labour market. Since the category of &quot;erased&quot; 
does not exist in official employment records, the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social 
Affairs does not have any information on whether and how many persons &quot;erased&quot; from the 
Register of Permanent Residents lost their jobs.  
</p>
<p>189. Regarding pensions, the Government highlighted that decision U-1-246/02-28 of 3 
April 2003 of the Constitutional Court (Official Gazette RS, No. 36/2003) determines only 
the right to the prepayment of a pension for military personnel who were subject to the loss 
of permanent residence in Slovenia in 1992. Rights which can be asserted on the basis of 
pension and disability insurance are not subject to citizenship and permanent residence. 
Rights under pension and disability insurance are rights deriving from insurance and are 
connected with the payment of contributions to the Pension and Disability Insurance 
Institute of the Republic of Slovenia. At first, the right to the prepayment of a military 
pension was recognized by the Institute on the basis of the Decision on the Prepayment of 
Military Pensions, and in 1998 the Act on the Rights under the Pension and Disability 
Insurance of Former Military Insured Persons was adopted. Article 1 of the Decision 
stipulated that beginning on 1 November 1991 the Republic of Slovenia would be in charge 
of the payment of pensions and other benefits in accordance with the regulations on pension 
and disability insurance of military insured persons acquired by the entitled persons - 
Slovene citizens with permanent residence in Slovenia and other entitled persons with 
permanent residence in Slovenia since 26 June 1991. The dates of 18 July 1991, 18 October 
1991 and 1 February 1992 were key dates for the acquisition of rights. The Act Regulating 
the Legal Status of Citizens of Former Yugoslavia Living in the Republic of Slovenia 
stipulated that after 6 February 1992 their permanent residence would not be recognized; 
however, the majority of persons asserted their rights before this date. On the basis of the 
Act on the Rights under the Pension and Disability Insurance of Former Military Insured 
Persons, the Institute reviewed all cases and acted in accordance with the applicable laws. 
As early as 1999, on the basis of decision No. U-I-284/94 of 4 February 1999 of the 
Constitutional Court, the Institute reviewed the majority of cases and retroactively 
recognized the right to a military pension of the entitled persons.  
</p>
<p>190. As far as immigrant Roma are concerned, the Government noted that they have the 
same rights and obligations as Slovenian citizens provided they hold this status. Some 
important rights, especially for Roma, are also granted on the basis of permanent residence 
(e.g. social subvention, which is allocated to approximately 90 per cent of Roma living in 
Slovenia). Otherwise, they enjoy the rights applicable to them as aliens, in conformity with 
international rules and national legislation. They also may exercise some additional rights </p>

<p>     A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 45 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>under articles 14, 61 and 62 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. In accordance 
with Slovene legislation, an unemployed person being entered in the register of unemployed 
persons at the Employment Service of Slovenia is not obliged to state his or her ethnicity. 
Consequently, the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs does not have official data 
on the number of unemployed members of the Roma communities; only unofficial estimates 
are available. On the basis of the Active Employment Policy Measures Programme, special 
measures for the Roma are taken in areas where they are concentrated. With regard to 
employment, the members of the Roma communities are thus treated at least equally among 
the prioritized when compared to the members of other ethnic communities. 
</p>
<p>191. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Government has been 
actively engaged in the preparation of the Roma Community Act which will 
comprehensively and systematically resolve all issues regarding the Roma and define 
special employment measures, vocational education and training, and the employment of 
the Roma. This act is expected to be adopted this calendar year.  
</p>
<p>192. As regards the retroactive effect of the right of residence, between February and 
July 2004, 4,093 supplementary decisions were issued ex officio in compliance with the 
Constitutional Court decision granting to individuals the right to residence in the Republic 
of Slovenia with retroactive effect. In addition, 64 claims for re-entry in the register of 
permanent residents were filed with the Ministry of the Interior on the basis of the 
Constitutional Court decision. The examination of cases showed that 12 persons had been 
granted citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia where Constitutional Court decision did not 
provide for the regulation of their status with retroactive effect. In 34 cases, it was 
established that the claim for the issue of a supplementary decision on the basis of the 
Constitutional Court decision was not justified, as the applicant had no valid residence 
permit and the status could therefore not be granted with retroactive effect. In 11 cases, a 
supplementary decision was issued or the applicant's request was granted on the basis of the 
ascertained factual situation. Five cases are being processed by the Ministry.  
</p>
<p>193. The Government reported that 31 claims for damages had been filed so far; one of 
the reasons for the adoption of a constitutional act that would supplement the Constitutional 
Court decision is also the regulation of the payment of damages. In this respect, the 
Ministry of the Interior drew up a draft Constitutional Act amending the Constitutional Act 
Implementing the Basic Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the 
Republic of Slovenia in order to resolve the problem of citizens of other successor States to 
the former SFRY whose registration of permanent residence in the Republic of Slovenia 
had terminated after the provisions of the Aliens Act began to apply to them. The draft Act 
amends article 13 of the Constitutional Act Implementing the Basic Constitutional Charter 
on the Independence and Sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia, which stipulates that 
citizens of other republics of the former SFRY registered as permanent residents of the 
Republic of Slovenia and who actually lived in Slovenia on the day of the plebiscite on 23 
December 1990 have equal rights and obligations as citizens of the Republic of Slovenia 
(except for purchasing real estate), until the time when the provisions of the Aliens Act 
begin to apply to them. The draft Act regulates the issue of permanent residence permits and 
the conditions for obtaining a permanent residence permit with retroactive effect for those 
citizens of the successor States to the former SFRY who still have no permanent residence 
permit of the Republic of Slovenia.  
</p>
<p>194. The Act lays down the conditions for acquiring a permanent residence permit with 
retroactive effect for citizens of other successor States to the former SFRY who had </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1 
Page 46  
 
permanent residence in the Republic of Slovenia on 23 December 1990 and who had 
already acquired a permanent residence permit under the Act Regulating the Legal Status of 
Citizens of Former Yugoslavia Living in the Republic of Slovenia. The draft Act further 
sets out those cases in which the condition of actual residence in the Republic of Slovenia 
has been met and what absences from Slovenia do not affect this condition. The draft Act 
also regulates the right to compensation in cases when the beneficiary suffered damage due 
to the unlawful action of an official person or authority.  
</p>
<p>195. The Government stated that the adoption of the Constitutional Act is essential for 
the final resolution of the problem and for regulating the status of citizens of successor  
States to the former SFRY. The Government has examined the draft Constitutional Act; 
however, additional harmonization is required, as the speediest possible adoption of the Act 
is in the interest of both the Government and all individuals concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>196. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Slovenia for the detailed reply 
provided. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Sudan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent  
</b></p>
<p>197. On 3 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding an 
attack on and looting of the market of the town of Shearia, Southern Darfur<b>.</b> According to 
the information received, the attack and looting took place in the first week of November 
2005 and was carried out by Janjaweed militias working in collaboration with government 
forces. It was reported that during this attack, persons from the Zaghawa tribe and shops 
belonging to them were specifically targeted. After the attack, persons belonging to the 
Zaghawa tribe fled the town to El Fahal, Otash and Dereig IDP camps. 
</p>
<p>198. On 15 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, sent an allegation letter concerning <b>the rape of a group of women </b>at 
Kalma IDP camp in Nyala, Southern Darfur. According to the information received, on 24 
July 2006, approximately 25 armed militias, some wearing army uniforms, attacked a group 
of 20 women aged 19-42 outside the camp while the women were collecting firewood. All 
the women belong to the Fur ethnic group. The militiamen beat the women with the butts of 
their guns and flogged them before raping 17 of the women. There had been a steady 
gathering of armed Janjaweed militias in the areas surrounding Kalma camp. They had 
previously attacked humanitarian workers and undertaken nightly armed incursions into the 
camp in order to loot.  
</p>
<p>199. The Special Rapporteurs expressed their strong concern about these allegations of 
sexual assault committed by militia against internally displaced women. They strongly 
urged the Government to protect internally displaced persons, especially women and girls, 
from all forms of sexual and other violence and to arrest, disarm and prosecute the 
perpetrators. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>200. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to these communications had been 
received from the Government of the Sudan at the time this report was finalized. 
</p>
<p>201. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up on these cases. In the event that no 
response is received from the Government, he will no longer treat the cases as mere 
allegations but as proven facts. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>202. In the absence of an answer from the Government of the United States of America 
concerning his communication of 13 July 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006 /16/Add.1, para. 96), the 
Special Rapporteur is forced to consider the following case no longer as an  allegation but 
as a proven fact. 
</p>
<p>203. According to the allegations received, <b>Mohammed C.</b> was arrested in Karachi, 
Pakistan, on or around 21 October 2001. He was transferred to a prison, where he was 
stripped to his shorts and hung by his wrists . He was kept in this position for 10 to 16 hours 
a day for three weeks; if he moved, he was beaten. He was blindfolded for the whole period 
except for three to five minutes each day, when the blindfold was removed so he could eat. 
Mohammed was subsequently taken to Peshawar for 10 days, and then transferred to United 
States custody in late November 2001. In United States custody, he was given blue overalls, 
hooded, shackled, beaten and threatened with death. It was said that the soldiers repeatedly 
called him &#8220;nigger&#8221; and that that was the first time he had heard the word. He was flown to 
the United States airbase in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he was physically assaulted on 
arrival and kept naked for the first week, beaten and doused with freezing water. On one 
occasion, a guard grabbed Mohammed&#8217;s penis and threatened to cut it off with a pair of 
scissors he was brandishing. In early January 2002, Mohammed was transferred to 
Guant&#225;namo Bay. He was sedated, shackled, hooded and gagged for the flight and beaten 
upon arrival. During the ensuing interrogation process, he was hung by the wrists for up to 
eight hours at a time, beaten, deprived of sleep, and exposed to strobe lighting, extreme cold 
from air conditioners and racial abuse. It is reported that dogs were used to intimidate 
detainees, and that he was brutally removed from his cell, sprayed with pepper and 
physically assaulted. In 2003, during an interrogation, the interrogator allegedly burned 
Mohammed&#8217;s arm with a cigarette. In May 2004, Mohammed was transferred to the newly 
opened Camp V, where he is said currently to be held for up to 24 hours a day in solitary 
confinement in a concrete cell measuring approximately 4 x 2 m. He is allegedly supposed 
to be able to leave his cell three times a week for an hour, for a shower and exercise; 
however, it is reported that he is usually allowed out just once a week. Large fans make a 
constant noise and 24-hour lighting hurts his eyes. On his first day in Camp V, the 
interrogator allegedly said to Mohammed: &#8220;We made this camp for people who would be 
here forever. You should never think about going home. You&#8217;ll be here all your life. Maybe 
one day my son will come to see you as you get old. Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll keep you alive so 
you can suffer more. If you don&#8217;t believe me, look at these walls&#8221;. And he allegedly banged 
on the concrete wall to show how solid it was. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.1

<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>204. In the light of this case, the Special Rapporteur strongly supports the report of the 
group of special procedures mandate holders on the situation of detainees in Guant&#225;namo 
Bay (E/CN.4/2006/120) which notes the complete disregard of respect for the human rights 
of the detainees. The use of racist language confirms the reality of manifestations and 
expressions of racism and racial discrimination in Camp V.
