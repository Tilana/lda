<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided by</i> the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 
Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and 
Development, Human Rights Council resolutions 7/24 of 28 March 2008, 14/12 of 18 June 
2010, 16/7 of 24 March 2011, 17/11 of 17 June 2011 and 20/12 of 5 July 2012, as well as 
those of the Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of all forms of violence 
against women, and recalling relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and relevant 
resolutions and the agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women,1 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000, 1820 
(2008) of 19 June 2008, 1888 (2009) of 30 September 2009, 1889 (2009) of 5 October 2009

  <i>Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2013, Supplement No. 7</i> (E/2013/27). 
</p>

<p>April 2006, and all relevant Security Council resolutions on children and armed conflict, 
including resolutions 1882 (2009) of 4 August 2009 and 1998 (2011) of 12 July 2011 ; 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> its resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the Human Rights 
Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with these resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Outraged </i>by the prevalence of rape and other forms of sexual violence, which 
disproportionately affect women and girls, and occur in all spheres of society, in public and 
private life, in peace time, during periods of civil unrest or political transition, and in 
conflict and post-conflict situations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that rape or any other form of sexual violence is unlawful in all 
circumstances and in all places, regardless of the sex, age, ethnicity or any other personal 
circumstances of the victim, including during arrest, questioning, in detention, in jail, in 
residential institutions, during displacement or while under international protection, 
whether or not committed by State or non-State actors in the course of achieving political or 
military objectives or in times of civil unrest or political transition, or whether or not in the 
course of an international or non-international armed conflict, 
</p>
<p><i>Underscores</i> <i>the fact</i> that shame, stigma, fear of reprisals and negative economic 
consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced household income, prevent many 
women from reporting cases of rape and other forms of sexual violence, and from seeking 
justice for these crimes, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>the importance</i> of law enforcement pursuing adequate investigations and 
prosecutions for rape and other forms of sexual violence perpetrated on any ground against 
women and girls, and recognizing that a lack of accountability unacceptably reinforces 
social normalization of and tolerance for these crimes, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that the forced marriage of women and young girls is a violation of 
their human rights and makes them particularly vulnerable to violence, including sexual 
violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that child, early and forced marriages expose young married girls 
to a greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often lead to early childbearing 
and increase the risk of disability, stillbirth, obstetric fistula and maternal death, and reduce 
their opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge or develop 
employable skills, and violate and impair the full enjoyment of the human rights of women 
and girls, preventing women and girls from becoming full, contributing members of 
society, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that violence against women has both short- and long-term adverse 
consequences for their health, including their sexual and reproductive health, and the 
enjoyment of their human rights, and that respecting and promoting sexual and reproductive 
health, and protecting and fulfilling reproductive rights in accordance with the Programme 
of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing 
Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences is a necessary 
condition to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women to enable them to 
enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to prevent and mitigate 
violence against women, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, as well as the recognition by the ad hoc 
international criminal tribunals that rape can constitute a war crime, a crime against 
humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide or torture, </p>


<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the responsibility of all States to comply with their relevant obligations 
to put an end to impunity and to effectively use all available means to thoroughly 
investigate and prosecute those subject to their jurisdiction that are responsible for such 
crimes, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>that women&#8217;s empowerment, including women&#8217;s economic empowerment 
and full and equal access to resources, women&#8217;s full integration into the formal economy, in 
particular in economic decision-making, and their full and equal participation at all levels 
of public, political and cultural life is essential for addressing the underlying causes of 
violence against women, including sexual violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the important role of the United Nations system, in particular of the 
United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, in addressing 
discrimination and violence against women and girls at the global, regional and national 
levels and in assisting States, upon their request, in their efforts to eliminate and prevent all 
forms of violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all acts of violence against women and girls, whether 
these acts are perpetrated by the State, private persons or non-State actors, and calls for the 
elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the family, within the general 
community and where perpetrated or condoned by the State, in accordance with the 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at rape and other forms of sexual violence in all their 
manifestations, which often target victims associated with communities, ethnic groups or 
other groups regarded as antagonistic to or insufficiently supportive of the group or entity 
whose forces commit the crime, and are frequently calculated to humiliate, dominate, instil 
fear in, disperse and/or forcibly relocate members of such groups, including, but not limited 
to, the victims and their families, and can be used as a form of ethnic cleansing; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also expresses deep concern</i> at the use of rape and other forms of sexual 
violence to intimidate, harass, deter and commit reprisals against women and girls, 
including women human rights defenders, in public spaces, and calls upon States to ensure 
that women and girls are enabled to participate as members of civil society without fear of 
reprisal, coercion, intimidation or attacks; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges</i> States to take meaningful steps to address the harmful attitudes, 
customs, practices, stereotypes and unequal power relations that underlie and perpetuate 
rape and other forms of sexual violence by, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Publicly condemning, at the highest levels, rape and sexual violence against 
women and girls on any grounds, and providing visible and sustained leadership, by men 
and women alike, to support effective prevention; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Engaging all segments of society, including community and religious leaders, 
civil society organizations, the private sector and the media, in prevention efforts, such as 
awareness-raising and education campaigns targeting the general public to increase their 
understanding of the harmful effects of violence; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Engaging, educating, encouraging and supporting men and boys to take 
responsibility for their behaviour and to become active partners in the prevention and 
elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to end 
the stigmatization of victims by encouraging a change in attitudes, norms and behaviour 
through the promotion of gender equality; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Measuring the effectiveness of policies and programmes to prevent sexual 
violence, including by carrying out regular evaluation and monitoring, and collecting and 
disseminating data disaggregated by sex, age, disability and other relevant factors; </p>


<p>5. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> States to increase measures to protect women and girls from all 
forms of violence, including sexual violence, by addressing their security and safety, 
including through, inter alia, awareness-raising, involvement of local communities, crime 
prevention laws, infrastructures, public transportation, sanitation facilities, street lighting 
and improved urban planning; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> that women should be empowered to protect themselves against 
sexual violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and 
decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and 
reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that all forms of rape and sexual violence are 
criminalized in national law, and to take appropriate legislative and policy steps to ensure 
the prompt and adequate investigation, prosecution and accountability of perpetrators, 
including by strengthening the capacity of the criminal justice system; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that national laws and policies are in compliance with 
their international human rights obligations and are non-discriminatory by, inter alia, 
permitting prosecution of marital rape and repealing provisions that require corroboration 
of testimony; enable perpetrators of rape to escape prosecution and punishment by 
marrying their victim; and subject victims of sexual violence to prosecution for moral 
crimes or defamation; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Affirms</i> the need for States to take practical steps to ensure women&#8217;s access to 
justice, including by creating an enabling environment where women and girls can easily 
report incidents of violence, including sexual violence, through, inter alia, victim services, 
testimonial support and the possibility of publication bans, by improving victim and 
witness protection, protecting confidentiality and privacy rights, and providing law 
enforcement officials and first responders with human rights training; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underscores</i> <i>the importance</i> for States to address all health consequences, 
including physical, mental and sexual and reproductive health consequences, of rape and 
other forms of sexual violence against women and girls by providing accessible health-care 
services that are responsive to trauma and include affordable, safe and effective treatment; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon</i> Governments, in cooperation with the private sector, non-
governmental organizations and other civil society actors, as appropriate, to address the 
long-term consequences faced by victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence, 
including legal discrimination and social stigmatization, as well as the effects on children 
born as a result of rape or who witness such violence; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> for States and relevant United Nations agencies to ensure 
that measures to provide protection to victims and witnesses of rape and other forms of 
sexual violence extend to and address the specific needs of those most vulnerable to these 
forms of violence, including indigenous, disabled, refugee, internally displaced and 
trafficked women and girls, those forced into sexual exploitation and slavery, women in 
custody and women and girls forcibly recruited by armed forces and armed non-State 
actors; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Underlines</i> that, in situations of peaceful protest, civil unrest, public 
emergency or political transition, States must continue to take all necessary measures to 
protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of 
sexual violence, and must ensure that such acts, whether or not committed by State or non-
State actors in the course of achieving political or military objectives or, as a means of 
intimidation or repression, are promptly investigated and prosecuted; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Condemns</i> all acts of sexual exploitation, abuse and trafficking of women and 
children by military, police and related civilian personnel, including those involved in </p>


<p>United Nations operations, and affirms the need for personnel-contributing countries to 
continue to take all appropriate action necessary to combat these abuses by such personnel, 
including by ensuring that appropriate training is provided, that any allegations of rape or 
other forms of sexual violence against any such personnel are investigated and prosecuted, 
and that perpetrators are held accountable; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon</i> States to demonstrate their commitment to preventing sexual 
violence by promoting and protecting women&#8217;s human rights and the equal participation 
and full involvement of women in society and by ensuring that women are active 
participants in decision-making processes, including peace, transitional justice, political 
transition and constitutional reform processes; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Takes note</i> of the efforts to develop a non-binding international protocol on 
the investigation and documentation of sexual violence in conflict, drawing on existing 
local, regional and international guidance, to set out international standards for the 
investigation of rape and sexual violence to ensure that the strongest possible evidence is 
collected and that victims receive sensitive and sustained support; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Affirms</i> <i>its intention</i> to ensure that, where appropriate, the mandates of future 
fact-finding missions or commissions of inquiry require them to devote specific attention to 
violence against women and girls in their reports and recommendations, or upon renewal of 
existing mandates; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Pledges</i> to ensure that information gathered by its mechanisms that are of 
relevance to the women, peace and security agenda are transmitted to the General 
Assembly and, as appropriate, for consideration by the Security Council; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Invites</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to ensure, upon request, the rapid deployment of expertise to investigate allegations 
of mass rape or systematic sexual violence, including by utilizing existing regionally 
diverse and gender-balanced multilateral rosters of readily deployable trained professionals, 
such as the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
Women/Justice Rapid Response joint roster of international investigators of sexual and 
gender-based crimes; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Invites</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to include, during the annual 
full-day discussion on women&#8217;s human rights to be held during the twenty-ninth session of 
the Human Rights Council, a discussion on the outcome of the meeting of the open-ended 
intergovernmental expert group to be convened by the Secretary-General in 2014 and 
organized by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on ways and 
means to more effectively prevent, prosecute and punish gender-related killings of women 
and girls, and on the work carried out on good and promising practices, such as the non-
binding model protocol and the best practices guide for the investigation of gender-related 
killings in Latin America; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences and of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
Sexual Violence in Conflict, and takes note with appreciation of the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on State responsibility for eliminating violence against women;2 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequence, as set out by the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 16/7, for a period of three years; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>23. <i>Also decides</i> to continue consideration of the issue of the elimination of all 
forms of violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences, as a matter of high 
priority, in conformity with its annual programme of work.
