<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On the 18 and 19 March 2013, in the exercise of his mandate &#8220;to gather, request, 
receive and exchange information and communications from all relevant sources&#8221; 
(A/HRC/RES/15/14), the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
participated in a consultation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Representatives of indigenous 
peoples from Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, 
Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam participated in the consultation, together with members 
of the legislative bodies and national human rights institutions of the Philippines, Malaysia 
and Thailand. Written information was also submitted by meeting participants. 
</p>
<p>2. The consultation took place over two days. It was divided into three sessions 
organized around the following principal themes: (a) lands, territories and resources, with a 
focus on extractive industries; (b) militarization and impact of national security measures of 
Governments; and (c) self-determination, which included issues such as identity, religious 
discrimination, customary justice and political participation. Issues related to social and 
economic conditions were also addressed in each of the sessions. Within each thematic 
session, indigenous representatives from each country and subregion were given time to 
present information to the Special Rapporteur. Subsequently, the Special Rapporteur had a 
chance to ask questions and request clarifications from the meeting participants. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report provides an overview of the main issues raised during the 
consultation within each of the thematic areas. It also contains a series of overarching 
conclusions and recommendations on the basis of the information received. The report 
presents the issues brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur in general terms, 
without pointing out specific country examples at this time. Further, examples of 
government laws and policies, as well as specific actions to address the concerns 
mentioned, are not included in the report, given its nature as a report on the consultation 
meeting itself. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges, however, that many noteworthy 
laws, policies and programmes related to indigenous peoples, as well as good practices and 
positive developments, exist throughout the region. 
</p>
<p>4. In the coming months, within the terms of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur 
intends to communicate directly with the relevant Governments about many of the concerns 
raised during the consultation, and request their views on these concerns. He also intends to 
issue corresponding observations and recommendations, based on the allegations received 
and any responses by the Governments concerned, noting positive developments and 
outstanding challenges. The communications concerning specific countries will be made 
public and presented to the Human Rights Council for its attention. The Special Rapporteur 
hopes that these communications, as well has his observations and recommendations, will 
be of use to States, indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives and organizations, and others in 
Asia as they work to address the human rights concerns facing indigenous peoples in the 
region.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to warmly thank the organizers and hosts of the 
consultation: the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact, the Jaringan Orang Asal Semalaysia, and 
the Partners of Community Organizations in Sabah, with support from the Center for Orang 
Asli Concerns. He would also like to thank those representatives from the Asia region who 
presented their concerns and shared their stories with him.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Indigenous peoples in Asia 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur is aware that the vast majority of the people in the countries 
of the Asian region may be considered, in a literal sense, indigenous to the region. He 
concurs with the participants of the consultation, however, that there are particular groups 
that distinguish themselves from the broader populations of the Asian countries and that fall 
within the scope of the international concern for indigenous peoples as it has developed 
throughout the United Nations system and in connection with his mandate. 
</p>
<p>7. The groups in Asia that fall within the international rubric of &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; 
include groups such as those referred to as &#8220;tribal peoples&#8221;, &#8220;hill tribes&#8221;, &#8220;scheduled tribes&#8221; 
or &#8220;adivasis&#8221;. The international concern for indigenous peoples, as manifested most 
prominently by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
extends to those groups that are indigenous to the countries in which they live and have 
distinct identities and ways of life, and that face very particularized human rights issues 
related to histories of various forms of oppression, such as dispossession of their lands and 
natural resources and denial of cultural expression. Within the Asian region, the distribution 
and diversity of such groups varies by country, as does the terminology used to identify 
them and legal recognition accorded to them. These groups, some of which span State 
boarders, include, among others, the: 
</p>
<p>(a) Chakma, Marma and Tripura (collectively known as Jumma), and Santal, and 
Mandi, of Bangladesh, commonly referred to as Adivasi and officially referred to as tribes 
(upajati), minor races (khudro jatishaotta), ethnic sects and communities (nrigoshthi o 
shomprodai);  
</p>
<p>(b) Broa, Bunong, Chhong, Jarai, Kachak, Kavet of Cambodia, officially referred 
to as ethnic minority groups, indigenous minority peoples and Khmer-Loeu (hill tribes);  
</p>
<p>(c) Gond, Oraon, Khond, Bhil, Mina, Onge, Jarawa, Nagas of India, officially 
referred to as Scheduled Tribes or Adivasi (original inhabitants);  
</p>
<p>(d) Masyarakat adat communities, including groups such as the Dayak Benuaq, 
the Orang Tengger and the Orang Badui of Indonesia, a subset of whom are officially 
referred to as komunitas adat terpencil; 
</p>
<p>(e) Ainu of Japan, officially referred to as indigenous peoples, and the 
Ryukyuans or Okinawans, who have sought similar recognition as indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>(f) The majority of the Mon-Khmer, Sino-Tibetan and Hmong-Mien grouping in 
the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, officially referred to as ethnic minorities and non-
ethnic Lao;  
</p>
<p>(g) Orang Asli (original peoples) of peninsular Malaysia, the Bukitans, Bisayahs, 
Dusuns, Sea Dayaks, Land Dayaks groups of Sarawak, and the natives of Sabah, officially 
referred to as aborigines and natives;  
</p>
<p>(h) Shan, Kayin (Karen), Rakhine, Kayah (Karenni), Chin, Kachin and Mon of 
Myanmar, commonly known as ethnic nationalities and officially referred to as national 
races;  
</p>
<p>(i) Magar, Tharu, Tamang, Newar, Rai, Gurung and Limbu of Nepal, commonly 
known as Adivasi Janajati and officially referred to as indigenous nationalities; 
</p>
<p>(j) Aeta, Ati, Ibaloi, Kankanaey, Mangyan, Subanen of the Philippines, 
officially referred to as indigenous peoples and indigenous cultural communities;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>(k) Karen, Hmong, Lahu, Mien of Thailand, commonly known as ethnic 
minorities and officially referred to as &#8220;chao khao&#8221; or &#8220;hill tribes&#8221;, and the nomadic sea 
gypsies or &#8220;Chao Lay&#8221;; and  
</p>
<p>(l) Tay, Thai, Hmong, Muong and Khmer of Viet Nam, officially referred to as 
ethnic minorities (dan toc thieu so, dan toc it nguoi).  
</p><p>8. Today these groups are among the most discriminated against, socially and 
economically marginalized, and politically subordinated parts of the societies of the 
countries in which they live. Regardless of the controversy around issues of definition and 
categorization, it is apparent that political actors in Asia agree that there is a need to address 
the human rights issues facing these distinct peoples, which are issues very similar to those 
faced by groups unquestionably recognized as indigenous peoples in other parts of the 
world, and which fall within the sphere of the current international concern for the rights of 
these peoples. 
</p>
<p>9. It is worth noting that all of the countries addressed in the consultation supported the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples when it was adopted by 
the General Assembly in 2007, with the exception of Bangladesh, which abstained from the 
vote on the Declaration. Although not espousing a fixed definition of the term 
&#8220;indigenous&#8221;, the specific relevance of the Declaration, as evident by its terms, and of the 
various United Nations programmes and mechanisms concerning indigenous peoples, 
including the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, is to those groups indigenous to a territory 
that are in non-dominant positions, and that have suffered and continue to suffer threats to 
their distinct identities and basic human rights in ways not felt by dominant sectors of 
society.  
</p>
<p>10. In adopting the Declaration, State Members of the United Nations manifested their 
support for the Declaration&#8217;s call for affirmative and concerted measures to address the 
disadvantaged conditions of indigenous peoples in accordance with the human rights 
principles elaborated upon in that instrument. The Special Rapporteur does not question 
that the Declaration applies to disadvantaged indigenous peoples in Asia, as it does to 
indigenous peoples elsewhere. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of human rights issues raised during consultation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Securing rights to lands and resources in the context of extractive 
activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Recognition and protection of land and resources rights  
</b></p>
<p>11. A principal concern expressed by the participants at the consultation is the lack of 
adequate regulatory protections for indigenous peoples&#8217; customary rights over land, 
territories and resources. In many countries throughout the region, there is no specific 
legislation that recognizes indigenous peoples&#8217; customary land tenure. Even in those States 
where the regulatory frameworks afford such recognition, significant challenges remain to 
secure those rights in practice. Implementation of land laws has been found wanting, with 
slow land demarcation rates and formal procedures that place a heavy burden of proof on 
indigenous communities to demonstrate ownership.  
</p>
<p>12. In addition, despite notable jurisprudence in a few Asian countries recognizing the 
rights of indigenous groups to their customary lands, the gazetting of indigenous lands has 
been slow and fraught with problems. Some Governments have continued to challenge 
court decisions recognizing pre-existing rights to customary lands. Misrepresentation of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>customary law and misunderstanding of indigenous conceptions of land and natural 
resource management are alleged to have led to inconsistent land tenure practices. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur also received allegations that, in the face of inadequate 
regulatory frameworks, indigenous peoples&#8217; lands in Asia continue to face a number of 
threats. Land dispossession by non-indigenous settlers and migrants continues in many 
countries. The adoption of policies in States promoting individual titles over collective land 
titles was also raised as an issue in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur received information that, across the Asia region, the dispossession of land is 
having a profoundly negative impact on indigenous peoples&#8217; social and cultural patterns 
and means of subsistence.  
</p>
<p>14. Another matter of growing concern is the manner in which lands that are 
traditionally occupied by indigenous peoples are officially designated for conservation or 
tourism. Indigenous participants highlighted that conservation wildlife management 
legislation empowers Governments to declare lands as conservation areas or limit access to 
wildlife resources, thereby dispossessing indigenous peoples of their customary lands or 
impeding their subsistence activities. Those people who remain in, or continue to access, 
conservation areas for subsistence purposes have been in many instances subjected to 
criminal prosecution.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Extractive, energy and development industries 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur has received, both during the consultation and on an 
ongoing basis, information about the widespread negative impacts of extractive projects 
that are implemented in or near indigenous peoples&#8217; territories in places throughout Asia. 
Such activities represent one of the major challenges to securing indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
to land, territories and resources across the region, and in some instances are alleged to pose 
an imminent threat to their physical and cultural survival. Escalating violations of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights are also associated with the absence of appropriate and effective 
consultation and oversight processes around the planning, authorization and 
implementation of mining, dam and plantation projects.  
</p><p>16. The demand for minerals and metals, combined with the liberalization of mining 
legislation to facilitate foreign direct investment in mineral rich areas, has fuelled an 
unprecedented expansion in mining, oil and gas projects in indigenous peoples&#8217; territories. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed of the negative impacts of these projects on a range 
of rights of indigenous peoples. Mining projects have reportedly resulted in displacement of 
indigenous peoples, the alienation of their lands, as well as in limitations to access to areas 
within their traditional territories. There are allegations of widespread health impacts of 
development projects, including on the reproductive health of women. Furthermore, past 
and existing exploration and exploitation projects have involved the dumping of tailings 
into rivers and collapsed tailings dams, resulting in significant negative environmental 
impacts within indigenous areas. Indigenous groups also cited problems with actions of 
police, military and security forces in relation to extractive projects. 
17. A heightened focus by Governments on hydroelectric power appears to have set in 
motion developments that are having profound effects on indigenous peoples in several 
places in Asia. Over time, the construction of major hydroelectric projects has led to 
massive displacement of indigenous peoples in several countries. On top of this historical 
legacy of displacement, a series of additional dams involving potential displacement are 
planned throughout the region. It is alleged that, in many instances, inadequate impact 
assessments and safeguards have been put in place around hydroelectric projects, and that 
there is a lack of transparent and reliable information in relation to the projects. Indigenous 
peoples have called for a review of pending hydroelectric construction projects to ensure 
compliance with social, environmental and human rights norms and safeguards. Finally, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>military and security forces are alleged to use force and intimidation against indigenous 
peoples who opposed hydroelectric projects, and at times such opposition has led to an 
eruption of violence between protestors and security and military forces.  
</p>
<p>18. As is the case with mining and hydroelectric projects, recent years have seen a rapid 
growth in biofuel, sugar cane, rubber and timber plantations in indigenous peoples&#8217; 
territories in a number of Asian countries. Plantations cover millions of hectares of land 
throughout the region, significant portions of which are in indigenous peoples&#8217; territories. 
The Special Rapporteur received information that, in some jurisdictions, communal titles 
are reportedly provided to indigenous communities with the intent of facilitating oil palm 
plantations, rather than facilitating the pursuit of development models chosen by indigenous 
peoples themselves. Major social and cultural impacts of plantations were also raised as a 
matter of concern. Furthermore, a concern exists around the extent of the migration into 
indigenous territories that is necessary to operate the plantations. In many cases brought to 
the attention of the Special Rapporteur, the presence of police, military and private security 
in relation to plantation projects was associated with a climate of intimidation and 
allegations of widespread abuses.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur received information about inadequate or absent 
consultation and consent procedures in relation to all kinds of development projects. 
Consultations that are conducted are described as ranging from exercises in intimidation to 
mere information provision, or as efforts to convince peoples to accept projects rather than 
opportunities to make informed decisions. The Special Rapporteur also received 
information that consultation and consent procedures are often highly abbreviated processes 
and, in some jurisdictions, the imposition of bureaucratic rules and time frames 
incompatible with indigenous decision-making processes have rendered consultation and 
consent procedures largely ineffective. Further, even where agreements have been reached, 
the agreements are said to provide inadequate protection for indigenous peoples&#8217; underlying 
substantive rights, especially rights to lands and resources.  
</p>
<p>20. Meeting participants also highlighted as a matter of concern that inadequate and 
inappropriate compensation and remedial measures are available to indigenous peoples 
affected by extractive operations. Where compensation has been awarded for negative 
impacts on indigenous peoples, it has often allegedly been limited to financial awards rather 
than restitution of lands. In addition, consultation and consent-seeking processes are often 
conducted by multinational companies that implement projects, and indigenous 
representatives at the consultation with the Special Rapporteur suggested that the 
Governments of the countries that are home to these companies need to ensure that those 
companies are not complicit in rights violations. Finally, constitutional or legislative 
frameworks that recognize indigenous peoples&#8217; participatory rights are, according to the 
information received, frequently subordinated to legislation facilitating resource 
development. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Conflict, peace and physical security in indigenous territories 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the consultation, indigenous participants from a number of countries cited 
the militarization of indigenous peoples&#8217; territories as one of the major challenges to the 
realization of their rights. Low-scale protracted conflict has persisted for decades in some 
countries and continues to affect indigenous peoples, and in other countries, even where 
conflict has formally ended, military presence in indigenous areas continues. According to 
the information raised at the consultation, in some States the term &#8220;indigenous&#8221; or &#8220;tribal&#8221; 
has become synonymous with separatist movements among security forces and the police. 
Another allegation is that indigenous peoples, as well as the human rights organizations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>supporting them, are frequently labelled as members of these movements and stigmatized 
as criminals.  
</p>
<p>22. The presence of military forces in indigenous areas is alleged to have resulted in a 
number of violations of the rights of indigenous peoples. The widespread nature of 
militarization in the region according to the information received by the Special Rapporteur 
poses a serious obstacle to access to justice and freedom of expression. Intimidation and 
fear of reprisal prevents indigenous peoples from taking legal action against the military for 
ongoing and historical abuses. Killings of indigenous activists and human rights defenders 
continue in many places throughout the region. In some jurisdictions, indigenous peoples 
regard the military as violently suppressing their movements for self-determination and 
autonomy. In addition, in some States, the presence of military forces in indigenous areas 
has reportedly resulted in the forceful acquisition of indigenous lands, the increased 
settlement of non-indigenous groups in those lands, the destruction of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
homes, and in breakdowns in indigenous peoples&#8217; control over their territories. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur also received information that security plans often tend to 
target insurgent groups located in the resource-rich territories of indigenous peoples. Thus, 
in many cases, indigenous peoples regard the military presence in their territories, which is 
purported to be for anti-insurgency purposes, to be aimed instead at suppressing resistance 
to natural resources extraction projects. In this regard, the militarization of indigenous 
territories is also considered as deeply connected with the failure to recognize indigenous 
peoples&#8217; land rights and the denial of access to justice. 
</p><p>24. The particularly serious impact that militarization of indigenous peoples&#8217; territories 
has on women was raised. Participants pointed to the need to tackle the culture of silence 
which often accompanies such gender-based violence and to guarantee that an appropriate 
forum is available to address it. The relevance of Security Council resolution 1325 on 
women, peace and security was raised, as was the importance of education for the police 
and other government bodies.  
</p>
<p>25. Prosecutions and compensation for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings 
remain inadequate, according to participants in the consultation. The importance of 
ensuring indigenous participation in peace negotiations impacting them, and the potential 
role of customary practices in such negotiations, was also emphasized. Indigenous 
representatives recommended the application of customary law to military units and the 
recognition of indigenous guards by local government and law enforcement agencies. A 
representative of a national human rights institution pointed to the role these institutions 
could play in facilitating dialogue between the military, communities and other independent 
human rights organizations. Some indigenous peoples have implemented a proactive 
monitoring approach through the use of information communication technologies to rapidly 
alert relevant actors when human rights violations occur in remote areas.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Other human rights issues  
</b></p>
<p><b> a. Social and economic conditions 
</b></p>
<p>26. Indigenous peoples in Asia constitute some of the most vulnerable and socio-
economically marginalized sectors of the countries in which they live. Their 
disproportionate representation among the region&#8217;s poor is attributable to historical and 
contemporary alienation of their lands and resources, inadequate participation in decision-
making related to policy and legislation, and poorly designed or targeted government 
programmes implemented against a backdrop of structurally embedded centuries-old 
discrimination.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>27. In many parts of the region, indicators for access to education are significantly 
worse in areas with high concentrations of indigenous peoples, and illiteracy rates in those 
areas are high. The lack of education in indigenous languages, culturally inappropriate 
curricula, distance of schools from indigenous communities, and inadequate 
accommodation contribute to low levels of educational achievement and high dropout rates 
among indigenous peoples. While mother tongue education is provided in some places, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that such programmes, overall, are lacking. 
</p>
<p>28. Reports received during the consultation also allege that indicators for health are 
worse in areas where indigenous peoples are living. Food insecurity, chronic hunger and 
malnutrition are serious issues facing the region&#8217;s indigenous peoples, with obvious 
impacts on health. These conditions are attributable in large part to indigenous peoples&#8217; loss 
of lands, which has had a profoundly negative impact on their self-sustained means of 
subsistence. Traditional subsistence activities, including yak-raising, fishing, rice farming, 
and forest gathering, are also threatened by a range of infrastructure, development agro-
industrial, and conservation projects. There are also allegations of widespread health 
impacts of extractive projects. 
</p><p>29. A related issue of concern is the lack of birth registration or citizenship 
documentation afforded to indigenous individuals in some countries, for varying reasons, 
which limits many indigenous peoples&#8217; access to basic public services including for health 
and education. This situation reportedly contributes to an increased vulnerability of women 
and children to trafficking. Participants noted that some progress has been made in 
remedying this situation, although much more remains to be done. Furthermore, in some 
areas, indigenous groups are currently internally displaced as a result of armed conflict, and 
they suffer extreme social and economic hardship. 
</p>
<p>30. In some countries in the Asia region, resettlement programmes have been framed as 
developmental in nature, including programmes to cluster scattered indigenous 
communities in lowland villages in order to provide them with improved access to public 
services and infrastructure. However, indigenous organizations point to deterioration in 
indicators related to poverty, malnutrition, health and mortality in cases where communities 
have been relocated.  
</p>
<p><b> b. Recognition  
</b></p>
<p>31. As discussed earlier, a number of Asian Governments have yet to accept the 
applicability of the concept of &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; to those groups in their countries that 
share characteristics similar to those of indigenous peoples in other regions of the world. In 
this regard, the notion that the entire population of the country is indigenous has been used 
as a justification for denying recognition of particular indigenous peoples as such. In regard 
to those countries in which some form of recognition is provided, participants in the 
consultation complained that the procedures through which recognition is afforded 
constitute limitations on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination and opportunities 
for self-identification and definition. Further, procedural requirements in some countries to 
register as legal entities in order to obtain titles over lands, or to participate in government 
processes, was cited as a matter of concern in some countries.  
</p>
<p>32. According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur during the 
consultation, notions of &#8220;economic backwardness&#8221; and &#8220;primitiveness&#8221; continue to 
underpin the definition of groups in some countries. Further, discriminatory perspectives 
that indigenous peoples should be assimilated into mainstream society in order to address 
their &#8220;backwardness&#8221; are still reflected in the development polices of a number of 
countries. Another related concern among indigenous peoples in the region is in the 
perception of a significant divergence between official and actual population figures, which </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>they attribute to either a resistance towards the recognition of certain groups or a lack of 
disaggregated data. 
</p>
<p><b> c. Religious discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>33. Discrimination against indigenous peoples whose religious beliefs are distinct from 
the majority populations is also widely cited matter of concern. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that sites considered sacred by indigenous peoples under their own religions and 
belief systems have been desecrated or destroyed by large-scale development projects, and 
that reparations for environmental damage, where they have been provided, have allegedly 
failed to take the religious significance of these sites into consideration. Religious 
discrimination is also manifested in attempts to convert indigenous peoples to mainstream 
religious beliefs. Finally, religious discrimination has allegedly resulted, at least in one 
country, in the wilful burning of indigenous peoples&#8217; temples, as well as in the inciting of 
hate campaigns. 
</p>
<p><b> d. Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>34. Indigenous peoples throughout the region allegedly have been excluded from full 
participation in political life. Only a few States facilitate some such participation, through 
quotas or other means, although other countries have started to address the issue. 
Indigenous representatives suggest that, given that indigenous representation in legislative 
bodies and the exercise of legislative power to protect indigenous peoples have been 
limited, it has often been more effective for indigenous peoples to seek action by the 
executive and judicial branches of  the State. Indigenous peoples are, however, taking 
initiatives to increase their participation in the creation, promotion and implementation of 
policies and practices in relation to the realization of their rights. Nonetheless, it was also 
noted that powerful positions at national, provincial and district levels are generally not 
held by indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>35. A general observation made by indigenous peoples was that, in contexts where 
political patronage plays a major role in local and national politics, it was important for 
traditional authorities to avoid being politicized and the distinction between electoral 
representation and traditional representation should be respected. In some contexts, local 
government officials were regarded as beholden to political parties and thus rendered 
ineffective in upholding community rights, especially in the context of central government-
authorized projects.  
</p>
<p><b> e. Customary justice 
</b>36. Indigenous peoples regard the exercise of their right to self-determination as 
contingent on their freedom to maintain, develop and engage their own legal systems. 
While some progress in recognizing indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to resolve conflicts in 
accordance with customary laws has been made, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
a lack of education of government agencies education about customary justice systems 
presents an obstacle to the use of customary laws and procedures for conflict resolution.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>37.<b> In light of the information received during the Asia consultation, the Special 
Rapporteur respectfully submits a number of overarching conclusions and 
recommendations. He understand that many of the concerns raised at the consultation 
are already being addressed by the Governments concerned, and that there are a 
number of positive developments in the region that were not addressed during the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b>consultation. Nonetheless, it is clear that, despite some positive developments, much 
more needs to be done to improve the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in 
Asia. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to following up with each of the 
Governments concerned in relation to their specific country situations. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
</b></p>
<p>38.<b> The implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and core international human rights conventions is fundamental 
to the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. Broader 
ratification of International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries would be of significant 
assistance to Governments in the implementation of their human rights obligations 
regarding indigenous and tribal peoples in their countries. 
</b></p>
<p>39.<b> Asian States should commit to recognizing the rights of indigenous peoples as 
set out in international instruments, irrespective of the terminology used under 
national law and policy to identify these groups, and they should be guided by the 
manner in which these groups perceive and define themselves. This commitment 
should be accompanied by an acknowledgement of the widespread discrimination and 
marginalization that these groups face, and their vulnerable status as a result of their 
socio-economic and political circumstances. 
</b></p>
<p>40.<b> There is a continued need to develop new initiatives and reform existing ones, 
in consultation and in real partnership with indigenous peoples, to conform to 
international standards requiring genuine respect for cultural integrity and self-
determination. In this connection, States should undertake a review of their laws and 
policies in light of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>41.<b> Coordinated and systematic dialogue with indigenous peoples is necessary to 
secure their rights. This dialogue should include decision makers at the ministerial 
level and result in the sensitization of political leaders to indigenous rights. 
Institutional reform of existing government structures affecting the realization of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights is also important to accomplish in many contexts. Reforms 
should address issues around credibility, transparency and capacity of existing 
institutional arrangements. Governmental bodies that are responsible for 
programmes directly related to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights should be structured so 
that they are directly accountable to, and representative of, indigenous peoples, with 
any vestiges of paternalism or assimilation eradicated.  
</b></p>
<p>42.<b> All strategies, policies and programmes that have the pursuit of national unity 
and development as their objective must be fully consistent with respect for 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. This implies that all development policies that are 
premised on notions of indigenous peoples as primitive and backwards, and in need of 
assimilation into mainstream society, should be abandoned and replaced with policies 
that recognize these groups as self-determining peoples capable of exercising their 
right to choose their own social, cultural and economic development path.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Securing rights to land, territories and resources, with a focus on extractive industries 
</b></p>
<p>43.<b> As with other indigenous peoples throughout the world, securing rights over 
land and natural resources for indigenous peoples in the Asia region is fundamental to 
their self-determination and is a prerequisite for them to be able to survive as distinct 
peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>44.<b> Yet, ownership and control of their lands and territories continue to be denied 
to many indigenous communities throughout the Asia region. States should ensure </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b>that all laws and administrative practices related to lands and natural resources align 
with international standards concerning indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to lands, 
territories and resources. To this end, the Governments should establish mechanisms 
to comprehensively review at the national level all such laws and related institutions 
and procedures, and implement necessary reforms. 
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> Where they have not done so already, States should enact and effectively 
implement legislation recognizing indigenous peoples&#8217; customary tenure rights over 
lands and resources. This legislation should provide for demarcation of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; territories in a manner that is efficient and not burdensome on the groups 
concerned, and ensure that respect for indigenous peoples&#8217; authorities and customary 
laws and practices is a paramount consideration. These mechanisms should also 
provide for restitution and compensation for lands taken from indigenous peoples 
without their free, prior and informed consent, including lands taken as a result of 
concessions issued for extractive or other projects or the establishment of conservation 
areas such as natural parks 
</b></p>
<p>46.<b> States should ensure good-faith consultations with indigenous peoples on 
extractive activities that would affect them and engage in efforts to reach agreement 
or consent. In any event, the State remains bound to respect and protect the rights of 
indigenous peoples and must ensure that other applicable safeguards are implemented 
as well, in particular steps to minimize or offset any limitation on the rights through 
environmental and social impact assessments, measures of mitigation, compensation 
and benefit sharing. The Special Rapporteur reiterates in this regard, 
recommendations made in his final study on extractive industries and indigenous 
peoples (A/HRC/24/41). 
</b>47.<b> Indigenous peoples should be able to oppose or withhold consent to extractive 
projects free from reprisals or acts of violence, or from undue pressures to accept or 
enter into consultations about extractive projects. In no circumstances should States 
use criminal prosecutions to silence indigenous peoples&#8217; opposition to development 
projects. 
</b>48.<b> Consultation and free, prior and informed consent processes should ensure the 
effective participation of all affected indigenous groups and guarantee sufficient time 
and culturally appropriate processes for internal consensus-building. Communities 
should be protected from interference of government agencies, companies or the 
military in their internal decision-making processes. Overregulation and 
bureaucratization of consultation and free, prior and informed consent processes 
should be avoided. Instead, States should guarantee flexibility so that rights-based 
consultation processes are consistent with the customary laws and decision-making 
practices of the indigenous peoples concerned.  
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> States in the region should take steps to increase the participation of indigenous 
peoples in the management of natural parks and other conservation areas, and should 
minimize any restrictions that prohibit these peoples from carrying out traditional 
subsistence and cultural activities within these areas. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Conflict, peace and physical security 
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> With respect to the presence of military forces in indigenous territories, States 
should by guided by article 30 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, which affirms that military activities shall not take place in the 
lands or territories of indigenous peoples, unless justified by a relevant public interest 
or otherwise freely agreed with or requested by the indigenous peoples concerned. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>51.<b> Indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, including their rights to health, education and to 
practice their livelihoods, should act as a constraint on any military programmes 
targeting their territories. Elements of counter-insurgency programmes resulting in 
violation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights should be identified and abandoned.  
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> Any blanket equation of indigenous peoples, and human rights organizations 
supporting them, with insurgent groups or terrorists, and the suppression of 
opposition to development projects through force and intimidation, should be halted 
immediately. Prompt and transparent investigations should be held leading to 
prosecutions of those responsible, including military officers, where alleged abuses of 
indigenous rights are confirmed.  
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> Effective and credible safeguard mechanisms aimed at preventing the 
recurrence of human rights abuses in the context of conflicts, and facilitating the 
transition from conflict to post-conflict situations, should be developed in conjunction 
with indigenous peoples, civil society and National Human Rights Institutions. 
Indigenous participation should be guaranteed in all peace processes affecting their 
rights. Where agreements have been entered into with indigenous peoples, their 
effective implementation and oversight should be guaranteed, with United Nations 
agencies or other international actors involved in ensuring this where requested by 
indigenous peoples.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Socio-economic conditions 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The disadvantaged socio-economic situation of indigenous peoples requires 
urgent attention in States throughout the region. The collection of disaggregated data 
is a prerequisite to effectively targeting and monitoring measures to address this 
disadvantage. Affirmative measures to address indigenous peoples&#8217; particular 
conditions and needs should be developed in consultation with them.  
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> The Governments in the Asia region should seek to include in their 
development programmes and initiatives the goal of advancing indigenous peoples&#8217; 
self-determination, in particular by encouraging indigenous self-governance at the 
local level, ensuring indigenous participation in the design, delivery and monitoring of 
programmes, and developing culturally appropriate programmes that incorporate or 
build on indigenous peoples&#8217; own priorities. In this regard, financial and technical 
assistance should be provided to indigenous peoples to enable them to improve their 
own socio-economic conditions and build their institutional capacity. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> Particular attention should be directed toward the provision of adequate, 
accessible and culturally appropriate education in indigenous peoples&#8217; own languages, 
and to ensuring that indigenous peoples can access health services appropriate to their 
cultural patterns.  
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> States should ensure that all indigenous individuals have appropriate birth 
registration and citizenship documentation, and that the lack of such documentation 
does not present barriers to their access to adequate education, health and other basic 
services.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Religious discrimination, justice and political participation 
</b>58.<b> States should implement affirmative measures to prevent and punish 
discrimination against indigenous peoples whose religious beliefs are distinct from the 
majority populations. 
</b>59.<b> Significant efforts should be made to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are 
in place to guarantee access to justice for indigenous peoples. This necessitates a </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b>combination of (a) training on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and customary laws for the 
judiciary and legal profession; (b) consideration, in consultation with indigenous 
peoples, of how customary law and national law interrelate; and (c) the role that 
indigenous judicial systems should play in addressing rights violations and conflict 
resolution. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> States should facilitate the participation of indigenous peoples in States&#8217; 
governance and decision-making institutions, both at the national and local levels. 
Further, indigenous peoples must be able to freely determine their own development 
plans and priorities. Development plans specifically targeting indigenous peoples 
should therefore either be developed by indigenous peoples themselves, or in 
conjunction with them, in accordance with the principles of full and effective 
participation and free prior and informed consent.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Recommendations to regional human rights bodies and United Nations agencies  
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Intergovernmental 
Commission on Human Rights should consider the establishment of a working group 
with a mandate to address the implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and 
engage States, indigenous peoples and relevant agencies in dialogues on issues 
affecting indigenous peoples in the region.  
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system should help 
to facilitate constructive and effective dialogue between Governments and indigenous 
peoples in the Asia region, and should also provide financial and technical assistance 
to indigenous peoples for the development and implementation of initiatives aimed at 
securing the realization of their rights. United Nations agencies should jointly develop, 
in cooperation with indigenous peoples, focused and targeted programmes at the 
country level to address the particular needs of indigenous peoples, including the 
particular needs of indigenous women and youth.
