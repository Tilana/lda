Management Commentary
Halbert S. Washburn, Breitburn’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “We delivered another record
quarter with total production reaching approximately 3.4 million Boe, representing a 5% increase
from the first quarter of this year. We continued to move forward with our robust capital program,
drilling 33 gross wells and completing 14 workovers during the quarter. As a result of our liquids
focused capital program, oil and NGL production also increased to approximately 65% of total
production in the quarter.  Most importantly we are very pleased about the acquisition of QR
Energy that we announced earlier today.  This combination combines complementary, high
quality asset portfolios and like-minded operating philosophies to form the largest oil-weighted
upstream MLP.  We believe this transaction will benefit the unitholders of both companies and
create significant value from an expanded portfolio of assets and organic development
opportunities.”

Adjusted EBITDA was $110.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $117.8 million
in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to higher commodity derivative
settlement payments and lower realized natural gas prices, partially offset by higher crude oil
volumes and prices.
Net loss attributable to common unitholders was $106.6 million, or $0.89 per diluted common
unit, in the second quarter of 2014 compared to a net loss of $9.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted
common unit, in the first quarter of 2014.
Oil, NGL, and natural gas sales revenues were $219.1 million in the second quarter of 2014,
compared to $223.6 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower realized natural
gas prices partially offset by higher realized oil prices and sales volumes.
Lease operating expenses, which include district expenses, processing fees and transportation
costs, were $21.03 per Boe in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $20.81 per Boe in the
first quarter of 2014.

•
General and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash unit-based compensation, were
$3.06 per Boe in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $3.78 per Boe in the first quarter of
2014.
Losses on commodity derivative instruments were $127.0 million in the second quarter of 2014
compared to losses of $40.2 million in the first quarter of 2014, which primarily reflected an
•
•increase in crude oil and natural gas futures prices during the second quarter of 2014. Derivative
instrument settlement payments were $17.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to
payments of $13.5 million in the first quarter of 2014.
WTI oil spot prices averaged $103.35 per barrel and Brent oil spot prices averaged $109.69 per
barrel in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $98.68 per barrel and $108.14 per barrel,
respectively, in the first quarter of 2014. Henry Hub natural gas spot prices averaged $4.61 per
Mcf in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $5.18 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2014.
Realized crude oil, NGL, and natural gas prices, excluding the effects of commodity derivative
settlements, averaged $95.74 per Bbl, $38.26 per Bbl and $4.81 per Mcf, respectively, in the
second quarter of 2014, compared to $92.12 per Bbl, $42.89 per Bbl and $6.51 per Mcf,
respectively, in the first quarter of 2014.
Oil and gas capital expenditures were $89 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to
$79 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Distributable cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $52.7 million in the second quarter
of 2014 compared to $60.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. Distributable cash flow per
common unit was approximately $0.431 in the second quarter of 2014 compared to
approximately $0.496 in the first quarter of 2014.

Management Provides Second Half 2014 Production, Adjusted EBITDA and Capital
Expenditures Guidance
Excluding the effect of any acquisitions, Breitburn is forecasting total production for the second
half of 2014 to be between 6.8 million and 7.2 million Boe, with oil production now expected to be
between 3.8 million and 4.2 million barrels, and still expects to achieve its targeted December
2014 production exit rate of between 38,400 and 40,800 Boe/d.  This revised production outlook
is principally due to the recent performance of Breitburn’s operations in the Permian Basin. 
Breitburn also expects second half Adjusted EBITDA to be between $235 million and $255
million, principally as a result of lower expected oil revenues. Total oil and gas capital
expenditures for the second half of 2014 are expected to be between $170 million and $180
million.
Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Adjusted EBITDA range above assumes estimated net
income (before non-cash compensation) between $80 million and $102 million, less mark-to-
market gains on commodity derivative instruments of $40 million, plus DD&A of $137 million,
plus interest expense between $56 million (high end of Adjusted EBITDA) and $58 million (low
end of Adjusted EBITDA). Estimated 2014 net income is based on oil prices of $105 per barrel
for WTI oil, $110 per barrel Brent oil, and $4.00 per Mcfe for natural gas. Consequently,
differences between actual and forecast prices could result in changes to gains or losses on
mark to market of commodity derivative instruments, DD&A, including potential impairments of
long-lived assets, and ultimately, net income.
The foregoing guidance is subject to all of the cautionary statements and limitations described
below and under the caption “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.” In
addition, estimates for Breitburn’s future production volumes are based on, among other things,
assumptions of capital expenditure levels and the assumption that market demand and prices for
oil and gas will continue at levels that allow for economic production of these products. The
production, transportation and marketing of oil and gas are extremely complex and are subject to
disruption due to transportation and processing availability, mechanical failure, human error,
weather, and numerous other factors, including the inability to obtain expected supply of CO2.
Breitburn’s estimates are based on certain other assumptions, such as well performance, which
may actually prove to vary significantly from those assumed. Lease operating costs, including
major maintenance costs, vary in response to changes in prices of services and materials used in
the operation of our properties and the amount of maintenance activity required. Lease operating
costs, including taxes, utilities and service company costs, move directionally with increases and
decreases in commodity prices, and we cannot fully predict such future commodity or operating
costs. Similarly, interest rates and price differentials are set by the market and are not within our
control, and they can vary dramatically from time to time. Capital expenditures are based on our
current expectations as to the level of capital expenditures that will be justified based upon the
other assumptions set forth below as well as expectations about other operating and economic
factors not set forth below. The foregoing guidance does not constitute any form of guarantee,
assurance or promise that the matters indicated will actually be achieved. Rather, the foregoing
guidance simply sets forth our best estimate today for these matters based upon our current
expectations about the future based upon both stated and unstated assumptions. Actual
conditions and those assumptions may, and probably will, change over the course of the year.
Impact of Derivative Instruments
Breitburn uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate risks associated with commodity
price volatility and to help maintain cash flows for operating activities, acquisitions, capital
expenditures and distributions. Breitburn does not enter into derivative instruments for
speculative trading purposes. Because Breitburn does not use hedge accounting to account for
its derivative instruments, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in
Breitburn’s earnings during each reporting period. These non-cash changes in the fair value of
derivatives do not affect Adjusted EBITDA, cash flow from operations, distributable cash flow or
Breitburn’s ability to pay cash distributions for the reporting periods presented.
Total losses from commodity derivative instruments were approximately $127.0 million for the
second quarter of 2014, which included payments of $17.0 million for derivative instruments that
settled during the period.

Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one Bbl of oil equivalent. This ratio
reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given
commodity price disparities, the price for a Bbl of oil equivalent for natural gas is significantly
less than the price for a Bbl of oil.
Oil sales were 1,817 MBbl, 1,813 MBbl and 1,238 MBbl for the three months ended June 30,

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release, the financial tables and other supplemental information, including the
reconciliations of certain non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) measures
to their nearest comparable generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures, may
be used periodically by management when discussing Breitburn’s financial results with investors
and analysts, and they are also available on Breitburn’s website under the Investor Relations tab.
Among the non-GAAP financial measures used are “Adjusted EBITDA” and “distributable cash
flow.” These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP
measures, such as net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other
GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP
financial measures enhance comparability to prior periods.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information
relative to the performance of Breitburn’s assets, without regard to financing methods or capital
structure. Distributable cash flow is used by management as a tool to measure the cash
distributions we could pay to our unitholders.  This financial measure indicates to investors
whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can support our distribution rate to our
unitholders. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures of other publicly traded partnerships or limited liability companies because all
companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow in the same manner.
