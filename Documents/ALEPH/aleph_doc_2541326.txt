Item
1.             Reporting Requirements Pursuant to the Senior Indenture
Item 1.
2
Pursuant to the terms of PDVSA Finance Ltd.’s (the “Company”) Senior Indenture, as supplemented, the Company
has provided to the Trustee on June 30, 2005 its annual audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (formerly
International Accounting Standards or IAS) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board.
As part of the continuing review of the Company’s financial statements by management and the Company’s
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, it has been identified that approximately US$71,563,000 was paid by
PDVSA Petróleo in respect of expenses and premiums in connection with the Company’s cash tender offer that
should have been recorded in the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 as an
expense of the Company with a corresponding contribution from PDVSA to the Company.  Accordingly, the Company
has been advised that the audit opinion with respect to the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004 will be retracted and that such financial statements should be restated to reflect such expense
and corresponding contribution.
It is unclear whether such restatement of the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004,
previously provided to the Trustee on a timely basis, would constitute an Event of Default under the terms of the
Senior Indenture, as supplemented, which occurred subsequent to December 31, 2003.  Nonetheless, any Event of
Default that may result from such restatement would be cured upon the delivery of the restated financial statements
to the Trustee.  The Company is currently in the process of completing the restatement of its financial statements for
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.  The Company intends
to deliver such restated financial statements to the Trustee promptly after its completion and, in any event, within 60
days.
In addition to the annual financial statements of the Company, the Senior Indenture as supplemented,
requires the Company to deliver unaudited quarterly financial statements of the Company to the Trustee
within 90 days of the first three quarters of each year.  As of the date of this report the Company is in the
process of finalizing the unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 and accordingly
has not delivered such to the Trustee within the 90 day requirement.  The Company intends to deliver the
unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 to the Trustee promptly after its
completion with any Event of Default arising from such late submission being cured upon such presentation
to the Trustee.
