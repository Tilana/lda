<p><b>  Report of the commission of inquiry on 
human rights in Eritrea* ** ***</b> 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The commission of inquiry undertook its investigation in accordance with Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 26/24.  
</p>
<p>Although the commission was unable to visit Eritrea, it obtained first-hand 
</p>
<p>testimony by conducting 550 confidential interviews with witnesses residing in third 
</p>
<p>countries. It also received 160 written submissions. 
</p>
<p>On the basis of this body of evidence, the commission found that systematic, 
</p>
<p>widespread and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed in Eritrea 
</p>
<p>under the authority of the Government. Some of these violations may constitute crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity.  
</p>
<p>In the present report, the commission shows how the initial promises of democracy 
</p>
<p>and rule of law, incarnated in the never-implemented Constitution of 1997, were 
</p>
<p>progressively suppressed and then extinguished by the Government. It details how the 
</p>
<p>Government has created and sustained repressive systems to control, silence and isolate 
</p>
<p>individuals in the country, depriving them of their fundamental freedoms. Information 
</p>
<p>collected on people&#8217;s activities, their supposed intentions and even conjectured thoughts are 
</p>
<p>used to rule through fear in a country where individuals are routinely arbitrarily arrested 
</p>
<p>and detained, tortured, disappeared or extrajudicially executed. The commission also 
</p>
<p>describes how, on the pretext of defending the integrity of the State and ensuring its self-
</p>
<p>sufficiency, Eritreans are subject to systems of national service and forced labour that 
</p>
<p>effectively abuse, exploit and enslave them for indefinite periods of time.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 26/24, the Human Rights Council established the commission of 
</p>
<p>inquiry on human rights in Eritrea for a period of one year with the mandate to investigate 
</p>
<p>all alleged violations of human rights in Eritrea, as outlined by the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in Eritrea in her reports (A/HRC/23/53 and A/HRC/26/45).  
</p>
<p>2. On 26 September 2014, the President of the Human Rights Council appointed  Mike 
</p>
<p>Smith as chairperson of the commission, and Victor Dankwa and the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in Eritrea,  Sheila B. Keetharuth, as its members.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report is submitted pursuant to  Council resolution 26/24, in which the 
</p>
<p>Council requested the commission to present a written report to the Council at its twenty-
</p>
<p>ninth session. In accordance with the decision of the Council, all reports of the commission, 
</p>
<p>including document A/HRC/29/CRP.1, will be transmitted to all relevant bodies of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and to the Secretary-General for appropriate action.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>4. In compliance with resolution 26/24, the commission of inquiry investigated the 
</p>
<p>human rights violations described by the Special Rapporteur in her reports, including 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and <i>incommunicado</i> detention, arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrest and detention, torture, violations committed during compulsory national service, 
</p>
<p>including those affecting children&#8217;s rights, and restrictions to the freedoms of expression 
</p>
<p>and opinion, assembly, association, religious belief and movement. 
</p>
<p>5. The commission paid specific attention to gender-based violations, particularly 
</p>
<p>violence against women, and the impact of violations on particular groups, including 
</p>
<p>women and children.  
</p>
<p>6. Human Rights Council resolution 26/24 does not limit the temporal scope of the 
</p>
<p>inquiry. As part of the definition of its methods of work, the commission decided to focus 
</p>
<p>the temporal scope of the investigation from the independence of Eritrea until present day. 
</p>
<p>7. With regard to its geographic scope, the commission conducted its investigation on 
</p>
<p>violations allegedly committed on the territory of Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>8. While other commissions of inquiry established by the Human Rights Council were 
</p>
<p>specifically requested to investigate human rights violations and related crimes in a specific 
</p>
<p>country or territory, the present commission was mandated only to investigate violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights; it therefore interpreted its mandate as not including the investigation of 
</p>
<p>international crimes. Nevertheless, the commission was not of the view that this prevented 
</p>
<p>it, on the basis of the body of information collected by the end of its investigation, from 
</p>
<p>reaching a conclusion on the possibility that such crimes may have been committed and 
</p>
<p>from recommending further investigations.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Non-cooperation by Eritrea 
</b></p>
<p>9. In Human Rights Council resolution 26/25, the Council called upon the Government 
of Eritrea to cooperate fully with the commission, to permit unrestricted access to visit and 
</p>
<p>to provide the information necessary for the fulfilment of the mandate.  
</p>
<p>10. The Government did not respond to the commission&#8217;s repeated calls for access and 
</p>
<p>for information related to the human rights situation. During the commission&#8217;s oral update 
</p>
<p>to the Council at its twenty-eighth session, the Government stated that &#8220;country-specific </p>


<p>resolutions and mandates are in breach of the United Nations principles of impartiality, 
</p>
<p>objectivity and non-selectivity&#8221; and rejected the oral report.   
</p>
<p>11. The commission shared its detailed findings with the Government of Eritrea (see 
</p>
<p>annex I).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>12. Without access to Eritrea, the commission obtained first-hand testimony by 
</p>
<p>conducting confidential interviews with witnesses residing in third countries.  
</p>
<p>13. Within the limits of time, budget and programme of work, the commission selected 
</p>
<p>countries to visit on the basis of acceptance received, size of the Eritrean population hosted, 
</p>
<p>and their average dates of departure from Eritrea (the latter to ensure that the entire period 
</p>
<p>under investigation was covered). The commission conducted visits to Djibouti, Ethiopia, 
</p>
<p>Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland and the United States of America.  
</p>
<p>14. The commission and its secretariat conducted confidential interviews with more than 
</p>
<p>550 witnesses, 100 of whom were women. In accordance with best practices, it paid special 
</p>
<p>attention to gender issues and the gendered impact of violations. Nevertheless, it faced 
</p>
<p>significant difficulties in the investigation and documentation of human rights violations 
</p>
<p>suffered by women. The commission therefore takes the view that its inquiry may have 
</p>
<p>only partially captured the extent of sexual violence and violence against women. 
</p>
<p>15. In November 2014, the commission made a call for written submissions to relevant 
</p>
<p>individuals, groups and organizations. By the deadline, 160 submissions had been received. 
</p>
<p>16. The commission engaged with a number of United Nations entities and other 
</p>
<p>humanitarian actors. It regrets that a number of these entities and actors felt they were not 
</p>
<p>in a position to provide relevant information. The commission expresses its gratitude to the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for its 
</p>
<p>support. The commission also benefited from the invaluable support of a number of non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>17. Aside from its inability to enter Eritrea, the most significant investigative challenge 
</p>
<p>the commission faced was fear of reprisal among witnesses. Many potential witnesses 
</p>
<p>residing outside Eritrea were afraid to testify, even on a confidential basis, because they 
</p>
<p>assumed they were still being clandestinely monitored by the authorities and therefore 
</p>
<p>feared for their safety and for family members back in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>18. As a consequence, the commission paid particular attention to the protection of 
</p>
<p>witnesses. It recalls that primary responsibility for protecting all persons cooperating with 
</p>
<p>the commission rests with their States of residence and nationality. The commission 
</p>
<p>therefore urges Member States to provide additional protection measures where necessary.  
</p>
<p>19. Another challenge faced by the commission in the completion of its work was the 
</p>
<p>absence of reliable data, including statistical information, in such areas as demographics, 
</p>
<p>development, the economy and the legal system. Whenever evidence-based conclusions 
</p>
<p>could not be drawn from available data, the commission indicated it.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal framework and standard of proof for reported violations 
</b></p>
<p>20. The commission assessed the human rights situation on the basis of the international 
</p>
<p>legal obligations voluntarily subscribed to by Eritrea. Eritrea is a State party to the 
</p>
<p>following universal and regional human rights treaties (year of ratification is given in 
</p>
<p>parentheses):  </p>


<p>&#61607; Convention on the Rights of the Child (1994) and the Optional Protocols 
thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of 
</p>
<p>children, child prostitution and child pornography (2005)  
</p>
<p>&#61607; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(1995)  
</p>
<p>&#61607; African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (1999)  
</p>
<p>&#61607; African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (2000)  
</p>
<p>&#61607; International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (2001)  
</p>
<p>&#61607; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2001)  
</p>
<p>&#61607; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (2002)  
</p>
<p>&#61607; Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment (2014) 
</p>
<p>21. The commission based its findings on a &#8220;reasonable grounds to believe&#8221; standard of 
</p>
<p>proof. This standard is met when in assessing all the information gathered &#8211; including open 
</p>
<p>sources &#8211; it can be concluded that it is reasonable to believe that the incident or event 
</p>
<p>occurred as reported.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Archiving and record-keeping of testimony 
</b></p>
<p>22. In accordance with established United Nations procedures, all information collected 
</p>
<p>by the commission is stored in the official United Nations archive system and all interviews 
</p>
<p>are classified as strictly confidential. Information will not be shared with any State, entity 
</p>
<p>or individual without the explicit and informed consent of each witness concerned. This 
</p>
<p>includes sharing with other sections of OHCHR, United Nations human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>any international judicial mechanisms, any judicial mechanisms of other States, and any 
</p>
<p>government authorities, in particular the Government of Eritrea. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Principal findings of the commission 
</b></p>
<p>23. The commission finds that systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations 
</p>
<p>have been and are being committed in Eritrea under the authority of the Government. 
</p>
<p>Patterns of systematic human rights violations have been identified, taking into account 
</p>
<p>several factors. They include the high frequency of occurrence of the human rights 
</p>
<p>violations documented and corroborated during the investigation, the number of victims 
</p>
<p>and the replication of the violation during a certain period of time; the type of rights 
</p>
<p>violated; and the systemic nature of these violations, meaning that they cannot be the result 
</p>
<p>of random or isolated acts of the authorities. The main perpetrators of these violations are 
</p>
<p>the Eritrean Defence Forces, in particular the Eritrean Army; the National Security Office; 
</p>
<p>the Eritrean Police Forces; the Ministry of Information; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Defence; the People&#8217;s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ); the Office of the 
</p>
<p>President; and the President. 
</p>
<p>24. The struggle for the independence of Eritrea is recorded in history as a major feat of 
</p>
<p>a people&#8217;s fight for self-determination. The commission finds that the current situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in Eritrea is the tragic product of an initial desire to protect and ensure the 
</p>
<p>survival of the young State that very quickly degenerated into the use of totalitarian 
</p>
<p>practices aimed at perpetuating the power of the Eritrean People&#8217;s Liberation Front and its 
</p>
<p>successor, the People&#8217;s Front for Democracy and Justice.  </p>


<p>25. In the present report, the commission shows how the initial promises of democracy 
</p>
<p>and rule of law, incarnated in the never-implemented Constitution of 1997, were 
</p>
<p>progressively suppressed then extinguished by the Government on the pretext of threats to 
</p>
<p>its existence. It details how the Government has created and sustained repressive systems to 
</p>
<p>control, silence and isolate individuals in the country, depriving them of their fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms. It shows how information collected on people&#8217;s activities, their supposed 
</p>
<p>intentions and even conjectured thoughts is used to rule through fear in a country where 
</p>
<p>individuals are routinely arbitrarily arrested and detained, tortured, disappeared or extra-
</p>
<p>judicially executed. The commission also describes how, under the pretext of defending the 
</p>
<p>integrity of the State and ensuring its self-sufficiency, Eritreans are subject to systems of 
</p>
<p>national service and forced labour that effectively abuse, exploit and enslave them for 
</p>
<p>indefinite periods of time. 
</p>
<p>26. Faced with a seemingly hopeless situation they feel powerless to change, hundreds 
</p>
<p>of thousands of Eritreans are fleeing their country. In desperation, they resort to deadly 
</p>
<p>escape routes through deserts and neighbouring war-torn countries and across dangerous 
</p>
<p>seas in search of safety. They risk capture, torture and death at the hands of ruthless human 
</p>
<p>traffickers. To ascribe their decision to leave solely to economic reasons is to ignore the 
</p>
<p>dire situation of human rights in Eritrea and the very real suffering of its people. Eritreans 
</p>
<p>are fleeing severe human rights violations in their country and are in need of international 
</p>
<p>protection.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Controlled, silenced and isolated 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Surveillance of the population in violation of the right to privacy  
</b></p>
<p>27. Through its extensive spying and surveillance system targeting individuals within 
the country and in the diaspora, the Government engages in the systematic violation of the 
</p>
<p>right to privacy. It employs all means, including harassment, intimidation and the abusive 
</p>
<p>use of a coupon system originally created to allow access to subsidized goods in 
</p>
<p>government shops, to collect information about Eritreans. Pervasive spying and 
</p>
<p>surveillance in Eritrea go beyond the needs of national security or crime prevention and are 
</p>
<p>arbitrary.  
</p>
<p>28. As a result of this mass surveillance, Eritreans live in constant fear that their conduct 
</p>
<p>is or may be monitored by security agents, and that information gathered may be used 
</p>
<p>against them leading to arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, disappearance or death. They 
</p>
<p>therefore engage in self-censorship with regard to most aspects of their lives. They do so 
</p>
<p>because it is impossible for an individual to know what activities may be considered 
</p>
<p>&#8220;deviant&#8221; and sanctionable at a specific moment in time and what the consequences for 
</p>
<p>such activities might then be. The existence of such a pervasive control system generates a 
</p>
<p>general climate of fear and mistrust in communities and even within families. In the words 
</p>
<p>of one witness, &#8220;When I am in Eritrea, I feel that I cannot even think because I am afraid 
</p>
<p>that people can read my thoughts and I am scared.&#8221; The end result is a severe curtailment of 
</p>
<p>the exercise of all other rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Government strives to control strictly any human movement both internally and 
</p>
<p>for those who wish to leave the country, in particular to ensure that individuals fulfil their 
</p>
<p>national service obligations. To do so, it has established an intricate system of travel 
</p>
<p>permits and identity cards, which must be produced during identity checks to verify an 
</p>
<p>individual&#8217;s status with regard to compulsory national service and that person&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>authorization to travel. The Government controls who may leave Eritrea legally through the </p>


<p>arbitrary issuance of an exit visa. To prevent those who wish to avoid national service from 
</p>
<p>leaving the country unlawfully, the Government also restricts movements towards border 
</p>
<p>areas and severely punishes anyone found trying to cross the frontier. With a few 
</p>
<p>exceptions, those who have been forced to return to the country have been arrested, 
</p>
<p>detained and subjected to ill-treatment and torture. Eritreans voluntarily returning to their 
</p>
<p>country may face arbitrary arrest, in particular if they are perceived as having associated 
</p>
<p>with opposition movements abroad. Eritreans abroad can obtain a passport only upon 
</p>
<p>payment of a mandatory &#8220;rehabilitation tax&#8221; amounting to 2 per cent of their earnings, a 
</p>
<p>disproportionate price for a travel document. Those who left unlawfully also have to sign a 
</p>
<p>regret form.  
</p>
<p>30. The restrictions on movement are not proportionate and strictly necessary in the 
</p>
<p>interests of national defence. They constitute a violation of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement, including the right to leave and freely return to one&#8217;s country. All persons 
</p>
<p>suspected of intending to cross the border unlawfully are treated in a manner that often 
</p>
<p>amounts to torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading punishment, outside of any judicial 
</p>
<p>proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>31. In its determination to safeguard its own continued existence, the Government has 
</p>
<p>proceeded to establish a system by which individuals in society are silenced and isolated 
</p>
<p>through the organized repression of the freedoms of opinion, expression, assembly, 
</p>
<p>association and religion. The commission recalls that merely invoking general grounds such 
</p>
<p>as national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals 
</p>
<p>or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others cannot be regarded as legitimate to 
</p>
<p>justify the restriction of public freedoms.  
</p>
<p>32. In the area of freedom of expression, the Government systematically silences anyone 
</p>
<p>who is perceived as protesting against, questioning or expressing criticism of the 
</p>
<p>Government and its policies, even when such statements are genuine and legitimate in the 
</p>
<p>context of a democratic public debate. The most visible sign of such repression was the 
</p>
<p>purge in 2001 of the G-15 reform group and of its supposed supporters, who were in their 
</p>
<p>majority either killed or disappeared. Following that crackdown, the silencing of the 
</p>
<p>population went a step further as Eritreans started being punished for just about any 
</p>
<p>expression of opinion: claiming the enjoyment of fundamental rights and legitimate 
</p>
<p>benefits; enquiring about the fate of persons perceived as critics by the Government; 
</p>
<p>discussing governmental policies; or asking any type of question. The Government 
</p>
<p>consistently labels perceived critics as traitors. Those found guilty of such a &#8220;crime&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>severely punished.  
</p>
<p>33. Freedom of the press is another casualty of the Government&#8217;s effort to control 
</p>
<p>society. In 2001, the Government suppressed the emerging free press by closing down 
</p>
<p>independent newspapers and silencing journalists through detention and torture, several of 
</p>
<p>whom disappeared. Since then, only pro-Government information is easily accessible in the 
</p>
<p>country. The Government, principally through its Ministry of Information, holds tight 
</p>
<p>control over the content of information, the journalists who produce it, the matters they may 
</p>
<p>cover and what they may say about them. It severely punishes any perceived divergence 
</p>
<p>from the official line. The restrictions imposed on the press, the exercise of journalism as a 
</p>
<p>profession and the access to information and means of communication are neither 
</p>
<p>proportionate nor necessary for the interests of national security, public order or even 
</p>
<p>national unity, and constitute a violation of the right to seek, receive and impart information 
</p>
<p>that is included in the right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>34. The freedom of assembly and association is also targeted. The few attempts to 
</p>
<p>exercise the right to peacefully demonstrate have been crushed by the Government, which </p>


<p>arrested, detained and sometimes executed demonstrators extrajudicially. Moreover, since 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of political parties and independent trade unions, short of joining the ruling 
</p>
<p>party, individuals have no avenue for participating in the conduct of public affairs, nor any 
</p>
<p>means to protect or improve their working conditions. The restrictions imposed by law on 
</p>
<p>the establishment of and the activities that may be undertaken by national or international 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations are so limiting that it is impossible for them to operate in 
</p>
<p>the country, leaving only government-organized associations able to operate. The 
</p>
<p>commission&#8217;s findings on the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly and association 
</p>
<p>point to a lack of mechanisms for channelling grievances, the absence of representation of 
</p>
<p>interest groups in the administration of the country, lack of consultation on decisions 
</p>
<p>affecting the population, absence of opportunities for open and genuine dialogue, and the 
</p>
<p>punishment of peaceful assembly and expression of demands.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Freedom of religion and belief 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Government perceives religion as a threat to its existence and has set about 
</p>
<p>controlling it and its expressions. Only four religious denominations are authorized in 
</p>
<p>Eritrea: Eritrean Orthodox, Catholicism, the Lutheran church and Sunni Islam. In spite of 
</p>
<p>the legal processes established in 2002 to apply for recognition, to date no other 
</p>
<p>denominations have been formally allowed to exist. All religious communities and their 
</p>
<p>members are nevertheless to varying degrees targeted by restrictions and attacks by the 
</p>
<p>Government. Interference in religious structures and affairs is rampant. The religious 
</p>
<p>gatherings of non-authorized denominations are prohibited. Religious materials are 
</p>
<p>confiscated. Adherents are arbitrarily arrested, ill-treated or subjected to torture during their 
</p>
<p>detention, and prisoners are coerced to recant their faith. Many religious followers have 
</p>
<p>been killed or have disappeared. 
</p>
<p>36. In the implementation of discriminatory treatment on the basis of belief, Jehovah&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Witnesses have been arbitrarily deprived of their citizenship. Apart from making it 
</p>
<p>impossible for them to participate in public affairs, the loss of citizenship entails 
</p>
<p>curtailment of the enjoyment of other fundamental rights, including the right to work when 
</p>
<p>their business licences are arbitrarily revoked, and the right to be recognized as a person 
</p>
<p>before the law when their national identity documents are confiscated.  
</p>
<p>37. The limitations imposed on the activities of churches and religious institutions by 
</p>
<p>law and through unwritten policies and indirectly restricting the right to manifest one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>religion or belief are not compatible with international human rights law. The restrictions 
</p>
<p>have affected the right of adherents to practice and manifest their religion, to conduct 
</p>
<p>legitimate religious activities such as preaching, and the functioning of religious institutions 
</p>
<p>in a manner that is not proportionate and necessary for the protection of public safety or 
</p>
<p>order. Moreover, the commission considers that the rights of adherents to liberty and fair 
</p>
<p>trial and not to be tortured or subjected to degrading treatment or punishment are regularly 
</p>
<p>violated. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Rule by fear 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>38. The non-implementation of the Constitution of 1997, including the provisions 
</p>
<p>relating to individual rights, has had a profound impact on the rule of law in Eritrea. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>with no parliament meeting and the court system controlled by the executive, it could even 
</p>
<p>be affirmed that there is no rule of law in Eritrea. Information gathered through the 
</p>
<p>pervasive control system is used in absolute arbitrariness to keep the population in a state of 
</p>
<p>permanent anxiety. It is not law that rules Eritreans, but fear. </p>


<p>39. Violations of the right to fair trial and due process of law are particularly blatant. 
</p>
<p>Criminal proceedings disregard the most basic, universally recognized principles in the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice. It seems that investigators, security officers and military leaders 
</p>
<p>also act as de facto magistrates; however, given that their decisions are not public ,there is 
</p>
<p>scarce information about them. Therefore, the extent of the violations committed can only 
</p>
<p>be partially assessed. Most decisions are rendered on the sole basis of investigation reports 
</p>
<p>that often include statements obtained under torture. Judgements are rarely made public or 
</p>
<p>even communicated to accused persons, who are not always aware they have been tried and 
</p>
<p>have no knowledge of how long they will be imprisoned. This makes it impossible for 
</p>
<p>persons sentenced to have their sentences reviewed by a higher court. 
</p>
<p>40. The commission concludes that the judicial system, both civil and military, is not 
</p>
<p>independent and the Government frequently interferes in the administration of justice. The 
</p>
<p>judiciary is not in a position to protect the fundamental rights of Eritrean citizens, in 
</p>
<p>particular when they are violated by public officials. Some judges are conscripts whose 
</p>
<p>&#8220;careers&#8221; depend on the Ministry of Defence at a salary of less than $2 a day, a clear 
</p>
<p>violation of the principle of judicial independence and of their security of tenure. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>the lack of independence of the judiciary and prosecution contributes to the widespread 
</p>
<p>impunity enjoyed by public officials in Eritrea, including in cases of gross abuse of human 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Arbitrary arrest 
</b></p>
<p>41. The use of information collected by the Government through spying networks leads 
</p>
<p>in the first place to arbitrary arrest and detention. The great majority of those who provided 
</p>
<p>their testimony had been arrested, many a number of times. Arrests are often unjust, 
</p>
<p>unpredictable, unreasonable and disproportionate. In most cases, people are arrested and 
</p>
<p>detained for reasons that are arbitrary to such an extent that no one can possibly identify the 
</p>
<p>law that might have been broken. Since formal charges are not laid, individuals are left to 
</p>
<p>guess the reason for their arrest and detention, based on the line of interrogation or their 
</p>
<p>conduct before arrest. The main reasons for arrest that the commission was able to 
</p>
<p>reconstruct related to asking questions; suspected collaboration with the enemy, including 
</p>
<p>working for foreign entities in Eritrea; presumed or actual attempt to flee the country or 
</p>
<p>desert national service; and for the conduct of a family member. Specific categories of 
</p>
<p>people have also been targeted, particularly political opponents, journalists and members of 
</p>
<p>religious groups.  
</p>
<p>42. Arrests and detention are ordered and conducted by any person with de facto 
</p>
<p>authority, including local administrators, in breach of requirements that officials authorized 
</p>
<p>to make arrests should be clearly identified. Most people are arrested by armed military or 
</p>
<p>national security officers, in either uniform or civilian clothes. The arresting officers 
</p>
<p>sometimes present their identity cards but rarely inform persons under arrest of the place 
</p>
<p>where they will take them. In most cases, individuals arrested at home or on the streets are 
</p>
<p>deceived by arresting officers, who tell them that they are only needed at the police station 
</p>
<p>for a short time and will then be able to return home. People often ultimately find 
</p>
<p>themselves in an unofficial place of detention. The principle of habeas corpus is rarely 
</p>
<p>respected. As a result, the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty is not reviewed and 
</p>
<p>detainees are released at the whim of the arresting or detaining officer. Detention in Eritrea 
</p>
<p>cannot possibly be referred to as pretrial, given that individuals are rarely tried. The 
</p>
<p>Government systematically uses arbitrary arrests and detention in violation of the right to 
</p>
<p>liberty of the person. </p>


<p><b> 3. Enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>43. Since 1991, scores of people have been subjected to enforced disappearance, for 
</p>
<p>known and unknown reasons. Information is hardly ever officially provided on the 
</p>
<p>whereabouts of and charges against those detained. Detainees are usually not brought 
</p>
<p>before a court, and are thus placed outside the protection of the law. When relatives enquire 
</p>
<p>after detainees, they are informed by prison authorities that they have no information on the 
</p>
<p>person arrested and warn them to cease their enquires or risk facing a similar fate. In certain 
</p>
<p>cases, relatives may subsequently receive unofficial information from inmates who have 
</p>
<p>been released or from bribed guards; in most cases, however, they are still prevented from 
</p>
<p>visiting their detained relatives. The commission finds that most of the countless people 
</p>
<p>arrested in Eritrea are indeed victims of enforced disappearance, which is a widespread and 
</p>
<p>systematically employed practice. 
</p>
<p>44. While the exact number of people subjected to enforced disappearance remains 
</p>
<p>unknown, the commission finds that specific targets of the Government include political 
</p>
<p>dissidents, in particular former freedom fighters belonging to the Eritrean Liberation Front, 
</p>
<p>journalists, religious leaders and adherents (in particular Muslim scholars and 
</p>
<p>businessmen), and leaders and members of the Afar ethnic group. The commission 
</p>
<p>considers that all those who have been victims of enforced disappearance suffered a 
</p>
<p>violation of their right to life, their right not to be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment, their right to be treated with humanity and with respect for dignity in 
</p>
<p>the context of detention, their right to be recognized as a person before the law, and their 
</p>
<p>right to liberty. In addition, in the light of the anxiety and suffering that enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances cause families for extended periods, the commission finds that the right of 
</p>
<p>family members not to be subject to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is also 
</p>
<p>violated. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Arbitrary deprivation of life 
</b></p>
<p>45. Since independence, extrajudicial executions and arbitrary killings have been widely 
</p>
<p>perpetrated. Before 1998, punishment in the form of summary executions or extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>killings was meted out against war veterans with disabilities and political opponents, and 
</p>
<p>particularly targeted Muslims scholars. Eritrean soldiers accused of cowardice or desertion 
</p>
<p>during the 1998-2000 war with Ethiopia were systematically executed. This also includes 
</p>
<p>Eritreans and Ethiopians suspected of being &#8220;collaborators of the enemy&#8221; after the war, in 
</p>
<p>particular Kunamas accused of having supported the Government of Ethiopia. Thereafter, 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial executions have been carried out by the Eritrean authorities, publicly or 
</p>
<p>secretly, to punish perceived critics, as well as suspected smugglers and ordinary citizens 
</p>
<p>for arbitrary reasons. Mass killings have also been perpetrated against ethnic groups.  
</p>
<p>46. Eritreans who attempt to leave the country are seen as traitors. For a considerable 
</p>
<p>period of time, the Government has implemented a shoot-to-kill policy in border areas to 
</p>
<p>prevent people from fleeing. The policy has largely been implemented by the military, 
</p>
<p>particularly the border surveillance division. Numerous testimonies indicated that the 
</p>
<p>policy, which was publicly announced in 2004, might have been revised in later years. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since people were still being shot at while trying to cross the border as late as 
</p>
<p>2014, the commission is not in a position to conclude that the policy has been officially 
</p>
<p>abolished. The commission recalls that the right to leave one&#8217;s country is a fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedom recognized under international human rights law. The use of lethal force to prevent 
</p>
<p>individuals from leaving Eritrea, even if illegally, is a violation of the right to life.  
</p>
<p>47. Some of the killings and executions reported might have resulted from personal 
</p>
<p>initiatives or excessive use of force by officials. By not investigating, prosecuting and 
</p>
<p>punishing the authors of such killings, the Government breaches its due diligence 
</p>
<p>obligation; as a result, these killings are imputable to it. The commission is concerned that </p>


<p>the general climate of impunity thus created is conducive to the continued practice of 
</p>
<p>arbitrary and extrajudicial killings in Eritrea. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Detention 
</b></p>
<p>48. The detention of persons, which begins arbitrarily at the time of arrest and continues 
</p>
<p>unlawfully for long periods of time, is not subject to judicial review. The detention network 
</p>
<p>in Eritrea is vast (see annex II),  with many secret and unofficial facilities. Detainees are 
</p>
<p>kept in a variety of facilities, including makeshift and open air camps, converted old 
</p>
<p>buildings, metal containers (some of which buried underground), and in caves and holes. 
</p>
<p>The practice of incommunicado detention is widespread. Persons detained on religious or 
</p>
<p>political grounds are systematically kept incommunicado for periods that can last several 
</p>
<p>years.  
</p>
<p>49. Conditions of detention are extremely harsh. When not held in solitary confinement 
</p>
<p>or being used for labour (both common practices), inmates are locked night and day in 
</p>
<p>extremely overcrowded cells characterized by unspeakable hygienic conditions. Proper 
</p>
<p>toilets are not available in cells, and detainees are sometimes forced to sleep in human 
</p>
<p>waste overflowing from the insufficient containers provided for this purpose. Access to 
</p>
<p>fresh air and natural light is limited to bare minimum, often on purpose. Food rations are 
</p>
<p>minimal and of poor nutritional quality, leading to hunger and starvation. Drinking water is 
</p>
<p>frequently unclean and limited in quantity, despite the high temperatures experienced in 
</p>
<p>many detention locations. In addition, the absence of health facilities and the lack or 
</p>
<p>deliberate denial of medical care and medicines, coupled with the arbitrary imposition of 
</p>
<p>punishment, exposes detainees to illnesses, epidemics and death. The harsh conditions of 
</p>
<p>detention push some detainees to suicide.  
</p>
<p>50. The harshest conditions and the strictest regimes of detention are deliberately 
</p>
<p>employed in a number of situations, including to punish those suspected of being a threat to 
</p>
<p>national security, traitors or suspects of &#8220;cross-border crimes,&#8221; or during the investigative 
</p>
<p>phase of detention, with the intent to obtain self-incrimination, to extract a confession or 
</p>
<p>information or to force religious believers to recant their faith. Conditions of detention are 
</p>
<p>often particularly inhumane at the beginning of the period of detention and improve slightly 
</p>
<p>but incrementally up until release. 
</p>
<p>51. An unknown number of foreign combatants are detained in Eritrea, including at least 
</p>
<p>five Djiboutian soldiers, on whom no information has been received since 2011. 
</p>
<p>52. Women are generally kept separated from men, but are rarely under the 
</p>
<p>responsibility or attention of women officers. The lack of female officers responsible for 
</p>
<p>and attending to female detainees puts them at increased risk of sexual and gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, and causes them unnecessary humiliation. The commission documented instances 
</p>
<p>where children were detained together with adults in the same inhumane conditions and 
</p>
<p>without attention to their specific needs. As with others, children are often held 
</p>
<p>incommunicado.  
</p>
<p>53. With regard to detention, the Government is in violation of the rights to life; to 
</p>
<p>liberty and security; not to be subject to torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment; to 
</p>
<p>be treated with humanity and the inherent dignity of the human person; and to a reasonable 
</p>
<p>standard of health. Incommunicado detention and solitary confinement, during which 
</p>
<p>detainees are also denied contact with other detainees and even prison guards for prolonged 
</p>
<p>periods of time, amounts to torture. Authorities are accountable for the violation of the right 
</p>
<p>to life of detainees who are under their responsibility and who die in custody, including in 
</p>
<p>cases of suicide. The commission finds that, in all these cases, the Government does not 
</p>
<p>abide by its positive obligation to protect the life of persons in custody and its obligation of 
</p>
<p>due diligence to investigate deaths. </p>


<p><b> 6. Torture 
</b></p>
<p>54. Eritrean officials use a variety of forms of ill-treatment during interrogations and to 
</p>
<p>punish detainees and conscripts. The common element of these forms of ill-treatment, such 
</p>
<p>as extreme forms of restraint, beatings or rape, is that they are intended to inflict severe 
</p>
<p>physical and psychological pain. The purpose of these acts is to extract confessions and 
</p>
<p>information, and to punish, intimidate and coerce detainees and conscripts. Many of them 
</p>
<p>also cause long-lasting psychological and physical damage to the victims or result in the 
</p>
<p>death of the person. The commission finds that this ill-treatment constitutes torture, which 
</p>
<p>may be described as widespread in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>55. Torture is either directly ordered by officials or inflicted with their consent and 
</p>
<p>acquiescence. The recurrence, coherence and similarities of the many torture incidents 
</p>
<p>documented are a clear indication of the existence of a deliberate policy to inflict torture in 
</p>
<p>a routine manner during investigations and interrogations, as well as during national 
</p>
<p>service. Perpetrators of torture enjoy general impunity. The commission concludes that the 
</p>
<p>Government is accountable for the widespread torture inflicted on Eritreans throughout the 
</p>
<p>country. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Right to property 
</b></p>
<p>56. The State&#8217;s post-independence land reforms, a significant departure from previous 
</p>
<p>customary law, were implemented to varying degrees across the country. The 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s exclusive ownership of land and of natural resources has been used as a 
</p>
<p>means by authorities to harass and punish perceived enemies, in particular members of 
</p>
<p>unauthorized religions, opponents and relatives of people who fled the country, and to 
</p>
<p>unlawfully reward associates or supporters. Although the land reform laws appear gender-
</p>
<p>neutral, the commission finds the system to be indirectly discriminatory to women. Women 
</p>
<p>and girls are disproportionally affected by the citizenship requirement linked to completion 
</p>
<p>of national service to have access to land, given that many do not undertake or complete it 
</p>
<p>due to marriage and motherhood. Land reform also has a disproportionate impact on 
</p>
<p>pastoralists, such as the Afar and Kunama minorities. The manner adopted by the 
</p>
<p>authorities to resettle members of these communities may be construed as an intentional act 
</p>
<p>to dispossess them of their ancestral lands, their livelihoods and their culture. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Abused, exploited and enslaved 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National service 
</b></p>
<p>57. In 1995, the Government issued a Proclamation on national service complementing 
</p>
<p>previous laws and calling for the conscription of all 18-year-old Eritreans. In 2002, it 
</p>
<p>launched the Warsai Yikealo Development Campaign, requiring boys and girls to 
</p>
<p>commence military training for a period of six months when they reach twelfth grade, if in 
</p>
<p>school, or by the time they are 18 years old. Conscripts who pass the final exam at the 
</p>
<p>Warsai Yikealo secondary school are allowed to continue their education while remaining 
</p>
<p>formally in national service; others are required to serve in either the military or the civil 
</p>
<p>service for at least 12 months. In reality, children are often forcibly recruited and conscripts 
</p>
<p>end up serving for an indefinite period of time. The commission interviewed individuals 
</p>
<p>who were still in the army when they finally decided to flee after 17 years of service.  
</p>
<p>58. Conditions and treatment during military training and service are harsh. They 
</p>
<p>include lack of adequate food, water, hygienic facilities, accommodation and medical 
</p>
<p>services that may result in death, severe disabilities or psychological and physiological 
</p>
<p>long-term effects. Conscripts are routinely deprived of their rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, movement and religion. They are systematically subjected to intentional </p>


<p>punishment and ill-treatment aimed at inflicting severe pain. In many cases, this constitutes 
</p>
<p>torture.  
</p>
<p>59. Sexual violence against women and girls is widespread and indeed notorious in 
</p>
<p>military training camps. Furthermore, the enforced domestic service of women and girls 
</p>
<p>who are also sexually abused in these camps amounts to sexual slavery. The commission 
</p>
<p>considers that these violations of the rights of women and girls also amount to torture. They 
</p>
<p>are also committed to a lesser extent within the military and are a further example of the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s failure to fulfil its due diligence obligations to protect, prevent, punish and 
</p>
<p>remedy acts of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>60. Being exempted from national service is very difficult, particularly for men. No 
</p>
<p>form of conscientious objection is allowed, and even persons with disabilities are 
</p>
<p>conscripted for active military training and service instead of civil service. Authorities 
</p>
<p>regularly conduct mass round-ups (<i>giffas</i>) to seize draft evaders and deserters in an 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate manner. This often involves excessive use of force, occasionally leading to 
</p>
<p>death, and the forced entrance into and search of private homes. Leaving national service is 
</p>
<p>equally challenging, and often is only possible when the individual deserts and flees the 
</p>
<p>country. Indeed, the indefinite duration of national service, its terrible conditions &#8211; 
</p>
<p>including arbitrary detention, torture, sexual torture, forced labour, absence of leave and the 
</p>
<p>ludicrous pay &#8211; and the implications it has for the possibility of any individual to found a 
</p>
<p>family, conduct a family life and have favourable conditions of work make national service 
</p>
<p>an institution where slavery-like practices are routine.  
</p>
<p>61. The conscription of citizens into national service is a prerogative of sovereign States, 
</p>
<p>which can require that individuals contribute to the national defence of the State for a 
</p>
<p>certain period of time. This should not, however, result in the complete denial of the 
</p>
<p>individual&#8217;s freedoms and rights. National service in Eritrea is based on conditions and 
</p>
<p>measures that are not proportionate, reasonable or necessary in the interest of national 
</p>
<p>defence. National service as implemented by the Eritrean authorities involves the 
</p>
<p>systematic violation of an array of human rights on a scope and scale seldom witnessed 
</p>
<p>elsewhere in the world. In particular, the commission finds that national service violates the 
</p>
<p>rights of Eritreans to life; to liberty and security; not to be tortured or subject to cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhumane or degrading treatment; to be treated with humanity and inherent dignity of the 
</p>
<p>human person while deprived of liberty; to be recognized everywhere as a person before the 
</p>
<p>law; to enjoy freedom of thought, conscience, religion, expression and movement; to 
</p>
<p>privacy and family life; to education; to the highest attainable standard of physical and 
</p>
<p>mental health; not to be subjected to forced labour; and to gain one&#8217;s life by work freely 
</p>
<p>chosen or accepted. It also violates the right of children not be forcibly enrolled in armed 
</p>
<p>forces.  
</p>
<p>62. Lastly, the commission considers that the lack of investigation, prosecution and 
</p>
<p>punishment by the Government of those practices or violations that result of individual 
</p>
<p>initiatives constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence under international human 
</p>
<p>rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Forced labour 
</b></p>
<p>63. Thousands of boys and girls are enrolled every year in open-ended national service. 
</p>
<p>The commission finds that, during their service, most conscripts in the military and all 
</p>
<p>conscripts in civil service are subject to forced labour. There is a pattern of torture, 
</p>
<p>inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment or punishment of conscripts in the army in 
</p>
<p>connection with the labour that conscripts are forced to perform. The working and living 
</p>
<p>conditions of conscripts who are subject to forced labour are conducive or amount to 
</p>
<p>additional human rights violations, such as to their right to work in just and favourable 
</p>
<p>conditions, their right to adequate housing and their right to the highest attainable standard </p>


<p>of health and access to health care, in particular when they are required to perform 
</p>
<p>dangerous work.  
</p>
<p>64. Many Eritreans, including under-age students, are also subject to forced labour 
</p>
<p>outside national service. Elderly Eritreans are subject to forced labour in the context of their 
</p>
<p>forced recruitment in the militia. The commission finds that the labour exacted from 
</p>
<p>persons deprived of liberty by the Government also constitutes a form of forced labour 
</p>
<p>prohibited under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>65. Conscripts, students, elderly persons and prisoners are all forced to work under the 
</p>
<p>threat of penalty or punishment. In the repressive context of Eritrea, refusal to perform such 
</p>
<p>work is therefore not a possibility they would consider. The commission concludes that 
</p>
<p>forced labour in this context is a practice similar to slavery in its effects and, as such, is 
</p>
<p>prohibited under international human rights law.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p> <b>A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The commission finds that systematic, widespread and gross human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations have been and are being committed by the Government of Eritrea and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>there is no accountability for them. The enjoyment of rights and freedoms are severely 
</b></p>
<p><b>curtailed in an overall context of a total lack of rule of law. The commission also finds 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the violations in the areas of extrajudicial executions, torture (including sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture), national service and forced labour may constitute crimes against humanity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The commission emphasizes that its present findings should not be interpreted as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>conclusion that international crimes have not been committed in other areas. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> Following up on practices developed during the liberation struggle, the PFDJ, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the ruling and only party in Eritrea, has held on to power by progressively 
</b></p>
<p><b>dismantling or refraining from implementing reforms aimed at establishing 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy and rule of law in the country. Through the establishment of control 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems and the application of harsh repression, the PFDJ has eroded public freedoms 
</b></p>
<p><b>and established a rule of fear that tolerates no opposition. It has blurred the lines 
</b></p>
<p><b>between the three sources of constitutional authority by concentrating all power in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>executive, and in particular in the figure of the President </b>&#8211;<b> who is also the head of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>party, at the cost of the legislature and the judiciary. National elections have never 
</b></p>
<p><b>been held.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The PFDJ has established a system by which an extraordinary number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals have the power to spy on Eritreans and conduct investigations and arrests 
</b></p>
<p><b>often without observing the law. The proliferation of national security offices and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers assigned to administrative offices but with an intelligence mandate </b>&#8211;<b> and their 
</b></p>
<p>overlap with the party&#8217;s own intelligence and with mili<b>tary intelligence </b>&#8211;<b> is a major 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern.  
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> What was meant to be the supreme law of the country, the Constitution of 1997, 
</b></p>
<p><b>has never been implemented. The National Assembly stopped convening in 2002. Even 
</b></p>
<p><b>while it was sitting, laws were passed by government </b>decree (&#8220;P<b>roclamation</b>&#8221;); since 
</p>
<p><b>2002, it has been the exclusive way to promulgate legislation. It is of particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern that some important policies adopted by the Government, including those 
</b></p>
<p><b>severely affecting individual rights and freedoms, are not embodied in law; they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>simply </b>&#8220;announced&#8221; <b>by government media or in messages passed on by local 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrations and implemented in practice, with all the ambiguities of such a 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure. This modus operandi has undermined the legitimate expectations of </b></p>


<p><b>Eritreans on the certainty of laws and on proper legislative processes separated from 
</b></p>
<p><b>and under the control of an independent legislature. While the commission welcomes 
</b></p>
<p><b>the promulgation of the new codes that, as of May 2015, effectively replace the 
</b></p>
<p><b>transitional codes in force since 1991, it is not in the position to assess their compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international human rights law.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The judiciary is not independent. Judges are appointed, reassigned and 
</b></p>
<p><b>dismissed at the will of the President and are directed in their actions and influenced 
</b></p>
<p><b>in their decisions by members of the PFDJ and of the army. The judicial system has 
</b></p>
<p><b>also been affected by the creation of a parallel structure, the Special Court, which, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice, presides over and rules on all kinds of crimes, operating with clear disregard 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the most basic safeguards related to due process. Its judges are senior military 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers without legal training, apparently directly appointed by the President and 
</b></p>
<p><b>directly accountable to him. Globally, administration of justice is completely deficient, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly when it comes to processing cases of persons in detention. Community 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts, with jurisdiction over disputes arising from the </b>&#8220;<b>daily lives of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities</b>&#8221;<b>, have at least facilitated access to some justice for people in rural and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remote communities.  
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Eritreans are unable to move at will, to express themselves freely, to practice 
</b></p>
<p><b>their religion without undue interference, to enjoy unrestricted access to information 
</b></p>
<p><b>or to have the liberty to assemble and associate. Pervasive control systems and heavy 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences for perceived deviant behaviours, including lifetime incarceration or 
</b></p>
<p><b>death, have created an environment of self-censorship whereby individuals no longer 
</b></p>
<p><b>trust anyone </b>&#8211;<b> not even their own family.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> Continuing practices already recorded during the liberation struggle when 
</b></p>
<p><b>dealing with internal and external opposition, the Government has since independence 
</b></p>
<p><b>used enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions to crush real or perceived 
</b></p>
<p><b>opposition and prevent the rise of any opposing views. The commission finds 
</b></p>
<p>particularly abhorrent the Government&#8217;s practice of <b>acknowledging arrests while 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing no further information regarding the fate or whereabouts of those arrested. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> Arbitrary detention is ubiquitous. The number of officials misusing the power 
</b></p>
<p><b>of arrest is particularly worrisome, as is the number of official, unofficial and secret 
</b></p>
<p><b>places of detention </b>&#8211;<b> all outside the control of the judiciary. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>are extremely harsh, and the lack of access to sufficient food, water and medical care 
</b></p>
<p><b>while in detention is found to debilitate prisoners and to lead to short- and long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>health complications, and sometimes death. The practice of keeping detainees in 
</b></p>
<p><b>incommunicado detention and/or in isolation with total disregard for international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards is widespread. The mental and physical health of prisoners is thus unduly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and unnecessarily affected.  </b></p>
<p>74.<b> Persons arrested, detained or held for punishment under various 
</b></p>
<p><b>circumstances, including during national service and military training, are routinely 
</b></p>
<p><b>subject to forms of ill-treatment that, in many cases, amount to torture. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission finds that the use of torture is so widespread that it can only conclude that 
</b></p>
<p><b>it is a policy of the Government to encourage its use for the punishment of individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>perceived as deviant and for extorting confessions. Monitoring of detention centres is 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-existent, and perpetrators of torture are never brought to justice. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The commission finds that the practice of punishing family members for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>behaviour of a relative constitutes a form of guilt by association that is in violation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards. Retaliation of this kind can be financial or take the form of 
</b></p>
<p><b>harassment (including abroad), arbitrary arrest and detention. Targets can be </b></p>


<p><b>relatives of perceived critics of the Government, conscripts who have deserted, 
</b></p>
<p><b>detainees who have escaped or individuals who had fled the country. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> Controlled access to property, including land, has allowed the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>use such resources as a further means to punish those in perceived disagreement with 
</b></p>
<p><b>it and to reward supporters. The commission finds that military and party 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives in particular have abused their authority to seize land, houses and 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses for their own profit.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Since 1994, Eritreans have had to spend most of their working lives in national 
</b></p>
<p><b>service. The duration of national service is indefinite, its conditions violate 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards and conscripts are severely underpaid . As such, it is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>institution where slavery-like practices take place. Conscripts are at the mercy of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>superiors, who exercise control and command over their subordinates without 
</b></p>
<p><b>restriction in a way that violates human rights and without ever being held 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountable. Conscripts are regularly subjected to punishment amounting to torture 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ill-treatment, during both military training and life in the army. Women and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b>are at a high risk of rape and other forms of sexual violence in all areas of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>service, and particularly in military training camps, where they are often forced into 
</b></p>
<p><b>concubinage by superiors in the camp. Eritreans who attempt to avoid conscription or 
</b></p>
<p><b>escape from the military are severely punished and arbitrarily deprived of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>liberty.  
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The Government has unlawfully and consistently been using conscripts and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other members of the population, including members of the militia, many beyond 
</b></p>
<p><b>retirement age, as forced labourers to construct infrastructure and to pursue the aim 
</b></p>
<p><b>of economic development and self-sufficiency of the State, thus indirectly supporting 
</b></p>
<p><b>the continued existence of a totalitarian Government that has been in power for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>past 24 years. The use of forced labour is so prevalent in Eritrea that all sectors of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>economy rely on it, and all Eritreans are likely to be subject to it at some stage in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>lives. The Government also regularly profits from the almost free work exacted from 
</b></p>
<p><b>conscripts and detainees to obtain illegitimate financial gain when they are </b>&#8220;<b>lent</b>&#8221;<b> to 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign companies paying salaries to the Government that are considerably higher 
</b></p>
<p><b>than the amounts paid by the Government to the workers. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The situation of human rights incites an ever-increasing number of Eritreans to 
</b></p>
<p><b>leave their country. Overall, it is estimated that approximately 5,000 people leave 
</b></p>
<p><b>Eritrea each month, mainly to neighbouring countries. The trend has been upwards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with a marked spike during the latter months of 2014. In October 2014, the registered 
</b></p>
<p><b>refugee population was 109,594 in the Sudan and 106,859 in Ethiopia. The total 
</b></p>
<p><b>Eritrean population of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Refugees in mid-2014 was 357,406; depending on estimates of the current population, 
</b></p>
<p><b>this would constitute between 6 and 10 per cent of the national population. Thousands 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Eritreans are killed at sea while attempting to reach European shores. The practice 
</b></p>
<p><b>of kidnapping migrating individuals, who are released on ransom after enduring 
</b></p>
<p><b>horrible torture or killed, targets Eritreans in particular. Episodes of Eritreans killed 
</b></p>
<p><b>inside the country while trying to leave have also been recorded.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> Discrimination and violence against women are present in all areas of Eritrean 
</b></p>
<p><b>society. Women are not only at extreme risk of sexual violence within the military and 
</b></p>
<p><b>in military training camps, but also in society at large, where violence against women 
</b></p>
<p><b>is perpetrated in an environment of impunity. Discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersects with the other human rights violations, placing women in a position of 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability. Violations of the right to property, employment and freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>movement result in women being vulnerable to food insecurity, engaging in 
</b></p>
<p><b>transactional sex and prostitution and at heightened risk of punishment for non-</b></p>


<p><b>sanctioned work. The lack of genuine rule of law, credible security agencies and 
</b></p>
<p>independent and impartial women&#8217;s civil society organizations leave<b>s women and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b>unable to seek recourse to justice or remedy for the sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>and discrimination they endure.  
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The commission finds that the lack of trustworthy data, including statistical 
</b></p>
<p><b>data, in almost every domain (inter alia, legal, demographic, development-related and 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic) is a serious deficiency that hampers a clear understanding of the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Eritrea, allows the circulation of interpretations that are not evidence-based, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>results in decisions that can be harmful to the enjoyment of human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Eritreans.  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The commission has not benefited from any form of cooperation from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Eritrea. The limited access to the country by international and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional governmental and non-governmental organizations is of great concern, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly in the context of a Government that maintains an opaque system and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>does not make information publicly available to either its citizens or the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The international community and the United Nations bear an ongoing 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility for the situation in Eritrea. In particular, the non-implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Algiers Agreement of 12 December 2000 and of the ruling on the demarcation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>border between Ethiopia and Eritrea has provided an easy pretext for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to implement repressive practices supposedly aimed at the defence of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>State. The international community also has a responsibility to keep Eritrea under 
</b></p>
<p><b>scrutiny for its policies and practices.  
</b></p>
<p> <b>B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> On the basis of its findings and conclusions, the commission makes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations below. 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. General 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The commission of inquiry recommends that the Government of Eritrea: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Implement fully and without further delay the Constitution of 1997; any 
</b></p>
<p><b>amendments to the Constitution should be made in a transparent and participatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner and take into account </b>the State&#8217;s<b> obligations under international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Respect obligations under international human rights treaties to which 
</b></p>
<p><b>Eritrea is a party; ratify and implement other international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments; and respect fully the freedoms of expression and opinion and of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and association as critical foundations for any democracy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Acknowledge the existence of human rights violations and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for past human rights violations, including but not limited to 
</b></p>
<p><b>extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, unlawful detention, sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and forced labour, including within national service;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Establish an independent and impartial mechanism to investigate and, 
</b></p>
<p><b>where appropriate, to bring perpetrators to justice, in particular those with command 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility, and to provide victims with adequate redress; and ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures are in place to hold all perpetrators of ongoing and future human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations fully accountable. 
</b></p>
<p><b>2. Governance and administration of justice </b></p>


<p>86. <b>The commission also recommends that the Government of Eritrea:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure the separation of powers between the legislature, the executive 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the judiciary;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Allow the creation of political parties and hold free, fair and transparent 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic elections at all levels, and in this context, respect and implement the draft 
</b></p>
<p><b>electoral law and other products of the work of the commission set up to organize 
</b></p>
<p><b>elections;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Bring national laws and regulations into line with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards, ensure that law-making is transparent and consultative, and that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation is published and made accessible to the general public in the official 
</b></p>
<p><b>languages of Eritrea.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Adopt legislation providing enhanced legal and social protection to those 
</b></p>
<p><b>in vulnerable situations, particularly children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Undertake without delay legal and institutional reforms aimed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring checks and balances among government organs, including by restoring the 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect of the rule of law, by institutionalizing an independent and transparent 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary and by providing access to justice, in particular for the accused and 
</b></p>
<p><b>detainees;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that court processes, including judgements, are transparent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>open and accessible to the public, and transmitted to accused persons immediately; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) End the application of vicarious liability of innocent parties for alleged 
</b></p>
<p><b>unlawful acts committed by third persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Establish an independent national human rights institution with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring mandate to investigate ongoing human rights violations; and protect and 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect the substantive role that civil society actors, particularly human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders, play in democratic societies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)  Ensure that individuals have the possibility of appealing settlements that 
</b></p>
<p><b>are not based on law, and close the Special Court.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Enforced disappearances, and arbitrary arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The commission further recommends that the Government of Eritrea: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> <b>Cease with immediate effect the practice of enforced disappearance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>all forms of extrajudicial executions by, inter alia, discontinuing the shoot-to-kill 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy wherever it may be applicable in border areas;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Immediately and unconditionally release all unlawfully and arbitrarily 
</b></p>
<p><b>detained persons, including members of the G-15, journalists and members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious groups;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Set up an effective mechanism to establish the whereabouts of those who 
</b></p>
<p><b>have disappeared, provide it with a full account of all those arrested or disappeared 
</b></p>
<p><b>since independence, and immediately provide information thereon to their families;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Review all cases of detainees who have been convicted of an offence in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial or quasi-judicial forum but who were not given the opportunity to defend 
</b></p>
<p><b>themselves or accorded the procedural rights that are established in the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments to which Eritrea is party;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Put an immediate end to the practice of incommunicado detention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>close all unofficial and secret places of detention; allow access to prisoners by family </b></p>


<p><b>members, lawyers and judges; and institute and ensure the respect of procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b>whereby any person who is arrested is either charged or released after a reasonable 
</b></p>
<p><b>period of time; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Provide immediately information on any prisoners of war held in 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention, and release them as soon as possible; in the meantime, allow international 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitors unrestricted access to them. 
</b></p>
<p><b>4. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The commission recommends that the Government of Eritrea: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Improve the conditions of detention and the treatment of prisoners to 
</b></p>
<p><b>bring them into line with international standards and, in particular, ensure access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>medical treatment for all detainees in need;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that solitary confinement remains an exceptional measure of 
</b></p>
<p><b>limited duration;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Institute procedures for independent oversight of detention centres; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediately permit unhindered access by international monitors to all places of 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention, allow them to conduct regular and unannounced visits, and act promptly on 
</b></p>
<p><b>their recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The commission recommends that the Government of Eritrea put an immediate 
</b></p>
<p><b>end to the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment, establish adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>complaints mechanisms and ensure that prompt and effective investigations are 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted into all allegations of torture and ill-treatment with a view to bringing 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators to justice. 
</b></p>
<p> <b>6. Public freedoms 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The commission recommends that the Government of Eritrea: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Permit immediately freedom of movement within the country by 
</b></p>
<p><b>dismantling checkpoints and removing the need for travel permits; take measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate the lawful movement of persons in and out of the country, including for 
</b></p>
<p><b>family reunification; and lift the requirement of an exit visa to leave the country, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>treat returnees in compliance with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Take immediate measures to allow the operation of independent media, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by bringing relevant legislation into conformity with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards; and protect journalists from arbitrary interference and arrest;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Take immediate measures to end all religious persecution, particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>for specific religious groups, </b>such as Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Pentecostals and other non<b>-
</b></p>
<p><b>authorized religious groups; and immediately restore citizenship and related rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Respect the religious freedom of all faiths. 
</b></p>
<p><b>7. Property 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The commission also recommends that the Government of Eritrea: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that rights related to property are realized and enjoyed without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination of any kind;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that evictions from property, including land and houses, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resettlements are conducted in accordance with international human rights law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including on compensation, and the principles of proportionality and reasonableness;  </b></p>


<p><b>(c) End forced evictions used in reprisal against unauthorized religions, 
</b></p>
<p>such as Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses and those who did not take part in the armed struggle. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Stop the seizure without compensation of land of Afars who flee Eritrea; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ensure that Afars are resettled in a hospitable environment. 
</b></p>
<p><b>8. National service 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The commission recommends that the Government of Eritrea:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Discontinue indefinite national service by limiting it to 18 months for all 
</b></p>
<p><b>current and future conscripts, as envisaged by the Proclamation on national service; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Provide full and transparent information on the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recent announcement concerning the return of the duration of national service to 18 
</b></p>
<p><b>months for persons recruited as of 2014;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Provide for conscientious objection by law, in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international norms; and provide for and grant exemptions from national service for 
</b></p>
<p><b>reasons relating to physical or mental health issues or family needs;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Establish and apply lawful procedures for the apprehension of draft 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaders and deserters, and ensure that they are charged and tried by a court in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with international standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Adopt a military code that, inter alia, forbids and punishes ill-treatment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation and harassment of conscripts, and that sets standards for their living 
</b></p>
<p><b>conditions, including provision of food and shelter;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Establish a complaint mechanism for conscripts to raise allegations of ill-
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment and to obtain redress;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Stop the forced recruitment of children under the age of 18 years into 
</b></p>
<p><b>military training;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Disassociate education from military service and provide for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>completion of secondary schooling outside of Sawa or other military training centres; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Abolish the requirement of completion of national service duties for 
</b></p>
<p><b>citizenship. 
</b></p>
<p><b>9. Forced labour  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The commission of inquiry calls upon the Government of Eritrea to cease the 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice of using conscripts serving in the national service, detainees, students and 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of the militia as a source of forced labour, which is prohibited by 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards. 
</b></p>
<p> <b>10. Gender equality  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The commission of inquiry recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Strengthen legislation protecting and promoting the equality of women 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Eritrea;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ratify the Protocol </b>to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p><b>Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Permit the creation of independent gender-specific civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, which are necessary </b>to increase women&#8217;s involvement in public life and 
</p>
<p><b>decision-making;  </b></p>


<p><b>(d) Ensure that women have access to productive land, agricultural training 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the means required to make their farming sustainable and productive;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that all women and girls enjoy equal inheritance rights and are 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected by the same legal standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Investigate, prosecute and sentence offenders of sexual and gender-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) During mandatory military training, prohibit the assignment of women 
</b></p>
<p>and girls to officials&#8217; quarters for forced domestic labour<b>, and institute a zero-
</b></p>
<p><b>tolerance policy for sexual abuse within training camps, which should be monitored 
</b></p>
<p><b>and reported on by an independent institution; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Take immediate measures to ensure de facto gender equality, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>address all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender-based violence by State and non-State actors, specifically within state 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, such as military camps, army and places of detention;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Implement impartial, gender-sensitive reporting mechanisms for victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>of violence, and provide rehabilitation and support services, including safe houses, 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal aid resources and health care. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 11. Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The commission of inquiry also recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Seek technical assistance from OHCHR and other agencies, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate, with a view to assist in the implementation of the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations, as well as those made during the universal periodic review and by 
</b></p>
<p><b>other human rights mechanisms;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Collaborate with the Special Rapporteur in implementing her mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>and respond positively to her requests for an invitation to visit Eritrea;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Cooperate with other international human rights mechanisms;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure an inclusive and comprehensive follow-up process to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal periodic review, implement the recommendations made by treaty bodies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and submit overdue reports;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Cooperate with the international community to allow those providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian assistance unhindered access throughout the country. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The commission of inquiry recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Pending tangible progress in the situation of human rights, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>the adoption of reforms that seriously address the problems identified in by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission in the present report, continue to provide protection to all those who have 
</b></p>
<p><b>fled and continue to flee Eritrea owing to severe violations of their rights or fear 
</b></p>
<p><b>thereof;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Respect the principle of non-refoulement and end bilateral and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrangements that jeopardize the lives of those who seek asylum;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Identify long-term solutions to help Eritrean refugees, including local 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration in the first-asylum country and resettlement in third countries, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen international solidarity in sharing the responsibility to care for Eritrean 
</b></p>
<p><b>refugees and migrants;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Promote channels of regular migration from Eritrea to reduce 
</b></p>
<p><b>clandestine channels, in particular by ensuring that they no longer have to risk their </b></p>


<p><b>lives crossing the Mediterranean; in this regard, the issue of securing refugee routes 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be considered at the international level to provide safe passage to fleeing 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Promote inter-State cooperation to counter human smuggling and 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking, while treating victims in accordance with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Criminalize the trade in people trafficking and people smuggling, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>in this region predominantly affects Eritreans; and establish mechanisms to 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigate, and provide resources to prosecute, those engaged in this trade;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) In engaging with the Eritrean authorities on solutions to stem the flow of 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum seekers from Eritrea, place human rights considerations at the forefront of 
</b></p>
<p><b>any package of proposed abatement measures; furthermore, neighbouring 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments should train security sector personnel in gender-sensitive trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Keep Eritrea under close scrutiny until tangible progress in the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights is evident, and ensure the centrality of human rights in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement with the country;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Clear conditions for a return to full, normal relations between Eritrea 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the international community, including the participation of Eritrea in regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>councils and mechanisms;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Assist Eritrea and Ethiopia in solving border issues through diplomatic 
</b></p>
<p><b>means. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> When negotiating development assistance and investment projects in Eritrea, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments, non-governmental organizations and private sector companies should 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that decent wages for locally engaged staff are an integral part of the

<p><b>agreement, and insist that wages effectively go to those doing the work. In negotiating

<p><b>access to the country and in proposing programmes and projects, organizations

<p><b>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN ERITREA</b> 
</p>
<p>    
</p>
<p>3 June 2015 
</p>
<p> 
Excellency, 
</p>
<p>Further to my letter of 14 October 2014, I am writing to you again in my capacity as 
</p>
<p>Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>In June 2014, the Human Rights Council established the Commission with the 
</p>
<p>mandate to investigate all alleged violations of human rights in Eritrea and to report to it at 
</p>
<p>its twenty-ninth session, starting in Geneva on 15 June. 
</p>
<p>The Commission undertook its investigation between the months of November 2014 
</p>
<p>and May 2015. I sincerely regret that in spite of repeated calls for access and for 
</p>
<p>information related to the human rights situation, your Government decided not to engage 
</p>
<p>with us and not to provide any cooperation. We are still ready to engage with you and your 
</p>
<p>Government, should you wish to invite us to visit Eritrea and discuss the outcome of our 
</p>
<p>investigation with you and your collaborators.  
</p>
<p>On the basis of the body of evidence collected from more than 700 testimonies, the 
</p>
<p>Commission has concluded that systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations 
</p>
<p>have been and are being committed in Eritrea under the authority of your Government. The 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of rights and freedoms are severely curtailed in an overall context of a lack of 
</p>
<p>rule of law. 
</p>
<p>The Commission also finds that the violations in the areas of extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>executions, torture (including sexual torture), national service and forced labour may 
</p>
<p>constitute crimes against humanity. The commission emphasizes that its present findings 
</p>
<p>should not be interpreted as a conclusion that international crimes have not occurred in 
</p>
<p>other areas. 
</p>
<p>The full report on the findings and conclusions of the recommendations, together 
</p>
<p>with a shorter version of it are shared as annexes to this letter. They will be made public on 
</p>
<p>08 June 2015; and presented and discussed on 23 June, in the course of the Council&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>twenty-ninth session.  </p>


<p>In light of the findings of the Commission and as President of Eritrea, President of 
</p>
<p>the National Assembly and leader of the ruling party, the People&#8217;s Front for Democracy and 
</p>
<p>Justice, I exhort you to take immediate action to address the grave human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>your country, in particular by ending impunity for officials guilty of gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations.  
</p>
<p>The Commission urges you and your Government to: 
</p>
<p><b>Implement fully and without further delay the 1997 Constitution. Any 
</b></p>
<p><b>amendments to the Constitution should take place in a transparent and participatory 
</b></p>
<p>manner and take into account Eritrea&#8217;s obligations under international human rights 
</p>
<p><b>law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Acknowledge the existence of human rights violations and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for past human rights violations, including but not limited to 
</b></p>
<p><b>extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, unlawful detention, sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and forced labour, also within national service.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Cease with immediate effect the practice of enforced disappearance and all 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of extrajudicial executions, inter alia by discontinuing the shoot-to-kill policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>that may be applicable at any border. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Immediately and unconditionally release all unlawfully and arbitrarily 
</b></p>
<p><b>detained persons, including members of the G-15, journalists and members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Put an immediate end to the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discontinue the indefinite national service by limiting it to 18 months for all 
</b></p>
<p><b>current and future conscripts as envisaged by the National Service Proclamation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Take immediate measures to ensure de facto gender equality and address all 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual and gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>based violence by State and non-State actors.  
</b></p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s full recommendations are detailed in the reports attached to this 
</p>
<p>letter. We hold the hope that you will give them serious consideration. We strongly believe 
</p>
<p>that, if implemented, they would be of help to make Eritrea a State where rule of law is 
</p>
<p>implemented and human rights respected.  
</p>
<p>The Commission avails itself of the opportunity to renew the expression of its 
</p>
<p>highest consideration. 
</p>
<p>Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.  
</p>
