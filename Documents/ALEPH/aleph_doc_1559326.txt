Certain  statements  made in this Annual Report are "forward-looking statements" 
(within  the  meaning  of  the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) 
regarding  the  plans  and  objectives of management for future operations. Such 
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that 
may  cause  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements of the Company to be 
materially  different  from  any  future  results,  performance  or achievements 
expressed  or  implied  by  such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking 
statements  made  in  this Report are based on current expectations that involve 
numerous  risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, 
in  part,  on  assumptions  involving  the  growth  and  expansion  of business. 
Assumptions  relating  to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among 
other  things,  future  economic,  competitive  and market conditions and future 
business  decisions,  all  of  which  are  difficult  or  impossible  to predict 
accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the 
Company  believes that its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements 
are  reasonable,  any  of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, 
there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the forward-looking statements made in this 
Report  will  prove  to  be  accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties 
inherent in the forward-looking statements made in this Report, the inclusion of 
such  information  should  not be regarded as a representation by the Company or 
any  other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.

BUSINESS 
 
We  are  an  exploration stage oil and gas company.  Since our business requires 
significant  capital and we have limited assets and resources, we will initially 
participate in the oil and gas industry by acquiring undivided working interests 
in  small oil and gas exploration properties and non-operating interests in both 
producing  and  exploration  projects  throughout  the United States and Canada. 
There  can  be  no  assurance  that we will be successful in our exploration and 
investment  activities.  The  oil  and  gas  business involves numerous risks. A 
"working  interest"  is  an  interest  in  a  well  that  bears the drilling and 
operating  expenses  thereof.  A  "non-operating interest" is a working interest 
for  which  the  owner  does  not  operate  the  well. 
 
Our  management  is  not  experienced  in  the  oil  and  gas industry.  We will 
therefore  rely  on consultants to identify, evaluate and structure suitable oil 
and  gas acquisition opportunities.  With the assistance of our consultants and, 
to  a  lesser  extent,  unsolicited submissions, we intend to evaluate potential 
acquisitions  of  oil and gas interests in the United States and Canada that may 
become  available  on acceptable terms and that have the potential to provide us 
with  production  revenue  and  reserves. 
 
We  will  rely on third parties for outsourced drilling and exploration services 
as  appropriate.  By  outsourcing  an appropriate level of the capital-intensive 
aspects  of  our  business,  we  expect  to achieve significant cost savings and 
operational  efficiencies.  We believe that our business model will permit us to 
maximize  the  use  of  our  otherwise  limited  resources,  reduce  the risk of 
unsuccessful  drilling  efforts,  and  capitalize  on  the  experience  of  our 
consultants. 
 
We  are  focusing  our acquisition and exploration activities in the Province of 
Alberta.  This  region  is characterized by potentially long-lived reserves with 
predictable  and  relatively  low  production depletion rates, multiple geologic 
targets  that  decrease  risk,  lower  service costs than in more competitive or 
remote  areas,  a  favorable  regulatory  environment  that  encourages drilling 
efforts, and limited federal land or land access impediments.  We will, however, 
consider  any  prospective  oil and gas projects located in the United States or 
Canada  that we believe may yield commercially producible amounts of oil or gas. 
 
We  have  not earned any revenue since our inception and presently have negative 
cash  flow.  To  date,  our  efforts  upon  have  been  devoted  to  acquiring 
non-operating  interests  in  projects that are already producing oil or natural 
gas,  and  thereby  generate  positive  cash  flow  to  fund  operations  and 
re-investment in other oil and gas projects.  We have also pursued non-operating 
interests  in  exploration  projects. 
 
In  2009,  we expanded our business plan to include the development of renewable 
energy  sources.  Our  efforts  in  this  area  been  unsuccessful.  In 2010, we 
abandoned our pursuit of renewable energy to focus on the acquisition of oil and 
natural  gas  interests. 
 
On  November  25,  2009,  we  obtained an assignment of the conditional right to 
acquire  a working interest in certain natural gas properties located in Alberta 
(the  "Prospect") from the well operator (an independent third party), which was 
subject  to Thrust providing up to $1,000,000 in financing for the completion of 
wells  located on the Prospect.  On January 22, 2010, the well operator informed 
us  that  we  were  in  default  of our contractual obligations.  As part of our 
negotiations  with the well operator, we agreed to pay a further $100,000 CAD to 
the operator in respect of the Prospect.  On February 8, 2010, our sole director 
advanced  the sum of $25,000 CAD ($23,740) to the operator on our behalf, but we 
were  unable  to  make  any  further payments.  No working interest or any other 
interest in the Prospect has been granted to the Company, and the Company is not 
pursuing  the grant of any such interest related to the Prospect. As a result of 
conservatism,  we  have  written off a total of $83,740 in costs relating to the 
acquisition  of  conditional  rights  to  acquire  an  interest in the Prospect. 
 
The  Company  is  actively  pursuing  recovery  of  its  cash  investment in the 
Prospect.  The  well operator is obligated to return $100,000 CAD to the Company 
by  January  6,  2011.  An  additional  $25,000 CAD is payable to the Company on 
demand  without  interest.  On  October  12, 2010, we made formal demand for the 
payment  of $25,000 CAD from the well operator by October 31, 2010.  To date, no 
payment  has  been  received  by  the  well  operator. 
 
We  do  not  presently have any oil, gas or renewable energy interests, or other 
assets. 
 
STRATEGY 
 
We  will  regularly review exploration opportunities generated by our management 
and  consultants.  We will generally seek to acquire and explore properties that 
are located in regions having established production history and infrastructure, 
or  current  production  levels  with  proven  and  potential  reserve  upside 
opportunities.  In  some  cases,  we may acquire higher risk undeveloped acreage 
based  on  available  information  suggesting  the  potential  for  commercially 
producible reserves and a favorable risk-based economic evaluation of production 
and  price  scenarios. 
 
Our  selection  of  exploration  properties will be based primarily on available 
information  gathered  from  historical  records  and  drill  logs, geologic and 
engineering  data, surrounding production from similar wells and ease of access. 
The  cost  of  obtaining such information will be unique to each property we may 
acquire  in the future and cannot presently be estimated.  Due to the expense of 
3-D  seismic  data  it  is  unlikely  that  we will obtain such information with 
respect  to any property we acquire.  3-D seismic is the method by which a three 
dimensional  image  of  the  earth's  subsurface  is  created  through  the
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1343009/000130368110000176/tegc10k31aug1...

interpretation  of reflection seismic data collected over a surface grid.  A 3-D 
seismic  survey  allows for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than 
does  a  2-D  seismic  survey  and contributes significantly to field appraisal, 
exploitation  and  production.  Without  a  3-D  seismic  survey it is much more 
likely  that  our  drilling  efforts  will  be  unsuccessful. 
 
Prior  to any acquisition, we intend to perform a review of the subject property 
generally  consistent with industry practices.  Such a review, however, will not 
reveal  all  existing  or  potential  problems,  nor will it permit us to become 
sufficiently  familiar  with  the  property  to assess fully its deficiencies or 
potential  value.  Inspections  of  the  property  may  not  be  practicable and 
existing  problems may not be observable even in those cases where an inspection 
is  undertaken.  We  may  assume  existing  liabilities, including environmental 
liabilities, upon such an acquisition and would likely acquire interests in such 
a  property  on  an  "as  is"  basis. 
 
Due  to  our  limited assets and resources, we will be circumscribed in the type 
and  quality  of properties that we will be able to acquire.  This may result in 
us  being  able  to acquire only small leaseholds in areas with proven producing 
horizons  (geological  formations  with  a history of oil or gas production), or 
leaseholds  in  higher  risk  properties.  We may also be required to enter into 
various  forms  of  joint  arrangements  with  unrelated  companies, whereby the 
parties agree to share the costs of exploration, as well as the costs of and any 
revenue from a discovery.  Such arrangements do not always equate the proportion 
of  expenditures  undertaken by a party with the share of revenue to be received 
by  such  party.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be able to find 
acceptable  properties  for exploration, or if we do, that we will be successful 
in  locating  commercially  producible  reserves  of  oil  or  gas. 
 
When we acquire a working interest in an exploration property we will assess the 
potential  reserves  of oil and gas, future oil and gas prices, operating costs, 
potential  environmental  liability,  and  other  risks  and  factors beyond our 
control.  Such  an  assessment  is  necessarily  inexact  and  its  accuracy  is 
inherently  uncertain.  Based on this assessment we will determine the degree to 
which  we will participate in exploration drilling.  We plan to finance any such 
participation  from  available  capital.  But,  when  available  capital  is 
insufficient,  we plan to finance our participation through the issuance of debt 
instruments  and  the  sale  of  our stock.  We do not presently have sufficient 
capital  to  perform  any exploration and there can be no assurance that we ever 
will. 
 
In  the  right  circumstances,  we  will  assume the entire risk of exploration. 
Alternatively,  we  may  determine  that  it  will  be more beneficial to invite 
industry  participants  to  share  the  risk  and  the reward of the prospect by 
financing  some  or  all  of  the costs of drilling contemplated wells.  In such 
cases,  we  may retain a carried working interest or a reversionary interest, or 
we  may  be required to finance all or a portion of our proportional interest in 
the  prospect.  Although  this  approach will reduce our potential return should 
the  drilling  operations  prove  successful,  it  will also reduce our risk and 
financial  commitment to a particular prospect.  A "carried working interest" is 
an  oil  or  gas  interest that has no obligation for operating costs, which are 
instead  borne by the owner or owners of the remaining interest in the property. 
A  "reversionary  interest"  is a fractional interest reserved by the owner of a 
whole  interest when the balance of the whole interest is transferred to another 
party. 
 
As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we will conduct a preliminary title 
examination  at  the time that we acquire an exploration property.  We will rely 
upon  the  brokers  of  each property to conduct the title examination.  We will 
engage  an  attorney  to  provide  a  title  opinion  on  any property having an 
acquisition cost of more than $100,000 prior to acquiring it.  Similarly, before 
we commit to spending $100,000 on the exploration of a property we acquire, such 
as  for  drilling operations, if we have not already obtained a title opinion on 
the  property  we  will  engage  an  attorney  to  do  so. 
We  will perform necessary curative work with respect to any significant defects 
in  title  prior  to  proceeding  with  operations. 
 
We  also  plan to evaluate and pursue from time-to-time opportunities to acquire 
non-operating  interests  in both producing and exploratory oil and gas projects 
with  a  view  towards  generating revenue and a significant reserve base.  This 
approach will allow us to diversify into a larger number of prospects at a lower 
cost  per prospect.  There can be no assurance, however, that such non-operating 
interests  will  be  available  to  us  on  acceptable  terms. 
 
SALES  AND  MARKETING 
 
As  we  remain  in the exploration stage, we have not yet generated any revenue, 
nor  do  we  have  any  customers. 
 
The principal customers for our crude oil production, if any, are expected to be 
refiners,  remarketers  and  other companies, some of which are expected to have 
pipeline  facilities  near  the  properties  we  acquire.  In the event pipeline 
facilities are not conveniently available, we intend to truck or barge crude oil 
to  storage,  refining  or  pipeline  facilities. 
 
The  principal  target customers for our gas production, if any, are expected to 
be  pipelines,  utilities,  gas  marketing  firms,  industrial  users  and local 
distribution  companies.  We  intend  to  use  existing  gathering  systems  and 
interstate  and  intrastate  pipelines  to  consummate gas sales and deliveries. 
 
We  intend  to  sell  our  oil and gas production, if any, under both short-term 
(less  than  one  year)  and  long-term  (one year or more) agreements at prices 
negotiated  with  third  parties. Under both short-term and long-term contracts, 
typically  either  the  entire contract (in the case of short-term contracts) or 
the  price  provisions  of the contract (in the case of long-term contracts) are

renegotiated  from  intervals  ranging  in  frequency  from  daily  to annually. 
 
We  have not yet adopted any specific sales and marketing plans. We will address 
the  need  to  hire sales and marketing personnel if and when production begins. 
 
COMPETITION 
 
The oil and gas business is highly competitive, and we do not hold a significant 
competitive  position  within  it.  Our competitors include major integrated oil 
and  gas  companies  and numerous independent oil and gas companies, individuals 
and  drilling  and  income  programs. Some of our competitors are also potential 
customers.  Many  of  our competitors are large, well established companies with 
substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we have 
and  which  have been engaged in the energy business for a much longer time than 
we  have.  Such  companies  may  be  able to pay more for productive oil and gas 
properties  and  exploratory  prospects  and  to  define,  evaluate, bid for and 
purchase  a  greater  number  of  properties and prospects than our financial or 
human  resources  permit.  Our  ability  to acquire additional properties and to 
discover  reserves  in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate 
and  select  suitable  properties  and  to  consummate  transactions in a highly 
competitive  environment. 
 
GOVERNMENT  AND  ENVIRONMENTAL  REGULATION 
 
Domestic  development,  production  and  sale  of  oil  and  gas are extensively 
regulated  at  both  the federal and state levels. Legislation affecting the oil 
and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently 
increasing  the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both 
federal  and  state/provincial, have issued rules and regulations binding on the 
oil  and gas industry and its individual members, compliance with which is often 
difficult  and  costly and some of which carry substantial penalties for failure 
to  comply.  Statutes  and  regulations require permits for drilling operations, 
drilling  bonds and reports concerning wells. Alberta and other jurisdictions in 
which  we  intend  to  conduct  operations  also  have  statutes and regulations 
governing  conservation matters, including the unitization or pooling of oil and 
gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas 
wells. 
 
Our  planned  operations  will  be  subject to extensive and developing federal, 
state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  relating to environmental, health and 
safety  matters;  petroleum;  chemical  products  and  materials;  and  waste 
management.  Permits, registrations or other authorizations will be required for 
any  future  oil  and  gas exploration and production activities. These permits, 
registrations  or authorizations will be subject to revocation, modification and 
renewal.  Governmental  authorities  have  the  power to enforce compliance with 
these regulatory requirements, the provisions of required permits, registrations 
or  other  authorizations,  and  lease  conditions, and violators are subject to 
civil  and  criminal penalties, including fines, injunctions or both. Failure to 
obtain  or maintain a required permit may also result in the imposition of civil 
and  criminal  penalties.  Third  parties  may  have the right to sue to enforce 
compliance. 
 
Some  risk  of costs and liabilities related to environmental, health and safety 
matters  is  inherent  in  our planned operations, as it is with other companies 
engaged in similar businesses, and there can be no assurance that material costs 
or  liabilities  will  not  be incurred. In addition, it is possible that future 
developments,  such  as  stricter  requirements  of  environmental or health and 
safety  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  business  or  more  stringent 
interpretations  of,  or  enforcement  policies  with  respect to, such laws and 
regulations,  could  adversely  affect  us.  To  meet  changing  permitting  and 
operational  standards,  we  may  be  required,  over  time,  to  make  site  or 
operational  modifications at our facilities, some of which might be significant 
and  could  involve  substantial  expenditures.  There  can be no assurance that 
material  costs  or  liabilities  will  not  arise  from  these  or  additional 
environmental  matters that may be discovered or otherwise may arise from future 
requirements  of  law. 
 
EMPLOYEES 
 
We currently have no employees other than our sole officer and director, who has 
not  been  paid for his services.  We do not have any employment agreements with 
our  sole  officer  and  director.  We  do  not  presently have pension, health, 
annuity,  insurance,  stock  options,  profit  sharing or similar benefit plans; 
however,  we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal 
benefits  available  to  our  officers  and  directors. 
 
Since  our  sole  officer  and  director  is  not  experienced  with  oil or gas 
exploration, we intend to retain qualified persons on a contract basis as needed 
from  time  to  time  to  identify,  evaluate and structure suitable oil and gas 
investment  opportunities.

Our  Board  of  Directors may declare and pay dividends on outstanding shares of 
common  stock  out  of funds legally available there for in our sole discretion; 
however,  to  date  no  dividends  have  been  declared or paid on common stock. 
 
PENNY  STOCK  REGULATION 
 
Our  shares  must  comply  with  the  Penny  Stock Reform Act of 1990, which may 
potentially  decrease our shareholders' ability to easily transfer their shares. 
Broker-dealer  practices  in  connection with transactions in "penny stocks" are 
regulated.  Penny  stocks  generally  are equity securities with a price of less 
than  $5.00.  The  penny  stock  rules  require  a  broker-dealer,  prior  to  a 
transaction  in  a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a 
standardized  risk  disclosure  document  that  provides information about penny 
stocks  and  the  risks  in  the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must 
provide  the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, 
the  compensation  of  the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, 
and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held 
in  the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require 
that  prior  to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special 
written  determination  that  the  penny  stock is a suitable investment for the 
purchaser  and  receive  the  purchaser's  written agreement to the transaction. 
These  disclosure  requirements  may  have  the  effect of reducing the level of 
trading  activity  in the secondary market for a stock that must comply with the 
penny  stock  rules.  Since  our shares must comply with such penny stock rules, 
our  shareholders  will  in  all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their 
securities. 
 
ITEM  6.     SELECTED  FINANCIAL  DATA 
 
We  are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act

ITEM  7.     MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS 
 
FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES. 
 
We  are  an exploration stage oil and gas company that has not begun operations. 
We  plan  to acquire undivided working interests in small exploration properties 
and  non-operating  interests  in  both  producing  and  exploration  projects 
throughout  the  United  States  and Canada. We do not presently own or have any

interest  in  any  oil  or  natural  gas  properties. 
 
We  have not earned any revenue since the date of our inception. Our capital has 
been  obtained via the issuance of common stock and shareholder loans. We do not 
presently  have  sufficient working capital to satisfy our cash requirements for 
the  next  twelve  months  of operations. Our director has undertaken to provide 
such  financing  as  may  be  required  to  maintain  nominal  operations. 
 
We  will  require additional financing to pursue our business plan. We expect to 
obtain  such  financing through the issuance of debt instruments and the sale of 
our  stock,  but  we  cannot  give  any assurance that we will be able to obtain 
additional  funding  on commercially acceptable terms when it is required. If we 
fail  to  obtain  the funding when it is needed, we may be required to forego or 
delay potentially valuable opportunities to acquire oil and gas interests, or we 
may  default  on  future  anticipated  funding  commitments to third parties and 
forfeit  or dilute our rights in future anticipated oil and gas interests, or we 
may  be  required  to  cease  operation  altogether. We do not have any plans or 
contingencies  in  the  event  that  we  cease  operating. 
 
On  November  25,  2009,  we  obtained an assignment of the conditional right to 
acquire  a working interest in certain natural gas properties located in Alberta 
(the  "Prospect") from the well operator (an independent third party), which was 
subject  to Thrust providing up to $1,000,000 in financing for the completion of 
wells  located  on  the Prospect. As consideration for the conditional right, we 
paid  a  total of $160,000 upon execution of the agreement, and were to issue 75 
million  common  shares  and  5  million  preferred shares upon receiving a 4.9% 
working  interest in wells to be completed on the Prospect. On January 22, 2010, 
the  well  operator  informed  us  that  we  were  in default of our contractual 
obligations. 
 
As  part  of our negotiations with the well operator, we agreed to pay a further 
$100,000  CAD  to  the  operator  in respect of the Prospect. We paid a total of 
$25,000  CAD  ($23,740)  to the operator on February 8, 2010, but were unable to 
make  any  further  payments.  The  payment  to  the  operator was financed by a 
director  of  the  Company. 
 
We  are  actively  pursuing recovery of our cash investment in the Prospect. The 
well  operator  is obligated to return $100,000 CAD to the Company by January 6, 
2011.  An additional $25,000 CAD is payable to us on demand without interest. No 
working  interest  or  any  other  interest  in the Prospect has been granted to 
Thrust Energy, and we are not pursuing the grant of any such interest related to 
the  Prospect.  As  a result of conservatism, we have written off and expensed a 
total  of $83,740  in costs relating to the acquisition of conditional rights to 
acquire  an  interest  in  the  Prospect. 
 
As  of  August  31, 2010, we had total assets of $94,960 comprised entirely of a 
cash  receivable  from the operator of the Prospect. This reflects a decrease of 
the  value  of  our  total  assets  from $177,741 on August 31, 2009, due to the 
write-off  of costs relating to the acquisition of conditional rights to acquire 
an interest in the Prospect. Working capital was reduced, as at August 31, 2010, 
to  $59,970  as  compared  to  $174,950  on  August  31,  2009. 
 
As of August 31, 2010, our total liabilities increased to $34,990 from $2,791 as 
of  August  31,  2009.  The  increase  was primarily due to a cash loan from our 
director. 
 
We  do not expect to purchase or sell any significant equipment nor do we expect 
any  significant  changes  in  the  number  of  our  employees. 
 
We  plan  to acquire undivided working interests in small exploration properties 
and  non-operating  interests  in  both  producing  and  exploration  projects 
throughout  North  America. 
 
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS 
 
We  posted  an  operating loss of $114,980 for the fiscal year ending August 31, 
2010, due primarily to $24,467 in professional fees and the write-off of $83,740 
in  costs associated with the acquisition of conditional oil exploration rights. 
This  was consistent with the operating loss of $114,921 for the previous fiscal 
year.

We  are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 
TO  THE  BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  STOCKHOLDERS  OF 
 
THRUST  ENERGY  CORP. 
(An  exploration  stage  company) 
 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Thrust Energy Corp. (an 
exploration  stage  company)  as  at  August  31,  2010 and 2009 and the related 
statements of stockholders' equity, operations and cash flows for the years then 
ended  and  the cumulative period from September 15, 2004 (date of inception) to 
August  31,  2010.  These  financial  statements  are  the responsibility of the 
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express an opinion on these 
financial  statements  based  on  our  audits. 
 
We  conducted  our  audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those standards require that we 
plan  and  perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a 
test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the overall 
financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a 
reasonable  basis  for  our  opinion. 
 
In  our  opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all  material  respects,  the financial position of the Company as at August 31, 
2010 and 2009 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years 
then ended and the cumulative period from September 15, 2004 (date of inception) 
to  August 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted 
in  the  United  States  of  America. 
 
The  accompanying  financial  statements have been prepared assuming the Company 
will  continue  as  a  going  concern.  As  discussed in Note 1 to the financial 
statements, the Company incurred losses from operations since inception, has not 
attained  profitable  operations  and  is  dependent  upon  obtaining  adequate 
financing to fulfill its exploration activities. These factors raise substantial 
doubt  about  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's 
plans  in  regard  to  these matters are also discussed in Note 1. The financial 
statements  do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of 
this  uncertainty.

THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
<PAGE> 
NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS 
 
Thrust Energy Corp. is engaged in the exploration, exploitation, development and 
production of oil and gas projects within North America.  We incorporated in the 
state  of  Nevada  on  September 15, 2004. Our principal offices are in Toronto, 
Ontario,  Canada.  Our  fiscal  year  end  is  August  31. 
 
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America with the on-going 
assumption  that  we  will  be  able  to  realize  our  assets and discharge its 
liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business. As shown in the accompanying 
financial  statements,  we  have  incurred  operating losses since inception and 
further  losses are anticipated in the development of our business. As of August 
31,  2010,  we have limited financial resources and require additional financing 
to  fund our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability 
to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  Our  ability  to  achieve  and  maintain 
profitability  and  positive  cash  flow is dependent upon our ability to locate 
profitable  mineral  properties,  generate  revenue  from  our  planned business 
operations,  and  control  exploration  cost.  These financial statements do not 
include  any  adjustments  to  the  amounts  and  classifications  of assets and 
liabilities  that  might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going 
concern.  Management  plans to fund its future operation by obtaining additional 
financing  and  commencing commercial production. However, there is no assurance 
that  we  will  be able to obtain additional financing from investors or private 
lenders. 
 
NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES 
 
Cash  Equivalents 
 
We  consider  all  highly liquid investments and debt instruments purchased with 
maturity  of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At August 31, 2010 and 
2009,  we  had  no  cash  equivalents. 
 
Use  of  Estimates 
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require 
us  to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and  liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of  the  financial  statements  and  the reported amounts of revenue and expense 
during  the  reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Concentration  of  Credit  Risk 
 
We  place  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  with high credit quality financial 
institutions  in  uninsured  accounts. 
 
Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments 
ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" requires an entity to maximize 
the  use  of  observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when 
measuring  fair  value.  ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the 
level  of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure 
fair  value.  A  financial  instrument's  categorization  within  the fair value 
hierarchy  is  based  upon  the lowest level of input that is significant to the 
fair  value  measurement.  ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that 
may  be  used  to  measure  fair  value: 
 
Level  1  - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 
Level  2  -  Inputs  other  than  quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
either  directly  or  indirectly  observable;  and 
 
Level  3  -  Unobservable  inputs  that  are  supported  by  little or no market 
activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the 
assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing. 
 
The  Company's  financial  instruments  include cash and cash equivalents, other

receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and due to a related party. 
Fair  values  were  assumed  to  approximate  carrying value for these financial 
instruments,  except where noted.  Management is of the opinion that the Company 
is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest  or  credit risks arising from these 
financial  instruments.  The  Company  is operating outside the United States of 
America  and  has  significant  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk due to the 
fluctuation  of  currency  in  which  the  Company  operates  and  U.S. dollars. 
 
Revenue  Recognition 
 
We  record  revenue  when title passes, delivery occurs to our customers and the 
customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, when the price is fixed and 
determinable,  and  when  collectability  is  reasonably  assured. 
 
<PAGE> 
NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED) 
 
Income  Tax 
 
We  recognize  deferred  tax assets and liabilities based on differences between 
the  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets and liabilities using the 
enacted  tax  rates  and  laws  that  are  expected  to  be  in  effect when the 
differences  are  expected to be recovered. We provide a valuation allowance for 
deferred  tax  assets  when  we  consider  realization of such assets to be less 
likely  than  not. 
 
Net  Loss  per  Common  Share 
 
We  have  adopted ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. ASC 260 requires the reporting of 
basic  and diluted earnings/loss per share. We calculate basic loss per share by 
dividing  net  loss  by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares 
during  the  period. 
 
Comprehensive  Loss 
 
We  apply  ASC  220, Comprehensive Income. ASC 220 establishes standards for the 
reporting  and display of comprehensive income or loss, requiring its components 
to be reported in a financial statement. For the years ended August 31, 2010 and 
2009  our  only  component  of  comprehensive  income  or  loss was the net loss 
reported  in  the  operations  statement. 
 
Foreign  Currency  Translation 
 
We  maintain  our  accounting records in U.S. Dollars.  At the transaction date, 
each  asset,  liability,  revenue  and  expense  involves  foreign currencies is 
translated  into  U.S. dollars by the use of the exchange rate in effect at that 
date.  At  the  period  end,  monetary  assets and liabilities involving foreign 
currencies are remeasured by using the exchange rate in effect at that date. The 
resulting  foreign  exchange  gains  and losses are included in operations.  Our 
currency  exposure  is insignificant and immaterial and we do not use derivative 
instruments  to  reduce  our  potential  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk. 
 
Oil  and  Gas  Activity 
 
We  follow the successful-efforts method of accounting for oil and gas property. 
Under this method of accounting, we capitalize all property acquisition cost and 
cost  of  exploratory and development wells when incurred, pending determination 
of  whether  the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not 
find  proved  reserves,  we  charge to expense the cost of drilling the well. We 
include  exploratory dry hole cost in cash flow from investing activities within 
the  cash  flow  statement.  We capitalize the cost of development wells whether 
productive  or  nonproductive. 
 
We  expense as incurred geological and geophysical cost and the cost of carrying 
and  retaining  unproved  property.  We will provide depletion, depreciation and 
amortization  (DD&A)  of  capitalized  cost  of proved oil and gas property on a 
field-by-field  basis  using  the  units-of-production  method based upon proved 
reserves.  In  computing  DD&A  we  will  take  into  consideration restoration, 
dismantlement  and  abandonment cost and the anticipated proceeds from equipment 
salvage.  When  applicable,  we  will  apply  the  provisions  of ASC 410, Asset 
Retirement  and Environmental Obligations, which provides guidance on accounting 
for  dismantlement  and  abandonment  cost. 
 
We  review  our  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  when  events or changes in 
circumstances  indicate  that an impairment may have occurred. In the impairment 
test we compare the expected undiscounted future net revenue on a field-by-field 
basis  with  the  related net capitalized cost at the end of each period. Should 
the  net  capitalized  cost  exceed  the  undiscounted  future  net revenue of a 
property,  we  will  write down the cost of the property to fair value, which we 
will  determine  using  discounted  future  net  revenue.  We  will  provide  an 
impairment  allowance on a property-by-property basis when we determine that the 
unproved  property  will  not  be  developed. 
 
Stock-Based  Compensation 
 
The Company adopted ASC 718, Compensation - Stock-Based Compensation, to account 
for  its  stock  options  and  similar  equity instruments issued.  Accordingly, 
compensation  costs  attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments 
granted  are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the 
expected vesting period.   ASC 718 requires excess tax benefits be reported as a 
financing  cash  inflow  rather  than  as  a  reduction  of  taxes  paid. 
 
We did not grant any stock options during the years ended August 31, 2010 and 
2009.

NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED) 
 
Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements 
 
In  June  2009,  the FASB issued a standard that established the FASB Accounting 
Standards  Codification  ("ASC")  which  mended  hierarchy of generally accepted 
accounting  principles  ("GAAP")  such  that the ASC became the single source of 
authoritative  nongovernmental US GAAP.  The ASC did not change current US GAAP, 
but  was  intended  to  simplify  user  access  to  all authoritative US GAAP by 
providing  all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one 
place.  All  previously  existing  accounting standard documents were superseded 
and  all  other  accounting  literature  not  included  in the ASC is considered 
non-authoritative.  New  accounting standards issued subsequent to June 30, 2009 
are  communicated by the FASB through Accounting Standards Updates.  The ASC was 
effective  for  the Company on September 1, 2009.  This standard did not have an 
impact  on  our  financial  statements. 
 
In  December 2007, FASB issued ASC 850 (prior authoritative literature: SFAS No. 
141(R),  Business  Combinations)  and  ASC  810-10-65  (prior  authoritative 
literature: SFAS No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interest in 
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  an  amendment  of  ARB  No. 51). These new 
standards will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business 
combinations  and non-controlling (minority) interests in consolidated financial 
statements.  ASC 805 and ASC 810-10-65 are required to be adopted simultaneously 
and  are  effective  for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 
December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company has adopted these 
new  pronouncements  on  September  1,  2009.  The  adoption  of  ASC850 and ASC 
810-10-65  did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or 
results  of  operations. 
 
In March 2008, FASB issued ASC 815-10 (prior authoritative literature: SFAS 161, 
Disclosures  about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of 
FASB  Statement  No.  133).  ASC  815-10  requires enhanced disclosures about an 
entity's  derivative  and  hedging  activities.  ASC  815-10  is  effective  for 
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after 
November  15,  2008  with  early application encouraged. The Company adopted ASC 
815-10  on  September  1, 2009. The adoption of this ASC did not have a material 
impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position  or  results  of  operations. 
 
In  April  2008,  the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful 
Life  of  Intangible  Assets , as codified in ASC subtopic 350-30, Intangibles - 
Goodwill and Other: General Intangibles Other than Goodwill (ASC 350-30) and ASC 
topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties (ASC 275), which amends the factors that must 
be  considered  in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine 
the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset 
under  SFAS  No.  142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , as codified in ASC 
topic  350,  Intangibles  Goodwill  and  Other (ASC 350). ASC 350-30 requires an 
entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of 
the  arrangement,  consistent  with  its  expected  use  of the asset, and is an 
attempt  to  improve  consistency  between  the  useful  life  of  a  recognized 
intangible  asset  under  ASC  350 and the period of expected cash flows used to 
measure  the  fair  value of the asset under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
Company  adopted ASC 350-30 on September 1, 2009. The adoption of ASC 350-30 did 
not  have  a  material  impact on the Company's financial position or results of 
operations. 
 
     In  May  2008, FASB issued ASC 470, Debt. ASC 470 specifies that issuers of 
     convertible  debt  instruments  that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
     (including  partial  cash  settlement)  should  separately  account for the 
     liability  and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity's 
     nonconvertible  debt  borrowing  rate  when  interest cost is recognized in 
     subsequent  periods. We have adopted ASC 470 on September 1, 2009, and this 
     standard  was  applied  on  a  retrospective  basis.  The  adoption of this 
     statement  did  not  have  a  material  effect  on  the Company's financial 
     statements. 
 
In April, 2009, the FASB issued ASC subtopic 820-10 (formerly Staff Position No. 
FAS  157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the 
Asset  or  Liability  Have  Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions 
That  Are  Not  Orderly). ASC 820-10 provides additional guidance for estimating 
fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have 
significantly decreased. This ASC subtopic also includes guidance on identifying 
circumstances  that  indicate  a transaction is not orderly. The adoption of ASC 
820-10 will not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. In 
April,  2009,  the  FASB  issued  ASC 820-10-50 (formerly Staff Position No. FAS 
107-1  and  APB  28-1,  Interim  Disclosures  about  Fair  Value  of  Financial 
Instruments)  that expands to interim periods the existing annual requirement to 
disclose  the  fair value of financial instruments that are not reflected on the 
balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  The  new  guidance  could  potentially require 
additional disclosures in interim periods after the Company's fiscal year ending 
2010.  Adoption  of  this  FSP  will not have a material impact on the Company's 
financial  statements. 
 
On April 1, 2009, the FASB issued ASC 320-10-65 (formerly Staff Position No. FSP 
FAS  115-2  and  FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary 
Impairments).  ASC 320-10-65 amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance 
in  U.S.  GAAP  for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to 
improve  the  presentation and disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on 
debt  and  equity securities in the financial statements. ASC 320-10-65 does not 
amend  existing  recognition  and  measurement  guidance  related  to 
other-than-temporary  impairments  of equity securities. The Company adopted ASC 
320-10-65 on September 1, 2009. The adoption of this FSP did not have a material 
impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

NOTE  2  -  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED) 
 
     Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements  and  Newly  Adopted Accounting Policies 
     (continued) 
 
In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. ASC 860 requires 
more  information  about transfers of financial assets, including securitization 
transactions,  and  where entities have continuing exposure to the risks related 
to  transferred  financial  assets.  It  eliminates the concept of a "qualifying 
special-purpose  entity,"  changes  the requirements for derecognizing financial 
assets,  and  requires  additional  disclosures.  It  also  enhances information 
reported  to  users  of  financial  statements by providing greater transparency 
about  transfers  of  financial assets and an entity's continuing involvement in 
transferred  financial  assets.  ASC 860 is effective for fiscal years beginning 
after  November  15,  2009. 
 
In  January  2010,  the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and 
Disclosures  (Topic  820):  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. 
ASU  2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10 to clarify existing disclosures, require new 
disclosures,  and  includes  conforming  amendments  to  guidance  on employers' 
disclosures  about  postretirement benefit plan assets. ASU 2010-06 is effective 
for  interim  and  annual  periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for 
disclosures  about  purchases,  sales,  issuances,  and  settlements in the roll 
forward  of  activity  in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are 
effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim 
periods  within  those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of 
ASU  2010-06  to  have  a  material  impact  on  its  financial  statements. 
 
In  February  2010,  The FASB issued ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events (Topic 855): 
Amendments  to  Certain  Recognition  and  Disclosure  Requirements. ASU 2010-09 
amends  Topic  855  to  exclude  SEC  reporting entities from the requirement to 
disclose  the  date on which subsequent events have been evaluated. In addition, 
it modifies the requirement to disclose the date on which subsequent events have 
been evaluated in reissued financial statements to apply only to such statements 
that  have  been  restated  to  correct  an  error  or  to  apply  U.S.  GAAP 
 
retrospectively.  The  amendments  are generally effective immediately, but with 
respect  to  the  requirement  that  conduit obligors evaluate subsequent events 
through  the date the financial statements are issued, the effective date is for 
interim  or  annual  periods ending after June 15, 2010. The Company has adopted 
ASU  2010-09  with  no  material  impact  on  the  financial  statements. 
 
ASU No. 2010-13 was issued in April 2010, and clarified the classification of an 
employee  share  based  payment  award with an exercise price denominated in the 
currency  of  a market in which the underlying security trades. This ASU will be 
effective  for  the first fiscal quarter beginning after December 15, 2010, with 
early  adoption  permitted.  The  adoption of ASU No. 2010-13 is not expected to 
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements. 
 
Other  accounting  standards  that  have  been issued or proposed by the FASB or 
other  standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date 
are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements 
upon  adoption. 
 
NOTE  3  -  WRITE-OFF  OF  GAS  WELL  OPTION 
 
On  November 25, 2009, the Company obtained an assignment of a conditional right 
to  acquire  a  working  interest  in  certain natural gas properties located in 
Alberta  (the  "Prospect")  from the well operator (an independent third party), 
which was subject to the Company providing up to $1,000,000 in financing for the 
completion  of  wells  located  on  the  Prospect.  As  consideration  for  the 
conditional  right,  the  Company paid a total of $160,000 upon execution of the 
agreement,  and  were  to issue 75 million common shares and 5 million preferred 
shares  upon  receiving  a 4.9% working interest in wells to be completed on the 
Prospect.  On  January  22, 2010, the well operator informed the Company that it 
was  in  default  of  its  obligations. 
 
As  part of its negotiations with the well operator, the Company agreed to pay a 
further  $100,000  CAD  to  the operator in respect of the Prospect. The Company 
paid  a  total of $25,000 CAD ($23,740) to the operator on February 8, 2010, but 
was  unable  to  make  any  further  payments.  The  payment to the operator was 
financed  by  a  director  of  the  Company. 
 
The  Company  is  actively  pursuing  recovery  of  its  cash  investment in the 
Prospect.  The  well operator is obligated to return $100,000 CAD to the Company 
by  January  6,  2011.  An  additional  $25,000 CAD is payable to the Company on 
demand  without  interest.  No  working  interest  or  any other interest in the 
Prospect  has  been  granted to the Company, and the Company is not pursuing the 
grant of any such interest related to the Prospect. As a result of conservatism, 
a total of $83,740 in costs relating to the acquisition of conditional rights to 
acquire  an  interest  in  the Prospect has been written off and expensed by the 
Company. 
 
NOTE  4  -  PREFERRED  AND  COMMON  STOCK 
 
We  have  100,000,000  shares  of  preferred  stock  authorized and none issued. 
 
We  have  900,000,000 shares of common stock authorized. All shares of stock are 
non-assessable  and  non-cumulative,  with  no  preemptive  rights. 
 
NOTE  5  -  RELATED  PARTY  TRANSACTION 
 
On February 8, 2010, the Company's sole director advanced the sum of $25,000 CAD 
($23,740)  on behalf of the Company to the operator of certain natural gas wells 
located  in  Alberta.  The  advance  has  been  recorded  by  the  Company  as a

non-interest  bearing, unsecured loan by our sole director to Thrust that is due 
and payable on demand. As of August 31, 2010, the entire principal amount of the 
advance  is  still  outstanding. 
 
NOTE  6  -  INCOME  TAXES 
 
At  August  31,  2010,  we  had  deferred  tax  assets of approximately $106,000 
principally  arising  from  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  for  income tax 
purposes.  As  our  management  cannot determine that it is more likely than not 
that  we  will  realize  the  benefit  of  the  deferred  tax asset, a valuation 
allowance  equal  to  the  deferred tax asset has been established at August 31, 
2010.  A  reconciliation  of  income  taxes at statutory rates with the reported 
taxes  is  as  follows: 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                                August 31, 2010  August 31, 2009 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Net loss before income taxes                   $       114,980   $      114,921 
 
Income tax recovery at statutory rates of 35%           40,243           40,222 
Unrecognized benefits of non-capital losses            (40,243)         (40,222)

The  significant components of the deferred tax asset at August 31, 2010 were as 
follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
At  August  31,  2010,  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 
$302,400,  which  expire  in  the  year  2026  through  2030.

ITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND 
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 
There have been no changes in or disagreements with our independent accountants 
since our inception. 
 
ITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
EVALUATION  OF  DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS  AND  PROCEDURES 
 
As  of  August 31, 2010, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and 
with  the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer 
and  Chief  Financial  Officer  (who  are  one  and  the  same  person),  of the 
effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure controls and 
procedures  pursuant  to  Exchange  Act  Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  Based solely on the material 
weaknesses  described  below,  our  Chief  Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer concluded that, as of August 31, 2010, the Company's disclosure controls 
and  procedures  were  not  effective: 
 
1.     The  Company  presently  has  only  one  officer,  who  is  also the sole 
director,  and  no  employees.  Inasmuch  as  there  is no segregation of duties 
within  the  Company, there is no management oversight, no one to review control 
documentation  and  no  control  documentation  is  being  produced. 
 
CHANGES  IN  DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS  AND  PROCEDURES 
 
There were no changes in disclosure controls and procedures that occurred during 
the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  have  materially  affected, or are 
reasonably  likely to materially effect, our disclosure controls and procedures. 
We  will  not  be  implementing  any  changes  to  our  disclosure  controls and 
procedures  until  there  is  a  significant change in our operations or capital 
resources. 
 
LIMITATIONS  ON  THE  EFFECTIVENESS  OF  CONTROLS 
 
Our  management,  including  our  CEO and CFO (who are one and the same person), 
does  not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent 
all  errors  and  all  fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and 
operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable,  not  absolute,  assurance  that  the 
objectives  of  the  control  system  are  met. Further, the design of a control 
system  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are resource constraints, and the 
benefits  of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the 
inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  no evaluation of controls can 
provide  absolute  assurance  that all control issues and instances of fraud, if 
any,  within  the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include 
the  realities  that  judgments  in  decision-making  can  be  faulty,  and that 
breakdowns  can  occur  because  of  a  simple  error  or mistake. Additionally, 
controls  can  be  circumvented  by  the  individual  acts  of  some persons, by 
collusion  of  two  or  more  people,  or by management or board override of the 
control. 
 
The  design  of  any  system  of  controls  also  is  based in part upon certain
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1343009/000130368110000176/tegc10k31aug1...

Page 15 of 19
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance 
that  any  design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential 
future  conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in  conditions,  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.  Because  of  the  inherent limitations in a cost-effective control 
system,  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
CEO  AND  CFO  CERTIFICATIONS 
 
Appearing  immediately following the Signatures section of this report there are 
Certifications  of  our  CEO  and  CFO  (who  are one and the same person).  The 
Certifications are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act  of  2002  (the Section 302 Certifications). This Item of this report is the 
information  concerning  the  Evaluation  referred  to  in  the  Section  302 
Certifications  and  this  information  should  be  read in conjunction with the 
Section  302  Certifications  for  a  more  complete understanding of the topics 
presented. 
 
MANAGEMENT'S  REPORT  ON  INTERNAL  CONTROL  OVER  FINANCIAL  REPORTING 
 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control  over  financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 
13a-15(f).  Our  internal control over financial reporting is a process designed 
to  provide  reasonable  assurance  to  our  management  and  board of directors 
regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting and the preparation of the 
financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  accounting 
principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America. 
 
Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those policies and 
procedures  that  (i)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail,  accurately  and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets  of  the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America,  and  that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only 
in  accordance  with  authorizations of management and directors of the Company; 
and  (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or disposition of the Company's assets that 
could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial  statements. 
 
Because  of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter 
how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human 
error  and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective 
internal  control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance 
with  respect  to  financial  statement  preparation.  Also,  projections of any 
evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are subject to the risk that 
controls  may  become  inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may  deteriorate. 
 
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial 
reporting  as  of  August  31,  2010.  In  making  this  assessment, it used the 
criteria  set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission  (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based solely on the 
material  weaknesses  described  below, our management has concluded that, as of 
August 31, 2010, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not 
effective.  Management  has  identified  the  following  deficiencies that, when 
aggregated,  may  possibly  be  viewed  as  a  material weakness in our internal 
control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  August  31,  2010: 
 
1.     We  do not have an Audit Committee - While not being legally obligated to 
have  an  audit  committee,  it  is our management's view that such a committee, 
including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control 
over  our  financial  statements.  To  date  we  have  not  established an audit 
committee. 
 
2.     Insufficient  documentation of financial statement preparation and review 
procedures  -  We  employ  policies  and  procedures  in  reconciliation  of the 
financial  statements and the financial information based on which the financial 
statements  are  prepared.  Notwithstanding, the controls and policies we employ 
are  not  sufficiently  documented. 
 
3.     We  did  not maintain proper segregation of duties for the preparation of 
our financial statements - As of August 31, 2010 the majority of the preparation 
of  financial  statements  was  carried  out  by  one  person.  Additionally, we 
currently  only  have one officer/director having oversight on all transactions. 
This  has  resulted  in  several  deficiencies  including: 
 
a.     Significant,  non-standard  journal entries were prepared and approved by 
the  same  person,  without  being  checked  or approved by any other personnel. 
 
b.     Lack  of  control  over  preparation  of financial statements, and proper 
application  of  accounting  policies. 
 
4.     We lack sufficient information technology controls and procedures - As of 
August 31, 2010, we lacked a proper data back-up procedure, and while backup did 
take  place in actuality, we believe that it was not regulated by methodical and 
consistent  activities  and  monitoring. 
 
CHANGES  IN  INTERNAL  CONTROL  OVER  FINANCIAL  REPORTING 
 
We  have  also  established  and  evaluated  our internal control over financial 
reporting,  and  there have been no significant changes in our internal controls 
or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to 
the  date of their last evaluation.  Nor have there have been any changes in our

internal  control  over  financial  reporting  during  the  last fiscal quarter. 
Except  as  set  out  below,  we  do  not intend to implement any changes to our 
internal control over financial reporting until there is a significant change in 
our  level  of  operations  and  capital  resources: 
 
1.     We will engage additional personnel to assist with the preparation of our 
financial statements; which will allow for proper segregation of duties, as well 
as  additional  manpower  for  proper  documentation. 
 
2.     We  will  engage  in a thorough review and restatement of our information 
technology  control  procedures,  in addition to procurement of all hardware and 
software  that  will  enable us to maintain proper backups, access, control etc. 
 
This  annual  report  does  not  include an attestation report of our registered 
public  accounting  firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. We 
are  not  required  to  provide  an  attestation report by our registered public 
accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 
 
DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
 
The  following  sets  forth  our  directors,  executive  officers, promoters and 
control  persons,  their ages, and all offices and positions held. Directors are 
elected  for  a  period  of one year and thereafter serve until the shareholders 
duly  elect  their  successor. Officers and other employees serve at the will of 
the  Board  of  Directors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Thomas Mills  CEO, President, CFO,       42      2005 to present 
              Secretary and a director 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Thomas  E.  Mills  serves  as  our  President, Secretary, Treasurer and our sole 
director.  From  2001  until 2004, Mr. Mills was the President of Torrent Energy 
Corp. (formerly, Scarab Systems, Inc.), an oil and gas exploration company.  Mr. 
Mills  was  a  director and executive officer of Kingston Mines, Ltd., a mineral 
exploration  company,  from  2005  to  2008.  Since 2003, Mr. Mills has been the 
President,  CEO  and  a  director  of  AMP  Productions  Ltd.,  a motion picture 
production  company.  In  2009,  Mr. Mills became the sole executive officer and 
director  of  Novagen Solar Inc., a company involved in the sale of photovoltaic 
products.  Mr.  Mills  maintains  a part-time legal practice to which he devotes 
not more than 25 hours per week.  Mr. Mills received his Bachelor of Laws degree 
from  the  University  of British Columbia in 1996, and holds a Bachelor of Arts 
degree  obtained from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario in 1992.  He 
was  called  to  the  Bar  of  British  Columbia  in  1997. 
 
All  directors  serve for terms of one year each, and are subject to re-election 
at  our  regular  Annual  Meeting  of  Shareholders, unless they earlier resign. 
 
There  are  no  material  proceedings to which any of our directors, officers or 
affiliates, any owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of any

affiliate,  or  security  holder  is  a  party  adverse  to  us  or  any  of our 
subsidiaries  or  has  a  material  interest  adverse  to  us  or  any  of  our 
subsidiaries. 
 
We  have  attempted and will continue to attempt to insure that any transactions 
between  us  and  our  officers,  directors,  principal  shareholders,  or other 
affiliates  have been and will be on terms no less favorable to us than could be 
obtained  from  unaffiliated  third  parties  on  an  arm's-length  basis. 
 
INVOLVEMENT  IN  CERTAIN  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS 
 
Except  as  noted  herein  or  below, during the last ten-(10) years none of our 
directors  or  officers  have:

Under  the  Securities  Laws  of the United States, the Company's Directors, our 
Executive  (and  certain  other) Officers, and any persons holding more than ten 
percent  of the Company's common stock are required to report their ownership of 
the  Company's  common stock and any changes in that ownership to the Securities 
and  Exchange  Commission.  Specific  due  dates  for  these  reports  have been 
established  and the Company is required to report in this report any failure to 
file  by  these  dates. 
 
All  of  these  filing  requirements  were  satisfied by the Company's Officers, 
Directors,  and  ten-percent  holders. 
 
In  making these statements, we have relied on the written representation of our 
Directors  and  Officers  or copies of the reports that they have filed with the 
Commission. 
 
COMMITTEES  OF  THE  BOARD 
 
All  proceedings  of the board of directors for the fiscal year ended August 31, 
2010  were  conducted  by  resolutions  consented  to in writing by our board of 
directors  and  filed  with  the  minutes  of  the  proceedings  of our board of 
directors.  Our  company  currently  does  not  have nominating, compensation or 
audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our company 
have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of 
directors  does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because 
it believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by 
the  board  of  directors. 
 
Our  company  does  not  have  any  defined policy or procedure requirements for 
shareholders  to  submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The board 
of  directors  believes  that,  given  the  stage of our development, a specific 
nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business 
operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not currently have 
any  specific  or  minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the board of 
directors  and  we  do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating 
such  nominees.  The  board  of  directors  will  assess all candidates, whether 
submitted  by  management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election 
or  appointment. 
 
A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by 
directing  a  written request addressed to our CEO, Thomas Mills, at the address 
appearing  on  the  first  page  of  this  registration  statement. 
 
AUDIT  COMMITTEE  FINANCIAL  EXPERT 
 
We  do not have a standing audit committee.  Our directors perform the functions 
usually designated to an audit committee.  Our board of directors has determined 
that  we  do  not  have  a  board  member  that qualifies as an "audit committee 
financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have 
a  board  member  that  qualifies  as  "independent" as the term is used in Item 
7(d)(3)(iv)(B)  of  Schedule  14A  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended,  and  as  defined  by  Rule  4200(a)(14)  of  the  NASD  Rules. 
 
We  believe  that  our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating 
our  financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for 
financial  reporting.  Our  board  of  directors  does  not  believe  that it is 
necessary  to  have  an  audit  committee  because  management believes that the 
functions  of  an  audit  committees can be adequately performed by the board of 
directors.  In  addition,  we believe that retaining an independent director who 
would  qualify  as  an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly 
and  burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our 
development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from 
operations  to  date. 
 
As  we  generate  revenue  in  the  future,  we  intend to form a standing audit 
committee  and  identify  and  appoint  a financial expert to serve on our audit 
committee. 
 
CODE  OF  ETHICS 
 
The  Company  has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that is 
applicable  to  our  principal  executive  officer, principal financial officer, 
principal  accounting  officer  or  controller,  or  persons  performing similar 
functions.  A  copy of our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers is filed 
as  an  exhibit  to  this  annual  report  on  Form  10-K. 
 
INDEMNIFICATION 
 
Under  our  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  Bylaws  of the corporation, we may 
indemnify  an  officer  or  director  who  is  made  a  party to any proceeding, 
including  a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in 
a  manner  he  reasonably  believed  to  be in our best interest. We may advance 
expenses  incurred  in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or 
director  is  successful  on  the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be 
indemnified,  we  must  indemnify  him  against all expenses incurred, including 
attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only 
for  expenses  actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and 
if  the  officer  or  director  is  judged  liable,  only  by a court order. The 
indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of 
the  State  of  Nevada. 
 
Regarding  indemnification  for  liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 
1933,  which  may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are 
informed  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission, 
indemnification  is  against  public  policy,  as  expressed  in the Act and is,

therefore,  unenforceable. 
 
ITEM  11.     EXECUTIVE  COMPENSATION 
 
To  date we have no employees other than our officers.  No compensation has been 
awarded,  earned or paid to our officers.  We have no employment agreements with 
any  of  our  officers.  We  do  not  contemplate  entering  into any employment 
agreements  until  such  time  as  we  have  proven  mineral  reserves. 
 
There  is  no  arrangement pursuant to which any of our directors has been or is 
compensated  for  services  provided  as  one  of  our  directors. 
 
There  are  no  stock option plans, retirement, pension, or profit sharing plans 
for  the  benefit  of  our  officers or directors.  We do not have any long-term 
incentive  plans  that  provide  compensation intended to serve as incentive for 
performance. 
 
ITEM  12.     SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND 
RELATED  STOCKHOLDERS  MATTERS 
 
The  following  table  sets  forth  certain information regarding the beneficial 
ownership  of our common stock as of August 31, 2010 by (i) each person known by 
us  to  be  a  beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of our issued and 
outstanding common stock; (ii) each of our Directors and executive officers; and 
(iii)  all  our  directors  and  executive  officers  as  a  group.

Unless otherwise noted, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole 
voting  and  investment  power  with  respect  to  all  shares  of  common stock 
beneficially  owned  by  them. For purposes hereof, a person is considered to be 
the beneficial owner of securities that can be acquired by such person within 60 
days  from  the  date  hereof,  upon  the exercise of warrants or options or the 
conversion  of  convertible  securities.  Each  beneficial  owner's  percentage 
ownership  is  determined  by  assuming  that  any  such  warrants,  options  or 
convertible  securities  that are held by such person (but not those held by any 
other  person)  and  which can be exercised within 60 days from the date hereof, 
have  been  exercised. 
 
ITEM  13.     CERTAIN  RELATIONSHIPS  AND  RELATED  TRANSACTIONS,  AND  DIRECTOR 
INDEPENDENCE 
 
On February 8, 2010, our sole director advanced the sum of $25,000 CAD ($23,740) 
on  our  behalf to the operator of certain natural gas wells located in Alberta. 
We  have  recorded the advance as a non-interest bearing demand loan by our sole 
director  to  Thrust.  As  of  August  31, 2010, the entire principal sum of the 
advance  remains  owing  to  our  sole  director. 
 
No  other  material  related party transactions between Thrust and its officers, 
directors  or  control  persons occurred during the fiscal year ended August 31, 
2010.

for  the audit of our annual financial statements included in this Annual Report

*    approved by our audit committee; or 
 
*    entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established 
     by the audit committee, provided the policies and procedures are detailed 
     as to the particular service, the audit committee is informed of each 
     service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the 
     audit committee's responsibilities to management. 
 
We  do not have an audit committee.  Our sole director pre-approves all services 
provided  by  our  independent  auditors. The pre-approval process has just been 
implemented  in response to the new rules. Therefore, our sole director does not 
have  records  of what percentage of the above fees were pre-approved.  However, 
all  of  the  above  services  and  fees  were reviewed and approved by our sole 
director  either  before  or  after  the  respective  services  were  rendered.
