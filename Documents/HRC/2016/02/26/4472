<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/6, 
in which the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was requested 
to prepare a study on challenges and best practices in the implementation of the 
international framework for the protection of the rights of the child in the context of 
migration, in consultation with relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>2. Written submissions were received from States, intergovernmental organizations, 
national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individual 
experts.1<b> </b>On 25 May 2010, OHCHR organized a one-day open-ended consultation on the 
issue of protecting the rights of the child in the context of migration. The results of that 
consultation, which included input from expert participants, States and other stakeholders, 
have informed the preparation of this report.<footnote name="2">9. This principle has very practical policy implications, requiring State authorities to 
guarantee in law and administrative practice the right of children on the move to participate 
and to provide adequate information to children, as well as providing appropriate forums in 
which children can exercise their right to be heard. Decisions should not be made, for 
example in respect of border control and return decisions or the delivery of social services, 
without consulting the affected children. In order to give effect to this right, in addition, it is 
vital that all relevant personnel are adequately trained in applying a child-sensitive 
perspective in their actions. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>3. The outcome document of the special session of the General Assembly on children, 
<i>A world fit for children</i>, pledged to build &#8220;a world in which all girls and boys can enjoy 
childhood &#8230; where their safety and well-being are paramount and where they can develop 
in health, peace and dignity&#8221;. Yet, to many migrant children, these laudable goals will 
sound hollow. Often the object of suspicion, neglect and abuse, children are locked up in 
immigration detention centres, denied access to essential services because of their or their 
parents&#8217; status and subjected to the same regimes of criminalization as adult migrants.  
</p>
<p>4. Children in the context of migration, including children left behind and children on 
the move,3 appear in the universal protected group of &#8220;children&#8221; at the same time as they 
are divided into a number of different legal categories.<b> </b>Article 1 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child defines a child as &#8220;every human being below the age of eighteen years 
unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier&#8221;. Children are also 
placed in a range of different categories of persons on the move, including refugees4, 
stateless persons,5 migrant workers or family members of such workers,6 trafficked persons 
or smuggled persons7 and separated or unaccompanied children.8 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The text of most submissions received can be found on the migration page of the OHCHR website. 
</p>
<p>Available from http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/migration/consultation/index.htm. 
 2 A report of this consultation, as well as the interventions of participants and other useful links can be 
</p>
<p>found on the migration page of  the OHCHR website (see footnote 1). 
 3 The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants has noted that &#8220;children on the move are 
</p>
<p>migrant children taking an active part in the migration process&#8221; (A/HRC/11/7). 
 4 &#8220;A person who &#8230; owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted on account of race, religion, 
</p>
<p>nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his 
nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that 
country&#8221; (art. 1A, Convention relating to the Status of Refugees). 
</p>

<p>5. As human mobility, including child mobility, has become more complex, 
movements can include elements of the search for protection entwined with the search for 
opportunity. Often these motivations will change along the migratory route, shifting 
children from one category to another. The challenge for the formulation and 
implementation of policy is to ensure that such categorization does not impede a human 
rights-based response to the assistance and protection needs of children in the context of 
migration. This report will concentrate on the international movement of migrant children 
in view of their particular vulnerability as non-nationals, while recognizing that a far 
greater number of children move within their countries, as internally displaced persons and 
internal migrants.9  
</p>
<p>6. Asylum-seeking and refugee children have particular international protection needs 
which must be identified and addressed. At the same time, it is necessary to bear in mind 
that children can have, and can acquire in the course of movement, a need for protection 
that is different from refugee status, but that is no less important. It is critical also to 
recognize and address in policy and practice the particular vulnerability of girl children to 
violence and discrimination within the context of migration. 
</p>
<p>7. Children are affected by migration in various ways: children are left behind by one 
or both parents who migrate; they accompany their migrating parents; and they migrate 
alone, independently of parents and adult guardians. Some children return to their countries 
of origin, either voluntarily or as the result of force. There are unfortunately limited 
statistics on the global movement of children10 and this lack of disaggregated data is one of 
many challenges in formulating and implementing child-sensitive migration policies.11<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>8. Both immigration and child-protection12<b> </b>legislation are employed to deal with the 
issue of migrant children. However, these standards are sometimes applied in a confusing 
</p>
<p>  
Organized Crime). Smuggling has been distinguished from trafficking and is defined as &#8220;the 
procurement in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit of the illegal 
entry of a person into a State Party of which the person is not a national or a permanent resident&#8221; (art. 
3(a), Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United 
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime). 
</p>
<p> 8 Unaccompanied children &#8220;have been separated from both parents and other relatives and are not being 
cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so&#8221;; separated children &#8220;have 
been separated from both parents, or from their previous legal or customary primary caregiver, but 
not necessarily from other relatives. These may, therefore, include children accompanied by other 
adult family members&#8221;. (Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 6 on treatment 
of unaccompanied and separated children outside their country of origin). 
</p>
<p><b> </b>9  Such children will require specific protection in the context of their displacement. See United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), <i>Overcoming barriers: Human mobility and development, Human 
Development Report 2009</i> (Basingstoke and New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009). 
</p>
<p> 10  The recent report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants notes that &#8220;there is no 
accurate statistical information on the number of children involved in the international migration 
process. Age is not a common variable of disaggregated statistical data on international migration&#8221; 
(A/HRC/11/7, p. 5). 
</p>
<p> 11  See Jeronimo Cortina and Bela Hovy, &#8220;Boosting Cooperation: UNICEF, UNDESA and SU/SSC 
Joint Studies on Migration&#8221;, <i>South-South in Action</i>, vol. summer 2009, pp. 3&#8211;5 (MediaGlobal, 2009). 
</p>

<p>or even contradictory manner, often letting immigration policies override child-protection 
exigencies and associated human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Normative standards that protect the rights of the child in 
the context of migration 
</b></p>
<p>9. International law first explicitly recognized the particular protection needs of 
children in 1924, when the Geneva Declaration on the Rights of the Child was adopted by 
the League of Nations. Subsequently, the core international human rights instruments13<b> 
</b>were developed, which contain general provisions that are applicable to children in the 
context of migration. All children are thus entitled to enjoy equal access to fundamental 
civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. The principal normative standards of 
child protection are equally applicable to migrant children and children implicated in the 
process of migration. Accordingly, international law provides that all such children be seen 
and protected as children first and foremost, rather than letting their migratory or other 
status, or that of their parents, dictate their access to protection and assistance. The 
Convention on the Rights of the Child is the primary normative standard in relation to 
children&#8217;s rights (see following section), in addition to which all the general provisions of 
international human rights law contained in the core human rights instruments are 
applicable to children. 
</p>
<p>10. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families contains specific provisions which protect 
children, including in relation to access to birth registration (art. 29) and to education (art. 
30). In addition, the Convention provides that when a migrant worker is deprived of liberty, 
the detaining State must pay attention to problems posed to their spouses and minor 
children (art. 17, para. 6). All migrant workers and members of their families are also 
protected from unlawful confiscation and destruction of their identity documents (art. 21), 
from collective expulsion (art. 22), and have the right to consular protection and assistance 
(art. 23).  
</p>
<p>11. Two conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) relate to the 
situation of migrant workers; the Migration for Employment Convention (Revised), 1949 
(No. 97) and the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (No. 
143). In addition, the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) and the Worst Forms of 
Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) specifically protect the rights of children who 
work. 
</p>
<p>12. The Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 protects the rights of 
child refugees and asylum-seekers. Although there is no specific mention of child refugees 
in this instrument, its provisions &#8211; including article 22 which requires States to extend to 
refugees equal treatment as nationals in regard to education &#8211; apply equally to the situation 
of children.  
</p>
<p>  
 13 These are: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; International Convention on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; Convention on the Rights of the 
Child; Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; 
and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  </p>


<p>13. The Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness of 1961 requires States to grant 
nationality to any person born on their territory if this person would otherwise be stateless 
(art. 1) and prohibits States from depriving persons of their nationality if such deprivation 
would render them stateless (art. 8).14 
</p>
<p>14. United Nations treaty bodies, as committees of independent experts that monitor the 
implementation of the core international human rights treaties, have provided authoritative 
guidance on the situation of children in the context of migration in the form of general 
comments, including general comment No. 6 on the treatment of unaccompanied and 
separated children outside their country of origin of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child.15 
</p>
<p>15. The special procedures mechanisms of the Human Rights Council have also 
addressed relevant issues within their thematic and country-specific mandates.16 Of 
particular importance is the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, who has recently issued a report on the situation of children in the context of 
migration (A/HRC/11/7).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. Also relevant to the situation of children in the context of migration are the Protocol 
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing 
the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.  
</p>
<p>17. At the regional level, the following instruments, among others, provide protection of 
the rights of the child in the context of migration: the African Charter on the Rights and 
Welfare of the Child; the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms; the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; the 
American Convention on Human Rights; and the Inter-American Convention on 
International Traffic in Minors. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The Convention on the Rights of the Child: General 
principles and definitions 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified international 
human rights treaty, with 193 States parties. It contains a comprehensive set of legally 
binding international standards, and elaborates on many of the general provisions contained 
in earlier instruments with specific reference to the rights of the child. The Convention 
applies to every child, regardless of categorization, or of his or her nationality or 
immigration status. This Convention is thus a key standard of protection for all children in 
the context of migration. 
</p>
<p>19. The Convention is supplemented by two Optional Protocols: the Optional Protocol 
on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Optional Protocol 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict. Both these instruments provide protection 
to children in the context of migration. 
</p>

University of Lan&#250;s, which compiles excerpts from concluding observations related to children, 
human rights and migration (2000&#8211;<footnote name="2">8. The right of all children to participate in matters and decisions which concern them 
informs every provision of the Convention, highlighting the principle of agency, and 
making clear that where appropriate children should be able to express their views, and to 
be heard in judicial or administrative proceedings affecting them (art. 12).

<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council. </p>


<p>20. Certain general principles underline the obligation of States to protect the rights of 
all children, and are of relevance to the situation of children in the context of migration.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>21. The principle of non-discrimination, as set out in article 2, paragraph 1, of the 
Convention provides that all rights contained therein are applicable &#8220;to each child within 
their [States Parties&#8217;] jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind&#8221;. This would include a 
prohibition on discrimination on the basis of nationality, immigration status or 
statelessness. Children should also be protected against discrimination or punishment on 
account of the status of their parents, legal guardians or family members (art. 2, para. 2). 
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has further elaborated that the 
&#8220;ground of nationality should not bar access to Covenant rights, e.g., all children within a 
State, including those with an undocumented status, have a right to receive education and 
access to adequate food and affordable health care.&#8221;17 
</p>
<p>22. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasized that discrimination, 
&#8220;whether it is overt or hidden&#8221; is an affront to the human dignity of children.18<b> </b>The 
Committee has addressed the issue of disparities that exist between especially vulnerable 
children (which would include children affected by migration) and other children, noting 
that these disparities often amount to de facto discrimination in the areas of health care, 
education and social services.19 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
has similarly noted that both direct and indirect discrimination will have an impact on the 
enjoyment of Covenant rights.20  
</p>
<p>23. Recognizing that, in some situations, such as in the context of certain political rights, 
limited distinctions can be made between nationals and non-nationals, the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has nevertheless stated that &#8220;differential treatment 
based on citizenship or immigration status will constitute discrimination if the criteria for 
such differentiation &#8230; are not applied pursuant to a legitimate aim, and are not proportional 
to the achievement of this aim&#8221;.21 The principle of non-discrimination thus prohibits 
distinctions that are unjustifiable, unfair or arbitrary. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The best interests of the child 
</b></p>
<p>24. The principle of the best interests of the child is derived from article 3, paragraph 1, 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that &#8220;in all actions concerning 
children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, 
administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a 
</p>
<p>  
<b> </b>17 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 20  on non-discrimination 
</p>
<p>in economic, social and cultural rights (art. 2, para. 2). The Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
specified that in view of the absolute nature of obligations deriving from the Convention and their <i>lex 
specialis </i>character, article 2 paragraph 3, of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
would not apply with regard to unaccompanied and separated children (see its general comment No. 
6). 
</p>
<p> 18 Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 1 on the aims of education (art. 29, para. 
1). 
</p>
<p> 19 Jaap E Doek, &#8220;The CRC General Principles&#8221;, <i>18 Candles: The Convention on the Rights of the Child 
Reaches Maturity</i> (Sion, OHCHR and Institut international des droits de l&#8217;enfant, 2008), p. 33. 
</p>
<p> 20  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 20.

<p>citizens. </p>


<p>primary consideration&#8221;. Accordingly, all authorities and institutions that come into contact 
with children in the context of migration are required to determine that their actions are 
primarily concerned with protecting the interests of the individual child. This principle 
should override all others, including conflicting provisions of migration policy should these 
arise. 
</p>
<p>25. It should be noted that the meaning of what constitutes the &#8220;best interest&#8221; will 
necessarily be different in different contexts, depending on the situation of the individual 
child. This makes it necessary to ensure that the individual circumstances of the child be 
taken into account when determining what is in his or her best interests, including his or her 
nationality, upbringing, cultural and linguistic background, vulnerability and particular 
protection needs. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has recommended that, in order 
to provide sufficient protection to children, the principle should be integrated into relevant 
legislation and be a core component of any decision-making process. The other general 
principles of child protection should be integrated into best interest determinations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to life, survival and development 
</b></p>
<p>26. The right to life of the child is a fundamental human rights standard (art. 6 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child). It has been interpreted to encompass but also go 
beyond physical survival, to include the development of the child &#8220;to the maximum extent 
possible&#8221; (art. 6, para. 2). Ensuring the non-discriminatory access of migrant children to 
economic, social and cultural rights and promoting the concept of leisure and play which 
encourage the fullest possible development of the child&#8217;s personality will allow for such 
development. Equally important will be protecting children in the context of migration from 
exploitation, detention and separation from their families in contradiction of their best 
interests. The development of irregular child migrants in countries of transit and destination 
can be severely affected by constraints on their rights or the rights of their parents. 
</p>
<p>27. Linked to the general principle of survival and development is the principle of 
evolving capacities (art. 5), which underlines the notion that the child is a full bearer of 
rights, respects the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and guardians, and links to 
the requirement that the age and maturity of the child be taken into account in decision-
making, particularly as their capacity to make decisions evolves.

</b></p>

<p>complaints procedures relating to exploitation and abuse in the workplace, and in the design 
and delivery of social services to migrant communities.22 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges in implementation 
</b></p>
<p>31. Children migrate in various ways with a variety of motives, yet the movement of 
children is usually considered within the framework of the migration of adults. The distinct 
interests, perspectives and vulnerabilities of children are thus discounted in the formulation 
of national migration policies and related legislation, since most of these policies operate 
under the assumption that all migrants are adults. On the other hand, most national 
childhood policies do not take account of the needs and rights of migrant children, who can 
be excluded explicitly or in practice from the protection of legislation and regulations put in 
place by Governments to protect children who are nationals of the country. Thus inadequate 
child protection systems and lack of effective implementation of the existing normative 
framework result in serious protection gaps for migrant children in every region of the 
world.  
</p>
<p>32. Children who migrate are also confronted by policies made on the basis of 
inaccurate and inappropriate assumptions. For instance, it is often assumed that all children 
who migrate independently have been subject to trafficking and therefore are in need of 
&#8220;rescue&#8221; and return to their countries of origin.23 
</p>
<p>33. Another general challenge relates to the inadequate recognition of the impact of 
immigration control policies on the protection situation of children in the context of 
migration. For example, when their parents are criminalized and subject to detention, 
exclusion or deportation, the children of irregular migrant parents will also suffer. The 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has asserted the principle that criminalizing 
irregular stay in a country exceeds the legitimate interest of States to control and regulate 
irregular migration, and can lead to unnecessary detention and encourage stigmatization, 
hostility and xenophobia.24 Moreover, there is a growing consensus that, while entering a 
State without a valid visa or overstaying a visa may constitute an administrative offence, it 
should not be considered as a criminal offence.25 
</p>
<p>34. Children, whether they migrate on their own or with their families, can be subject to 
high levels of physical, psychological and sexual violence within the migratory process.26<b> 
</b>Such violence is perpetrated inter alia by both State authorities and non-State actors, while 
the children are being moved by traffickers and smugglers, at the border, in detention and in 
the workplace. Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child protects all children, 
regardless of location or legal status, from torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading

</p>

<p>treatment.27 Yet, the vulnerability of migrant children is compounded when they are denied 
access to the courts in order to seek justice and remedies.28 
</p>
<p>35. Children and their families can be subject to xenophobia, racism, hate crimes and 
hate speech in host and transit countries, often bolstered by official policies which 
marginalize and exclude migrants and their communities and impede integration. The 
participation of children is particularly crucial in the design and implementation of effective 
integration policies in countries of destination, including programmes and campaigns 
against xenophobia and racism. 
</p>
<p>36. Human rights treaty bodies have on a number of occasions recommended that States 
should closely monitor and combat racism and xenophobia, and promote intercultural 
understanding and tolerance among all groups in society.29  
</p>
<p><b> A. Separated and unaccompanied children 
</b></p>
<p>37. Many separated and unaccompanied children have experienced significant trauma 
and violence in the course of their journey, some will have fallen into the hands of 
traffickers and some will be in need of humanitarian assistance owing to the conditions of 
their movement. Yet, many children who migrate on their own are denied access to legal 
and practical assistance and detained unlawfully. Unaccompanied children can be wrongly 
determined to be adult irregular migrants, and deported without the effective opportunity to 
seek asylum and in the absence of due process, and without regard for the rights of the 
child. 
</p>
<p>38. General comment No. 6 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child provides 
comprehensive guidance to States and other stakeholders on the protection of 
unaccompanied and separated children.30 This includes inter alia that all such children 
should be identified and registered as soon as possible following their entry into the host 
country, and a competent guardian or legal representative should be appointed, taking into 
consideration the views of the child. Those assigned legal guardianship duties, as well as 
any other person/s in charge of safeguarding the child&#8217;s best interests, should be provided 
</p>
<p>  
 27  Such a prohibition is reinforced by article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 7 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention against Torture. In a 
conclusion that applies equally to the situation of many migrant children, the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child has expressed its concern at the &#8220;ill-treatment, corporal punishment, torture and 
sexual abuse of children in detention facilities, and alleged instances of killings of children living 
and/or working on the streets by law enforcement officials&#8221; (CRC/C/15/Add.115, paras. 38-39). 
Article 19 of the related Convention, in addition, establishes a duty on States to protect children from 
violence and exploitation perpetrated by parents, guardians and other persons who are in a care-
providing role (such as employers). 
</p>

<p>with appropriate training and support to carry out their functions effectively.31 Under no 
circumstance should unaccompanied and separated children be refused entry to the 
territory.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Border controls 
</b></p>
<p>39. The border can be a dangerous place for migrant children, including separated and 
unaccompanied children. They can be subject to high levels of violence by border guards 
and arbitrary and prolonged detention, and can be denied the right to seek asylum. Children 
at borders are often regarded with suspicion by officials who cast doubt on their age and 
motivations for movement. 
</p>
<p>40. Interception practices at land, sea and air borders can be arbitrary and even unlawful, 
with entire groups of migrants, including unaccompanied and separated children, being 
pushed back to transit countries or countries of origin. The humanitarian needs of migrants 
in such circumstances, some of whom have been on the move for weeks or months, are 
ignored. Because of their heightened vulnerability, children will often suffer 
disproportionately. Equally seriously, protection needs can also be ignored, often with 
drastic consequences. 
</p>
<p>41. International law provides an absolute prohibition of refoulement, i.e., the return of 
anyone to a country where they would be at risk of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment,32 or the return of a refugee to any country in any manner whatsoever where his 
or her life or freedom would be threatened.33 All children should have access to an effective 
procedure to establish, in a child-friendly manner, the risk they would face if returned to 
their country of origin, or to any risk of &#8220;chain refoulement&#8221; (i.e. removal to third countries 
in which the person would be at risk of refoulement). This would include access to asylum 
procedures and procedures to establish whether they have been subject to trafficking and 
other serious human rights violations. Where appropriate, border authorities should 
promptly refer migrant children to child protection authorities and other relevant services. 
An independent guardian or legal advisor should be appointed promptly to advise and 
protect separated children.34 
</p>
<p><b> C. Age assessment 
</b></p>
<p>42. Despite the fact that the assessment of age can be the key to being protected as a 
child, many migrant and asylum-seeking children can be subject to inappropriate age 
determination techniques, which can interfere with their right to privacy and violations of 
their human dignity. The false belief that such techniques are an exact science can lead to 
serious errors35 and can place children at risk of refoulement, detention and denial of 
essential services.36 
</p>
<p>

</p>

 33 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, art. 33. 
 34 SCEP, p. 16. 
 35  Medical assessment methods, such as bone and teeth analysis, are associated with a margin of error of 
</p>
<p>at least two years in either direction. This can be compounded by cultural differences in recording 
age, and lack of documentary evidence. One report has noted that in some countries an official 
&#8220;culture of disbelief&#8221; pervades the issue of age assessment, putting the burden of proof on the child to 
prove that they are not adults. See Heaven Crawley, &#8220;When is a Child Not a Child? Asylum, Age 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>43. Recognizing the inherent limitations of such processes, general comment No. 6 of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommends that any age assessment procedure 
should take into account the psychological maturity of the individual in addition to physical 
and cultural factors.  
</p>
<p>44. Safeguards surrounding the issue of age assessment should include that such 
assessments only be carried out as a measure of last resort when the age of the individual is 
disputed, that the benefit of the doubt be given to the individual, that information about the 
process and possible consequences be provided to the individual in a child-friendly manner, 
that his or her informed consent be sought, and that the individual be protected from return 
while his or her age is being assessed. Age assessments should ideally be carried out by an 
independent panel of experts, and the individual should be given the effective opportunity 
to appeal the decision.37 
</p>
<p><b> D. Return 
</b></p>
<p>45. The issue of return and repatriation is high on the migration agenda in countries 
around the world. Children are caught up in collective expulsions, and can be returned to 
their own or transit countries in the absence of an individual determination of the 
lawfulness of this action or of the protection needs of the child. Returns of children can be 
carried out with high levels of violence and the disproportionate use of force. Returns can 
also lead to the separation of families, as parents are deported to countries of origin while 
their children remain in the host country. 
</p>
<p>46. Yet, the ability of States to return children in the context of migration is constrained 
by a number of factors. Most important in this respect is the principle of non-refoulement. 
The Committee on the Rights of the Child has asserted that return of a child should in no 
cases be contemplated to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that 
there is real risk of irreparable harm to the child. The Committee has advised that such a 
risk could originate from both State and non-State actors, be directly intended or as an 
indirect consequence of action or inaction, and has noted in addition that States should first 
conduct a risk assessment of the adequacy of food or health services to which the child is 
being returned (general comment No. 6). Moreover, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of migrants has recommended the principle of non-deportation of unaccompanied 
children. 
</p>
<p>47. The principle of the best interests of the child, in addition to accompanying 
principles such as the right of the child to be heard, should be a primary consideration in 
any decision to return, and in decisions on the deportation of their parents.  
</p>
<p>48. While recognizing that in exceptional situations the return of children can be 
contemplated, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasized that &#8220;non rights-
</p>
<p>  
Disputes, and the Process of Age Assessment, Immigration Law Practitioner&#8217;s Association&#8221; (May 
2007). 
</p>
<p> 36 One NGO has noted that &#8220;the very status of young immigrants as children is regularly challenged by 
national immigration control authorities&#8221; (Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented 
Migrants, <i>Undocumented Children in Europe: Invisible Victims of Immigration Restrictions</i> 
(Brussels, 2008), p. 6). Bhabha notes in addition that &#8220;these children&#8217;s youth is discounted because 
they are assumed to be &#8216;other&#8217; than &#8216;our children&#8217;; hardened and prematurely matured by their life 
experiences&#8221; (Jacqueline Bhabha, &#8220;&#8216;Un vide juridique?&#8217; Migrant Children: the Rights and Wrongs&#8221;, 
in Carol Bellamy and Jean Zermatten (eds.), <i>Realizing the Rights of the Child</i> (Ruffer and Rub, 2007), 
p. 209). 
</p>

<p>based arguments, such as those relating to general migration control, cannot override best 
interests considerations&#8221;.38<b> </b>This implies in turn that an effective mechanism to determine 
the best interests of the child should be in place before return can be contemplated. 
</p>
<p>49. International law prohibits collective expulsions, reasoning that there is a risk that 
such expulsions will be tainted with discrimination and arbitrariness, and will therefore be 
inherently unlawful.39 Article 22 of the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families specifically prohibits the collective 
expulsion of migrant workers and members of their families, and provides some safeguards 
in case of expulsion. Regional instruments, such as the Protocol No. 4 to the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, similarly prohibit the collective expulsion 
of non-nationals.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Detention 
</b></p>
<p>50. The absence of a child and adolescent perspective within migration-related detention 
policies means that children are often treated, and detained, as adults, including in punitive 
detention meant to deter future irregular arrivals. In some situations, children are placed in 
immigration detention as a substitute for care arrangements. 
</p>
<p>51. Children in immigration detention are often exposed to severely inadequate 
conditions, including deplorable living conditions, lack of adequate medical care (including 
psychological care), physical and sexual abuse and violence, overcrowding and inadequate 
nutrition. They can be detained along with unrelated adults, or arbitrarily separated from 
their parents or other family members. While all migrants can be detained in inappropriate 
facilities, such as prisons which house convicted criminals, children who are detained in 
immigration detention in addition rarely have access to adequate education, play and leisure 
facilities, and staff who are trained to respond to the specific needs of migrant children. 
Children in immigration detention will often be traumatized and have difficulty 
understanding why they are being &#8220;punished&#8221; despite having committed no crime.40  
</p>
<p>52. International law provides that the detention of children, including children in the 
context of migration, should generally be avoided.41 The Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of migrants has affirmed that it is never in the best interests of children to be 
detained.42<b> </b>Children should not be detained based on their migratory status or irregular 
entry to the country.43<b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. Where it is deemed to be absolutely necessary, children should only ever be detained 
as a measure of last resort, this detention must always be justified in law, and it must be for 
the shortest possible period of time.44 A maximum period of detention must be set in law. 
There should be a judicial review of the decision to detain, and the child must be able 
effectively to challenge the legality of their detention before a court or other competent 
body, and to have a prompt decision.45

<p>54. State authorities seeking to uphold the principle of family unity in situations of 
irregular migration should seek to address the situation of parents and families in ways that 
do not contemplate the detention of migrant children. The principle to be applied in such 
circumstances should be &#8220;care&#8221; rather than a punitive or disciplinary approach, and 
adequate alternatives to detention, such as community-based and casework-oriented 
models, should be contemplated in the first instance.46  
</p>
<p>55. The safeguards surrounding alternatives to detention should be as rigorous as those 
applied to situations of detention, including ensuring that the alternative measure is 
established in law, is non-discriminatory in purpose and effect, and is subject to judicial 
review, and that the migrant has access to legal counsel. States should always use the least 
restrictive means necessary as alternatives to detention. Particularly in the case of children, 
it is important to examine the effect that applying an alternative model will have on the 
rights and dignity of the individual; for example, children released from detention centres 
should be provided with appropriate alternative care, and not be left destitute on the streets.  
</p>
<p>56. In the rare instances where migrant children may be lawfully detained, international 
human rights standards assert that a number of fundamental safeguards must be applied. 
These are underlined by the principle that the migrant child must at all times be treated with 
humanity and dignity, in a manner which takes into account the particular needs of the 
child. Children must be allowed contact with their families and prompt access to legal 
counsel and interpretation. Adequate and culturally appropriate food, clothing and medical 
care should be provided in line with international standards, and every child must be able to 
access appropriate educational and recreation facilities. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Right to identity and the principle of family unity 
</b></p>
<p>57. Children born to irregular migrant parents often are not registered at birth.47 
Irregular migrants who do not possess valid identity documents can be denied the right in 
law to register their children in the host country, or will not register their children in 
practice because of fears of being detected by the authorities and deported as a result. 
Administrative and practical obstacles to birth registration also include lack of knowledge 
of the language used in birth registration forms and procedures, and high registration fees. 
This can have serious consequences for the individual child, and leave him or her 
vulnerable to human rights violations for many years if not addressed.  </p>
<p>58. Birth registration is the &#8220;official recording of the birth of a child by some 
administrative level of the State. It is a permanent and official record of a child&#8217;s 
existence&#8221;.48<b> </b>It is in addition an important means of securing other rights, such as the right 
to education and to health, to protection from child recruitment and from trafficking.49<b> 
</b>Children who are registered at birth can be protected from statelessness, and can also be 
protected from arbitrary actions by law enforcement authorities in host countries. 
</p>
<p>  
 46 See Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 6. For a study on alternatives to the 
</p>
<p>detention of children, see International Detention Coalition, &#8220;Children in Detention&#8221;. Available from 
http://idcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/children-in-detention.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 47 It is estimated that some 50 million births go unregistered each year, of which a significant proportion 
would be children born in the context of migration (Inter-Parliamentary Union, <i>Child protection: A 
handbook for parliamentarians</i> (SRO-Kundig, 2004), p. 42). 
</p>
<p> 48  Ibid., p. 42. 
 49 The Human Rights Committee has noted that birth registration can &#8220;reduce the danger of abduction, 
</p>
<p>sale of or traffic in children&#8221; (general comment No. 17 on the rights of the child). </p>


<p>59. The right to an identity has been recognized in articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Registering their birth is a critical first step in ensuring the rights of all children in 
the context of migration. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has made clear that the 
right to be registered immediately after birth extends equally to &#8220;asylum-seeking, refugee or 
migrant children &#8211; irrespective of their nationality, immigration status or statelessness&#8221;. In 
order to fulfil adequately the right of the child to birth registration, the State must record the 
birth in the relevant civil register, and provide the child with a birth certificate which 
includes all relevant information (including the child&#8217;s name, place of birth, and all 
available information concerning the child&#8217;s mother and father), ideally free of charge, and 
easily available to all without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>60. Birth registration can facilitate the reunification of separated children with their 
parents and family members. Article 9 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges 
States to ensure that children are not separated from their parents against their will. The 
principle of family unity has an important protective function for children in the context of 
migration, particularly in the situation of unaccompanied and separated children.50 Family 
reunification also constitutes a key element of integration policies.  
</p>
<p>61. Yet, it is apparent that regulations have become more severe in various countries, 
imposing new restrictions that make family reunification more difficult.51 The underlying 
assumption of policies in many States is that reunification should take place in the country 
of origin, yet general comment No. 6 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child makes 
clear that the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration, and 
reunification in the country of origin should not be pursued when there is &#8220;reasonable risk&#8221; 
that such a return would lead to the violation of fundamental human rights of the child 
(para. 82). Article 10 of the Convention establishes that reunification must always be 
considered in light of the best interests of the child. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Access to social services:</b>52<b> Health 
</b></p>
<p>62. Article 24 of the Convention provides that every child has the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation 
of health and urges States to &#8220;ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to 
such health care services&#8221;. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights notes 
the State obligation to respect the right to health by, &#8220;inter alia, refraining from denying or 
limiting equal access for all persons, including &#8230; asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, to 
preventive, curative and palliative health services.&#8221;53 In prohibiting discrimination based on 
nationality, the Committee notes, for example, that all children within a State, including 
those with an undocumented status, have the right to receive affordable health care.54 
</p>
<p>63. Migrant children can be prevented from gaining effective access to health care in a 
number of ways beyond express prohibition: high costs can make access unaffordable; the

<p>requirement of immediate payment or proof of payment can also impede access to the 
health service; the use of health care and services as an instrument of immigration control 
policies such as the duty to report undocumented migrants by health professionals; fear of 
deportation or detention of themselves or their families; and, finally, lack of information 
about migrant&#8217;s entitlements and guarantees in relation to health services and goods. A 
particular area of concern lies in the area of childhood immunization; many migrant 
children are unable to gain access to vaccinations in a timely manner, with long-term 
effects on their health. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Access to social services: Housing 
</b></p>
<p>64. Migrant children and their families can often be found living in substandard 
housing, whether because they cannot pay high rents, because their legal status prevents 
them from renting legally or because they have joined diaspora communities that live in 
run-down and spatially segregated parts of the city. Children who work, including domestic 
workers, may live in employer-provided accommodation which is overcrowded and 
unsanitary.55<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>65. Article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right of every 
child to a standard of living adequate for the child&#8217;s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and 
social development, and calls on States to provide material assistance and support 
programmes, particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that &#8220;the right to adequate housing applies 
to everyone&#8221; and that &#8220;individuals, as well as families, are entitled to adequate housing 
regardless of age, economic status, group or other affiliation or status and other such 
factors.&#8221;56<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>66. The Committee has expressed concern that migrant families are &#8220;disproportionately 
concentrated in poor residential areas characterised by low-quality, poorly maintained large 
housing complexes&#8221; and recommended the &#8220;effective implementation of existing legislation 
to combat discrimination in housing, including discriminatory practices carried out by 
private actors&#8221;.57 
</p>
<p>67. The European Committee of Social Rights has ruled that irregular migrant children 
should not be evicted from reception centres following failed asylum proceedings, 
observing that States are required to provide adequate shelter to all children in the territory, 
and that any other solution would run counter to the respect for their human dignity and not 
take account of the particularly vulnerable situation of children.58 
</p>
<p><b> I. Access to social services: Education 
</b></p>
<p>68. Children in the context of migration can face practical and legal obstacles to 
realizing their right to education. Fears that their irregular situation will be reported can 
deter enrolment, as can an inability to pay fees and buy uniforms and school materials. 
Migrant children can also face xenophobia and racism in the classroom, or pressure from 
their families to earn an income, leading to high dropout rates.

<p>69. In recognising the primary importance of education for the development and 
protection of children, the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides, in article 28, 
that primary education should be universally available for free &#8220;to all&#8221;, and that States 
should encourage the development of different forms of secondary education, including 
general and vocational education, making them available and accessible to every child. In 
addition, the Convention provides that educational and vocational information and guidance 
should be available and accessible to all children. Article 30 of the Convention on the 
Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which applies to all 
migrant workers and their families, regardless of their status, states that:  &#8220;each child of a 
migrant worker shall have access to education on the basis of equality of treatment with 
nationals of the State concerned. Access to public pre-school educational institutions or 
schools shall not be refused or limited by reason of the irregular situation with respect to 
stay or employment of either parent or by reason of the irregularity of the child&#8217;s stay in the 
State of employment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>70. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has called on States to 
&#8220;avoid segregated schooling and different standards of treatment being applied to non-
citizens on grounds of race, colour, descent, and national or ethnic origin in elementary and 
secondary school and with respect to access to higher education&#8221;.59<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>71. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has asserted that access to education is 
one of the special protection measures with which State parties are obliged to comply, also 
in the case of children in the context of migration.60 
</p>
<p><b> J. Migrant children and work 
</b></p>
<p>72. Just as most adult migrants are involved in some way in the world of work, a 
significant proportion of children on the move are working and will require protection. 
While some children migrate on their own in search of work, others will start working in 
the country of destination as a way of supporting their families, and still others will resort to 
work when their parents or primary caregivers migrate, leaving them behind. It is important 
to recognize that &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;exploitation&#8221; are not necessarily synonymous61 and that 
protecting the rights of children who work, alongside robust efforts to prohibit harmful 
work, could make for more effective policy. Such protection should include setting a 
minimum age for admission to employment (see below), protecting children from violence, 
upholding the right to education, safeguarding leisure and ensuring the right to health of the 
child including occupational health protections. 
</p>
<p>73. The ILO has adopted two conventions of relevance to the situation of migrant 
children who work. Convention No. 138 commits States to abolishing child labour and 
raising progressively the minimum age for admission to employment. It further states that 
the minimum age for employment should &#8220;not be less than 15 years&#8221; and that all children 
should be protected from hazardous work (which is defined as work &#8220;likely to jeopardise 
the health, safety or morals of young people&#8221;). The Convention on the Rights of the Child 
similarly requires States to specify a minimum age for admission to employment. ILO 
Convention No. 182 defines the worst forms of child labour, to which no child should be 
exposed, including forms of slavery, debt bondage, involvement in prostitution, and 
hazardous work. The latter has been interpreted to include &#8220;work for long hours &#8230; or work

</i></p>

<p>where the child is unreasonably confined to the premises of the employer&#8221;, which is 
intended to refer to domestic workers, or workers who live and work in factories and 
sweatshops.62<b> </b>All of the provisions of the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families apply equally to child migrant workers, 
even though the Convention does not explicitly refer to the situation of children who 
migrate on their own for work. 
</p>
<p>74. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on States to &#8220;regulate the 
working environment and conditions for adolescents who are working&#8221;.63 Further 
elaborating on this issue in general comment No. 12, the Committee notes that, in the case 
of working children who are younger than the age permitted by ILO Conventions: &#8220;they 
should be included in the search for a solution, which respects the economic and socio-
cultural constraints as well as the cultural context under which these children work&#8221;.64<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> K. Protection of children left behind in countries of origin 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants has stated that the term 
&#8220;children left behind&#8221; refers to &#8220;children raised in their home countries or in their countries 
of habitual residence who have been left behind by adult migrants responsible for them&#8221;.65<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>76. The impact of being left behind on children is hard to generalize, as some children 
will benefit from the migration of their parents, including those who receive remittances 
that enable them to go to school, improve their housing situation or access better health 
services. Others, however, could suffer destitution and official neglect, physical and sexual 
abuse from relatives and foster carers, and psychological trauma from the experience of 
being &#8220;abandoned&#8221; by one or both parents. Children left behind could suffer social 
stigmatization, debt and pressure from moneylenders and smugglers and be forced to take 
on social and family roles far beyond their age and maturity. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur has noted that a key factor in determining the impact of 
migration on children left behind will be the extent to which the responsible State has 
implemented specific child protection policies for such children.66 Targeted policies should 
address the socio-economic situation of such children, protect them from exploitation and 
violence (including domestic violence), and enable their voice to be heard. Where 
appropriate, the State should appoint a legal guardian for such children. 
</p>
<p>78. The situation of children left behind in the context of migration is also of relevance 
to family reunification policies in countries of destination. Where possible and in their best 
interests, States should enable children to join their parents who have migrated.67 Such 
reunification opportunities should not be contingent on the migration status of the parents.

</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child protects children from hazardous work and work that

provides similar protection.

<p><b> V. Recent practice, including joint efforts and strategies, to 
protect the rights of the child in the context of migration 
</b></p>
<p>79. Governments, international organizations, national human rights institutions, NGOs 
and other stakeholders have put in place a variety of initiatives at various levels to protect 
the rights of children in the context of migration.68 The following sections provide a brief 
and non-exhaustive overview of some recent practice in this regard.69 </p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>80. The following are examples of recent practice on general issues related to children in 
the context of migration: 
</p>
<p>(a) Article 40 of the Ecuador Constitution recognizes the right of all individuals 
to migrate, and provides that no person shall be identified nor considered as illegal due to 
his or her migration status; </p>
<p>(b) New legislation passed in New Zealand in 2009 (following a review of the 
Immigration Act) defines a child as a person under 18 years of age, in line with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The legislation also requires that children be given 
the opportunity to express their views and for these to be taken into account in proceedings 
affecting them; 
</p>
<p>(c) In 2006, Argentina put in place the Patria Grande regularization programme, 
which granted either temporary or permanent residence to a total of 776,742 undocumented 
migrants from the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) countries; 
</p>
<p>(d) The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs and the Special Unit for South-South Cooperation have 
created the United Nations Global Migration Database,<b> </b>which includes all publicly 
available data on international migrant stocks, separated out by age and sex as well as by 
country of birth and citizenship in order to facilitate research and policymaking on issues 
related to children in the context of migration. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>81. The following are examples of recent practice on economic, social and cultural 
rights: 
</p>
<p>(a) Trinidad and Tobago has established universal access to health care for all 
migrants in its territory. 
</p>
<p>  
observations, regularly called on States to facilitate family reunification in the best interests of the 
child. See, for example, CRC/C/15/Add.248, as well as section VII of general comment No. 6. 
</p>
<p> 68 Such initiatives are complemented by regional consultative processes (see IOM, &#8220;RCPs by Region&#8221; 
available from http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/policy-research/regional-consultative-processes/rcps-
by-region), and the multilateral Global Forum on Migration and Development at the international 
level. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>69  Many of the following initiatives are derived from input received for this study from States and other 
stakeholders. See http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/migration/consultation/index.htm for 
reference. See in particular UNICEF, Examples of Good Practice in the Implementation of the 
International Framework for the Protection of the Rights of the Child in the Context of Migration, 
(draft of 18 May 2010), also available on the migration page of the OHCHR website. </p>


<p>(b) In France the State Medical Assistance (<i>Aide M&#233;dicale de l&#8217;Etat</i>) allows 
irregular migrants and their children, who have been residing in France for more than three 
months and whose income is below a certain threshold, to access publicly subsidized health 
care upon compliance with certain conditions; 
</p>
<p>(c) There are explicit references to the right to education for irregular migrants in 
the legislation of Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, specific 
legislation regarding both primary and secondary school prohibits officials from 
investigating a child&#8217;s migration status before admission to school. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Detention 
</b></p>
<p>82. Below are examples of recent practice on detention of migrant children: 
</p>
<p>(a) In 2005, most children and their family members were released from 
Australian immigration detention centres and the Migration Act was amended to affirm &#8220;as 
a principle&#8221; that a minor should only be detained as a measure of last resort; 
</p>
<p>(b) In May 2010, the new United Kingdom Government announced an end to the 
policy of detaining migrant and asylum-seeking children in detention centres; 
</p>
<p>(c) Panama has included in its legislation a prohibition on detaining migrants 
who are less than 18 years of age; 
</p>
<p>(d) The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has explicitly included several 
alternatives to detention in its migration legislation including periodic reporting, directed 
residence and provision of bail (which takes account of the economic condition of the 
migrant). 
</p>
<p><b> D. National jurisprudence 
</b></p>
<p>83. The following show recent practice in national jurisprudence: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Constitutional Court of Spain has upheld the right of the child to be 
heard in the context of unaccompanied children facing repatriation or deportation;70<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(b) The High Court of South Africa (Transvaal Division) prevented the 
deportation in 2004 of a group of unaccompanied migrant children detained in a 
repatriation centre. The Court noted that the detention of such children was unlawful and 
should cease immediately, observing that &#8220;furthermore, the way in which these children are 
being deported is not unlawful, it is shameful&#8221;.71 
</p>
<p><b> E. Regional jurisprudence 
</b></p>
<p>84. Below are some examples of regional jurisprudence: 
</p>
<p>(a) In <i>FIDH v. France<b>,</b></i>72<b> </b>the European Committee of Social Rights examined a 
complaint based on articles 13 (right to health care) and 17 (rights of the child) of the 
European Social Charter, and held that legislation or practice which denies entitlement to 
</p>

<p>medical assistance to foreign nationals (particularly children), within the territory of a State 
Party, even if they are there illegally, is contrary to the Charter; 
</p>
<p>(b) In <i>Yean and Bosico v. Dominican Republic</i>,73 the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights pronounced on the situation of children born in the Dominican Republic to 
migrant parents in respect of birth registration and the right to education. The Court ruled 
that the migratory status of a person is not transmitted to their children, and that the 
discriminatory application of nationality and birth registration laws and regulations 
rendered certain children stateless, unable to access other critical rights to education, a 
lawfully registered name, and equal protection before the law.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Policy coherence at the national, regional and international levels 
</b></p>
<p>85. The following are recent developments in ensuring policy coherence at all levels: 
</p>
<p>(a) In 2003 a working group on the education of migrant children was set up by 
the Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture. This group includes all relevant 
ministries, international organizations, academic experts, NGOs, teachers, and directors of 
schools. The aim of the working group is to share best practices, exchange information, and 
coordinate actions in relation to migrant children; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Federal Migration Service of Russia has joined with the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), UNICEF and NGOs to provide social support to 
conflict-affected migrant children. Joint actions have been undertaken to provide 
humanitarian aid to child victims and create conditions for their social and psychological 
rehabilitation; 
</p>
<p>(c) Several Government agencies in Mexico (in particular the Foreign Ministry, 
the Migration Institute and the National Welfare Agency), together with international 
agencies, developed an integrated model of protection for unaccompanied migrant children 
through an inter-institutional roundtable on unaccompanied children and migrant women. 
In 2007, the Government of Mexico appointed 68 child protection officers; 
</p>
<p>(d) On 6 May 2010, the European Commission adopted the Action Plan74 on 
Unaccompanied Minors (2010&#8211;2014), which aims to increase the protection of 
unaccompanied children entering the European Union. The action plan includes a 
commitment to the standards of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, such as the 
principle of the best interests of the child, and highlights the need to support the 
development of child protection systems in countries of origin; 
</p>
<p>(e) The Council of the Baltic Sea States has established a network of national 
contact points who meet regularly in order to build systems to respond to the needs of all 
separated and unaccompanied children arriving in the region;75 
</p>
<p>(f) National human rights institutions in the Asian region adopted the Seoul 
Guidelines on 11 November 2008, during the International Conference on Human Rights 
and Multicultural Society. This document underlines specific actions to promote and 
protect the right of migrant workers;

<p>(g) UNHCR has developed the Guidelines on Formal Determination of the Best 
Interests of the Child76 in the context of its mandate, which provide practical guidance on 
how to determine the best interests of children. The best interests determinations are 
undertaken through the establishment of a determination panel, and through putting in place 
standard operating procedures; 
</p>
<p>(h) The Global Migration Group is a group of United Nations and other agencies 
which aims to encourage better coordinated approaches to the issue of international 
migration, including through mainstreaming human rights approaches to migration. The 
group places a specific focus on the impact of migration on children.77 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The protection of the rights of all children in the context of migration is a 
matter of utmost importance. While recognizing that children have particular 
vulnerabilities and needs and that they may be subject to discrimination, violence and 
abuse in the context of migration, the situation of children should not be artificially 
separated from that of their adult parents and families. The best way to protect the 
rights of the child in this context is to ensure that migration policies in general do not 
criminalize migrants, are non-discriminatory in purpose and effect, address the entire 
process of migration from a child and gender perspective, are premised on and 
respectful of human rights norms and standards, and are evidence-based and 
coordinated between all relevant stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> To this end, the High Commissioner recommends that effective measures are 
put in place in order to ensure the protection of the human rights of all children in the 
context of migration, including: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should integrate the rights and participation of children in the 
formulation, implementation and monitoring of all relevant legislation and 
administrative regulations, including childhood policies and plans on access to 
essential services, as well as migration policies. Where relevant, national human rights 
institutions and ombudspersons should be given a mandate to monitor, promote and 
protect the rights of children in the context of migration; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) All State officials and private personnel who come into contact with 
children in the context of migration, including border control authorities and 
personnel in detention centres, should be adequately trained to apply a child-sensitive 
and rights-based approach, which takes account of the specific vulnerability, needs 
and rights of children on the move. The principles of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child should be an integral part of this training; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) States should avoid and repeal laws and administrative regulations that 
require public officials (including in the fields of service provision, local police and the 
judiciary) to report the presence of irregular migrants to migration authorities, as 
well as legislation that criminalizes the provision of assistance to irregular migrants. 
States should take measures to ensure durable solutions to the situation of irregular 
migrant children, including consideration of regularization programmes, through an 
integrated and protective rather than punitive approach; 
</b></p>
<p>  
 76  UNHCR, <i>UNHCR Guidelines on Formal Determination of the Best Interests of the Child</i>, May 
</p>

<p><b>(d) States and other relevant stakeholders should prioritize the collection of 
age and gender-disaggregated data on the human rights situation of children in the 
context of migration, while ensuring that such data-collection activities are not used 
for immigration enforcement purposes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States should strive to achieve policy coherence on migration at the 
national, regional and international levels, including through ensuring coordinated 
child protection policies and systems across borders that are in full compliance with 
international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
