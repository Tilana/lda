<p>GE.10-14893 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
13/12, in which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) to present an annual report to the Council containing information on 
relevant developments of United Nations human rights bodies and mechanisms, as well as 
on the activities undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner at Headquarters and in 
the field that contribute to the promotion of and respect for the provisions of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p>2. Prior to resolution 13/12, the High Commissioner had submitted reports to the 
Council pursuant to its decision 2/102, in which it requested the Secretary-General and the 
High Commissioner to continue with the fulfilment of their activities, in accordance with 
all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the 
relevant reports and studies. Accordingly, reports on the rights of persons belonging to 
national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities were submitted under item 2 to the 
Council at its fourth (A/HRC/4/109), ninth (A/HRC/9/8) and tenth sessions (A/HRC/10/38 
and Add.1). 
</p><p>3. The present report contains an outline of the main activities undertaken in the course 
of 2009 and part of 2010 by OHCHR, both at Headquarters and in the field, to strengthen 
the promotion and protection of the rights of minorities pursuant to the Declaration on the 
Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. 
The report also provides a review of relevant developments arising from treaty-based 
bodies and special procedures.  
</p>
<p>4. The report describes the efforts made by OHCHR and the United Nations human 
rights machinery to strengthen the use of the Declaration. Adopted in 1992 by consensus by 
the General Assembly, the Declaration is the tool of reference in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities at national and international 
levels, and offers important guidance in efforts to advance minority rights within the United 
Nations and other forums. Given its specific standards on key issues, such as participation, 
the Declaration is an essential complement to minority-specific human rights treaty 
provisions, such as article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.   
</p>
<p>5. The activities summarized in the report demonstrate that particular efforts have been 
made by OHCHR, the independent expert on minority issues and the Forum on Minority 
Issues to contribute to the promotion and protection of the right of persons belonging to 
minorities. The fundamental nature of this right is such that, in many cases, other human 
rights can only be enjoyed or exercised if it is secured. As such, whether in the 
administration of justice, including law enforcement, or political participation, the right to 
effective participation is essential to the enjoyment of rights in accordance with the 
principles of non-discrimination and equality before the law. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights at Headquarters and in the field 
</b></p>
<p>6. The work of OHCHR in 2009 in relation to minorities was guided by the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Management Plan for the period 2008&#8211;2009. In this regard, 
particular focus was placed on the thematic area of anti-discrimination through effective 
participation of persons belonging to minorities, particularly in law enforcement institutions </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-14893 
</p>
<p>and decision-making. To that end, several capacity-building activities were held with a 
view to facilitate and increase the ability of minorities to draw on United Nations 
international and regional human rights bodies and mechanisms for the protection of their 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Policing and minority communities 
</b></p>
<p>7. A key concern of persons belonging to minorities is their right to participate in 
cultural, religious, social, economic and public life. Obstacles to the participation of 
minorities in the administration of justice, including law enforcement structures, can result 
in the overrepresentation of minorities as both victims and defendants in the criminal justice 
system. Contributing to increased participation of minorities in the administration of justice 
continues to be a priority for OHCHR. In order to improve the participation of minorities in 
law enforcement structures, such as the police, OHCHR has launched a series of 
consultations on good/effective practices in policing and minority communities.  
</p>
<p>8. The initial consultation in this area began with an expert meeting on integration with 
diversity in policing, organized by OHCHR in Vienna on 15 and 16 January 2008, in 
cooperation with the independent expert on minority issues, the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The expert meeting 
brought together senior police officials from Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and the 
Pacific, in addition to representatives of several international organizations, all of whom 
shared their experiences and made good practices recommendations on policing in minority 
communities (A/HRC/10/38/Add.1).   
</p><p>9. OHCHR continued its efforts to gather good/effective practices in policing and 
minorities in order to address the underrepresentation of minorities in the police and the 
deep alienation that often divides minorities and law enforcement representatives. To this 
end, during the Durban Review Conference, held from 20 to 24 April 2009, OHCHR 
organized a side event entitled &#8220;Durban commitments and minorities: policing in diverse 
societies&#8221;. The objective of the side event was to share information and raise awareness on 
effective measures to prevent racial discrimination and encourage participation in the police 
force of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. In 
addition to panel presentations, the side event included film clips from various regions, 
displaying innovative approaches to encourage the participation and involvement of 
representatives from minority communities in all aspects of policing, in accordance with 
several provisions of the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>10. A second consultation, on the same theme, entitled &#8220;Expert consultation on good 
practices in policing and minority communities in Africa&#8221; was organized by OHCHR in 
Johannesburg on 12 and 13 October 2009. Like the 2008 expert meeting, the consultation 
brought together high-ranking police officials from various countries of southern Africa, in 
addition to representatives of national human rights institutions and non-governmental 
organizations, to share and collect good practices. Building on the conclusions reached at 
the expert meeting, the Johannesburg consultation was an opportunity to identify additional 
good practices particularly relevant in the subregional context of southern Africa.  
</p>
<p>11. The participants in the Johannesburg consultation emphasized that policing by a 
representative police force that had developed effective relationships with minority 
communities could assist in maintaining public order, reduce levels of criminality and lead 
to greater communal cohesion. Experts underlined the fact that the police must exercise 
their functions through a human rights-based approach free of discrimination, and they 
considered various ways to ensure that the composition of police forces reflect the ethnic, 
religious and linguistic composition of the population at large. Participants also stressed 
that a shared understanding of problems and proactive communication between the police </p>


<p>GE.10-14893 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>and minorities in arriving at solutions designed to address crimes and other community 
issues remained essential to progress. 
</p>
<p>12. As the OHCHR initiative on policing and minority communities evolves, it is 
expected that the next consultation will offer an opportunity to gather additional effective 
practices in policing and minority communities. Once a broad range of effective practices 
covering both normative standards and operational approaches are assembled, they will be 
compiled and shared to assist in ensuring the participation and representation of minorities 
in policing.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sixth meeting of the Inter-agency Group on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>13. OHCHR hosted the sixth meeting of the Inter-agency Group on Minorities on 18 
May 2010. The Group aims to contribute to coordinated progress in the field of minority 
rights pursuant to article 9 of the Declaration, which calls on specialized agencies and other 
organizations of the United Nations system to contribute to the full realization of the rights 
and principles set forth in the Declaration within their respective fields of competence. In 
addition to several OHCHR staff members working in areas relevant to the Group, 
representatives of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 
ILO and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) also took part in the meeting.   
</p><p>14. The meeting of the Group offered, inter alia, an opportunity for the coordination of 
measures to improve the implementation of the Declaration. The measures discussed 
included:  
</p>
<p> (a) Encouraging agencies, programmes, funds and departments of the United 
Nations to support the implementation of recommendations arising out of the Forum on 
Minority Issues. To this end, IPU cited the organization, in accordance with a 
recommendation of the Forum, of an international conference entitled &#8220;Promoting inclusive 
parliaments: the representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in Parliament&#8221;, to be 
held in November 2010;  
</p>
<p> (b) The finalization of a publication entitled &#8220;Marginalized minorities in 
development programming: a UNDP resource guide and toolkit&#8221;, to respond to minority 
issues in development processes (the UNDP representative informed the participants that 
the guide had been completed and its launch and roll-out were being planned. It is expected 
that the guide will be used as a reference document in many agencies of the United Nations 
system); 
 (c) Follow-up to Council resolution 13/12 on the rights of persons belonging to 
national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. (Participants expressed their 
satisfaction that, in the resolution, the Council welcomed the interagency cooperation of 
United Nations agencies, funds and programmes on minority issues, led by the Office of the 
High Commissioner, and urged them to further increase their cooperation.); 
 (d) The revision, by participants, of draft terms of reference for the Group, to be 
adopted at its next meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Second session of the Forum on Minority Issues  
</b></p>
<p>15. Consistent with the concern regarding participation of persons belonging to 
minorities, and pursuant to Council resolution 6/15, the second session of the Forum on 
Minority Issues, held on 12 and 13 November 2009, focused on the issue of minorities and 
effective political participation. A key reference for the session was article 2 (2) of the </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-14893 
</p>
<p>Declaration, which provides for the right of persons belonging to national or ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities to participate effectively in cultural, religious, social, 
economic and public life.  
</p>
<p>16. The Forum was chaired by Barbara Lee, a Congresswoman and chairperson of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, a civil rights organization in the United States of America. 
The work of the Forum was also guided by the independent expert on minority issues, Gay 
McDougall. The session of the Forum was attended by representatives of United Nations 
mechanisms, bodies and specialized agencies, intergovernmental organizations, regional 
organizations and mechanisms in the field of human rights, academics, experts on minority 
issues and civil society representatives. More than 500 people were accredited to 
participate, including delegates from more than 45 States.  
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR provided substantive support to the Forum. In this regard, one of its 
contributions was a document on the work of OHCHR and human rights bodies regarding 
minorities and the right to effective participation (A/HRC/FMI/2009/5). The document also 
contained a description of thematic advice, capacity-building and field engagement 
activities carried out by OHCHR and aimed at advancing the right of persons belonging to 
minorities to participate in decision-making.  
</p>
<p>18. The Forum made thematic, action-oriented recommendations intended to increase 
the inclusion and recognition of minorities in decision-making processes, while enabling 
them to maintain their own identity and characteristics. The Forum submitted the 
recommendations made at its second session to the Council at its thirteenth session 
(A/HRC/13/25). 
</p><p>19. During the Forum, OHCHR organized, on 13 November 2009, a panel discussion 
entitled &#8220;The Minorities Declaration: challenges and opportunities&#8221;. The event brought 
together a panel of six experts that examined the extent to which regional organizations, 
civil society actors and other stakeholders had been using the Declaration as a tool and 
source of reference in their work. The event also offered an opportunity for the panellists 
and the other participants to identify positive examples and main obstacles relevant to the 
use of the Declaration. Proposals aimed at encouraging its wider use at the international, 
regional and country levels were also made. Most participants commented that the 
Declaration was imbued with legal authority by virtue of the fact that it is rooted in equality 
and non-discrimination, principles well established under international law and 
international human rights law. The need to use the Declaration more widely was also 
stressed. 
</p>
<p>20. On 11 November 2009, prior to the Forum, OHCHR and Minority Rights Group 
International organized a half-day preparatory workshop for civil society and other minority 
representatives. The purpose of the workshop was to provide a briefing for interested 
parties on substantive and procedural lessons learned from the first session of the Forum, in 
order to maximize the effectiveness of their participation in the second. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Capacity-building of civil society 
</b></p>
<p>21. With regard to the capacity-building of civil society, OHCHR continued its Minority 
Fellowship Programme in 2009, to empower representatives of minority communities by 
providing them with human rights training to enable them to better secure their rights at the 
national level through improved use of the United Nations human rights mechanisms. In 
2009, participants in the programme came from Australia, Costa Rica, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>22. The English-language fellowship lasted over three months and involved intensive 
training at OHCHR headquarters in Geneva. During the programme, the fellows attended </p>


<p>GE.10-14893 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>several briefing sessions on international human rights instruments and mechanisms, 
including introductions to the work of the Council and its universal periodic review 
procedure. They also benefited from lectures on the work of the treaty bodies and that of 
several special procedures. Briefing sessions were also organized for the fellows on the 
United Nations instruments and mechanisms devoted to minorities, including the 
Declaration, the work of the independent expert on minority issues and the Forum on 
Minority Issues. The fellows also had the opportunity to attend, as observers, many 
important sessions of human rights mechanisms, including the Durban Review Conference. 
</p>
<p>23. The 2009 and 2010 fellowship programmes also included training activities and 
workshops at other specialized agencies and several individual and group assignments, 
including the preparation of presentations on human rights issues in the fellows&#8217; respective 
communities or countries. They also prepared papers on the political participation of 
minorities in public life, which were used as background material for the second session of 
the Forum on Minority Issues. 
</p>
<p>24. The Arabic-language fellowship consisted of a one-month intensive training at 
OHCHR headquarters in Geneva. The fellowship amounted to a condensed version of the 
English-language programme, with participants being afforded the opportunity to 
participate in the second session of the Forum on Minority Issues together with a group of 
selected former English-speaking fellows. 
</p>
<p>25. The English-language minority fellowship programme for 2010 was held at OHCHR 
headquarters from 12 April to 11 June 2010. Like the 2009 programme, it provided 
intensive training to minority rights advocates, from Colombia, France, Nigeria and Sri 
Lanka. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Country engagement activities 
</b></p>
<p>26. OHCHR currently has a network of more than 50 field presences spanning five 
continents, and its country engagement increasingly includes activities that advance the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities. For example, in the Republic of Moldova, 
OHCHR, working with the country team, provided detailed comments on the country&#8217;s 
draft anti-discrimination law, to strengthen legal protections of minorities facing 
discrimination. Although the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had the 
lead in this area, OHCHR also held a series of consultations with officials from the 
Ministry of Justice engaged in the preparation of the draft law, with a view to assisting in 
the adoption of a comprehensive legal instrument prohibiting discrimination on various 
grounds. 
</p>
<p>27. In Iraq, OHCHR has been monitoring protection, especially in relation to respect for 
the principles of non-discrimination and equality before the law. The United Nations 
Assistance Mission for Iraq has been assessing the feasibility of addressing the concerns of 
minority communities through an integrated framework strategy with input from OHCHR. 
The strategy, which is to include specific proposals for activities by various components of 
the country team and Iraqi actors, will also address (a) the underrepresentation of minorities 
in the judiciary and law enforcement services; and (b) their overrepresentation among the 
victims of targeted attacks, abductions, security force misconduct and as subjects of 
criminal proceedings in certain regional areas. 
</p>
<p>28. OHCHR began a project on the promotion of the human rights of Afro-descendants 
in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Ecuador and Peru. Aimed at strengthening the 
institutional capacity of Afro-descendant organizations in the Andean region and to enable 
them to better defend their human rights, the project was launched with a national 
workshop and a regional human rights training session of trainers, which was held from 9 </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14893 
</p>
<p>to 12 February 2010 in Lima. Organized in collaboration with OHCHR field presences in 
Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Ecuador and the regional office in Chile, colleagues from 
other field offices in the region also participated in the two activities. A manual on the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities and a compilation of recommendations by treaty 
bodies on the promotion and protection of the rights of Afro-descendants in the three 
countries were prepared for the activity. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Concluding observations from treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>29. In exercising their competence to receive and consider initial and periodic reports<b> </b>of 
States parties, treaty bodies can enquire about measures being taken to protect minorities; 
make observations, particularly when such measures fall short of treaty obligations; and 
issue recommendations on improving compliance with treaty provisions. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Ninety-fifth session (16 March&#8211;3 April 2009) 
</i>30. In the Committee&#8217;s concluding observations for its ninety-fifth session, it expressed 
concern about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officials against racial 
minorities in Australia, as well as about the greater number of cases of discrimination 
against persons of Muslim background, despite measures taken by the State party to combat 
Islamophobia. 
</p>
<p>31. Regarding the report submitted by Sweden, the Committee welcomed the inclusion 
of a provision in the Constitution prohibiting discrimination by public institutions on the 
grounds of, inter alia, colour, national or ethnic origin, linguistic or religious affiliation. The 
Committee remained concerned, however, about manifestations of intolerance directed 
towards members of minority groups in school settings. 
</p>
<p><i>  Ninety-sixth session (13&#8211;31 July 2009) 
</i>32. At its ninety-sixth session, the Committee, in its concluding observations on the 
State report submitted by the United Republic of Tanzania, expressed concern that the State 
party did not recognize the existence of indigenous peoples and minorities on its territory. 
In its concluding observations on the State report submitted by the Netherlands, the 
Committee expressed concern at reports of discrimination against minorities in the 
workplace, including their recruitment and selection. 
</p>
<p>33. In relation to the State report submitted by Azerbaijan, the Committee expressed 
concern at the lack of information on minorities and the absence of clarification by the 
delegation about the steps taken to address other significant concerns, in particular the 
reduction in legal guarantees relating to the protection of minorities in the State party&#8217;s law 
on the State language (2002) and the absence of consultative structures for representatives 
of minorities in the nation. 
</p>
<p><i>  Ninety-seventh session (12&#8211;30 October 2009) 
</i>34. At its ninety-seventh session, the Committee expressed its concern at the sharp rise 
in apparent anti-Semitic incidents occurring in Switzerland, and at reports that the police in 
Geneva had not fully investigated the pattern of those incidents. It was also concerned at 
the generally low rate of minorities in the police force, despite the high percentage of </p>


<p>GE.10-14893 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>minorities in the population at large. The Committee called upon Switzerland to increase 
efforts to ensure that minorities are adequately represented in the police force. 
</p>
<p>35. In relation to the report submitted by the Republic of Moldova, the Committee 
expressed its concern at the lack of significant progress in the implementation of many of 
the Committee&#8217;s previous recommendations, including one relating to discrimination faced 
by minorities, such as the Roma. The Committee also recommended that the State party 
should strengthen its efforts to implement the Committee&#8217;s recommendations in this area. 
</p>
<p>36. In its observations on the State party report submitted by the Russian Federation, the 
Committee expressed its concern at the increasing number of reports of hate crimes and 
racially motivated attacks against ethnic and religious minorities, as well as persistent 
manifestations of racism and xenophobia in the State party, including reports of racial 
profiling and harassment by law enforcement personnel targeting foreigners and members 
of minority groups. The Committee was also concerned about the failure by the police and 
judicial authorities to investigate, prosecute and punish hate crimes and racially motivated 
attacks against ethnic and religious minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Forty-second session (4&#8211;22 May 2009) 
</i>37. At its forty-second session, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
encouraged Cyprus to strengthen its efforts to ensure that education in schools met the 
needs of a diverse society. The Committee also indicated that Cyprus should revise schools&#8217; 
curricula to include a better understanding of the contribution of communities and 
minorities to the State party&#8217;s history. 
</p>
<p>38. Pertaining to the report submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland, the Committee continued to be concerned about de facto discrimination 
experienced by some of the most disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups, 
such as ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. It expressed concern at the 
discriminatory impact of some counter-terrorism measures on the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights of certain groups, in particular ethnic and religious minorities, 
despite the State party&#8217;s commitment to adopt policies aimed at promoting integration, 
equal treatment and diversity. 
</p>
<p>39. In its concluding observations on the report of Cambodia, the Committee noted that 
primary education continued to be a problem for various ethnic minorities in the north and 
east of the country, where there are 20 minority languages spoken by these groups as their 
mother tongue, while the formal education curriculum has only used Khmer as the language 
of instruction. 
</p>
<p><i>  Forty-third session (2&#8211;20 November 2009) 
</i>40. At its forty-third session, in relation to the report submitted by Poland, the 
Committee continued to be concerned, in spite of the appointment of a plenipotentiary for 
equal treatment in April 2008, at the de facto discrimination experienced by some 
disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups, such as ethnic minorities. It 
remained concerned that Roma communities in the State party continued to face 
widespread discrimination in areas such as employment, education, land tenure, access to 
welfare benefits, housing and health care, which thus impairs the enjoyment of their 
economic, social and cultural rights. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-14893 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Seventy-fourth session (16 February&#8211;6 March 2009) 
</i>41. At its seventy-fourth session, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, in its concluding observations on the report of Bulgaria, remained 
concerned at the low levels of representation in public administration, specifically in the 
army and the police, of persons from certain minority groups, particularly the Roma. The 
Committee also expressed its concern at the practice of the State party of placing Roma 
children in schools for children with disabilities, and at the obstacles faced by the Roma in 
their access to work, housing, health care and education, cases of ill-treatment and the 
excessive use of force employed by the police against the Roma. 
</p>
<p>42. In the report submitted by the Congo, the Committee found that the State party had 
not included a legal definition of racial discrimination in its domestic legislation. The 
Committee recommended that the State party intensify efforts to establish harmonious 
inter-ethnic relations among various ethnic and cultural groups, especially those living in 
the north of the country. Regarding Croatia, the Committee remained concerned at the 
discrimination faced by the Roma, including in the fields of education, employment, 
housing, citizenship and political participation. It also observed that the Serb and Bosniak 
minorities faced similar difficulties to the Roma in gaining access to citizenship procedures. 
</p>
<p>43. In its concluding observations on the report submitted by Finland, the Committee 
welcomed the fact that the ombudsman for minorities had been transferred to the Ministry 
of the Interior as an independent authority. It expressed its concern at de facto segregation 
in the housing of Roma and immigrants, as well as the limited access of Roma to exercise 
their rights to education, employment and housing. 
</p>
<p>44. In assessing the State report of Montenegro, the Committee noted with concern that, 
despite efforts by the State party, many Roma children were not enrolled in school, nor 
were they completing higher education. It also found that the Roma faced discrimination in 
the spheres of education, employment, health care and social welfare. 
</p>
<p>45. With regard to the report submitted by Pakistan, the Committee observed that the 
State party had not yet adopted a law prohibiting caste-based discrimination, despite the 
persistence of de facto segregation and discrimination against Dalits in exercising their 
economic, civil, political and social rights. Another area of concern expressed by the 
Committee pertained to acts of violence against minority women, such as Baluchi women. 
It welcomed the efforts made to ensure adequate political participation of minorities, such 
as the reservation of seats for minority members in the National Assembly, and the 
introduction of quotas to admit members of minorities to Government services. 
Nevertheless, the Committee noted that minorities were considered only to encompass 
religious minorities, and that there was a lack of a specific policy or legislative framework 
to ensure the appropriate representation of all ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p>46. With regard to the report submitted by Turkey, the Committee, in its concluding 
observations, expressed concern that domestic laws resorted to restrictive criteria to 
determine the existence of ethnic groups. The use of such criteria to officially recognize 
certain groups as meeting the requirements to qualify as minorities, while denying the 
recognition of other groups as such, amounts to a practice that could give rise to differing 
treatment for various ethnic and other groups. This practice in turn could result in de facto 
discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms as stipulated in article 5 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. </p>

<p><i>  Seventy-fifth session (3&#8211;28 August 2009) 
</i>47. At its seventy-fifth session, in its concluding observations on Azerbaijan, the 
Committee expressed regret over the lack of current statistical data on employment with 
regard to members of ethnic minorities, and recommended that Azerbaijan should include 
such information in its next periodic report. It also expressed concern about the absence of 
consultative structures for representatives of minorities to give them a voice in the 
legislative process. The Committee also noted the lack of information on whether the 
Government was providing education and instruction in Armenian for ethnic Armenians 
living in Azerbaijan. 
48. In relation to the report submitted by China, the Committee expressed concern about 
the lack of statistical data available on the socio-economic status of ethnic minorities, and 
urged the Government of China to include such information in its next report. It also noted 
that China had not adopted a comprehensive law against racial discrimination, and 
recommended that such a national law should be adopted to combat discrimination on the 
grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. The Committee also expressed 
concern at reports of incentive systems for workers to settle in minority regions, which 
could substantially alter the demographics of these regions and negatively affect local 
traditions and cultures. The Committee also noted that the household registration 
requirement could give rise to de facto discrimination against ethnic minorities. 
</p>
<p>49. The Committee expressed concern at the fact that national policies in China on 
administrative detention and re-education through labour are being applied 
disproportionately in relation to members of ethnic minorities, and requested further 
information on this topic. It also recommended that the Government should increase its 
efforts to favour participation of all minority groups in public service, political life and 
economic growth, and take into account the relationship between ethnicity and religion, and 
ensure respect for the right of all ethnic groups to enjoy freedom of religion. 
</p><p>50. In its concluding observations on the report submitted by Greece, the Committee 
took note of the State&#8217;s definition of minority as being exclusively applied to the Muslim 
minority in Thrace. It called upon the Government to conduct research to assess the 
incidences of racial discrimination affecting all groups based on national or ethnic origin, 
and to take steps to eliminate such discrimination. In particular, the Committee requested 
more information about Turkish, Pomak and Romani groups that form the Muslim minority 
in Thrace, and about the measures the Government had taken to protect the identity and 
human rights of these groups. 
</p>
<p>51. The Committee also expressed concern about reports of forced dissolution and the 
refusal to register associations with words such as &#8220;minority&#8221;, &#8220;Turkish&#8221; or &#8220;Macedonian&#8221; 
in their titles. It was also concerned at the obstacles encountered by Roma and Turkish-
speaking persons, particularly in their access to employment, housing, health care and 
education. 
</p>
<p>52. The Committee expressed regret over the lack of statistical data on the rights 
enjoyed by ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples in the Philippines. It recommended 
that the State should use the 2010 census to include indicators, disaggregated by ethnicity 
and gender on the basis of voluntary self-identification, and include this information in its 
next report. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women

against Women considered the State report submitted by Armenia. In its concluding </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-14893 
</p>
<p>observations, the Committee expressed concern at the relatively high dropout rate from 
school of ethnic minority girls from rural areas, and noted the lack of information and 
statistics about, inter alia, women belonging to ethnic and religious minorities. 
</p>
<p><i>  Forty-fourth session (20 July&#8211;7 August 2009) 
</i>54. At its forty-fourth session, the Committee expressed regret at the lack of information 
and statistics concerning minority women in Japan, as well as the lack of any proactive 
measures, such as a policy framework, to promote their rights. It recommended that Japan 
should take effective measures, including the adoption of a policy framework and 
temporary special measures, such as appointing minority women representatives to 
decision-making bodies to combat discrimination against minority women. 
</p>
<p>55. The Committee also called for a comprehensive study on the situation of minority 
women in Japan, particularly from the Ainu, Buraku, Zainichi Korean and Okinawa 
communities. 
</p>
<p>56. The Committee expressed concern at persistent media stereotyping and negative 
portrayals of ethnic minority women in Switzerland. It recommended targeted measures for 
the media and educational system to promote a more positive image of ethnic minority 
women and women from migrant backgrounds. In relation to the report submitted by Spain, 
the Committee expressed concern about the lack of positive media portrayals of minority 
women, including Romani women and women with migrant backgrounds.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Fiftieth session (12&#8211;30 January 2009) 
</i>57. At its fiftieth session, in its concluding observations to the report submitted by the 
Republic of Moldova, the Committee on the Rights of the Child found that Romani 
children faced limited access to education, health care and an adequate standard of living. 
In its concluding observations on the report submitted by the Netherlands, the Committee 
urged the State party to ensure full protection against discrimination on the grounds of 
national and/or ethnic origin and, if necessary, to take affirmative action for the benefit of, 
inter alia, children belonging to minority groups. 
</p>
<p><i>  Fifty-first session (25 May&#8211;12 June 2009) 
</i>58. At its fifty-first session, in its concluding observations on the report submitted by 
Bangladesh, the Committee recommended that the State party should take the necessary 
measures to ensure that minority and indigenous children were not discriminated against in 
the enjoyment of their right to access basic and specialized health services. It also 
recommended that Bangladesh should consider making multilingual education available in 
remote areas for minority and indigenous children.  
</p>
<p>59. Regarding the report submitted by France, the Committee reiterated its 
recommendation that the State party review its position with respect to children belonging 
to minority groups and to consider withdrawing its reservation to article 30 of the 
Convention, as well as declarations with regard to articles 6 and 40. While welcoming the 
inclusion in school curricula of activities to counter racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia, 
the Committee expressed concern at cases of persistent discrimination hampering social 
progress, justice and non-discrimination, especially with respect to children residing in the 
overseas departments and territories, asylum-seeking and refugee children, as well as 
children belonging to minority groups, such as Roma, travellers (<i>gens du voyage</i>) and 
religious minorities.  </p>


<p>GE.10-14893 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>60. With regard to the report submitted by Mauritania, the Committee noted the lack of 
information on children belonging to minority groups. It urged the State party to provide 
information on the fulfilment of the rights of children belonging to minority groups in its 
next periodic report.  
</p>
<p>61. In its concluding observations on the report submitted by Romania, the Committee 
noted with regret that some of the recommendations contained therein had not been fully 
implemented, in particular those related to discrimination against children belonging to the 
Roma minority. It reiterated its recommendation that children belonging to national 
minorities should receive education in their mother tongue, or that the study of their mother 
tongue be made available to children belonging to a number of minorities, including the 
Roma.  
</p>
<p>62. Regarding the report submitted by Sweden, the Committee reiterated its previous 
concern that, despite the adoption of legislative guarantees, including the new anti-
discrimination act, the principle of non-discrimination was not fully respected in practice. 
The Committee expressed particular concern about de facto discrimination, xenophobia and 
racist attitudes towards children of ethnic minorities, refugee and asylum-seeking children 
and children belonging to migrant families. 
</p>
<p><i>  Fifty-second session (14 September&#8211;2 October 2009) 
</i>63. At its fifty-second session, in relation to the report submitted by Pakistan, the 
Committee expressed concern at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes and 
discrimination against children belonging to religious or other minority groups. In relation 
to the report submitted by the Philippines, the Committee reiterated its concern at the lack 
of disaggregated data by region, gender and age and at the insufficient data on children 
belonging to minorities and indigenous groups. 
</p>
<p><i>  Fifty-third session (11&#8211;29 January 2010) 
</i>64. At its fifty-third session, the Committee addressed concluding observations and

</p>
<p><b> 6. Committee against Torture 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Forty-second session (27 April&#8211;15 May 2009) 
</i>65. At its forty-second session, in its concluding observations on the report submitted by 
New Zealand, the Committee against Torture recommended that the State party should 
provide adequate training to the judiciary and law enforcement personnel that takes into 
account the obligation to protect minorities, and integrate a gender perspective into the 
discharge of their tasks. 
</p>
<p><i>  Forty-third session (2&#8211;20 November 2009) 
</i>66. At its forty-third session, the Committee considered the report submitted by the 
Republic of Moldova, and observed with concern reports of violence and hatred towards 
minorities, especially Roma, and other vulnerable groups in that country. In relation to the 
report submitted by Slovakia, the Committee expressed concern at reports of mistreatment 
of Roma by police officers during arrest and while in custody. It was also concerned about 
the high percentage of Roma children in schools for children with mental disabilities.  </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-14893 
</p>
<p><b> B. General comments from treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>67. At its forty-second session, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
adopted general comment No. 20, in which it provided guidance on the obligation of States 
parties to guarantee non-discrimination in the exercise of each of the economic, social and 
cultural rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. In its general comment, the Committee spells out various distinctions existing in the 
manifestations of discrimination, giving examples to identify formal from substantive 
discrimination, direct and indirect forms of differential treatment that can amount to 
discrimination under article 2 (2) of the Covenant, as well as discrimination in the private 
and public spheres. 
</p>
<p>68. Article 2 (2) of the Covenant lists race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status as the prohibited 
grounds of discrimination. In its general comment, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights provides that the inclusion of &#8220;other status&#8221; indicates that the list is not 
exhaustive and that other grounds may be included, such as membership of a group and 
multiple discrimination. According to the Committee, &#8220;other status&#8221; could include, for 
example, disability, age, nationality, marital and family status, sexual orientation and 
gender identity, health status, place of residence, or economic and social situation.  
</p>
<p>69. With regard to the implementation of article 2 (2) of the Covenant, in addition to the 
obligation to refrain from discriminatory actions, States parties are to take concrete, 
deliberate and targeted measures to ensure that discrimination in the exercise of Covenant 
rights is eliminated. States parties are encouraged to, inter alia, take temporary special 
measures to accelerate the achievement of equality; conduct human rights education and 
training programmes for public officials; and make such training available to judges and 
candidates for judicial appointments. 
</p><p>70. In its general comment No. 21, on the right of everyone to take part in cultural life 
(article 15, paragraph 1 (a), of the Covenant), the Committee stated that that right entails an 
obligation of States parties to recognize, respect and protect minority cultures as an 
essential component of the identity of States. Consequently, minorities have the right to 
manifest their cultural identity and membership (E/C.12/GC/21, para. 32).  
71. At its seventy-fifth session, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination adopted general recommendation No. 32 on the meaning and scope of 
special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination. This general recommendation is based essentially on the Committee&#8217;s 
extensive practice of referring to special measures under the Convention and earlier general 
recommendations, in particular general recommendation No. 8 on article 1, paragraphs 1 
and 4, of the Convention, general recommendation No. 27 on discrimination against Roma, 
and general recommendation No. 29 on article 1, paragraph 1, of the Convention. The 
Committee declared that general recommendation No. 32 was intended to provide practical 
guidance on the meaning of special measures under the Convention, to assist States parties 
in fulfilling their obligations under the Convention, including reporting obligations. 
</p>
<p>72. In general recommendation No. 32, the Committee discusses formal and de facto 
discrimination, direct, indirect and multiple discrimination, and provides further guidance 
on the scope of the principle of non-discrimination under article 1.1 of the Convention and, 
more importantly, on the meaning to be attached to special measures. According to the 
Committee, the list of human rights to which the principle applies under the Convention is 
not closed, and extends to any field of human rights regulated by the public authorities in 
the State party to address racial discrimination by any persons, group or organization. </p>


<p>GE.10-14893 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>73. With regard to special measures with an objective of advancing equality, the 
Committee asserted that the term &#8220;special measures&#8221; includes measures that, in some 
countries, may be described as &#8220;affirmative measures&#8221;, &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; or &#8220;positive 
action&#8221;, whereas the term &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; in the context of international human 
rights standards is a <i>contradictio in terminis </i>and should be avoided.  
</p>
<p>74. Under general recommendation No. 32, special measures include the full span of 
legislative, executive, administrative, budgetary and regulatory instruments, at every level 
in the State apparatus, as well as plans, policies, programmes and preferential regimes in 
areas such as employment, housing, education, culture and participation in public life for 
disfavoured groups, devised and implemented on the basis of such instruments. The 
obligation to take special measures is distinct from the general positive obligation of States 
parties to the Convention to secure human rights and fundamental freedoms on a non-
discriminatory basis for persons and groups subject to their jurisdiction; this is a general 
obligation flowing from the provisions of the Convention as a whole, and integral to all 
parts of it. Special measures should be appropriate to the situation to be remedied, be 
legitimate, necessary in a democratic society, should respect the principles of fairness and 
proportionality, and be temporary. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Special procedures 
</b>75. In discharging their tasks of monitoring, advising and reporting on human rights 
violations, mandate holders often address the promotion and protection of the rights of 
minorities, since they tend to be the most vulnerable and therefore most likely to fall victim 
to human rights violations. Although the mechanisms established for the special procedures 
by the Human Rights Council address either specific country situations or thematic issues 
in all parts of the world, the rights of minorities tend to be addressed more often by 
thematic mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Independent expert on minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>76. In fulfilling her mandate in 2009, the independent expert on minority issues 
conducted two official country missions, to Kazakhstan and Canada, to consult on minority 
issues and consider national legislation, policy and practice relating to national or ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities. In her guiding role in the work of the Forum on Minority 
Issues, she made a substantive contribution to the preparation of the second session of the 
Forum, which focused on the theme &#8220;Minorities and effective political participation&#8221;, 
submitting also a background document on minorities and effective political participation 
(A/HRC/FMI/2009/3). In the document, the independent expert discussed the right to 
effective participation as a fundamental human right affirmed in several key international 
legal instruments, and which underpins the realization of all human rights of women and 
men belonging to ethnic or national, religious and linguistic minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>77. In her report submitted to the General Assembly (A/64/159), the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief analysed the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to 
national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities with regard to their freedom of 
religion or belief. The Special Rapporteur emphasized that many religious minorities face 
various forms of discrimination, for example with regard to official registration procedures 
or undue limitations when disseminating materials and displaying religious symbols. 
Moreover, some religious minorities were adversely affected by manifestations of </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-14893 
</p>
<p>intolerance and threats or acts of violence perpetrated by non-State actors, which were often 
tolerated or encouraged by the authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance discussed the issue of poverty and racism in his report 
submitted to the Council (A/HRC/11/36). In this context, he recalled that the socio-
economic vulnerability of minorities was frequently the result of historical legacies, such as 
slavery across the American continent, systems of inherited status in other continents and 
also of systems of formalized and State-sponsored discrimination against minorities that 
had long been in place in many parts of the world. The Special Rapporteur argued that, 
because of the inaction of Governments, imbalances that had been historically created 
continued to affect minority groups profoundly, long after formalized discrimination had 
been dismantled. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that Member States should 
take special measures to foster the integration of racial or ethnic minorities in the areas of 
education, health, housing, the workplace and others. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>79. In his report submitted to the Council (A/HRC/11/4), the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression analysed the 
issue of the right of access to information in situations of extreme poverty. He noted that 
the poor, the unemployed and people belonging to ethnic minorities and other vulnerable 
groups remained excluded from full participation in the society in which they lived, and 
emphasized the need for access to information to be guaranteed as a means to secure 
participation and accountability. In order to address the exclusion of minorities and other 
vulnerable communities from the media, the Special Rapporteur urged Governments to 
deregulate the communications and media environment to allow free and fair information to 
flow more effectively.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its 
causes and consequences 
</b></p>
<p>80. In her report submitted to the Council (A/HRC/12/21), the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, asserted that bonded 
labourers mostly came from socially excluded groups, including indigenous peoples, 
minorities and migrants, who also suffered from discrimination and political 
disenfranchisement. She reported that indigenous and minority populations were more 
vulnerable to bonded labour because, in many countries, they had limited access to land for 
their traditional income-generating activities, such as cultivation or hunting, and that the 
issue of land ownership was closely linked to the phenomenon of bonded labour. ILO 
research had in fact shown a clear link in Asian countries between forced labour and long-
standing patterns of discrimination. In India, the overwhelming majority of bonded labour 
victims in agriculture, brickmaking, mining and other sectors were from scheduled castes 
and scheduled tribes. </p>


<p>GE.10-14893 <b>17

<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>81.<b> In 2009 and the first part of 2010, the main activities undertaken by OHCHR 
relating to the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to 
minorities were focused on improving access to decision-making and facilitating 
effective participation. With regard to effective participation, emphasis was placed on 
law enforcement structures, such as the police. Several activities were undertaken to 
increase the use of United Nations and regional human rights bodies and mechanisms 
through capacity-building among minority representatives. The country engagement 
of OHCHR increasingly included activities to advance the rights of persons belonging 
to minorities and to promote the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. The treaty bodies and special 
procedures have also paid close attention to the situation and rights of persons 
belonging to minorities. A number of special procedures mandate holders made 
important statements on the situation of minorities with regard to their enjoyment of 
various human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The independent expert on minority issues gathered information from various 
sources, in particular during her two official country missions, and she continued to 
play a guiding role in the preparation of the work of the Forum. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The second session of the Forum on Minority Issues emphasized the 
importance of the right to effective participation for minorities, as specified in the 
Declaration, and that the realization of the rights of minorities depended on their 
participation in government, the administration of justice, parliament, public bodies 
and public companies.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>As we approach the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration, it 
is important to begin a process of reflection on how common efforts can be 
consolidated to strengthen the protection of minorities all over the world, in particular 
through the use of the Declaration. As a key international document, it reaffirms the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities to enjoy all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and equality before 
the law. The Declaration also provides explicit guidance for the implementation of 
minority rights as it contains central guarantees to ensure that cultures, languages 
and other elements of the identity of persons belonging to minorities are protected and 
promoted, including through the implementation of the right to effective 
participation. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In 2010, it is expected the work of OHCHR and that of the treaty bodies and 
special procedures will further advance the implementation of the Declaration. 
Through its collection of effective practices in policing and minority communities, its 
minorities fellowship programme in addition to other activities at headquarters and in 
the field, OHCHR will continue to increase its activities contributing to the realization 
of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities.
