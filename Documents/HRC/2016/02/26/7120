<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Human Rights 
Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by the use of force, as enshrined in the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the applicability of international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law, in particular the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian

including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention1 are

reaffirming their obligations under articles 146, 147 and 148 with regard to penal sanctions, 
grave breaches and responsibilities of the High Contracting Parties,  
</p>

</p>
<p>of impunity, leading to a recurrence of violations and seriously endangering the 
maintenance of international peace,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that 9 July 2014 marked the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the advisory 
opinion by the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the construction 
of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and that no progress has been made on its 
implementation, and affirming the urgent need to respect and ensure respect for 
international humanitarian law and international human rights law in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i>Firmly convinced</i> that justice and respect for the rule of law are the indispensable 
bases for peace, and stressing that prevailing long-standing and systemic impunity for 
international law violations has created a justice crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
that warrants action, including accountability for international crimes,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the systematic failure by Israel to carry out genuine investigations in an 
impartial, independent, prompt and effective way, as required by international law, on 
violence and offences carried out against Palestinians by the occupying forces and settlers 
and to establish judicial accountability over its military actions in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the obligations of Israel as the occupying Power to ensure the welfare 
and safety of the Palestinian civilian population under its occupation in the West Bank, 
including East Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip, and noting Israel&#8217;s wilful abdication and 
rejection of its obligations in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the deliberate targeting of civilians and other protected persons and the 
perpetration of systematic, flagrant and widespread violations of applicable international 
humanitarian law and international human rights law in situations of armed conflict 
constitute grave breaches and a threat to international peace and security,  
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the massive Israeli military operations in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, since 13 June 2014, which have involved 
disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks and resulted in grave violations of the human 
rights of the Palestinian civilian population, including through the most recent Israeli 
military assault on the occupied Gaza Strip, the latest in a series of military aggressions by 
Israel, and actions of mass closures, mass arrest and the killing of civilians in the occupied 
West Bank,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> at the critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, 
including in particular the forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, 
the crisis in access to adequate water and sanitation services affecting nearly 1 million 
people, and the extensive damage to electricity infrastructure resulting in 80 per cent of the 
population receiving electricity only four hours a day, and underlining the importance of 
providing emergency humanitarian assistance to them and other victims,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the establishment of the Palestinian national consensus Government on 2 
July 2014 as an important step towards Palestinian reconciliation, which is crucial for 
achieving a two-State solution based on the pre-1967 borders and lasting peace, and 
emphasizing that the situation of the occupied Gaza Strip is unsustainable as long as it 
remains geographically, politically and economically separated from the West Bank, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the failure of Israel, the occupying Power, to end its 
prolonged occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in 
accordance with international law and relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest terms</i> the widespread, systematic and gross 
violations of international human rights and fundamental freedoms arising from the Israeli 
military operations carried out in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 13 June 2014, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-21/L.1

</b></p>
<p>particularly the latest Israel military assault in the occupied Gaza Strip, by air, land and sea, 
which has involved disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks, including aerial 
bombardment of civilian areas, the targeting of civilians and civilian properties in collective 
punishment contrary to international law, and other actions, including the targeting of 
medical and humanitarian personnel, that may amount to international crimes, directly 
resulting in the killing of more than 500 Palestinians, most of them civilians and more than 
100 of whom are children, the injury of more than 3,500 people and the wanton destruction 
of homes, vital infrastructure and public properties;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Condemns</i> all violence against civilians wherever it occurs, including the 
killing of two Israeli civilians as a result of rocket fire, and urges all parties concerned to 
respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and international human 
rights law;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls for</i> an immediate cessation of Israeli military assaults throughout the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and an end to attacks against all 
civilians, including Israeli civilians;  
</p>
<p>5. <i>Welcomes</i> the initiative of Egypt, supported by the League of Arab States, 
and calls for all regional and international actors to support this initiative in view of 
securing a comprehensive ceasefire; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately and fully end its 
illegal closure of the occupied Gaza Strip, which in itself amounts to collective punishment 
of the Palestinian civilian population, including through the immediate, sustained and 
unconditional opening of the crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods 
and persons to and from the Gaza Strip, in compliance with its obligations under 
international humanitarian law;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community, including the States Members of the 
United Nations, international financial institutions and intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations, as well as regional and interregional organizations, to provide 
urgently needed humanitarian assistance and services to the Palestinian people in the Gaza 
Strip, including by supporting the emergency appeal launched by the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East on 17 July 2014;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Expresses</i> <i>grave concern</i> at the rising number of incidents of violence, 
destruction, harassment, provocation and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers illegally 
transferred to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, against 
Palestinian civilians, including children, and their properties, and condemns in the strongest 
terms the resulting perpetration of hate crimes;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Expresses</i> <i>deep concern</i> at the condition of Palestinian prisoners and 
detainees in Israeli jails and detention centres, in particular following the arrest by Israel of 
more than 1,000 Palestinians since 13 June 2014, and calls upon Israel, the occupying 
Power, to immediately release all Palestinian prisoners whose detention is not in 
accordance with international law, including all children and all members of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians, 
emphasizes the continued failure of Israel to protect the Palestinian civilian population 
under its occupation as demanded by international law, and in this context calls for 
immediate international protection for the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law and international human 
rights law;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-21/L.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>11. <i>Recommends</i> that the Government of Switzerland, in its capacity as 
depositary of the Fourth Geneva Convention,1 promptly reconvene the conference of High 
Contracting Parties to the Convention on measures to enforce the Convention in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to ensure its respect in 
accordance with article 1 common to the four Geneva Conventions,3 bearing in mind the 
statement adopted by the Conference of the High Contracting Parties on 15 July 1999, and 
the Declaration adopted by the Conference on 5 December 2001;  
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> all relevant special procedures mandate holders to urgently seek and 
gather information on all human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, according to their respective mandates, and to include their 
observations in their annual reports to the Human Rights Council;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Decides</i> to urgently dispatch an independent, international commission of 
inquiry, to be appointed by the President of the Human Rights Council, to investigate all 
violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza 
Strip, in the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014, whether 
before, during or after, to establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of the 
crimes perpetrated and to identify those responsible, to make recommendations, in 
particular on accountability measures, all with a view to avoiding and ending impunity and 
ensuring that those responsible are held accountable, and on ways and means to protect 
civilians against any further assaults, and to report to the Council at its twenty-eighth 
session;  
</p>
<p>14. <i>Requests</i> the cooperation, as appropriate, of other relevant United Nations 
bodies with the commission of inquiry to carry out its mission, and requests the assistance 
of the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
this regard, including in the provision of all administrative, technical and logistical 
assistance required to enable the commission of inquiry and special procedures mandate 
holders to fulfil their mandates promptly and efficiently; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to report on the implementation of the 
present resolution, including on measures taken with regard to ensuring accountability for 
the serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-
seventh session; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
