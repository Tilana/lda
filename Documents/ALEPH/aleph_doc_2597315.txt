99.1 News Release
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and information
The information presented or incorporated by reference in this report contains both historical
information and “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
or “forward looking information” (within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws)
(collectively referred to herein as “forward looking statements”) that may state our intentions,
hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions for the future.
Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions
that, while considered reasonable by us at this time, are inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies that may cause our actual
financial results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or
implied herein and many of which are outside our control.  Forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions, including those set out herein, that may never
materialize, prove incorrect or materialize other than as currently contemplated which could
cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements.  The words “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “plan,” “may,” “could”
and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends,
which do not relate to historical matters, identify forward-looking statements.  Any such forward-
looking statements are not intended to provide any assurances as to future results.
Numerous factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the
forward-looking statements, including without limitation:
delay or failure by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (“Venezuela”) to make required
payments or otherwise honor its obligations under the settlement agreement (the
“Settlement Agreement”), between us and Venezuela with respect to the payment of
amounts awarded under the arbitral award (the “Award”) granted in favor of the Company
by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in respect of the Brisas
Project and the sale to Venezuela of the technical mining data related to such project for
use by the Mixed Company (as defined below);
the ability of the Company and Venezuela to successfully form and operate the jointly
owned company (the “Mixed Company”) for the purposes of developing the Brisas Project
and the adjacent Cristinas gold-copper project in a combined project (the “Brisas-Cristinas
Project”);
the ability of Venezuela to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms, if at all, to make
the required payments under the Settlement Agreement in a timely manner and/or to fund
the development of the Brisas-Cristinas Project by the Mixed Company;
the ability of the Company and Venezuela to obtain the approval of the National Executive
Branch of the Venezuelan government to provide tax and other economic benefits for the
activities of the Mixed Company;
our ability to successfully provide engineering, procurement and construction services to
the Mixed Company under the technical services agreement we expect to enter into with
respect to the Mixed Company, including our ability to identify and secure third party
service providers in Venezuela;
risks associated with exploration and, if adequate reserves, financing and other resources
are available, development of the Brisas-Cristinas Project (including regulatory and
permitting risks);
risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates and metal prices and metal
production volatility;
the concentration of our future operations and assets in Venezuela, including operational,
regulatory, political and economic risks associated with Venezuelan operations;
the potential for corruption and uncertain legal enforcement in Venezuela, including
requests for improper payments;
the potential that civil unrest, military actions and crime will impact our potential future
operations and assets in Venezuela;
our prospects in general for the exploration and development of mining projects in the
future and other risks normally incident to the exploration, development and operation of
mining properties;
our ability to satisfy the obligations under our outstanding notes and contingent value rights
following any payment by Venezuela under the Settlement Agreement, and any
subsequent distribution of remaining funds to our shareholders (subject in each case to the
payment of outstanding or incurred corporate obligations and/or taxes);
if Venezuela fails to make required payments under the Settlement Agreement and it is
terminated, our ability to resume our efforts to collect the Award and the timing and success
of that collection effort;
the costs associated with the enforcement and collection of the Award, including the costs
that we will incur in connection with the Settlement Agreement;
pending the receipt of payments under the Settlement Agreement, our ongoing liquidity and
capital resources and access to additional funding in the future when required;
continued servicing or restructuring of our outstanding notes or other obligations as they
come due;
shareholder dilution resulting from restructuring, refinancing or conversion of our
outstanding notes or from the sale of additional equity, if required;
our ability to maintain continued listing of its Class A common shares on the TSX Venture
Exchange;
value realized from the disposition of the remaining Brisas Project related assets, if any;
adverse U.S. and/or Canadian tax consequences;
abilities and continued participation of certain key employees; and
our long-term plan for identifying and achieving revenue producing operations in the future.
This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. See
“Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F filed
on www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov, respectively for additional risk factors that could cause
results to differ materially from forward-looking statements.
Investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and investors
should not infer that there has been no change in our affairs since the date of this report that
would warrant any modification of any forward-looking statement made in this document, other
documents periodically filed with the SEC or other securities regulators or presented on the
Company’s website.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.  All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on
our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this notice.  We disclaim any intent or
obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements or the foregoing
list of assumptions or factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,
subject to our disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. and Canadian securities regulations. 
Investors are urged to read the Company’s filings with U.S. and Canadian securities regulatory
agencies, which can be viewed online at www.sec.gov and www.sedar.com, respectively.
