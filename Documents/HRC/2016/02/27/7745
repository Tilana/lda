<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-fifth session 
</b>Agenda item 4 
<b>Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, Marzuki Darusman 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 22/13, decided to establish a 
commission of inquiry for a period of one year to investigate the systematic, widespread 
and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In the 
same resolution, the Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a period 
of one year, and designated him to be one of the three members of the commission of 
inquiry. The commission of inquiry was requested to submit a written report to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session. 
</p>
<p>2. Given that the commission of inquiry will be presenting its report to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session, the Special Rapporteur will submit his regular 
report to the Council at its twenty-sixth session, in order to take follow-up and subsequent 
developments into account.
