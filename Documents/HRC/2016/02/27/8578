<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 7/29 on the rights of the child adopted on 28 March 2008, the 
Human Rights Council decided to dedicate, at a minimum, an annual full-day meeting to 
discuss different specific themes on the rights of the child, including the identification of 
challenges in the realization of the rights of the child. In its resolution 10/14 on the 
implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols 
thereto, adopted on 26 March 2009, the Council decided to focus its next resolution and 
annual full-day meeting on the rights of the child on the fight against sexual violence 
against children.  
</p>
<p>2. The annual full-day meeting on the fight against sexual violence against children  
took place on 10 March 2010, and was aimed at raising awareness about sexual violence 
against children, reaffirming existing standards and commitments, highlighting good 
practices and lessons learnt from work over the years, as well as identifying key challenges 
and anticipating future work.  The full-day meeting consisted of two panels: the morning 
panel focused on manifestations of sexual violence against boys and girls while the 
afternoon panel was devoted to discussing protection of boys and girls from sexual 
violence: prevention and response. More than 60 States;  5 non-governmental organizations 
on behalf of other organizations dealing with rights of the child; the European Union; the 
Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) and UNICEF participated in the 
interactive dialogue following the morning and afternoon presentations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Manifestations of sexual violence against boys and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory remarks and statements by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>3. The morning panel was moderated by Alex Van Meeuwen, President of the Human 
Rights Council. The Director of the Human Rights Council and Special Procedures 
Division of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Bacre Waly Ndiaye, 
made introductory remarks, followed by presentations by: Marta Santos Pais, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children; Tim Ekesa, Director 
of the Kenya Alliance for the Advancement of Children; Manfred Nowak, Special 
Rapporteur on question of torture; Lena Karlsson, Director of the Child Protection 
Initiative, Save the Children; and Radhika Coomaraswamy, Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.   
</p>
<p>4. In his introductory remarks, Mr. Ndiaye said that of all forms of violence against 
children, sexual violence was unquestionably one of the most repugnant. Children were 
physically hurt and mentally scarred in the most terrible way, with lifelong consequences. 
The panel would address the root causes of sexual violence in the five settings in which 
childhood was spent, namely home, schools, care and justice systems, workplaces and the 
community, and would additionally focus on sexual violence against children in conflict 
situations, emergencies and disasters. He highlighted some recent progress regarding 
children in conflict situations including Security Council resolution 1882 (2009), which 
reiterated that sexual violence against children during conflict would no longer be tolerated, 
and requested the Secretary-General to list, in his annual report to the Security Council,  
parties to armed conflict that engage in patterns of rape and other sexual violence against 
children in armed conflict, as well as the establishment of the mandate of Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence against Women in Armed 
Conflict recently entrusted to Margot Wallstr&#246;m. He also described the process leading to 
the United Nations study on violence against children and its recommendations and </p>


<p>welcomed the participation of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
Violence against Children.    
</p>
<p>5. Mr. Ndiaye referred to the recent commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, at which the persisting challenges to its full 
implementation were noted, including in ensuring the dignity of the child; in providing the 
child with full possibilities for development; and in facilitating dialogue between adults and 
children. He also recalled that child participants to the event focused also on issues 
affecting the dignity of children, and in particular sexual exploitation and abuse. They 
issued a number of recommendations which also included a request for an integrated 
approach to prevention of and protection from abuse and sexual and economic exploitation 
of girls and boys, based on the rights of the child. In May 2010 we would celebrate the 
tenth anniversary of the adoption of the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on, respectively, the involvement of children in armed conflict, and on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. It would be ideal to reach 
universal ratification of both Optional Protocols by 2012, the tenth anniversary of their 
entry into force.   
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Ndiaye added that an Open-ended Working Group of the Human Rights Council 
was now working on the possibility of elaborating an Optional Protocol to the Convention 
that would introduce a communications procedure for the rights the child. This mechanism 
could further strengthen the protection of children&#8217;s rights, including with regard to sexual 
violence. He concluded his remarks by stating that the discussion should contribute to 
developing a more holistic understanding of the various manifestations of this under-
recognized problem, and of effective modalities of addressing it with a child rights-based 
approach. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Representative of the Secretary General on Violence against Children, 
Ms. Santos Pais, focused her presentation on sexual violence against children in the family 
and the community. She said the family was the natural environment for the development 
and well-being of the child. For many children, however, the daily reality was one of 
neglect and trauma as they witnessed or endured domestic violence and ill treatment and 
abuse, including sexual violence, very often behind a curtain of silence and social 
indifference. Ms. Santos Pais said that girls appeared to be at greater risk of sexual violence 
and forced and early marriage, which in itself is a form of sexual violence. Up to one third 
of adolescent girls report their first sexual experience as being forced. Although less 
frequently acknowledged, sexual violence against boys was also a significant problem, 
including within the home. She emphasized that sexual violence has a dramatic and lasting 
impact on children's physical and emotional health, on their development and education, 
and is also linked to other forms of violence, including trafficking. Sexual violence also 
negatively affects the social well-being of victims, as they are often blamed, coerced to 
keep silent, and stigmatized and marginalized by their families and communities.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Representative underlined that sexual violence was a particularly 
difficult topic to survey as a result of its sensitive nature. Available data was scanty and 
fragmented, national studies were scarce, and reporting remained weak and difficult. In the 
case of sexual violence within the home, the pressure to conceal it was particularly strong, 
with shame, secrecy and denial leading to a pervasive culture of silence.  
</p>
<p>9. She described the experience of a national survey conducted in Swaziland, as a 
follow-up to the United Nations Study on violence against children. The finding of the 
survey helped to break the silence around violence and contributed to the development of a 
national strategy to effectively prevent and address it. This study underscored the 
importance for each country to develop a strategic agenda to prevent and address sexual 
violence. Key dimensions of this strategy should include:  solid data and research; the 
identification of underlying causes and groups of children who may be at greater risk; </p>


<p>strong and explicit legislation to combat violence; and accessible, child-sensitive 
counselling, and complaints and investigation mechanisms to address sexual violence and 
to provide redress and assistance to victims. In all regions, significant experiences led her to 
conclude that there is a widely shared commitment to build a strong protective environment 
for children, an environment where violence and sexual violence had no place.  
</p>
<p>10. The Director of the Kenya Alliance for the Advancement of Children, Tim Ekesa, in 
his presentation on sexual violence in schools, said that although schools should be 
particularly safe places for children, teachers have been often found to engage in sexual 
violence against boys and girls, including pressuring children to engage in sexual activities 
or indecent exposure. The slow pace of implementation of legislation protecting children, 
slow judicial processes and the often insignificant penalties for perpetrators of sexual 
violence in schools led to the escalation of such cases, adding that the effects of sexual 
violence against children included depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</p>
<p>11. Empowering boys and girls in schools and educational facilities through child-led 
movements and with information on their rights and responsibilities have proven to be 
valuable mechanisms of defence against sexual violence as they enabled open 
communication and active participation. The Kenya Alliance for Advancement of Children 
called upon Government ministries responsible for education and children&#8217;s affairs, child-
focused non-governmental organizations, as well as teachers&#8217; unions and service 
commissions to set checks and balances on offenders and to ensure that offenders are 
subjected to stronger penalties. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, Manfred Nowak, highlighted that 
more than one million children around the world are deprived of their liberty. They are 
likely to be subjected to abuse not only by police and correctional officers but also by 
fellow detainees. He highlighted that children are more vulnerable to abuse if they are 
detained in the same facilities or particularly the same cells with adults; if girls are 
supervised by male staff; if they are detained in inhuman and degrading conditions of 
detention, including severe overcrowding; and if there is no or insufficient adequately 
trained staff in institutions and other detention facilities. He added that, frequently, sexual 
abuses go unreported due to fear or shame. Moreover, children often faced difficulties in 
accessing legal aid and services, including medical and forensic facilities, to secure 
evidence and substantiate their claims, depriving them of the possibility of accessing the 
justice system.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur warned that there was not always a distinction between 
placing children in need of protection and those facing judicial procedures. As a result, 
detention facilities may hold children in pretrial detention, victims of child trafficking or 
sexual exploitation, abandoned or homeless children, as well as children with mental 
disabilities. To prevent sexual and other types of violence against children, he 
recommended that States should elaborate a clear policy stating that sexual violence against 
detainees would not be tolerated; ensure that institutionalized care would only be used as a 
last resort; ensure that all children should be removed from adult detention facilities; and 
establish independent and effective complaints, monitoring and investigation mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>14. The representative of Save the Children, Ms. Karlsson, spoke of the particular 
vulnerability of the millions of children who are &#8220;on the move&#8221;. Yet, despite the large 
number of children involved, their needs and voices were largely absent in the discussions 
and debates on both child protection and human migration. These children, especially those 
moving alone, were highly vulnerable to exploitation, coercion, deception and violence, 
including sexual violence. However, as a result of their social status and discrimination, 
girls and boys face barriers when they tried to report violence. Children whose status is 
irregular because of migration face barriers in accessing education and healthcare services. </p>


<p>Many children were even criminalized for the sexual violence they had experienced, in 
addition to their irregular migration status.  
</p>
<p>15. She emphasized that children who moved tended to be categorized and labelled as 
trafficked, kidnapped, unaccompanied, separated, displaced, asylum-seeking, refugees, 
nomadic children or independent migrants. There is an absence of holistic and rights-based 
child protection mechanisms accessible to all children on the move irrespective of their 
status at the country of origin, during movement and at destination. She recommended that 
policy makers needed to, among other things, gain a better understanding of children's 
movements, listen to the voice of children, implement fully the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, and strengthen legislation and policies to eliminate all forms of sexual violence. 
She also added that there is a need to understand the perpetrators&#8217; behaviour and to promote 
social changes in attitudes and behaviours which condone and normalize sexual violence 
against girls and boys.  
</p>
<p>16. Finally, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed 
Conflict, Ms. Coomaraswamy, spoke about sexual violence against children in conflict 
situations. She said that sexual violence against children was one of the six grave violations 
that were committed against children during times of war. She mentioned that perpetrators 
use rape as a tactic or instrument of war, in order to terrorize target populations and to 
displace and humiliate them. Sexual violence may also take place because of the symbolic 
value attached to that violence, which was particularly true in ethnic and tribal wars, or 
because war often created a climate of impunity.  However, if leaders have low tolerance 
for sexual violence, this can be in fact curtailed.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Representative emphasized that, in fighting sexual violence in war time, 
the international community must not only address the issue of accountability but also the 
need to assist victims to recover from such violence, and reintegrate them into society.  
Services for survivors should include legal, medical and psychosocial assistance. That 
should be an important part of emergency aid in situations of conflict, and expressed hope 
that the new Special Representative on sexual violence would make this an important part 
of her mandate. She also recalled that in some situations of armed conflict there are cases of 
violence against boys, which need to be addressed as well.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>18. In the interactive dialogue following the panellists&#8217; presentations,  representatives of 
Uruguay (on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States), the European 
Union, Colombia, Cuba, Italy, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan (on behalf of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference), Sudan (on behalf of the Group of Arab States), 
Slovenia, Mexico, Jordan, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), Belarus, China, 
Indonesia, New Zealand (on behalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand), the Russian 
Federation, Lithuania, Slovakia, Uruguay, the Organisation Internationale de la 
Francophonie, Tunisia, the United States of America, Kenya, Norway, Syria, Ukraine, 
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Zambia and Tanzania made statements. The Advisory Council on 
Human Rights of Morocco also took the floor.  
</p>
<p>19. Non-governmental organizations delivered four joint statements: one on behalf of 
the World Organization against Torture (OMCT), Defence for Children International, End 
Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes 
(ECPAT International), International Federation Terre des Hommes; International Catholic 
Child Bureau (BICE), Plan International, Child Rights Information Network (CRIN); the 
African Child Policy Forum, and the NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, was dedicated to sexual violence against children in detention.  A second statement 
on behalf of Plan International, Defence for Children International, International Catholic </p>


<p>Child Bureau, SOS Children's Villages; World Vision International, International 
Federation Terre des Hommes, the NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, War Child Holland; Child Helpline International and WAO Afrique (World 
Association for Orphans and Abandoned Children) focused on sexual abuses in schools. A 
third statement, delivered by World Vision International on behalf of the International 
Council of Women, ECPAT International, BICE, Plan International and SOS Children&#8217;s 
Villages International, was on sexual violence against children in the aftermath of natural 
disasters. The fourth statement, delivered by International Save the Children Alliance on 
behalf of the African Child Policy Forum, Defence for Children International, ECPAT 
International, BICE, the NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Plan 
International, SOS Children&#8217;s Villages International, War Child Holland, OMCT and 
World Vision International, focused on sexual violence against children affected by armed 
conflict.   
</p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, all speakers firmly condemned all forms of sexual 
violence against children. Sexual violence against children is a problem in all regions of the 
world affecting all areas of children&#8217;s lives.  The fight against this phenomenon must be a 
matter of urgent priority in the international agenda, as emphasized by most speakers. There 
were calls on all States to strengthen their efforts and focus on the so-called root causes as 
well, particularly poverty, and not only the manifestations. A number of speakers expressed 
concern about the increase in child trafficking and the use of Internet for the sexual 
exploitation of children. Others emphasized the limited knowledge of the phenomenon of 
sexual violence, particularly in the context of the family, and the lack of data. It was noted 
that despite the almost universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights on the Child, 
the enjoyment of human rights for most children was still a problem and the adoption of 
relevant legislation was not always enough. Implementation of laws and policies to fight 
sexual violence and impunity was essential, as well as building awareness of this 
phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>21. A number of countries described national initiatives taken to prevent and respond to 
sexual violence against children. These include introducing legislation and policies against 
violence and to protect children; increasing sentences, including for sexual tourism and 
sexual exploitation; providing free telephone services to report cases of abuse; establishing 
social services close to marginalized areas, centres for children victims of abuse, 
community services and social reintegration programmes for victims of violence and 
exploitation.  There were numerous calls on exchanging lessons learned in the fight of 
sexual violence against children.  
</p>
<p>22. Measures suggested to tackling sexual violence included: improving living 
standards; promoting international solidarity; including through increased international 
collaboration on programmes, strategies and research; changing attitudes to the problem 
and ensuring that both perpetrators and victims are provided with qualified professional 
help; strengthening mechanisms of prevention and denunciation.  Some speakers mentioned 
that there was also a need for behavioural and social change in communities, and the root 
causes for the increase in sexual violence should be identified and addressed. Integrating a 
gender perspective in all efforts and paying attention to the most vulnerable groups, such as 
the girl child, children in conflict situation, displaced children, children involved in natural 
disasters, and children with disabilities was also emphasized. A number of countries 
mentioned the ongoing work on establishing an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights to the Child on a communications procedure.  
</p>
<p>23. Speakers from UNICEF and non-governmental organizations focused on the 
importance of participation and of empowerment of children in the fight against sexual 
violence. In particular, a child representative of Plan International, in a presentation </p>


<p>prepared by children, describing her personal experience as a campaigner in Ghana, said 
that sexual violence in schools is preventable.  
</p>
<p>24. Questions included issues such as the role of the Human Rights Council and of the 
universal periodic review process in the fight against sexual violence; possible synergies in 
efforts to address sexual violence; the implementation  by States of the recommendations 
issued by the United Nations Study on Violence against Children; effective prevention 
measures; challenges to overcome violence in the family context and how to take into 
account the views of children in the various programmes and policies. 
</p>
<p>25. Panellists, in both their responses and their concluding remarks, highlighted the 
importance of international cooperation and the need for the international community to 
consciously coordinate the efforts of civil society, Governments, and children themselves 
from the local level up to the global level. It was emphasized that the universal periodic 
review process could also play an important role in fighting sexual violence by encouraging 
States under review to make strong commitments and follow-up on these. On prevention, 
family was the first place to start. It was important to sensitize relevant professionals, 
ensure transparency, and provide special services and support to children particularly at 
risk. A few panellists highlighted the need to have safe, accessible reporting mechanisms 
and to develop a communications procedure aimed at bringing child rights abuses to the 
attention of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Patriarchal structures, the status of 
women, and the cycle of violence were mentioned among the root causes of sexual 
violence. It was suggested that protecting and promoting appropriate social norms in 
communities, as well as promoting the active participation of children could be part of the 
solution. It was highlighted that there was much to be learned from good practices in all 
regions of the world. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Protecting boys and girls from sexual violence: prevention 
and response 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory remarks and statements by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>26. The afternoon panel was devoted to &#8220;Protecting boys and girls from sexual violence: 
prevention and response&#8221;. The panellists included: Susana Villar&#225;n de La Puente, Member 
of the Committee on the Rights of the Child; Victor Karunan, Chief of Adolescent 
Development and Participation at UNICEF; Najat Maalla M&#8217;Jid, Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, 
Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe, and Eliana Restrepo, Deputy Director 
of Plan Colombia.  
</p>
<p>27. The meeting was opened by Ibrahim Salama, Director of the Human Rights Treaties 
Division of OHCHR. He highlighted that investing efforts and resources in prevention was 
the most effective way to reduce sexual violence against children. A holistic approach with 
multisectoral policies, programmes and plans, as well as plans of action, is crucial to 
prevent and address violence against children. Other measures include collecting reliable 
data to help raise awareness of the problem and develop effective measures; using 
internationally recognized indicators to measure their impact; investigating cases of sexual 
violence against children using child sensitive procedures and establishing child-friendly 
court procedures to prevent the re-victimization of victims; and ensuring easy access to 
child-sensitive counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Salama mentioned that the afternoon panel would focus on efforts of the 
international community to implement the goals and targets of the Rio de Janeiro 
Declaration and Call for Action to Prevent and Stop Sexual Exploitation of Children and </p>


<p>Adolescents (the Rio Declaration). He emphasized in particular the importance of ensuring 
the full participation of children themselves in all strategies and measures to prevent, 
respond and monitor violence, in accordance with article 12 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>29. Ms. Villar&#225;n of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in her presentation on 
national, regional and international effective remedies, said that measures had to address 
the gap between policies and practices. She mentioned that the Committee, when reviewing  
the domestic laws of States, noted the lack of a single definition of sexual violence against 
children. However, at international level, the jurisprudence of the European Court on 
Human Rights and the Inter-American Court and Commission qualify sexual violence as 
torture, while international criminal law considers sexual violence as crime against 
humanity. The United Nations Study on Violence against Children also identified essential 
aspects to be considered when adopting preventive and protection measures. Therefore, in 
the creation of new legal instruments, she emphasized, the need to look at all existing 
international frameworks.  
</p>
<p>30. Ms. Villar&#225;n underlined that the Committee had also identified a number of 
preventive and protective measures. These included: legal reforms, such as the legal 
minimum age for marriage,  criminal responsibility, sexual consent, as well as for accessing 
health services without parental consent; public policies and national plans with clear 
objectives and sufficient resources; measures  to address cultural beliefs that condone 
sexual violence; guaranteeing that the right of the child to be heard; putting in place 
information systems with disaggregated data; prioritising prevention measures through 
education and the empowerment of children; and adopting measures to avoid re-
victimization of the children.  
</p>
<p>31. The representative of UNICEF, Mr. Karunan, mentioned in his presentation on the 
empowerment and participation of children that sexual violence against children remained a 
neglected and hidden issue and only recently had the magnitude of the problem begun to 
attract the attention of policymakers and the public. He provided a few examples of child-
led initiatives to combat sexual violence against children in Cambodia, India and 
Bangladesh. In this regard he underlined that practice standards on child participation to 
combat sexual violence should include an ethical approach to participation, participation 
that is relevant and voluntary, a child-friendly environment, and an effective follow-up and 
evaluation system to monitor progress and assess outcomes and impact of participation. He 
concluded by highlighting that children themselves were the best advocates against sexual 
violence; that child-led initiatives should become an integral part of policies and protection 
mechanisms to combat sexual violence against children; and that all efforts to curb and 
eradicate sexual violence must have the child&#8217;s best interest at the centre, as well as 
children&#8217;s agency and empowerment as central guiding principles.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, Najat Maalla M&#8217;jid, when speaking about the follow-up to the Rio Congress 
and its Call for Action, noted that, despite considerable progress made, sexual exploitation 
of children and adolescents through the Internet and new technologies, via child trafficking 
and sexual tourism was still growing. Referring to the implementation of the Rio Plan of 
Action, Ms. Maalla M&#8217;Jid noted that States had still not universally ratified a number of 
pertinent international and regional instruments; some bodies of national law had not 
defined clearly nor had they criminalized all forms of sexual exploitation of children;  many 
countries did not have mechanisms that children could access to report cases of sexual 
exploitation; work remained to be done with regard to putting in place inter and 
intrasectoral strategies to reinforce national protection services or to create new ones to 
provide all victims of sexual violence and their families with economic and psychological 
support and the means for social reintegration.  </p>


<p>33. Additionally, Ms. Maalla M&#8217;jid favoured systematic participation of children in 
awareness-raising programmes as children were not just victims of sexual exploitation, but 
also part of the solution; there was scope for information exchange and technical assistance 
to developing countries regarding mechanisms to facilitate coordination at national, 
regional and international levels. Some businesses had adopted programmes in the area of 
social responsibility. Such initiatives should be extended to businesses involved in tourism, 
the Internet, media and entertainment. In conclusion, despite actions in many countries to 
combat sexual exploitation against children, much remained to be done and cooperation on 
this regard had to be intensified.  
</p>
<p>34. The Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Ms. Maud de Boer-
Buquicchio, said that everyone had the obligation to ensure that children had access to 
adequate child-sensitive services and mechanisms guaranteeing their protection, effective 
preventive measures and adequate responses to sexual violence. She enumerated the 
measures taken by the Council of Europe to deal with this issue. These included elaborating 
a convention covering all forms of sexual violence (the Lanzarote Convention); providing 
guidance to countries to set their own national integrated strategies for the protection of 
children from violence; mainstreaming children&#8217;s rights in a series of areas, including child-
friendly social services and health, as well as child participation; and preparing to launch in 
2010 a pan-European campaign to combat sexual violence against children. The Council of 
Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual 
Abuse (the Lanzarote Convention) is an international legally binding instrument which is 
open to ratification by non-European countries. The Policy Guidelines on integrated 
national strategies for the protection of children from violence, promote the development of 
a holistic national framework to safeguard children&#8217;s rights and protect them from violence. 
She concluded by describing the work done by the Council of Europe to define child 
friendly services particularly with regard to justice, social services and health care, and on 
child participation.  
</p>
<p>35. According to the Deputy Director of Plan Colombia, Eliana Restrepo, in order to 
tackle sexual violence, it was important to build a protection culture where values, cultural 
patterns and variables were taken into account. It was urgent to consider a cultural 
crossover where the State, civil society, communities, families and children all take part in 
the design of initiatives and intervene in a holistic and interdependent way. She highlighted 
that it is important to influence culture and social relationships also through awareness-
raising actions. Mass media needed to become allies in educating the population and 
changing cultures. She indicated that Plan Colombia had trained 1,000 media professionals 
in recent years, helping them to understand children&#8217;s rights and contributing to a more 
sensitive journalism on sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>36. Ms. Restrepo also added that it was necessary to strengthen the protective capacities 
of and the interaction with different actors. The various State institutions dealing with this 
issue must interact and coordinate. It is important that actions be carried out as 
interdependent and integral plans and not as sectoral plans, which have limited impact. 
Additionally, it was important to look for new allies in building protective networks, 
including the private sector. One example in that regard was the alliance between Plan 
Colombia and Banco Agrario. The bank committed to train 5,000 employees in the 
prevention of sexual violence against children and to offer training to its microcredit 
customers. That alliance would reach 88 per cent of Colombia&#8217;s municipalities through its 
900 branches. Violence prevention programmes in schools are also essential. The Plan 
Colombia representative concluded by stating that children could also become active in 
their own protection if they had access to training programmes that allowed them to 
identify and tackle risks relating to sexual violence, starting from childhood and continuing 
throughout their life. Plan Colombia had in fact been able to demonstrate that such </p>


<p>programmes were able to reduce the gaps generated inter alia by conditions such as 
environment, family and poverty.

<p><b> B. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>37. In the interactive dialogue following the afternoon presentations,  representatives of 
Spain (on behalf of the European Union), Paraguay, Senegal, Slovakia, Israel, South Africa, 
Belgium, Peru, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Morocco, the Maldives (speaking also on behalf 
Mauritius), Colombia, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Brazil, Algeria, 
Indonesia, Poland, Portugal, the United Arab Emirates, India, Argentina (speaking on 
behalf of the Common Market of the South, MERCOSUR), Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Japan, 
Finland, Thailand, the Holy See, Panama, Slovenia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Lichtenstein and Egypt took the floor. Also speaking was a representative of End Child 
Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes (ECPAT 
International).  
</p>
<p>38. There was general agreement among speakers that sexual crimes happened 
everywhere in the world and that violence against children was never justifiable. Most 
speakers agreed that it was critical to focus on prevention and one speaker highlighted that 
sexual violence against children was preventable when social and legal norms were 
respected. Many speakers warned about the danger presented by the use of new 
technologies, as well as the greater mobility in travel and tourism. In particular, sexual 
exploitation of children needed to be combated by strengthened common action. It was 
highlighted that there is still a considerable gap between policies on children&#8217;s rights and 
their implementation and that cooperation between State and local authorities, and non 
governmental organizations and other partners was crucial. There were calls on States 
which had not yet done so to ratify the Convention and its two Optional Protocols.  
</p>
<p>39. A number of States described measures and policies taken at national level, 
including the development of specific legislation, policies and action plans; the obligation 
to report sexual violence against children; the development of awareness-raising and 
information campaigns; the creation of special police units dealing with this issue; working 
with heads of religious communities; the training of people working with minors; the 
establishment of free help lines; the development of programmes to teach children to 
protect themselves against the risks of Internet and other new technologies; the use of 
information technologies to increase awareness on and  prevention of sexual crimes;  legal 
provisions allowing children to directly access all State entities to claim the protection of 
their rights without being accompanied by a legal representative; the establishment of child 
advocacy centres; allocating funds for victims of sexual violence; criminalization of all 
forms of violence against children; the increase in penalties against child sex offenders; and 
the criminalization of sexual abuse of children abroad . Reference was also made to plans 
of action adopted at regional level. 
</p>
<p>40. Measures suggested for eliminating violence included: identifying root causes 
leading to sexual violence against children; devising and implementing feasible preventive 
strategies; formulating, strengthening and enforcing policies and laws on child protection; 
sensitising the public to the problem; creating a non-violent society ; promoting positive 
child-rearing methods; engaging children in prevention and response; and creating an 
environment in which children were self-confident, self assured and resistant. It was 
emphasized that coordination across United Nations mandates and between institutions 
would ensure that sexual violence against children in all its forms and settings was 
systematically addressed. Children should also be able to press for reparation and should be 
able to directly address State authorities. </p>


<p>41. Main questions included examples of child participation in fighting against sexual 
violence; if there was a single definition of sexual violence against children that would be 
generally applicable; the role of information and communication technologies in protecting 
children; modalities to strengthen the complaint filing processes locally and internationally 
in order to prevent cases of sexual violence against children. Many States enquired about 
best practices regarding the prevention and protection of children from sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>42. In their replies and concluding remarks, panellists emphasized that, on prevention, it 
was important to act upstream rather than downstream and to do preventive work with 
families and schools, where most of the problems with sexual violence occurred. Self-
protection programmes for children were also an important element in controlling risks. 
The need to change mindsets was emphasized but this is a process that takes time. It was 
noted that there was a lack of a truly and holistic cross-cutting approach due primarily to a 
lack of a clear concept of the phenomenon, as it changed constantly. The Lanzarote 
Convention, which is open for ratification also by non-European States, was referred to as 
the only instrument which covered all forms of sexual violence against children, so it could 
serve as a comprehensive definition. In terms of complaints, a number of panellists 
highlighted the need for the Convention on the Rights of the Child to have an Optional 
Protocol for individual communications. It was emphasized that there was insufficient 
attention on the demand dimension, a root cause in itself, which should be addressed both at 
the national and global level. There was agreement that children should be treated as equal 
partners in the fight against sexual violence. Both the positive and negative roles of the 
media in this regard were highlighted.
