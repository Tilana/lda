<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 23/19, 
in which the Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to prepare a report, to be submitted to it at its twenty-seventh session, on 
technical assistance and capacity-building options for integrating human rights into national 
policies, drawing from worldwide best practices in the field, with a view to supporting 
States in developing and applying suitable methodologies to that end, upon request and 
according to their own particular needs and priorities. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 23/19, the Council recognized that State action aimed at the full 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national level was made most 
effective by drawing up and putting into practice national policies to protect and promote 
human rights in conformity with their obligations under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>3. OHCHR cooperates with States and national stakeholders to strengthen national 
frameworks to promote and protect human rights. This is often done in synergy and 
partnership with other United Nations entities and international actors, including regional 
organizations, national human rights institutions, civil society and academia. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report contains a selection of  practices, developed in the context of 
OHCHR technical cooperation programmes, that have proven effective and have yielded 
visible results in supporting State efforts to align national policies, strategies and laws with 
international human rights norms and principles, recommendations and commitments.  
</p>
<p>5. By strengthening the capacity of State institutions and officials, and bringing 
national systems and strategies into line with human rights standards, positive change can 
be achieved to ensure that all human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled. 
</p>
<p>6. The information contained in the report is based also on the experience of joint 
efforts under various assistance frameworks and cooperation with regional and subregional 
organizations, in particular support and results achieved under OHCHR technical 
cooperation programmes during the period from 2011 to 2014. It illustrates the types of 
options available to States in integrating human rights into national policies and/or in 
developing national policies in line with international human rights standards and their 
international obligations, with the support of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>7. In the preparation of the report, information on different experiences, including 
methodologies used and lesson learned, was gathered from OHCHR headquarters and field 
presences, regional and country offices, human rights components of United Nations peace 
missions and human rights advisers to United Nations country teams, working closely with 
host governments. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Framework for technical cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>8. Technical cooperation, which refers to both technical assistance and capacity-
building, is an integral part of OHCHR programmes.  
</p>
<p>9. Technical cooperation is aimed at identifying and addressing knowledge and 
capacity gaps by facilitating constructive dialogue and positive change with national 
counterparts. It is conducted by OHCHR at the request and with the agreement of States 
and includes a comprehensive assessment of the human rights situation in a given country, 
with a view to aligning laws, policies, institutions and practices with international standards 
and obligations. </p>


<p>10. Technical assistance and capacity-building complement other key OHCHR 
functions, as set out in General Assembly resolution 48/141.  
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR engages directly with governments and actively cooperates with all 
relevant national stakeholders, such as ministries, parliaments, the judiciary, transitional 
justice mechanisms, security institutions, statistical and information systems, mechanisms 
for the protection of vulnerable groups and groups that are discriminated against, national 
human rights institutions, development actors and civil society organizations, to support 
their role in  drawing up and assessing the impact of national policies.  
</p>
<p>12. Policy processes should be based on a human rights-based approach which upholds 
the universality, inalienability, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all 
human rights and ensures that decisions and objectives relating to those processes are 
achieved through participation and inclusion, the rule of law and accountability, non-
discrimination and transparency. 
</p>
<p>13. Effective national policies based on human rights align the priorities and goals of the 
State with the conditions for its population to enjoy all human rights. The experience 
gathered over the past 20 years by OHCHR demonstrates that the active and meaningful 
participation of all sectors of society in debating and developing policies and programmes 
affecting the population is critical for the success of such processes. In that context, the aim 
of technical cooperation is thus also to ensure that policy processes and outcomes empower 
rights holders to assert and claim their rights, and to assist duty bearers in ensuring that 
those rights are enjoyed by all.  
</p><p>14. Technical cooperation is a vehicle to support States&#8217; compliance with their human 
rights obligations and their follow-up to recommendations made by human rights 
mechanisms in that regard. Technical cooperation projects are results oriented; they are 
designed on the basis of dialogue with all relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>15. Over the years, OHCHR has been providing increasing assistance to United Nations 
country teams to integrate human rights into their programming strategies, including in the 
context of joint projects, and to promote a coordinated and coherent United Nations system-
wide human rights approach to technical cooperation.  
</p>
<p>16. OHCHR also supports regional and subregional organizations in strengthening 
arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights and in exchanging views on 
good practices and lessons learned. Such comparative processes strengthen regional 
cooperation and demonstrate the viability of strategies and the achievability of results.  
</p>
<p>17. Since the creation of the mandate of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
OHCHR has been working closely with States in support of their efforts to further the 
enjoyment of human rights for all. Examples of that work are human rights assessments; 
advisory services, including technical advice on institution building and strengthening 
legislation and policies; training of trainers; awareness initiatives; national workshops; 
dialogue facilitation; provision of documentation, publications and web tools; and sharing 
of good practices from other countries. 
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR, including through its field presences, promotes inclusive national 
ownership and sustainability of support efforts.  
</p>
<p>19. The Board of Trustees which oversees both the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights and the universal periodic review (UPR) 
Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, two key financial sources of 
OHCHR technical assistance, advises the Office on policy and strategic orientation with </p>


<p>regard to technical cooperation. The Board identified several components of effective 
technical cooperation,1 which have facilitated the identification of the practices highlighted 
in the present report. The OHCHR Performance Monitoring System, a results-based 
management tool, also provided information on how and how well results were reached.  
</p>
<p><b> III. National and regional experiences in integrating human 
rights into public policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Compliance of State entities and domestic laws, policies and 
programmes with international human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mexico: constitutional reform in the area of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>20. The constitutional reform adopted in Mexico in 2011 gave constitutional status to all 
of the human rights guaranteed in the international treaties to which Mexico is a party. The 
reform provided the country with a strong new legal framework, opening the way for the 
harmonization of national legislation and policy with international and regional standards; 
withdrawal of reservations and interpretative declarations; and opportunities for renewed 
national dialogue and coordination around human rights priorities. OHCHR supported the 
Government&#8217;s efforts towards constitutional reform. Over several years, in the context of a 
technical cooperation agreement, OHCHR-Mexico supported important initiatives, 
including the training of judges and the provision of advice to the Supreme Court of Justice 
on key human rights issues; consultations and advocacy activities promoting consensus 
within the Federal Congress; and the participation of civil society and academia in relation 
to issues of common concern. 
</p>
<p>21. Once the reform was approved, OHCHR-Mexico, in collaboration with the Supreme 
Court of Justice, the National Human Rights Commission of the Federal District (Mexico 
City) and the Centro de Investigaci&#243;n Aplicada en Derechos Humanos supported the 
development of a web-based educational tool, &#8220;Reforma DH&#8221;,2 on the implementation of 
the constitutional reform. Reforma DH is a key methodological tool to promote the 
implementation of the constitutional reform at the federal and state levels. It comprises nine 
modules, based on the contents of article 1 of the Constitution, and an add-on module on 
the sources of international human rights law. The aim of Reforma DH is to assist the 
implementation of the reform by providing the State and representatives of civil society 
with the conceptual, analytical and procedural tools necessary to advance the realization of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Myanmar: adoption of the National Human Rights Commission Law 
</b></p>
<p>22. Established in September 2011, the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission 
(MNHRC) has carried out various activities to promote and protect human rights, including 
promoting the ratification by Myanmar of core international human rights treaties; handling 
more than 4,000 complaints; and raising awareness of human rights among the relevant 
ministries and the general public.  
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR provided support to MNHRC through activities such as seminars for 
government staff, parliamentarians and civil society; training for staff and commissioners;

<p>and enabling greater engagement by MNHRC with civil society and human rights 
defenders. OHCHR and other stakeholders, including the Asia Pacific Forum of National 
Human Rights Institutions (APF), the Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Law and international experts on national human rights institutions, 
consistently recommended that the Government create a legislative basis for the 
establishment of a national institution in compliance with the Paris Principles, the 
international minimum standards on national human rights institutions.  
</p>
<p>24. In 2013, in order to ensure that an independent institution to promote and protect 
human rights, in line with the Paris Principles, was established by law, OHCHR, APF, 
international experts and partners, with the active support and involvement of the senior 
legal adviser in the Office of the President, provided technical cooperation and advice on 
substantive or procedural elements of the bill, as well as encouraged participation by civil 
society, before and after its submission to Parliament in August 2013. The Myanmar 
National Human Rights Commission Law was adopted in March 2014 and promulgated by 
the President in April 2014. 
</p>
<p><b>  European Union: supporting the application by European Union member States of 
a human rights-based approach to trafficking and border control 
</b></p>
<p>25. With a view to supporting European Union efforts in implementing the European 
Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, the OHCHR Regional Office for Europe, together 
with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children Fund 
(UNICEF), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Entity for 
Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), provided technical 
support to a number of European Union entities, including the European Parliament 
Committee for Women&#8217;s Rights and Gender Equality, in their efforts to develop a human 
rights-based directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and 
protecting its victims. Adopted in 2011, the directive takes into account the contributions by 
United Nations entities on existing relevant international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>26. Following the adoption of the directive, United Nations entities, including OHCHR, 
continued to provide practical guidance to European Union member States for the 
application of a human rights-based approach in the transposition of the directive into their 
national legislation. To that end, OHCHR and its United Nations partners prepared a joint 
commentary3 on the directive in relation to existing international standards, which was 
launched at the European Parliament in 2012.  
</p>
<p>27. OHCHR also provided technical assistance to the European Agency for the 
Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of Member States of the 
European Union (FRONTEX) in aligning its policies with the new framework. In close 
cooperation with the FRONTEX Training Unit and with the collaboration of the European 
Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, UNODC, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN-Women, the 
International Organization for Migration, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe and others, OHCHR provided legal and methodological advice for the development 
of two specialized training packages for border guards, in compliance with international 
and regional human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>28. Multidisciplinary teams from FRONTEX, national authorities and law enforcement 
agencies and United Nations partners, including OHCHR, worked jointly in the context of a

<p>series of technical meetings to ensure the compliance of the training materials with 
international standards. Technical cooperation work was successful in strengthening 
synergy among all partners involved. 
</p>
<p>29. In 2012 and 2013 respectively, the FRONTEX Training Unit launched two trainers&#8217; 
manuals, &#8220;Anti-trafficking training for border guards&#8221; and &#8220;Fundamental rights training for 
border guards&#8221;. The two manuals support national-level training of border guards and are 
aimed at strengthening their practical skills in operationalizing human rights when 
controlling borders and combating and preventing human trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b>  Russian Federation: human rights master&#8217;s degree programme  
</b></p>
<p>30. As part of the OHCHR Framework for Cooperation with the Russian Federation and 
in the context of the second phase (2010-2014) of the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education, the Human Rights Adviser to the United Nations country team in the Russian 
Federation has been supporting the education authorities in implementing a human rights 
master&#8217;s degree programme.  
</p>
<p>31. The programme is being implemented by a consortium of three leading universities, 
namely, the Peoples&#8217; Friendship University of Russia, the Russian State University for the 
Humanities and the Moscow State Institute for International Relations, and is supported by 
OHCHR, in partnership with the European Centre for Human Rights and Democratization. 
The consortium was recently extended to include the Kazan Federal University and the 
Perm State University. 
</p>
<p>32. The programme contributes to the development among young people and 
professionals of a culture of human rights, the rule of law and non-discrimination. It is 
practice oriented and interactive, and is supported by a strong international and national 
network of international organizations, academia, institutions and business partners.  
</p>
<p>33. OHCHR cooperates in designing modules and tools, identifying experts and 
lecturers and providing documentation and publications. Based on the positive experience 
in the Russian Federation, OHCHR has assisted with the development of human rights 
Master&#8217;s programmes in other countries. For instance, in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, 
the Plurinational School of Administration launched a Master&#8217;s programme to train civil 
servants in human rights norms on the prevention of racism and all forms of discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Ratification of international and regional human rights instruments 
and review of reservations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Thailand: using the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework for follow-up  
</b></p>
<p>34. With the start of the second cycle of the UPR in 2012, the OHCHR Regional Office 
for South-East Asia provided States in the region with support for reporting and following 
up on UPR recommendations.  
</p>
<p>35. In this context, OHCHR contributed to strengthening the capacity of the United 
Nations country teams in the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Thailand respectively, 
in order to support States&#8217; follow-up and reporting efforts in the context of their respective 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). Both documents integrate 
a human rights-based approach and contain specific outcomes geared to assisting the 
countries in implementing prioritized UPR recommendations, which include mainstreaming 
human rights in national policies.  </p>


<p>36. The provision of support through UNDAF furthers the strengthening of national 
ownership and commitment, as they are aimed at harmonizing and aligning programming 
priorities with national development priorities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Haiti: the Interministerial Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p>37. Since 2009, the Human Rights Section of the United Nations Stabilization Mission 
in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti 
have been encouraging the Government of Haiti to create a national reporting and follow-
up coordination mechanism.  
</p>
<p>38. Pursuant to a decree promulgated by the Prime Minister, the Government 
established the permanent Interministerial Human Rights Committee (Comit&#233; 
interminist&#233;riel des droits de la personne) (CIDP) which became operational in May 2013 
and replaced the existing ad hoc mechanism. CIDP promotes the ratification of 
international and regional human rights instruments and the review of reservations thereto, 
and aims to facilitate timely reporting and improved coordination in following up on 
recommendations emanating from treaty bodies and other United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms. That includes prioritizing and integrating relevant 
recommendations with a view to proposing or amending relevant laws, policies and 
mechanisms to strengthen the protection of all human rights for all the population, 
including vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>39. The MINUSTAH Human Rights Section, in close collaboration with the Ministry 
for Human Rights and the Fight against Extreme Poverty, gave advice on the drafting of the  
terms of reference and the Action Plan (2013-2016) of CIDP. The Action Plan contains 
detailed steps towards the ratification of or accession to human rights instruments and 
provided support to the Government with regard to signing the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment on 16 August 2013, and 
acceding to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 8 
October 2013. The MINUSTAH Human Rights Section provides regular support for the 
operationalization of the subcommittee on the universal periodic review and for 
strengthening the capacity and coordination of national stakeholders in gathering 
information and reporting on progress made in the implementation of UPR 
recommendations. The Human Rights Section also provided assistance to CIDP in the 
development of a national human rights action plan.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paraguay: a web tool for human rights implementation 
</b></p>
<p>40. In Paraguay, OHCHR has been supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
seeking innovative ways to engage with human rights mechanisms since 2011. In June 
2014, the Government launched the System for Monitoring Recommendations (Sistema de 
Monitoreo de las Recomendaciones) (SIMORE), a portal that facilitates the systematization 
of human rights recommendations made by the United Nations human rights mechanisms 
and the Organization of American States. This public tool4 provides direct access to reliable 
information on the status of implementation of recommendations. By explaining by whom, 
for whom and how recommendations have been implemented, SIMORE strengthens the 
transparency and accountability of the State.  
</p>
<p>41. SIMORE is coordinated by the Human Rights Network of the executive branch of 
government, led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. More than 
50 State officials, including the Ombudsman and the General Prosecutor, contributed 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 SIMORE is available from www.mre.gov.py/mdhpy/buscador/home. </p>


<p>information on policies, programmes and indicators5 for SIMORE technical files. SIMORE 
supports the daily work of the Government; the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee 
intends to use SIMORE to inform its agenda on progress and gaps in legislative reform. 
The tool is also useful for United Nations country team programming and cooperation 
activities. Furthermore, the portal is instrumental in strengthening the participation and 
contribution of non-State actors in the national reporting and monitoring process.  
</p>
<p><b>  Morocco: the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>42. In 2011, with a view to having a standing mechanism aimed at facilitating both 
timely reporting and coordination with regard to follow-up to recommendations made by 
human rights bodies, the Government of Morocco established by decree the Interministerial 
Delegation for Human Rights (DIDH). In line with its Strategic Plan (2012-2016), DIDH is 
tasked with ensuring coordination between government and other relevant stakeholders, 
such as the National Human Rights Council and civil society; promoting engagement with 
the international human rights mechanisms, in line with United Nations country 
programmes and UNDAF; ensuring reporting deadlines are met and implementing 
recommendations; ensuring follow-up on the implementation of the national action plan for 
democracy and human rights; contributing to the integration of a human rights-based 
approach into national programmes and policies, including through strengthening the 
capacity of the national administration and other stakeholders, such as the National Human 
Rights Council, universities and civil society. 
</p>
<p>43. In 2013, Morocco requested OHCHR support to strengthen government capacity in 
engaging with international human rights mechanisms and to strengthen its national human 
rights system. In order to strengthen the capacity of DIHD and other key institutional 
partners, including Parliament, through a programme of the United Nations Development 
Group human rights mainstreaming mechanism, the OHCHR Regional Office for the 
Middle East and North Africa supported national efforts to develop awareness and 
educational initiatives aimed at the sharing of good practices and the development of 
training tools and human rights methodologies to follow up on the implementation of 
recommendations made by international mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>44. In June 2014, OHCHR organized a training session for trainers, targeting key 
national stakeholders on the development of indicators to measure compliance with 
international standards. An initial core group of national trainers was established to guide 
national partners in developing indicators in line with the country&#8217;s identified priorities and 
with recommendations from the UPR, special procedures and treaty bodies. As a result of 
the training, the Government is considering drawing up a memorandum of understanding to 
strengthen collaboration between relevant institutions in developing and using human rights 
indicators. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 In Paraguay as well as in other countries, OHCHR supports the development of indicators in the areas 
</p>
<p>of health, water and sanitation, education and fair trial. See OHCHR, <i>Human rights indicators: a 
guide to measurement and implementation</i>, 2012 (HR/PUB/12/5), available from 
www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/ 
HRIndicators/AGuideMeasurementImplementationCompleteGuide_en.pdf.pdf. </p>


<p><b> C. Establishment and strengthening of judicial and accountability 
mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Togo: integrating a human rights-based approach to transitional justice 
</b>45. At the Government&#8217;s request and within the framework of the 2006 General Peace 
Agreement, OHCHR supported the process that led to the creation of the Truth, Justice and 
Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) in February 2009. As the lead entity within the United 
Nations system in the area of transitional justice, OHCHR, in coordination with the United 
Nations Resident Coordinator, the United Nations country team, UNDP and international 
donors, provided advice and capacity-building support by organizing national consultations 
to strengthen ownership and inclusive participation in the truth, justice and reconciliation 
process; supporting the drafting of legal and administrative frameworks for the 
establishment and functioning of the TJRC, in line with international human rights 
standards; and providing training to TJRC officials and staff. 
</p>
<p>46. In 2012, the President of Togo officially validated the core report and 
recommendations of the TJRC. OHCHR, in partnership with some civil society 
organizations, is preparing a compendium of the TJRC recommendations for wider 
dissemination and advocacy outreach initiatives, including in rural and remote areas. The 
Office is working closely with the Ministry of Human Rights on the drafting of a white 
paper on the implementation of the TJRC recommendations and the establishment of a  
mechanism to follow up the TJRC, in line with international good practices.  
</p>
<p><b>  Colombia: strengthening reparation and land restitution processes  
</b></p>
<p>47. In 2011, in order to address the need for comprehensive reparation measures for the 
victims of human rights violations committed in the context of the armed conflict in 
Colombia, the Victims and Land Restitution Law as well as decree-laws 4633, 4634 and 
4635 were adopted. Within the framework of two bilateral cooperation agreements signed 
in 2012 with the Land Restitution Unit and the Victims Attention and Comprehensive 
Reparation Unit, OHCHR-Colombia supports the authorities by issuing periodic reports on 
the status of implementation of the laws. Government partners have underlined the 
relevance of the recommendations contained in those reports, which provide policy options 
to improve compliance with international human rights standards, particularly on reparation 
and restitution. 
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR technical assistance has improved institutional coordination with a view to 
supporting the sustainability of land restitution and the exercise of economic, social and 
cultural rights without discrimination for the returned communities. Between December 
2011 and October 2013, 277 rulings were handed down by the tribunals. OHCHR continues 
to provide support to the authorities in promoting inter-institutional coordination, including 
at the local level, for the planning and execution of return efforts and the inclusive 
participation of victims in the development of public policies. A number of serious 
challenges remain to be addressed, such as the limited capacity to work in areas still 
affected by internal armed conflict, and violence against claimants and human rights 
defenders.  
</p>
<p><b>  El Salvador: regional protocol for the investigation of femicide 
</b></p>
<p>49. Following visits by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences to El Salvador in 2009 and 2010, the OHCHR Regional Office in Central 
America provided technical assistance to the Government for drafting the first 
Comprehensive Law for a Life Free of Violence against Women. The law, which came into </p>


<p>force in 2011, upholds the rights of women through the prevention of and response to 
violence, and through victim assistance and protection, among other measures.  
</p>
<p>50. On the basis of the new Salvadoran legal framework, the Office assisted the Office 
of the Attorney General in the development of a national protocol for the investigation of 
femicide, which was incorporated into the training curriculum for prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>51. The El Salvador protocol informed the drafting of the regional protocol for the 
investigation of femicide, a joint initiative by OHCHR and UN-Women in the context of 
the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign, with the 
collaboration of the Federation of associations for the protection and promotion of human 
rights (Spain) (Federaci&#243;n de Asociaciones de Defensa y Promoci&#243;n de los Derechos 
Humanos-Espa&#241;a) and Universidad Carlos III, Madrid, among others. The basic structure 
and content of the regional document were defined in the context of an international 
workshop at which experts discussed an OHCHR report documenting Latin American 
experiences, including various procedures and practices relating to the prosecution of 
femicide.  
</p>
<p><b>  Tunisia: strengthening the transitional justice process  
</b>52. OHCHR, together with the United Nations country team, supported processes 
leading to the adoption of the new Constitution of Tunisia, which contains provisions in 
line with international human rights standards on national institutions and on the 
establishment of bodies relating to elections, justice, human rights and the media. 
53. OHCHR-Tunisia has been working closely with the Government, including the 
Ministry of Human Rights and Transitional Justice, to support the establishment of a 
transitional justice mechanism in conformity with international standards. OHCHR also 
regularly advised key government authorities concerning advocacy initiatives and political 
processes relating to transitional justice, and reinforced the capacities of civil society 
organizations, in particular victims&#8217; groups, on those issues. 
</p>
<p>54. In cooperation with UNDP and the International Centre for Transitional Justice, the 
Office provided support to the Technical Committee, which comprised the Ministry of 
Human Rights and Transitional Justice and a wide range of representatives of civil society 
organizations, in organizing the national consultations leading to the drafting of a 
comprehensive transitional justice law. 
</p><p>55. In July 2013, OHCHR and UNDP supported awareness and outreach activities 
aimed at making transitional justice principles, processes and mechanisms better known to 
the public, and more specifically to victims and civil society organizations. OHCHR 
provided technical cooperation and advice on substantive or procedural elements of the 
draft organic law on transitional justice establishing the Truth and Dignity Commission, 
which was adopted on 15 December 2013. In June 2014, OHCHR co-organized with the 
Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Human Rights and Transitional Justice, UNDP and the 
International Centre for Transitional Justice, a national conference on the truth-and-dignity 
experience. Chairpersons and members of truth commissions from countries around the 
world, including Guatemala, Kenya, Peru, Poland and South Africa, attended the 
conference and shared their own experiences. In coordination with relevant partners, 
OHCHR is building the capacity of members of the Truth and Justice Commission in order 
to assist them in their daily work. The Office is also organizing awareness and training 
events with the aim of strengthening the transitional justice national network. </p>


<p><b> D. Measures to improve access to justice and basic services  
  Senegal: strengthening gender equality by reviewing the nationality law  
</b></p>
<p>56. The OHCHR Regional Office for West Africa provided technical advice for the 
drafting of a new nationality code, based on recommendations of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, with a view to ending the differential 
treatment of men and women with regard to the transmission of nationality through 
marriage, childbirth and adoption. 
</p>
<p>57. In collaboration with the non-governmental organization, Association of Senegalese 
Women Jurists, OHCHR provided technical assistance for the harmonization of the Family 
Code with international human rights standards, which resulted in the drafting of a 
compendium of national laws to be harmonized, based on the recommendations of 
international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Cambodia: strengthening a rule-of-law culture 
</b></p>
<p>58. Since 2012, OHCHR-Cambodia has been providing technical support to the 
Ministry of Justice in organizing a series of judicial round tables to create opportunities for 
staff of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) to share their 
experience with fellow judges, prosecutors and lawyers in the provinces. One of the topics 
discussed at every judicial round table has been pretrial detention. Those discussions led the 
Ministry of Justice to undertake reform of the pretrial detention process and align the 
practice of Cambodian national courts with that of ECCC by introducing the requirement 
that judges must provide detailed reasoning in decisions to detain. That was one of the most 
successful examples of transfer of good practice from ECCC to the domestic system so far.  
</p>
<p>59. In 2013, OHCHR launched the first-ever Cambodia-based course for lawyers on the 
right to a fair trial. The Fair Trial Rights Academy, organized at the Cambodian Lawyers 
Training Centre in cooperation with the Bar Association, is a three-month course featuring 
interactive activities, field trips and guest lectures by national and international experts on 
the Cambodian criminal justice system, including from ECCC, various Cambodian non-
governmental organizations and OHCHR. The course is aimed at improving the knowledge 
of and commitment to fair trial rights of future lawyers; strengthening their relevant legal 
skills; integrating a new human rights and fair trial rights module into the Lawyers Training 
Centre programme; and enhancing networking between future lawyers and current 
practitioners. The Bar Association and OHCHR also continue to co-host the Legal 
Dialogues Series, an annual programme of interactive workshops which focus on 
strengthening the quality of legal services. Sessions are developed by the Bar Association, 
in cooperation with OHCHR, and facilitated by senior national and international ECCC 
defence and civil party lawyers.  
</p>
<p>60. In March 2014, to promote the jurisprudence legacy of ECCC, OHCHR launched 
the Annotated Cambodian Code of Criminal Procedure, which was published with support 
from the British Embassy in Phnom Penh  and the United States Agency for International 
Development. The result of a three-year research project undertaken by several legal teams 
from around the world and coordinated by OHCHR-Cambodia, it is the first publication in 
recent Cambodian history annotating a law with relevant national and international 
jurisprudence. It constitutes an indispensable tool for legal practitioners and for anyone 
interested in knowing how the law is applied in practice. 
</p>
<p>61. The ECCC legacy activities are being developed and implemented largely to ensure 
the promotion of a culture of the rule of law and human rights, using ECCC as an example 
of best practice. </p>


<p><b>  Philippines: strengthening housing, land and property rights in the context of natural 
disasters 
</b></p>
<p>62. In November 2013, following a request from the Government of the Philippines, the 
Inter-Agency Standing Committee issued a level 3 emergency declaration in support of the 
Philippine population in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda. As a member of the 
Committee, OHCHR deployed 10 human rights officers on a rotational basis. The OHCHR 
team co-led protection cluster hubs with UNHCR and contributed to the overall efforts of 
the humanitarian country team. 
</p>
<p>63. In coordination with the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development 
and the humanitarian country team, OHCHR supported the protection work of relevant 
national partners, including government agencies<b>,</b> the Commission on Human Rights of the 
Philippines (CHRP) and civil society organizations. In coordination with CHRP, OHCHR 
supported the organization of round-table discussions on housing, land and property rights 
in the context of displacement, and on issues relating to the administration of justice and 
detention in the context of natural disasters. Several local government authorities, including 
municipal and city mayors, as well as United Nations partners, non-governmental 
organizations and national and international emergency assistance teams, participated in 
those initiatives and contributed to an informed and inclusive national consultation on 
reconstruction measures in the context of natural disasters taking into consideration human 
rights aspects. 
</p>
<p>64. In coordination with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of 
the right to an adequate standard of living and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
context, OHCHR provided significant support for the drafting of the CHRP &#8220;Advisory on 
human rights standards on housing, land and property rights of populations affected by 
Typhoon Yolanda&#8221;. The document served as an advocacy tool to guide relevant 
government efforts at both the national and local levels and support informed consultation 
of affected communities. It also helped to shape the rights-based common position paper 
issued by the humanitarian country team, which, together with the CHRP advisory and the 
outcomes of the round tables, contributed considerably to influencing policy review 
processes, including review of the policies on no-dwelling zones and no-build zones.  
</p>
<p><b>  Lebanon: developing a code of conduct for the protection of migrant domestic 
workers  
</b></p>
<p>65. Since 2005, as part of its technical cooperation work to increase the compliance of 
laws with international human rights standards, the OHCHR Regional Office for the Middle 
East has been working closely with the Government of Lebanon, ILO and non-
governmental organizations to alleviate the hardship experienced by domestic workers in 
Lebanon. A steering committee was set up to develop a national plan of action. One of the 
first major achievements of the committee was the drafting of a unified contract, which 
provided a common set of standards to protect domestic migrant workers. In close 
consultation with the Ministry of Labour, the Syndicate of Owners of Recruitment 
Agencies in Lebanon and Caritas Lebanon Migrant Centre, and in coordination with ILO, 
OHCHR supported the development of a code of conduct for recruiting agencies. Funded 
by the European Union and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, that key 
instrument for the protection of migrant domestic workers was launched in June 2013.  
</p>
<p>66. The code of conduct provides guidance to recruiting agencies on the rights of 
migrant domestic workers and includes self-accountability and disciplinary actions for 
agencies that violate it. It upholds the principles of transparency in business operations; 
provides comprehensive information about employment conditions in Lebanon and 
guidelines for the verification of workers&#8217; qualifications; and prohibits the placement of </p>


<p>underage persons. Its application through a rigorous implementation mechanism remains 
essential.  
</p>
<p>67. That initiative has inspired promising developments in Jordan, where the 
Government has established a steering committee, made up of the Ministry of Labour, the 
Ministry of the Interior, the Public Security Force, civil society, OHCHR and other 
international bodies, to prepare a road map for enhancing the protection of the human rights 
of migrant domestic workers. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guatemala: strategic litigation and the Maya programme 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Maya programme was established in 2009 to empower indigenous Mayan, 
Xinca and Garifuna peoples, communities and organizations to achieve stronger negotiating 
power and participation in public life. It is implemented by OHCHR, UNDP and UNICEF 
and is overseen by a steering committee comprising representatives of the Ministry of 
Planning and Programming of the Presidency, OHCHR, UNDP and UNICEF. In the first 
phase of the programme (2009&#8211;2013), 18 indigenous organizations filed cases before 
administrative or judicial bodies on various issues, including rights relating to land, 
territory and natural resources, discrimination, access to justice, consultation, self-
determined development and cultural rights. Five cases received favourable rulings, and 
three, for which national remedies have been exhausted, have been submitted to the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights. The remainder were at different stages in the 
legal process at the time of finalizing the present report. 
</p>
<p>69. While not always successful, OHCHR interventions, in collaboration with 
indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, have led to positive outcomes, such as the establishment 
of a support network for organizations working on indigenous rights and an increased use 
of national and regional protection systems by those organizations. The Maya programme 
has also built up the capacity of judicial officials and promoted changes in the legal and 
political culture of judges as duty bearers, so that they hand down rulings in accordance 
with international law. A second phase of the project was initiated in 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> E. National systems, inclusive participation in decision-making and 
development and monitoring of public policies  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Kenya: integrating human rights into the Medium-Term Development Plan  
</b></p>
<p>70. In 2012, the Government of Kenya shared with United Nations partners a concept 
note and a road map for the preparation of its second Medium-Term Plan for 2013-2017. 
The development of the second Medium-Term Plan followed the adoption of the 2010 
Constitution, which put forward the long-term development goals of Kenya. The 
Constitution promotes a human rights-based approach in government planning processes, 
focusing on accountability, participation, the rule of law, transparency and sustainable 
development.  
</p>
<p>71. In the context of the &#8220;Delivering as One&#8221; programme, OHCHR contributed to the 
United Nations country team&#8217;s support for the integration of human rights inputs into the 
second Medium-Term Plan. OHCHR provided inputs to the conceptualization process, 
supported the thematic working groups on &#8220;Governance, judiciary, security and rule of 
law&#8221; and &#8220;Gender, vulnerable groups and youth&#8221; and developed a policy brief on human 
rights and equity, highlighting challenges, drivers and opportunities for change through 
policy and programme interventions. </p>


<p>72. OHCHR also delivered specialized training on human rights for government 
economists and planners and the secretaries of the 19 sectoral working groups coordinated 
by the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.  
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR, the Ministry of Justice and the United Nations Resident Coordinator&#8217;s 
office trained key departments on human rights indicators for the second Medium-Term 
Plan in the areas of health, education, housing, gender, vulnerable groups, governance and 
the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>74. With OHCHR support, the Government designated human rights focal points of the 
Kenya National Commission on Human Rights in all the sectoral working groups.  
</p>
<p>75. The Resident Coordinator&#8217;s Annual Report 2013, published by the United Nations 
Development Group, cited the best practice of Kenya in the area of mainstreaming human 
rights in national development strategies, plans and processes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Uganda: implementing a human rights vision of development  
</b></p>
<p>76. In 2013, the Government of Uganda launched Uganda Vision 2040, an overarching 
national planning framework which considers human rights a prerequisite for development. 
The Vision was developed by the National Planning Authority (NPA) in consultation with 
other national stakeholders and partners. OHCHR-Uganda contributed to the drafting 
process. According to the Vision, &#8220;Government shall ensure that the human rights-based 
approach to development is integrated in policies, legislation, plans and programs&#8221;.6  
</p>
<p>77. NPA requested technical support from OHCHR for the effective integration of 
human rights into sector and district government development plans and, ultimately, into 
the second five-year National Development Plan. 
</p>
<p>78. In that context, OHCHR technical cooperation is being provided in partnership with 
the Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and with funding from 
Norway.<b> </b>In May 2014, with the support of OHCHR and GIZ, NPA issued new planning 
guidelines with a human rights-based approach. In order to strengthen the integration of 
human rights into plans and to identify and refine indicators, OHCHR launched a strategic 
training programme targeting planning officers, chief administrative officers and 
community development and population officers from 66 districts and 16 thematic sectors. 
Training was so well received that NPA requested OHCHR to cover the remaining 46 
districts, with UNDP funding.  
</p>
<p>79. In coordination with UNDP and other United Nations partners, OHCHR has 
continued to support inclusive consultative workshops at the regional level, enabling local 
government leaders to address their human rights priorities and concerns have them 
integrated into the second five-year National Development Plan.  
</p>
<p>80. The mainstreaming initiative led by NPA strengthened partnership and coordination 
between national institutions in Uganda, United Nations entities and international partners, 
such as GIZ, to work together on strengthening national capacities for efficient and quality 
planning. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ecuador: human rights in development planning 
</b></p>
<p>81. In 2008, the report submitted by the Ecuador within the framework of the first cycle 
of the UPR clearly defined the inclusion of a human rights-based approach to planning as a 
priority area for international cooperation. In 2009, the National Secretariat for Planning

 Uganda Vision 2014, p. 108. </p>


<p>and Development (Secretar&#237;a Nacional de Planificaci&#243;n y Desarrollo) (SENPLADES) 
requested OHCHR support for the integration of human rights into national development 
planning processes and tools.  
</p>
<p>82. The Constitution of Ecuador states that planning and public policies formulated 
through participatory approaches are key processes for realizing human rights and 
promoting social equality cohesion and &#8220;good living&#8221; (<i>buen vivir</i>). The task of OHCHR 
was also facilitated by the Government&#8217;s clear political will and by the work of a solid 
national planning entity with strong institutional and technical capacity.  
</p>
<p>83. The effective collaboration between OHCHR and SENPLADES between 2011 and 
2013 produced a number of key results, including the Guidelines for the elaboration of 
sectoral public policy, the Guidelines for the integration of a human rights-based approach 
in the national development plan and the Atlas of socioeconomic inequalities.  
</p>
<p>84. The approach used to develop the Guidelines for the elaboration of sectoral public 
policy followed precise methodological steps, such as identifying specific duty bearers vis-
&#224;-vis human rights obligations; unpacking the relevant rights and analysing their 
dimensions, e.g. accessibility, affordability, availability, quality; and integrating the 
principles of participation, non-discrimination, transparency and accountability into the 
policy. 
</p>
<p>85. Those Guidelines, adopted in 2011 through a ministerial decree, which made their 
use compulsory, have succeeded in placing the human being at the centre of development 
planning. The gap between human rights standards and the actual living conditions of the 
people is viewed as a development challenge. 
</p>
<p>86. OHCHR and SENPLADES provided specialized training for 120 planning officials 
of the executive branch of government, which strengthened the capacity of key departments 
to work together in formulating public policies from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>87. In 2011, OHCHR and SENPLADES assessed the level of integration of the human 
rights-based approach into a national development plan, namely the National Plan for Good 
Living, 2009&#8211;2013. Their work resulted in the preparation of Guidelines for the integration 
of a human rights-based approach in the national development plan, which provide 
instructions on how to integrate a human rights-based approach into the elaboration, 
implementation and evaluation of development strategies for targeting the next National 
Development Plan, for the period 2014&#8211;2017.  
</p>
<p>88. SENPLADES, together with OHCHR and 11 other United Nations entities, the 
Centro de Planificaci&#243;n y Estudio Social and the Universidad Andina Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var, 
worked together to develop the Atlas of socioeconomic inequalities<i>.</i> The Atlas, which  was launched in 2013, constitutes an innovative database that maps persistent gaps in the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in Ecuador. It contains disaggregated 
information, including by ethnicity, sex, gender, age and region, and creates new social 
indicators to measure poverty from a multidimensional perspective.  
</p>
<p>89. The Atlas served as a baseline for the National Strategy for Poverty Eradication and 
informed the actualization of the National Development Plan for the period 2014&#8211;2017. It 
is expected to guide the formulation of targeted public policies in order to address 
inequalities. 
</p>
<p>90. The OHCHR framework on indicators is being used to increase the capacity of the 
National Development Secretariat and the managers of the National Information System to 
monitor and evaluate public policies from a human rights perspective. </p>


<p><b>  State of Palestine: a rights-based framework for development 
</b></p>
<p>91. In 2011, the Ministry of Justice of the Palestinian National Authority approached 
OHCHR to request assistance in preparing an action plan that integrated a rights-based 
framework into national development. Following consultations with the Ministry of Justice 
and the Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development, it was decided to draw up a 
document setting out more effective and implementable guidance for the incorporation of 
human rights into the Palestinian National Development Plan, 2014&#8211;2016. The guidance 
document was prepared by both ministries with the support of OHCHR consultant experts.  
</p>
<p>92. A national consultation with the relevant government departments and a broad range 
of Palestinian stakeholders contributed to identifying priority intervention areas and rights-
based targets. The guidance document on integrating human rights into Palestinian national 
development plans was approved and launched in January 2014 by the Ministry of Justice, 
the Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development and OHCHR, in a formal 
signing ceremony, thereby strengthening the Government&#8217;s commitment to the 
recommendations contained in the document. The guidance document contains significant 
and far-reaching recommendations, as well as medium- and long-term objectives. Most of 
the recommendations were integrated into the Palestinian National Development Plan in 
February 2014, providing for an unprecedented level of integration of human rights in the 
four sectors of the Plan, namely, social development, economic development, infrastructure 
and governance. 
</p>
<p>93. OHCHR in the Occupied Palestinian Territories has been working closely with the 
Palestinian authorities, as well as with the Palestine Independent Commission for Human 
Rights and civil society to monitor the implementation of the Palestinian National 
Development Plan from a human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p><b>  Serbia: developing a consultation methodology for Roma communities  
</b></p>
<p>94. In 2012, the Ombudsman, OHCHR, the Human Rights Adviser of the United 
Nations country team in Serbia and UNDP issued human rights indicators on education, 
housing, health protection, employment, re-admission and anti-discrimination to assess 
government programmes for Roma inclusion.  
</p>
<p>95. In 2013, OHCHR, in coordination with the City of Belgrade, the United Nations 
Office for Project Services, the Danish Refugee Council and the Serbian non-governmental 
organization, Housing Centre for Socially Vulnerable Groups, participated in the 
implementation of a Roma housing project funded by the European Union. 
</p><p>96. Furthermore, the Human Rights Adviser developed criteria for evaluating locations 
for Roma social housing in Belgrade, which set out the basic requirements for adequate 
housing, in line with international standards. The project was designed to address the basic 
housing needs of targeted Roma families through a human rights complaint process. The 
Human Rights Adviser has been working in close and constructive cooperation with the 
Government and municipal authorities, providing technical advice and building trust with 
all stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>97. The OHCHR contribution ensured the application throughout the implementation of 
the project of a human rights-based approach, including a gender dimension and the 
meaningful participation of all stakeholders concerned in the definition and adoption of 
decisions affecting their lives. </p>


<p><b> IV. Lessons learned, challenges and the way forward 
</b></p>
<p>98. The experiences documented in the present report bring to light several common 
aspects relating to the integration of human rights into national policies and programmes 
that have been developed with the technical support of OHCHR and which could inspire 
future requests for technical cooperation. The common aspects focus on the manner in 
which  technical cooperation programmes have been designed and implemented, so as to 
promote national ownership; meaningful involvement of and cooperation between States 
and non-State actors; institutional building; effective coordination; and application of 
suitable methodologies. Those are all key components of sustainable technical cooperation 
programmes, as identified by the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>99. Experience has shown that it is essential that all relevant State entities and partners 
be involved from the onset, so as to foster knowledge, coordination, consensus and, 
fundamentally, ownership of priorities and strategies. The involvement of all relevant State 
entities as well as a holistic approach aimed at ensuring that adequate attention is paid to 
the interdependence and interrelatedness of all civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights are critical to achieving sustainable results and ensuring clear lines of responsibility 
throughout all the stages of the programme.  
</p>
<p>100. The meaningful involvement of and cooperation between State and civil society  
actors, with particular attention to the situation and representation of groups that are 
discriminated against and/or excluded, is key to ensuring the relevance of programmes as 
well as greater transparency, legitimacy and accountability.  
</p>
<p>101. The integration of human rights standards and recommendations from international 
human rights mechanisms into national policies and programmes requires effective 
coordination, an analytical framework and a harmonious methodological approach. The 
establishment of inclusive standing coordination and follow-up mechanisms has proven a 
useful tool in that regard. All national stakeholders, including civil society actors, play a 
critical role in both supporting  implementation and providing specific thematic expertise to 
inform the development of sound national policies.
