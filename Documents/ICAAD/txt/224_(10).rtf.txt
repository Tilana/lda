Following the trial lasting 12 days the Assessors have returned with an unanimous verdict of guilty on all 3 Counts, mentioned in the information, against the Accused Sachindra Nand Sharma.

I have reviewed the evidence called in trial, and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. I find that the verdict of the assessors was not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I do accept their verdict.

I therefore find the accused Sachindra Nand Sharma guilty as charged on all three counts in the information accordingly. I convict the accused as charged.
