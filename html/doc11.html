Summary of Alleged Facts
1. The Complainant represents 14,000 Ethiopian refugees who fled Ethiopia prior to 1991 during the
Mengistu regime and lived in Sudan and were a subject of forced repatriation pursuant to a decision
adopted by the Respondent State and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
September 1999. The Complainant states that during the 1980s and early 1990s an estimated 80,000
Ethiopians entered Sudan fleeing from persecution and from events disturbing public order in Ethiopia.
2. The Complainant alleges that the current Government in Ethiopia was formed by officials of the Tigrayan
People's Liberation Front (TPLF) party, who were allies with the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party
(EPRF) during the struggle against the Mengistu regime. The supporters of the EPRP are allegedly the
main target of repression by the Ethiopian government throughout the country.
3. The Complainant alleges that all Ethiopian refugees in Sudan were previously granted asylum by the
Government of Sudan in accordance with its international obligations. The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, the agency responsible for the protection of refugees worldwide, also
honoured this recognition until September 1999.
4. The Complainant alleges that in September 1999, the Government of Sudan signed an agreement with
the UNHCR to invoke the Cessation Clauses Article 1(C) (5)
× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no
longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have
ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;
Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able
to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the
protection of the country of nationality; http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html accessed 25.10.2010
of the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees with effect from 1st March 2000.
5. The Complainant alleges that by this agreement, Ethiopian refugees in Sudan would lose their right to
work or receive any social assistance as a way of coercing them into forced repatriation back to Ethiopia.
6. The Complainant states that in February 2000, a notice was posted on the door of the UNHCR
compound in Khartoum, Sudan, entitled "Information Announcement to the Ethiopian Refugees in
Sudan"and stated in part:
The Government of Sudan represented by the Commission for Refugees (COR) and the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would like to inform all Ethiopian Refugees in Sudan of the
following:
All Ethiopian Refugees outside Ethiopia after 1st March 2000 will lose their legal refugee status. This means
all the legal rights granted by international, regional and local regulations which guarantee refugees status
or condition as stipulated in the 1951 Geneva convention generally governing that status and treatment of
refugees etc..., the legal status in respect of resolving individual cases and the right to appear before the
courts etc..., the right to acquire employment and the guarantees, the issue of comprehensive guidance
and supply of shelter, health and treatment, education, food, social security, etc ...and in conclusion, the
various administrative assistance, and permits like travel permits, employment permits, driving licences,
identity cards, residence and travel documents for travelling abroad and commercial licences etc...; all will
cease to exist forthwith. ... In light of this new situation, any Ethiopian refugee who decides to remain in the
Sudan after 1st March 2000 will bear full responsibility of the consequences which may follow as the result
of the forfeiture of his entitlements which he used to enjoy as a refugee before 1st March 2000. ... To avoid
unnecessary problems, which will occur as a result of your illegal stay in the Sudan after 1st March 2000,
we request you to seriously consider the circumstances which will assist you in taking a reasonable
decision to guarantee your safety and that of the future of your family.
7. The Complainant states that although the Government had only agreed to withdraw refugee status,
dozens of refugees reported that the UNHCR informed them that they would be deported after 1st March
2000 and that any benefits that they were receiving would cease. Furthermore, some of the refugees were
arrested, beaten, and further mistreated as a consequence of their protests against their involuntary
repatriation.
1

8. The Complainant states that the Respondent State, the UNHCR and the Government of Ethiopia entered
into an agreement to forcibly repatriate them. This action consisted of several steps, including all of the
following: the withholding of social welfare benefits such a medical attention, food, clothing, and housing
entitlements; and the implementation of an unfair screening procedure.
9. The Complainant states that some of the refugees who protested the removal of their refugee status
were sometimes arrested and deported or threatened with arrest and deportation, forcing many of them to
flee to neighbouring countries.
10. The Complainant further alleges that at the time, Ethiopia was involved in a full-scale international
armed conflict with its neighbour Eritrea.
11. The Complainant states that the UNHCR and the Respondent State agreed bi-laterally to establish a
screening procedure. The Complainant alleges that this procedure did not provide the basic minimum
standards of due process. For example, the refugees were not allowed to be legally represented; the
Government of Sudan and/or the UNHCR recruited unqualified persons to do the screening. The screening
did not take into account the 1969 African Refugee Convention or the African Charter in their evaluation of
individual cases; the screenings did not start until months after the threat of forcible refoulement had been
made, and implemented in large parts. Interpreters were recruited from the Ethiopian Embassy in Khartoum
- the embassy of the State from which they harboured or had a recognised, well-founded fear of
persecution.
12. The Complainant states that some of the refugees had lived and settled in Sudan for up to thirty years;
that many of them are opponents of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and
the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), ruling the country since 1991. The Complainant states that
many refugees feared that they would be sent to the Ethiopia/Eritrea warfront, due to the war which was
ongoing during the whole of 2000 or that they would be mistreated or even killed by the Ethiopian
Government.
13. The Complainant states that some of the refugees, such as Mr Luel Kassa, who was forced to return in
early 2001, were arrested upon return; and others fled Ethiopia again to Sudan or a third country as soon
as they were able to.
14. The Complainant states further that many of the estimated 14,000 Ethiopian refugees who are still living
in Sudan do not wish to return to Ethiopia because they have a well-founded fear of persecution or because
they are fleeing the war and famine in Ethiopia.
15. The Complainant states that in March 2001, more than 1,700 Ethiopian refugees in Port Sudan and
Khartoum staged a hunger strike to protest their return. Their main complaint: the unfair process for
determining their status.
16. Since March 2001, the Complainant has contacted the Government of Sudan and the UNHCR in an
effort to resolve this matter, but without success.
17. The Complainant states that although some refugees were allowed to stay in Sudan, others remained
without the consent of the Government of Sudan and feared the prospect of immediate deportation without
due process of law. The Complainant further alleges that many of these refugees live in inhuman conditions
after being denied the basic necessities of life.

Complaint
18. The Complainant alleges violations of Articles 4, 5, 6, 12(3), (4) and (5) of the African Charter on
Human and Peoples' Rights (African Charter).

parties.
43. On 10th February 2004, the Complainant requested the African Commission to reconsider its decision
on admissibility and requested an oral hearing at the next Ordinary Session.
44. During the 35th Ordinary Session, the Commission considered the request to reconsider its decision on
admissibility, and deferred it to the 36th Ordinary Session. The Commission requested the Secretariat to
3

inform both parties of the decision and deferred consideration of the matter to the 37th Ordinary Session.
The same decision was communicated to the parties. The Secretariat requested them to submit additional
arguments on admissibility. A copy of the Complainant's brief was forwarded to the Respondent State,
which was duly requested to forward its response.
45. On 25th October 2005, the African Commission informed the Complainant of its decision to grant him an

Law
Admissibility
70. The African Commission recalls that it declared the communication inadmissible during the 34th
Ordinary Session of the Commission. The Complainant filed a request for the reopening of the case during
the 35th Ordinary Session. This request was considered during the 36th Ordinary Session.
71. When declaring the communication inadmissible, the African Commission stated the following: Although
the parties have not provided the African Commission in writing with further written submissions on the
issue of local remedies, the African Commission is in a position to rule on the admissibility of this
communication by making reference to the written submissions of the Complainant (received on 13th March
2001) and those of the Respondent State (received during the 30th Ordinary session) as well as the oral
submissions submitted by both parties during the 33rd Ordinary Session.
72. The Complainant alleges that there were no effective local remedies against the Government's threat to
forcibly repatriate the Ethiopian refugees. The refugees had been denied the right to legal representation
during the hearings that were aimed at determining whether there was any risk if they returned to Ethiopia
to be tortured or be subjected to inhuman, degrading and cruel treatment.
73. The Complainant submits that the procedure for repatriation agreed to by the UNHCR and Sudan was
unacceptable for the following reasons: firstly, the Ethiopian refugees were given no opportunity to make
representations during the decision - making process, despite public announcements to this effect.
Secondly, most of the interpreters/translators were taken from the Ethiopian Embassy, the country from
which the refugees were fleeing and they could therefore have been biased or prejudiced.
74. The Complainant adds that the Respondent State denied visas to the legal representatives of the
refugees. By failing to ensure that the refugees were given a fair hearing in matters concerning their human
rights under the African Charter, the Respondent State had by doing so denied them the right to access
local effective remedies.
75. The Respondent State argued that there had been no complaint against illegal or forced repatriation of
Ethiopians, and that this communication does not contain any concrete indication in this regard. The
Respondent State acknowledges that it understood the situation in Ethiopia was not favourable to those
who feared persecution in their country of origin, but reassured the African Commission that every
repatriation procedure in this case followed the principle of the Convention signed between Sudan,
Ethiopia, and the UNHCR.
76. Furthermore, the Respondent State submitted that the Complainant neither approached the UNHCR
nor any Court or administrative body to rule on any allegations of violation committed during the process of
repatriation. The Complainant could have submitted an administrative application or referred the matter to
the competent courts available in Sudan.
77. The Respondent State informed the African Commission that Article 20 of the 1996 Code of
Administrative Courts gives the Complainant the right to lodge an appeal against any administrative
decision. An appeal could have been lodged in the Supreme Court against any administrative decision
taken by the President of the Republic, the Federal Council of Ministers, the Government of any region or
Federal or Regional Minister. The African Commission notes that the Complainant in this communication
makes no mention of any attempt on his part to access the available local remedies in the Respondent
State.
78. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares that communication inadmissible for
non-exhaustion of local remedies.

5

Commission's Decision on Review

79. The Commission accepted the Complainant's request to reconsider its decision on the basis of the
submission by the Complainant that the Commission had not addressed itself to its jurisprudence,
regarding the exceptions to the exhaustion of local remedies rule, in particular the non-applicability of
domestic remedies to situations of massive violation of human rights, as is alleged in this instance.
80. The Commission reconsidered its decision under Rule 118(2) of the African Commission's Rules of
Procedure. Rule 118(2) reads as follows: If the Commission has declared a communication inadmissible
under the Charter, it may reconsider this decision at a later date if it receives a request for reconsideration.
81. Rule 118(2) does not stipulate the conditions under which the Commission may reconsider its previous
decision. The Commission may exercise its discretionary powers to reconsider its decision upon a party
moving it, and adducing compelling reasons. The Commission is called upon at all times to protect human
and peoples' rights. A decision to reconsider its decision must be aimed at protecting human and peoples'
rights.
82. Further to that general principle, a party seeking the reconsideration or review of a decision must show
that the Commission failed to take into account the criteria set out in Article 56 of the Charter, or it erred in
reaching the decision it did. The review must be based on the same facts as was initially before the
Commission. A party cannot introduce new facts or information at the review stage.
83. The Commission has in the past, based on its jurisprudence, held that the requirement of exhaustion of
local remedies does not hold ".... where it is impractical or undesirable for the Complainants or victim to
seize the domestic courts."1
84. Based on the above reasons the Commission reconsidered and departed from its previous decision
and considered the parties' submissions on admissibility.
Decision on admissibility

85. The admissibility of the communications submitted under the African Charter is governed by Article 56
of the African Charter. Of the seven conditions stipulated by this article, six have been met. The seventh
which is Article 56(5), stipulates that:
communications shall be considered if they [quote]"are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless
it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged... .
86. The Respondent State claims that the Complainant did not exhaust local remedies. It stressed that the
Complainant had the right to lodge an appeal against any administrative decision in accordance with Article
20 of the 1996 Code of Administrative Courts, and they could lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court
against any administrative decision taken by the President of the Republic, the Federal Council of
Ministers, the Government of any region or to the Federal or Regional Minister.
87. The Complainant submits that the African Commission has held that "the rule of exhausting domestic
remedies is the most important condition for admissibility of Communications. There is no doubt therefore,
in all communications seized by the African Commission, the first requirement considered concerns the
exhausting of local remedies...."2 The Complainant argues that the reason for this rule has been defined by
the Commission as a two-fold test. First, it is to give domestic courts an opportunity to decide upon cases
before they are brought to an international forum. If a right is not well provided for at the domestic level,
there cannot be effective remedies at all.3
88. Second, the Complainant states that the Respondent State should have notice of a human rights
violation in order to have the opportunity to remedy such violation before submitting them to an international
tribunal.4 The Complainant submits that the Respondent State was aware of the refugees' situation for
years and did not act to protect them. The Complainant alleges that there can be no doubt that the
Respondent State Government had been put on notice of the situation giving rise to this communication.
Such notice was given by the refugees themselves communicating with the Government; the
communications of the refugees' legal representatives with the Government and coverage of the plight of
the refugees by the news media.
89. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State responded to these communications by denying
any responsibility for the plight of the refugees. The Complainant states that, because of the serious
violations of human rights that have occurred, the requirement that the refugees resort to domestic
remedies should be deemed waived and the Commission should consider the merits of this
6

communication.
90. The Complainant claims that when interpreting Article 56(5) of the Charter, the African Commission
should take into consideration generally recognised principles of international law in the interest of ensuring
the protection of human rights.5
91. The Complainant submits that the Commission has unequivocally held that when a Respondent State
raises the defence of non exhaustion of local remedies, it must discharge the burden by demonstrating the
existence of such remedies."6
92. The Complainant urges the African Commission to draw inspiration from regional and international
human rights mechanisms on this issue. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has repeatedly
affirmed that a state has duties "to organise the governmental apparatus and, in general, all the structures
through which public power is exercised, so that they are capable of judicially ensuring the free and full
enjoyment of human rights." 7 The Court held that "the State claiming non-exhaustion of domestic remedies
has an obligation to prove that the domestic remedies remain to be exhausted and that they are effective."8
93. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressly stated that the burden of proving that
effective local remedies exist and that they had not been exhausted fell upon the government making such
a claim.9
94. A similar view regarding the burden of proof was taken by the United Nations Human Rights Committee
whereby a Respondent State "...had failed to provide.... sufficient information on effective remedies."10
Equally, the European Court and Commission of Human Rights have held that the government shoulders
the burden of proving that there are effective remedies.
95. Similarly, the Grand Chamber of the European Court for Human Rights has expressed the opinion that
"it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to satisfy the Court that
the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time."11 The Court
continued:" ...that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in
respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success."12 Only once this
burden of proof has been met does the petitioner have to establish that the local remedy "was in fact
exhausted or for some reason inadequate or ineffective in the particular circumstances."13
96. The Complainant urges the Commission to apply the standards articulated above, which require the
Respondent State to prove that effective local remedies exist in Sudan and that they are reasonably
accessible. The Complainant submits further that it is evident that the Respondent State has not met this
burden of proof. It has not shown that the refugees had adequate and effective remedies. The Government
had itself prevented refugees accessing any remedies - irrespective of their effectiveness and adequacy that it alleges are available.
97. The Complainant submits that communication 235/00 involves massive and serious violations of human
rights. He states that the African Commission has found that actions threatening the life and welfare of less
than a thousand people amount to serious and massive violations of human rights.14
98. The Complainant alleges that the present communication involves more than fourteen thousand
(14,000) Ethiopian Refugees, whose daily survival is threatened and who cannot approach the authorities
for fear that their refugee identity documents would be confiscated and they would be deported without the
due process of law.
99. The Complainant states that the Respondent State has suggested that the refugees could have
theoretically relied on Administrative and Constitutional procedures in "Article 20 of the 1996 Constitutional
and Administrative code, and in accordance with Article 120 (2)(b) of the Constitution." The Complainant
alleges that this would not have been an adequate remedy because the Judiciary in Sudan is not
independent.
100. The Complainant points to the fact that the Commission noted that the Respondent State had
dismissed over 100 judges when it came to power approximately twelve years earlier.15 The Complainant
further alleges that since 1989, the appointment of Judges is done in close coordination with the President.
The Complainant goes on to state that the 1998 Constitution of Sudan intentionally enhanced the powers of
the President.16
101. The Complainant alleges that on 12th December 1999, the President declared a State of Emergency
and prolonged his control over the Judiciary until 2001. Cases brought to the Court challenging this
declaration of emergency have been dismissed with little or no attention to international human rights law.
Instead the Courts have relied on vague references to customary presidential powers that override the
clear words of the Constitution.17 The Complainant concludes that the Sudanese Courts have been under
the control of the Sudanese Executive since 1989, and that an independent judiciary does not exist in
7

Sudan.
102. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has no system in place that can protect human
rights in the overwhelming majority of cases. He points to examples of Amal Aba al-Ajab v. Government of
Sudan case in which the Court refused to apply international human rights law.18 He also points to a similar
situation in the case of Abdelraham et al v. Sudan, Case No. 7/98 of 13th August 1998. 19
103. The Complainant submits that the lack of independence of the judiciary is the result of several steps
taken by the Sudanese Government since it came to power in 1989. He cites the reports of Mr Leonard
Franco, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan as well as numerous
non-governmental organisations to demonstrate the lack of independence of the judiciary in Sudan.20
104. The Complainant argues that although a new Constitution was adopted on 1st July 1998, the
Executive still exercises broad powers over the Judiciary: Section 5 of the Constitutional decree 13/1995,
entitled 'Powers of the President' provides that ... "the President shall be the Guardian of the Judiciary and
the Council of Justice in accordance with the Constitution and the Law" , ... "A Judge shall be guided by the
concept of supremacy of the Constitution, Law and general guidance of Sharia." Section 61 (1-3) provides
that: "The Judiciary is responsible before the President for the performance of its functions effectively and
honestly for the prevalence of justice; its function is to adjudicate fairly in constitutional, administrative,
family, civil and criminal disputes and to exercise its judgment in accordance with the law."
105. The Complainant alleges that Sudan is ruled under a State of Emergency whereby the president
exercises almost complete control over the executive, legislative and judicial functions. The Complainant
alleges further that for the foregoing reasons, no adequate and effective remedies exist in Sudan that the
refugees should be required to exhaust.
106. The Complainant submits that in the present case, the Respondent State has repeatedly denied the
victims access to their legal representative, Dr Curtis F. J. Doebbler, by repeatedly refusing to grant him a
visa to enter the country. The Government has also failed to make facilities available to the refugees, even
when they are in custody, to contact their legal representative.
107. The Complainant rejected the submission by the Respondent State that redress by way of an appeal
to the UNHCR or an appeal to the Sudanese Courts was available to the refugees.
108. He submitted that neither of these means of redress was adequate. An appeal to the UNHCR was
ineffective because the refugees were denied legal representation. He argues that UNHCR decision
makers refused to apply the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the 1969 OAU Convention
Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa. Secondly, appeals to the Sudanese
Courts were not possible, because there was no decision made by a Sudanese administrative body.
109. The Complainant submitted that the Respondent State denied responsibility for the protection of
Ethiopian refugees under its jurisdiction.
110. The Complainant stated that the Sudanese Government's position is in contrast to the position
expressed by the Commission, that: "the Charter specifies in Article 1 that the State Parties shall not only
recognise the rights, duties and freedoms adopted by the Charter, but they should also
"undertake.....measures to give effect to them." Therefore, if a State neglects to ensure the rights in the
African Charter, this can constitute a violation, even if the State or its agents are not the immediate cause
of the violation.21
111. The Complainant submitted further that the process offered by the UNHCR was flawed in several
serious matters. Despite repeated requests to represent the refugees in procedures before the UNHCR, the
refugees were denied the right to legal representation.
112. The UNHCR recruited translators from the Ethiopian Embassy in Sudan to interview the
Complainants. Because the procedures applied by UNHCR, did not apply the most basic standards of due
process, it cannot be considered effective or adequate for protecting the rights of the refugees that are
guaranteed in the African Charter.
113. Moreover, the Complainant submitted that the right to appeal from procedures that do not meet the
standards of due process is illusionary and cannot be deemed an effective remedy. The refugees could not
appeal a decision by the UNHCR to the Sudanese administrative bodies. Only administrative decisions
made by Sudanese Government authorities may be appealed. The Government of Sudan itself admitted
that it had nothing to do with the decision of the UNHCR. Consequently, there was no domestic remedy
that could adequately and effectively protect the victims' human rights.
114. The Respondent State reiterated its position that the Complainant neither approached the UNHCR nor
any court or administrative body to denounce the alleged violation of the rights of pre-1991 Ethiopian
refugees. The Respondent State stressed that the Complainant could have challenged the manner in which
8

the repatriation exercise was carried out by lodging an appeal to the Supreme Court in accordance with
Article 20 of the 1996 Code of Administrative Courts. Article 20 of the Code provides that anyone can lodge
an appeal to the Supreme Court against any administrative decision taken by the President of the Republic,
the Federal Council of Ministers, the Government of any region or Federal or Regional Minister.
115. The Respondent State added that the Complainant did not cite any case of refugees who had been
illegally or forcibly returned to Ethiopia. The Respondent State acknowledged that the situation prevailing in
Ethiopia in March 2000 was not favourable to the repatriation of those refugees fearing persecution in their
country of origin. It stated however that the repatriation process followed the principles laid down in the
Trilateral Agreement signed between the Government of Sudan, the Government of Ethiopia and the
UNHCR in August 2000.
116. The African Commission is of the view that, even if certain domestic remedies were available, it was
not reasonable to expect refugees to seize the Sudanese Courts of their complaints, given their extreme
vulnerability and state of deprivation, their fear of being deported and their lack of adequate means to seek
legal representation. The Commission notes that the refugees' legal representative was repeatedly denied
entry into the country by the Respondent State's authorities.
117. Furthermore, even accepting the argument of the Respondent State that the refugees could have
challenged the decision to repatriate them before the Administrative Courts or appealed to the Supreme
Court, the Commission holds the view, which it has stated oftentimes before, that where the violations
involve many victims, it becomes neither practical nor desirable for the Complainants or the victims to
pursue such internal remedies in every case of violation of human rights.22
For all these reasons, the African Commission declares this communication admissible.
Consideration of Merits
118. The present communication alleges that the Respondent State has violated the human rights of an
estimated fourteen thousand Ethiopian refugees, following the invocation by the UNHCR of the Cessation
Clause under Article 1(C)(5)
× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no
longer, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognised as a refugee have
ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;
Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able
to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the
protection of the country of nationality(http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html accessed 25.10.2010)
of the 1951 United Nations Refugees Convention.
Complainant's submission on the Merits

119. The Complainant states that sometime in September 1999, the Respondent State and the UNHCR
concluded an agreement, which inter alia stipulated that by 1st March 2000 Ethiopian refugees in Sudan
would lose their right to work or receive any social assistance as a way of coercing them into forced
repatriation.
120. The Complainant states that the said refugees were subsequently repatriated involuntarily to Ethiopia,
or were threatened with arrest or involuntary repatriation by the Respondent State upon protesting the
repatriation. Others were forced to leave Sudan for third countries.
121. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State violated Articles 4, 5, 6, 12(3), (4), and (5) of the
African Charter as a result of the failure to protect the Ethiopian refugees against the involuntary
repatriation, and from threats of arrest. He states further that by failing to protect the refugees, it forced
them to live under inhumane conditions, without the basic necessities of life. The Complainant is alleging
that the Ethiopians are de facto refugees, and thus protected by Articles 12 of the African Charter of Human
and Peoples' Rights.
122. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has an obligation to ensure respect for the right
9

to life, the right to humane treatment and the right to security of person for every individual under its
jurisdiction. It also has an obligation under Articles 7 of the African Charter, which requires that every
individual has a right to a fair determination of his human rights as protected in the Charter.
123. The Complainant draws the attention of the African Commission to Articles 60 of the Charter, to draw
inspiration from the UN Convention on Refugees of 195123 and the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the
Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, instruments which the Respondent State has signed and
ratified24 when determining the meaning of the above articles in the Charter in relation to those instruments.
124. The Complainant argues that since the African Charter is a treaty that is later in time, than either the
UN Refugees Convention, or the African refugees convention, the general principle of international law to
be applied to resolve any conflict between treaties is that the latter treaty prevails over the former treaty that
are not compatible. The Complainant relies on Article 30(3)
× When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not
terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its
provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 25 which states that "the earlier treaty applies only to the
extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the latter treaty." He argues that by applying this
principle, any provisions of the UN refugees convention that are incompatible with either the African
refugee convention or the Charter must be deemed to be overridden by these latter two instruments.
125. The Commission wishes to state that it does not find any conflict or incompatibility between the African
Charter and the two refugees' convention, or between the UN and the OAU refugees conventions. The
1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa 1969 OAU
Convention stipulates that it is a complement to the 1951 UN Refugees Convention. Paragraph 9 of its
preamble recognises the 1951 UN Convention and the 1967 Protocol as the basic and universal
instruments relating to the status of refugees. Article VIII of the OAU Convention enjoins Member States to
cooperate with the UNHCR, and states further that the OAU Convention is a regional complement to the
1951 UN Convention.
126. In that respect the Commission shall read the provisions of the three instruments as complementing
each other. The Complainant's argument that the provisions of the latter convention prevail over the former
do not in any way affect the interpretation the Commission will give to the applicable provisions, should it be
necessary to do so under this communication. This is because the provisions are at most complementary to
each other and not mutually exclusive.
127. Concerning the said violations, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State did not deny the
facts as presented; rather it has merely alleged that the problem is the responsibility of the UNHCR. He
states that both the Government of Sudan and the UNHCR recognised all of the refugees in the 1990s. The
Complainant states that while the Respondent State claims that the refugees no longer need protection, the
refugees, nevertheless, refute this claim. He argues that the refugees still deserve protection and, at the
very least, they deserve a fair process to determine this question in each of their individual cases. He
argues that since the Respondent State has denied the refugees protection, and a fair determination
process, it is necessary to examine the de jure status individually.
128. The Complainant argues that both customary international law and the African Charter provide special
protection to individuals who are unable to seek the protection of their own country. These persons refugees and asylum seekers - are recognised as being in particularly vulnerable positions. States are
under a legal obligation to consider refugees' claims to protection through a fair procedure and to provide
them protection if their claims are found to be well-founded.
129. Referring the Commission to Articles 12 of the African Charter, the Complainant argues that the
Charter specifically recognises the need to protect such individuals, notwithstanding that it does not define
in detail who qualifies as a refugee, except to describe them as any person who is persecuted. He goes on
to state that the second preambular paragraph
× Considering that the African Charter, while guaranteeing the freedom of movement and freedom of
residence of every individual within a state subject to being law abiding, recognises that when persecuted,
every individual shall have the right to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance with the
respective laws of the said countries, and international law,
of Resolution No. 72/(XXXVI)/04, creating the Commission's Special Rapporteur, reiterates this protection,
while also drawing States' attention to their obligations under relevant international instruments. 26

10

130. The Complainant further argues that the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is lex specialis
in relation to the African Charter.27
131. He argues that the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa is lex
specialis to both the Charter and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. He states that this
instrument elaborates and strengthens the definition of a refugee deserving the protection of asylum. This
treaty, he maintains, extends the definition of a refugee by stating in paragraph 2 of Article 1 that not only is
a refugee a person as described by the UN Refugees Convention, but also that:
[t]he term "refugee" shall also apply to every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign
domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or
nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place
outside his country of origin or nationality.
132. The Complainant concludes that, in the instance case, this expanded definition applies to the
Ethiopian refugees in addition to the definition in the UN Refugee Convention. This expanded definition
must also be the basis of the interpretation and implementation of Article 12 by the Commission because it
provides individuals cumulatively the most adequate protection of their human rights in accordance with the
international legal obligations that the Government of Sudan has voluntarily undertaken.
Respondent State's Submission on the Merits

133. The Respondent State in its submission states that Sudan is always committed to the implementation
of international human rights instruments and continues to cooperate with the UN High Commission for
Refugees which has the responsibility of monitoring international and regional conventions on refugees.
134. The Respondent State denies all the Complainant's allegations. It argues that as a signatory to the
African Charter and various refugee instruments, it was merely cooperating with the UNHCR "...in
performing its functions, and assist it in facilitating its duties and carrying out its assignments to monitor and
implement the provisions" of the Geneva Convention.28 The Respondent State argues that refugees are
only entitled to receive support from the UN, where fear from persecution which caused him/her to flee, still
persists.
135. The Respondent State argues that following the fall of Mengistu's regime in 1991, the UNHCR was of
the view that the circumstances which led to the flight of Ethiopians to Sudan and to the other countries of
the world, no longer existed. The Respondent State states that the UNHCR believed that the situation in
Ethiopia after Mengistu's fall had sufficiently changed for the return of large numbers of refugees to that
country. It nevertheless argues that the announcement of the Termination of Refugee Status for Ethiopian
refugees was not supposed to take place before an adequate period of time elapsed, to ensure stability and
sustainability of the change in the country of origin.
136. The Respondent State, quoting Article 1(c) para. 1-6
× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: 1) He has
voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or 2) Having lost his
nationality, he has voluntarily re-acquired it, or 3) He has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the
protection of the country of his new nationality; or 4) He has voluntarily re-established himself in the country
which he left or outside which he remained owing to fear of persecution; or 5) He can no longer, because
the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist,
continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; Provided that this
paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able to invoke
compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the
country of nationality; 6) Being a person who has no nationality he is, because of the circumstances in
connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, able to return to the
country of his former habitual residence;
of the 1951 UN Refugees Convention, which defines the six conditions under which refugee status ceases,
argues that in the case of the Ethiopian refugees, the conditions no longer justified their continued stay in
Sudan. The Respondent State argues that these six conditions are based on the consideration that
international protection is not usually granted when it is not justified.
137. It cites the Cessation Clause, Article 1(C)(5)
× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no
longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have
11

ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;
Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able
to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the
protection of the country of nationality;
as the source of the current dispute, which was not only directed at the Ethiopian refugees in Sudan, but to
Ethiopian refugees elsewhere in the world. The Respondent State argues that indeed the UNHCR had
issued similar Cessation Clauses in the past for other refugees from Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa and Chile, when the situation in those countries normalised. The Respondent State
submitted that since Sudan hosts a large number of Ethiopian refugees, to avoid the consequences which
a hasty implementation would cause to the refugees and to the Sudanese as well, it requested the Third
Committee of the United Nations in New York for a gradual implementation of the Cessation Clause to the
Ethiopian refugees in the Sudan.
138. The Respondent State states that a Tripartite Agreement between Sudan, Ethiopia and the UNHCR
was executed in 1993. Under this Agreement a programme of voluntary repatriation began to be
implemented in 1993 and continued into 1998. The Respondent State submits further that, according to this
Agreement, 720,000 refugees returned voluntarily. However, at the end of the programme, a considerable
number of the refugees remained in the Sudan.
139. The Respondent State stated that, both Ethiopia and Sudan requested the UNHCR on 29th December
1999 and 1st February 2000 respectively for a postponement of the repatriation due to the outbreak of the
war with Eritrea. The Respondent State, Ethiopia and the UNHCR later concluded another Tripartite
Agreement on 25th August 2000 to repatriate refugees at the end of the war with Eritrea, and the end of the
rainy season.
140. The August 2000 agreement provided, inter alia, for transport modalities, provision of return packages
for the returnees, such as cups, blankets, food allowances and other non food items. It also established a
mechanism for a residual caseload of individuals with compelling reasons for international protection, and
those who for social and economic reasons wished to remain in Sudan.
141. A screening process was carried out jointly by the Sudanese Commission on Refugees and the
UNHCR to determine those who continued to need international protection. It was agreed that the
regularisation for those wishing to remain in Sudan was a matter for bilateral discussion between the two
governments. The screening process was envisaged to end in November 2000. Repatriation would be
conducted between 1st and 31st December 2000, since food and funding would not be available in 2001.
The implementation for repatriation was delayed to a later date (14th March 2001) to allow for proper
implementation and assessment.
142. The Respondent State argues that the UNHCR brought in the best cadres serving in different parts of
the world to take part in this exercise, so as to ensure equity and justice. The Respondent State submits
that the repatriation was voluntary. It denies that any refugees were imprisoned, tortured or were subjected
to involuntary return. It submits further that no person was denied social services, such as medical care,
food or shelter. Assistance was extended to refugees throughout up to their final place of residence. Those
remaining were assisted until all phases of the implementation of the cessation clause were exhausted,
including the reconciliation of their legal status.
143. The Respondent State submitted further that of those who did not opt for voluntary repatriation, 282
were granted protection, while 2753 were not. The determination was done in accordance with the 1977
UNHCR Executive Committee (EXCOM) decision, which requires Member States to adopt comprehensive
procedures to ensure that asylum seekers are given adequate time to make an appeal for reconsideration
of a decision to accredit them, to the same committee or another authority.
144. By June 2001, the Respondent State had registered 7,072 Ethiopians from both the 1993 to 1998, and
the 2000 repatriation phases and issued them with an annually renewable residence permits, pursuant to
UNHCR Executive Committee (EXCOM) decision No 69, which requires Member States implementing the
cessation clause to make appropriate arrangements to enable persons expected to leave the country to
take care of strong family and other social and economic engagements.
145. The Respondent State drew that attention of the Commission to the date the communication was
received at the Commission's Secretariat on the 22nd February 2000. It submitted that the Communication
was received prior to the date of the implementation of the Cessation clause. The Respondent State
submitted that "10,000 Ethiopian refugees actually returned to their country voluntarily in the wake of the
implementation of the clause... ." It argues that such returnees cannot be deemed to be included in the
communication.
12

Commission's Decision on Merits

146. The present communication turns on issues relating to the application of two important principles in
international refugee and human rights law. The first issue is the effect of the Cessation Clause and its
application under the 1951 United Nations Convention on Status of Refugees vis-a-vis a State Party to the
African Charter. The second issue is the applicability of the non-refoulement principle based on the actions
taken by the Respondent State as a consequence of the Cessation Clause. The African Commission is
therefore required to determine whether or not the Respondent State, in applying the Cessation Clause,
acted in a manner which amounted to the refoulement of refugees to their country of origin where they
feared persecution, and hence constituting a violation of the African Charter.
147. Before analysing the instant case, it is important to clarify these concepts, namely the "cessation
clause," "refoulement"and "non-refoulement."
148. Article 1(C)(5)
× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no
longer, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognised as a refugee have
ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;
Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able
to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the
protection of the country of nationality;
of the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees stipulates one of the six conditions which brings to
an end the refugee status and hence the protection hitherto enjoyed by a refugee during asylum in a host
country, after fleeing persecution or the fear of persecution in his/her home country. Article 1(C)(5) of the
1951 UN Refugees Convention reads as follows:
[t]his Convention shall cease to apply to any person, (i.e. a refugee) if [h]e can no longer, because the
circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist,
continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;
Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee ...who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising
out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality.
149. The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa
stipulates a cessation clause of its own. Article 1(4)(e) reads as follows: [t]his Convention shall cease to
apply to any refugee if (s)he can no longer, because of the circumstances in connection with which he was
recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the
country of his nationality.
According to the two conventions the status of a refugee ceases when circumstances which caused the
person to assume refugee status cease to exist. Such a person can no longer refuse the protection of his or
her country. International protection is granted to refugees because they do not enjoy the protection of their
own home countries. The Cessation Clause does not apply when compelling reasons arising out of
previous persecution force a person to refuse the protection of ones country.
150. "Non-refoulement", on the other hand, is a principle which has taken an increasingly fundamental
character, as one of the cornerstones of international refugee law. It prohibits the return of an individual to a
country in which he or she may be persecuted.29 This principle is set out in the 1951 UN Refugee
Convention, Article 33 (1)] which states that: "No Contracting State shall expel or return ("refouler") a
refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be
threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or
political opinion."30
151. The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa31
enshrines the principle of non-refoulement in Article 2(3) of this Convention. It reads as follows: "[n]o
person shall be subjected by a Member State to measures such as rejection at the frontier, return or
expulsion, which would compel him to return to or remain in a territory where his life, physical integrity or
liberty[/quote] would be threatened for the reasons set out in paragraphs 1 and 2."
152. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1 of the OAU Convention define the conditions which compel an
individual to flee the country of his habitual residence and seek asylum in another country.
153. Having seen the applicable provisions, it is incumbent upon the Commission to determine whether the
13

Respondent State violated the African Charter.
154. The Complainant submitted that the Respondent State denied 14,000 Ethiopian refugees the
protection they deserved and a fair determination process when it executed a joint agreement with the
UNHCR in September 1999, giving effect to the cessation clause by 1st March 2000.
155. Did the actions of the Respondent State, in executing the joint agreement in September 1999 and
posting the notice in February 2000, amount to committing a refoulement, i.e. the act of expelling the
refugees? The mere execution of the agreement and posting of the notice did not constitute an act
amounting to an expulsion or repatriation. The September 1999 and the subsequent notice clearly
expressed the intent to apply the Cessation Clause. They created an atmosphere which triggered this
communication even before the Cessation Clause implementation was set in motion. The repatriation
process under the refugee conventions is conducted in a voluntary manner.
156. The Respondent State, being a party to the September 1999 agreement was thus responsible for
whatever action that would follow the execution of the said agreement. The Respondent State cannot
blame the UNHCR for its own actions. The Respondent State has however stated that it did not refoule the
refugees. It has submitted that it did not forcibly repatriate them; it did not imprison them nor deny them the
basic necessities of life as alleged by the Complainant.
157. The Respondent State denied that it repatriated refugees during the Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict. In fact
it submitted that both Ethiopia and itself requested the UNHCR to postpone the repatriation during the
Ethiopian Eritrean War. Repatriation resumed after the end of the conflict when a tripartite agreement was
concluded in August 2000. The agreement provided for voluntary repatriation, inclusive of UNHCR
assistance to the returnees as well as modalities for determination of a caseload of refugees who did not
opt to be repatriated.
158. The Respondent State stated that the refugees were not denied assistance, in spite of the notice, till
the end of the repatriation programme. 282 refugees continued receiving protection after the cessation
clause.
159. The Complainant alleged that the Respondent State had mistreated the refugees for protesting their
forcible repatriation. He alleged that the refugees were beaten, arrested, forcefully repatriated, and in other
cases were threatened with forced repatriation for demanding to remain in Sudan for fear of persecution if
they were returned to Ethiopia.
160. The African Commission wishes to state that the accounts by the two parties about the events
subsequent to the Cessation Clause differ in certain respects. The Complainant, who claimed to represent
14,000 refugees, submitted that many of the refugees did not want to return to Ethiopia because they were
aligned to the opposition EPRP and feared persecution. The Respondent State submitted that most of the
pre-1991 refugees returned. A substantial number were granted further protection and others were issued
with residence permits due to family or socio-economic reasons. The Respondent State argues that by
June 2001 it had issued residence permits to more than 7000 refugees who did not opt to be repatriated. At
the same time it stated that other post 1991 refugees who had fled the current Ethiopian regime continued
to remain in Sudan.
161. The African Commission has not found any substantive reasons to doubt the account by the
Respondent State. The African Commission holds that thousands of refugees repatriated voluntarily under
the tripartite arrangements and those who remained were accorded refugee status or assumed normal
immigrant status upon being granted residence permits.
162. The African Commission states, however, that the allegations made by the Complainant could have
been a case of a few refugees who feared the worst during the time immediately after the Cessation Clause
was announced. The fear of the unknown by a substantial number of refugees who were able to
communicate with their lawyer as well as the publicity generated by press reports, coupled with the
frustrations of denial of visas by the Respondent State to the Complainant, compounded the perception that
the Respondent State was about to refoule the refugees.
163. The Commission has found no evidence that refugees were refouled as a result of the cessation
clause. The Commission has not established any cases of imprisonment, arrest, and forcible repatriation.
There was no concrete evidence brought to the attention of the Commission to the effect that such cases, if
any, were linked to the promulgation and implementation of the cessation clause. The Respondent State
demonstrated by providing figures, which were not refuted, of refugees who repatriated voluntarily prior to
and after the cessation clause, as well as those who were granted further protection or alternative solutions
to repatriation. The Complainant allegations that Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the African Charter were violated
have not been proved.
14

164. The Complainant argues that Article 7 of the African Charter requires that every individual has a right
to a fair determination of the human rights protected in the Charter.
165. The Respondent State denied that it violated Article 7 of the African Charter. It argued that there is no
uniform process for determination of refugee status and appeals under the international refugee regime. It
stated that it had established a joint determination mechanism involving the Sudanese Commission of
Refugees and the UNHCR to carry out determination for the refugees who did not opt for voluntary
repatriation under EXCOM decision No 69. The Commission, while reiterating the need to adopt judicial
remedies in the event of the failure of such administrative mechanisms, takes note of the EXCOM
stipulated mechanism for the reconsideration of decisions by the same committee or another authority, in
the event of dissatisfaction with a decision of the Joint Committee.
166. The Commission wishes to state that the Complainant raised issues which, in actual fact, had been
taken care of. The Communication appears to have been instituted before the implementation of the
Cessation Clause began. Hence when implementation began, the alleged violation of the refugees' rights
expressed by the Complainant was eventually taken care of by the Respondent State.
167. The Complainant submitted that the refugees continued to consider themselves as de facto refugees
post-the cessation clause based on paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Article 12 of the African Charter:
(3) Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in
accordance with the law of those countries and international conventions. (4) A non-national legally
admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be expelled from it by virtue of a
decision taken in accordance with the law. (5) The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited.
Mass expulsion shall be that which is aimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.
Going by the aforesaid submission, the Commission finds that based on the information before it, there
were only cases of refugees who repatriated voluntarily, or those who remained within the Respondent
State under various recognised legal status, namely those who retained their status or those who became
immigrants upon the grant of residence permits, and the post-1991 refugees who were, in any case, not the
subject of the Communication. The Commission, therefore, finds that there was at no time any case of de
facto refugees.
The Commission finds that the Communication was filed in anticipation of a violation, which did not happen
in actual fact after the implementation of the cessation clause set in motion.
168. The Complainant's allegation that Article 12 of the African Charter was violated has also not been
proved.

Decision of the African Commission

The African Commission finds that the allegations concerning violations of Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12(3), (4)
and (5) of the African Charter have not been proved.

× The Court wishes to stress that it has established criteria that must be taken into consideration in this
case. Indeed, the generally accepted principles of international law, to which the rule of exhaustion of
domestic remedies refers, indicate, first, that this a rule that may be waived, either expressly or by
implication, by the State having the right to invoke it, as this Court has already recognized (see Viviana
Gallardo et al. [Judgment of November 13, 1981], No. G 101/81. Series A, para. 26). Second, the objection
asserting non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, to be timely, must be made at an early stage of the
proceedings by the State entitled to make it, lest a waiver of the requirement be presumed. Third, the State
claiming non-exhaustion has an obligation to prove that domestic remedies remain to be exhausted and
that they are effective (Velásquez Rodríguez Case, Preliminary Objections, Judgment of June 26, 1987.

× An independent and impartial judiciary is a prerequisite for respect for the rule of law and protection of
individual rights against abuse of power on the part of the executive or legislative branches of government.
Article 101 (1) provides that "judges are independent in the performance of their duties and have full judicial
16

competence with respect to their functions; and they shall not be influenced in their judgments". However,
the Constitution also assigns pervasive powers to the President, who, with the consent of the National
Assembly can appoint members of the Constitutional Court, the Chief Justice and his deputies, as well as
lower court judges, upon the recommendation of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. It is the opinion of
the Special Rapporteur that it would be preferable for the Supreme Council of the Judiciary to exercise
control over the selection and appointment of all judges. The law regulating the Supreme Council should
empower it to be a truly independent organ of self-government of the judiciary.
