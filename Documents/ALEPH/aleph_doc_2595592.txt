Letter from the Chairman
19 August 2016
Dear Fellow Renaissance Shareholders
You have received an offer from Emerald Resources NL (Emerald) to acquire all your shares in 
Renaissance Minerals Limited (Renaissance or the Company) on the basis of 1.55 Emerald Shares 
for each 1 Renaissance Share you own. 
  
This Target’s Statement is the formal response of the Independent Directors of Renaissance 
(Independent Directors) to the Offer and sets out the reasons for our recommendation that you 
ACCEPT the Offer, in the absence of a Superior Proposal. 
 
These reasons include: 
 
(a)
The Offer implies a significant premium relative to the Renaissance share price prior to the 
Announcement Date, being a 27% premium to Renaissance’s 30 – day volume weighted 
average share price1.
(b)
(c)
The Combined Group will have a strong board and management team with an enviable track 
record of developing world class gold projects.
The Combined Group will own 100% of the Okvau Project which will provide improved funding 
options and greater equity capital market appeal in terms of the Combined Group’s scale, 
improved liquidity and simplified ownership.
(d)
BDO Corporate Finance (WA) Pty Ltd, the Independent Expert, has concluded the Offer is not 
fair but reasonable to Renaissance Shareholders.
In its report, the Independent Expert notes that as required by ASIC Regulatory Guide 111 Content of 
Expert’s Reports, in its assessment of the value range of Renaissances Shares, it is required to 
include a premium for control.  The Independent Expert notes that it is required to take this approach 
notwithstanding that the only material asset of Renaissance is the Okvau Project, of which control will 
pass under the existing Joint Venture Agreement with Emerald regardless of the outcome of the Offer.  
The Independent Expert further notes that in comparing the value of a Renaissance Share without a 
premium for control results in the Offer being fair. 
 
The Independent Expert considers the advantages of the Offer to be greater than the disadvantages 
of the Offer, and that therefore the Offer is reasonable.    
 
The Independent Directors note that management control of Renaissance’s main asset, the Okvau 
Project, has already effectively passed to Emerald through the existing Joint Venture.  Accordingly, 
and for the other reasons set out in this Target’s Statement,  the Independent Directors recommend 
acceptance of the Offer. 
 
The Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out in Section 3.10 of this 
Target’s Statement.  The Offer does not extend to Renaissance Options, however, Emerald proposes 
to acquire all Renaissance Options by way of private agreement with each optionholder.  Details of 
this are set out in section 9.6 of this Target’s Statement.
1 Based on the 30 day VWAP of Emerald Shares and Renaissance Shares of 4.64 cents and 5.66 cents respectively to 15 July 
2016

To accept the Offer, follow the instructions in the acceptance form accompanying the Bidder’s 
Statement.    
 
I encourage you to read the Independent Expert’s Report annexed to this Target Statement.  
 
Each director of Renaissance, including myself, who holds Renaissance Shares, intends to accept the 
Offer in full, in the absence of a Superior Proposal. 
 
Yours faithfully
Hamish Halliday 
Chairman

What choices do I have?




ACCEPT the Offer – a course of action your Independent 
Directors recommend. Once you accept, you are locked 
into the Offer unless the limited withdrawal rights under 
the Offer apply, but if Emerald subsequently raises the 
Offer Price, you will receive the higher price if the Offer 
has become or becomes unconditional. You will not 
receive any consideration until after the Offer becomes 
unconditional; or
REJECT the Offer by doing nothing; or
SELL your Renaissance Shares on market (unless you 
have previously accepted the Offer and have not validly 
withdrawn your acceptance in the limited circumstances 
where this is permitted).
YOUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY 
RECOMMEND, IN THE ABSENCE OF A SUPERIOR 
PROPOSAL, THAT YOU ACCEPT THE OFFER.
What if I want to sell my 
Renaissance Shares on market?
During the Offer Period, you may sell your Renaissance Shares 
through ASX for cash (less any brokerage), provided you have 
not accepted the Offer for those Renaissance Shares.
When do I have to decide?
What happens if I accept the 
Offer now?
You should contact your broker for information on how to sell 
your Renaissance Shares on ASX and your tax adviser to 
determine your tax implications of such a sale.
If you wish to accept the Offer you need to do so before its 
scheduled closing date. Emerald has stated that its Offer is 
scheduled to close at 5.00pm (WST) on 26 September 2016 
unless it is extended or withdrawn.
If you wish to reject the Offer, you do not need to do anything.
If you accept the Offer now, while it is conditional, you will give 
up your rights to sell your Renaissance Shares on market or 
otherwise deal with them (for example, by accepting a Superior 
Proposal if one was to emerge) unless the limited withdrawal 
rights apply at the applicable time and you validly withdraw your 
acceptance.
What happens if Emerald 
increases its Offer?
If you accept the Offer now and Emerald subsequently raises its 
Offer Price you will receive the higher price if the Offer has 
become unconditional.

the times specified in the Bidder's Statement; or

Emerald extends the Offer Period for more than one 
month and the Offer remains subject to 1 or more of the 
conditions at the time (see section 1.6 of Annexure A of 
the Bidder's Statement). In these circumstances, you will 
have a period of one month after the date that the Offer is 
extended to withdraw your acceptance. If the Offer Period 
is further extended, you may receive further statutory 
withdrawal rights.
If you accept the Offer after all of the conditions have been 
satisfied or waived, you will not be able to withdraw your 
acceptance.
What are the conditions of the 
Offer?
The Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following 
conditions (in summary):
When will Emerald advise as to 
the status of the conditions?





90% minimum acceptance;
no Renaissance Prescribed Occurrence occurring during 
the Offer Period;
no Renaissance Material Adverse Change occurring 
during the Offer Period;
Renaissance not making any material acquisitions, 
disposals or commitments during the Offer Period; and
no material litigation being threatened or commenced 
against Renaissance during the Offer Period.
Each of the conditions can be waived by Emerald in its sole 
discretion.  Full terms of the conditions are set out in section 
4.10 of this Target’s Statement and section 1.9 of Annexure A of 
the Bidder’s Statement.
Section 1.11 of Annexure A of the Bidder's Statement indicates 
that the Bidder will give a Notice of Status of Conditions on 16 
September 2016 in accordance with section 630(3) of the 
Corporations Act, subject to extension in accordance with 
section 630(2) if the Offer Period is extended.
The Bidder is required to set out in this Notice of Status of 
Conditions:



whether the Offer is free of any or all of the conditions;
whether, so far as the Bidder knows, any of the conditions 
have been fulfilled on the date the notice is given; and
the Bidder's voting power in Renaissance.
If the Offer Period is extended by a period before the time by 
which the Notice of Status of Conditions is to be given, the date 
for giving the Notice of Status of Conditions will be taken to be 
postponed for the same period and the Bidder is required to 
give notice that states the new date for the giving of the Notice 
of Status of Conditions.
If a condition is fulfilled (so that the Offer becomes free of that 
condition) before the date on which the Notice of Status of
page | 14
Question
Answer
Conditions is required to be given, the Bidder must, as soon as 
practicable, give ASX and Renaissance a notice that states that 
the particular condition has been fulfilled.
What happens if the conditions 
are not satisfied or waived?
If the conditions are not satisfied or waived before the Offer 
closes, the Offer will lapse. You will then be able to deal with 
your Renaissance Shares without the restraint of the Offer.
How can Emerald extend the 
Offer Period?
Can Emerald withdraw the 
Offer?
Will Emerald Shares issued 
under the Offer be listed on 
ASX?
Can I be forced to sell my 
Renaissance Shares?
While the Offer is subject to conditions, Emerald may extend the 
Offer Period at any time before giving the Notice of Status of 
Conditions and after giving the Notice of Status of Conditions in 
the circumstances described in section 650C(2) of the 
Corporations Act.
However, if the Offer is unconditional (that is, all the conditions 
are satisfied or waived), Emerald may extend the Offer Period at 
any time before the end of the Offer Period.
In addition, there will be an automatic extension of the Offer 
Period, if within the last 7 days of the Offer Period:


Emerald improves the consideration offered under the 
Offer; or
Emerald voting power in Renaissance increases to more 
than 50%.
If either of these two events occurs, the Offer Period is 
automatically extended so that it ends 14 days after the relevant 
event occurs.
Emerald may withdraw the Offer with the written consent of 
ASIC and subject to the conditions (if any) specified in such 
consent. See further section 1.13 of Annexure A of the Bidder’s 
Statement.
Emerald intends to make an application for quotation of the 
Emerald Shares issued under the Offer on ASX. If the 
application is not successful, then all contracts resulting from 
acceptances of the Offer will be automatically void.  Emerald is 
already listed on the ASX and Emerald Shares under the Offer 
are in the same class as existing quoted Emerald Shares.  As 
such, the Independent Directors do not anticipate any issues in 
ASX granting quotation of the Emerald Shares under the Offer.
You cannot be forced to sell your Renaissance Shares unless 
Emerald acquires a Relevant Interest in at least 90% of all 
Renaissance Shares.
Emerald's intentions with respect to compulsory acquisition are 
set out in section 6.4.1 of the Bidder's Statement. In summary, 
Emerald has indicated that if it becomes entitled to compulsory

Question
Answer
Does the Offer include my 
Renaissance Options?
I am an Ineligible Foreign 
Shareholder. Can I accept the 
Offer?
Will I need to pay brokerage or 
stamp duty if I accept the Offer?
When will I receive the Offer 
consideration if I accept the 
Offer?
No. However, as soon as practical after Emerald makes the 
Offers, Emerald will make an Options Offer to the Optionholders 
to have their Options transferred to Emerald in exchange for 
Emerald Options.  The Options Offer is subject to the Offer 
being declared unconditional, and Emerald acquiring voting 
power in Renaissance of at least 50.1%.  Please refer to section 
9.6 of this Target’s Statement for further details.
Yes, you can. However, Emerald Shares will not be issued as 
consideration to Ineligible Foreign Shareholders that accept the 
Offer. Such Renaissance Shareholders will have the Emerald 
Shares that would otherwise be issued to them sold on their 
behalf and receive the net cash proceeds. Please refer to 
section 9.10 of this Target’s Statement for further details.
Section 2.9 of the Bidder’s Statement states that if your 
Renaissance Shares are registered in an Issuer Sponsored 
Holding in your name and you deliver them directly to Emerald, 
you will not incur any brokerage fees or be obliged to pay duty 
in connection with your acceptance of the Offer.
If your Renaissance Shares are registered in a Chess Holding, 
or if you are a beneficial owner whose Renaissance Shares are 
registered in the name of a broker, bank custodian or other 
nominee, you will not be obliged to pay duty by accepting the 
Offer but you should ask your Controlling Participant (usually 
your broker) or that nominee whether it will charge any 
transactional fees or service charges in connection with 
acceptance of the Offer.
If you are an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder, brokerage will be 
payable in respect of the Emerald Shares sold by the Nominee 
and these costs will be deducted from the proceeds of sale that 
will be provided to you.
If you accept the Offer and each of the conditions are satisfied 
or waived, Emerald will issue/pay you the Offer consideration for 
your Renaissance Shares on or before the earlier of:   

one month after the date of your acceptance or, if the 
Offer is subject to a defeating condition when you accept 
the Offer, within one month after the Offer becomes 
unconditional (whichever is later); and

21 days after the end of the Offer Period.
Full details of when you will receive the Offer consideration are 
set out in section 1.7 of Annexure A of the Bidder’s Statement.
What are the risks associated 
with the Offer, with Renaissance 
and its business and with being 
a shareholder in the Combined 
Group?
These risks are detailed in section 9.8 of this Target's 
Statement.
There are also risks associated with the Offer and being a 
shareholder in the Combined Group.  Details of these risks are 
set out in section 5.1 and 5.3 of this Target’s Statement and 
section 8 of the Bidder’s Statement.

2.2  The Combined Group will create a well-funded gold development company which is
well placed to develop its assets and pursue any value enhancing opportunities which 
may arise
Shareholders who accept the Offer will become part of a larger gold company with a portfolio which 
focuses on the Okvau Project, which is currently in the exploration and feasibility study phase. In 
addition to continuing to have exposure to the future upside associated with this project through 
owning shares in the Combined Group, Renaissance Shareholders will gain the benefit from

Emerald’s strong cash position of approximately $14.5 million, giving the Combined Group a strong 
balance sheet of approximately $18.2 million cash4 and no debt.
The Combined Group’s enlarged size and balance sheet are expected to improve access to future 
development funding at a lower cost than what Renaissance could achieve on its own and provide 
the Combined Group with the flexibility to support near term project funding and accelerate 
exploration and development activities.
See section 2.2 of the Bidder’s Statement for more information.
2.3  The Combined Group will have a strong board and management team that can deliver
the proposed strategy and growth going forward
The board and management team of Emerald are highly credentialed and experienced with 
delivering operational excellence, and is proposed to be expanded with the appointment of Mr 
Justin Tremain as an Executive Director.  Details on the current Emerald Directors are set out in 
Section 3.2 of the Bidders Statement, and details on Mr Tremain is set out in section 8.5 of this 
Target’s Statement.
By accepting the Offer, Shareholders will benefit from a high quality management team and 
business model, and will improve the exploration and development pathway for the Okvau Project.
See section 2.4 of the Bidder’s Statement for more information.
2.4  The Combined Group will own 100% of the Okvau Project, which may provide
improved funding options and greater equity market appeal in terms of the Combined 
Group’s scale, improved liquidity and simplified ownership
The Combined Group will result in a simplified single ownership structure and operational 
management of assets currently the subject of the Joint Venture Agreement. This is expected to 
allow for the acceleration of exploration and development of the Okvau Project.
The Combined Group may receive increased coverage from equity research analysts, benefit from 
greater relevance and interest from institutional investors and increased access to a wider range of 
investors. This may result in a market re-rating of the Combined Group that is superior to the 
market ratings of Emerald and Renaissance as stand-alone companies.
See section 2.2 of the Bidder’s Statement for more information.
2.5  Renaissance Shareholders may be able to obtain potential capital gains tax relief
through scrip-for-scrip rollover relief
Provided Emerald secures acceptances for at least 80% of Renaissance Shares, Renaissance 
Shareholders that accept the Offer may be able to obtain scrip-for-scrip rollover relief from any 
capital gains tax otherwise payable in relation to the Offer consideration. Renaissance 
Shareholders should seek their own independent tax, investment and finance advice in relation to

June 2016.  The pro forma cash position does not take into account events subsequent to 30 June 2016 or the costs of the 
Offer.

their specific circumstances.
The taxation consequences of accepting the Offer depend on a number of factors and will vary 
depending on your particular circumstances. A general outline of the Australian taxation 
considerations of accepting the Offer are set out in section 7 of the Bidder’s Statement.
See sections 2.5 and 7 of the Bidder’s Statement for more information.
2.6  The Independent Expert has concluded that the Offer, despite being not fair is
reasonable to Renaissance Shareholders
The Independent Directors appointed BDO Corporate Finance (WA) Pty Ltd to undertake an 
independent assessment of the Offer.  The Independent Expert has concluded that the Offer is not 
fair but reasonable to Renaissance Shareholders.  
 
The Independent Expert’s opinion that the Offer is not fair is on the basis its preferred value of the 
Offer consideration per Renaissance Share on a minority basis is lower than its preferred value of a 
Renaissance Share on a control basis.  However, in the Independent Expert’s opinion, the position 
of Shareholders if the Offer is successful is more advantageous than the position if the Offer is not 
successful, and is therefore the Offer is reasonable to Shareholders.   
 
The Independent Expert considers the advantages to the Offer are:
(a)
comparing the value of a Renaissance Share on a minority basis with the consideration 
offered reduces the valuation range, and results in the Offer being fair, if that approach was 
able to be adopted in its fairness assessment;
(b)
Emerald and Renaissance are a natural fit;
(c)
the Combined Group will own 100% of the Okvau Project under 1 management team which 
will simplify project funding and improve market appeal;
(d)  Renaissance Shareholders will gain exposure to a well credentialed management team who
will manage the Okvau Project through to production;
(e)  Renaissance Shareholders will gain exposure to alternative project opportunities  secured by
Emerald; and
(f)
the Offer eliminates a key risk for Renaissance of Emerald walking away from the Joint 
Venture.
In addition, the Independent Directors note that management control of Renaissance’s main asset, 
the Okvau Project, has already effectively passed to Emerald through the existing Joint Venture.
The Independent Expert considers the disadvantages to the Offer are that it is not fair, and will 
dilute existing Shareholders’ interests.
Refer to Annexure A of this Target’s Statement for the full Independent Expert’s Report.  The 
Independent Directors recommend that you read this report carefully.

3  Possible reasons why you may choose not to accept the Offer
Your Independent Directors unanimously recommend that you accept the Offer, in the absence of a 
Superior Proposal, however you may decide not to accept the Offer for different reasons, such as:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
in the Independent Expert’s opinion, the Offer is not fair because the value of a Renaissance 
Share prior to the Offer on a controlling basis is greater than the value of consideration being 
offered, being 1.55 Emerald Shares, on a minority basis;
you may disagree with the recommendation of the Independent Directors or the conclusion of 
the Independent Expert that the Offer is reasonable;
you may consider that there is a potential for a Superior Proposal to be made.  As at the date of 
this Target’s Statement, no Superior Proposal has emerged for consideration by the 
Independent Directors;
the potential tax consequences of the Offer may not suit your current financial position or tax 
circumstances.  A general summary of the tax implications of the Offer is set out in section 7 of 
the Bidder’s Statement; and
as detailed in Section 2.4, successful completion of the Offer will result in a simplified single 
ownership structure of the Okvau Project and operational management of assets currently the 
subject of the Joint Venture Agreement.  You may disagree with the Independent Directors as to 
the benefits of this and prefer that the Okvau Project is developed under the Joint Venture.

all acceptances that have not resulted in binding contracts are void. In that situation, you 
will then be able to deal with your Renaissance Shares without the restraint of the Offer.
4.17  Compulsory acquisition
Emerald’s intentions with respect to compulsory acquisition are set out in section 6.4.1 of 
the Bidder’s Statement.
In summary, Emerald has indicated that if it becomes entitled to compulsory acquire any 
outstanding Renaissance Shares in accordance with Part 6A.1 of the Corporations Act 
and any outstanding Renaissance Options in accordance with Part 6A.2 of the 
Corporations Act, it intends to proceed with the compulsory acquisition of these shares 
and options.
An overview of Emerald’s rights to compulsorily acquire Renaissance Shares is set out 
below.
(a)
Post bid compulsory acquisition
Emerald will be entitled, under section 661A of the Corporations Act, to compulsorily 
acquire any Renaissance Shares in respect of which it has not received an acceptance of 
the Offer on the same terms as the Offer if, during or at the end of the Offer Period, 
Emerald (together with its Associates) has a Relevant Interest in at least 90% (by 
number) of the Renaissance Shares and Emerald and its Associates have acquired at 
least 75% (by number) of the Renaissance Shares that Emerald offered to acquire under 
the Offer.
page | 27
If these thresholds are met, Emerald will have up to one month after the end of the Offer 
Period within which to give compulsory acquisition notices to Renaissance Shareholders 
who have not accepted the Offer. Renaissance Shareholders have statutory rights to 
challenge the compulsory acquisition, but a successful challenge will require the relevant 
Renaissance Shareholder to establish to the satisfaction of a Court that the consideration 
offered does not represent “fair value” for their Renaissance Shares.
If compulsory acquisition occurs, Renaissance Shareholders who have their Renaissance 
Shares compulsorily acquired will be paid their consideration later than Renaissance 
Shareholders who accept the Offer.
(b)  General compulsory acquisition provisions
Emerald will be entitled, under section 664A of the Corporations Act, to compulsorily 
acquire any outstanding Renaissance Shares and Renaissance Options if Emerald’s 
voting power in Renaissance is at least 90% and Emerald (either in its own right or 
through related bodies corporate) acquires full beneficial interests in at least 90% (by 
value) of the aggregate of all Renaissance Shares and Renaissance Options and:
(i)
(ii)
Emerald lodges a compulsory acquisition notice with ASIC within 6 months of 
achieving that 90% holding;
Emerald proposes a cash sum for the compulsory acquisition of the Renaissance 
Shares and Renaissance Options; and
(iii)  Emerald obtains the report of an expert stating whether, in the expert’s opinion, the
terms proposed in the notice give fair value of the securities covered.
Emerald has not stated in the Bidder’s Statement the cash sum it would propose for any 
compulsory acquisition of the Renaissance Shares or Renaissance Options that is 
undertaken by Emerald under section 664A of the Corporations Act.
4.18  Risks associated with rejecting the Offer
(a)  No Premium
If the Offer is not successful Renaissance Shareholders will not receive the premium 
offered by Emerald. The price of Renaissance Shares on ASX may potentially fall back to 
the levels at which it was trading before the Announcement Date.
(b)  Minority shareholding
If Emerald failed to acquire sufficient Renaissance Shares to be entitled to compulsorily 
acquire all outstanding Renaissance Shares but nonetheless declared the Offer 
unconditional, non-accepting Renaissance Shareholders may find themselves as minority 
shareholders in a company with potentially very limited share liquidity. In those 
circumstances (given current market conditions) there would be a risk that Renaissance 
Shares would trade at prices materially lower than the Offer Price.
(c)  Delisting
In the circumstances outlined in the preceding paragraph, Emerald may seek to have 
Renaissance removed from the official list of the ASX. If delisting occurs, Renaissance 
Shares will not be able to be bought or sold on the ASX.
(d)  Compulsory acquisition
page | 28
If, after the end of the Offer Period, Emerald becomes the holder of at least 90% of all 
Renaissance Shares (for example, by subsequent acquisitions of Renaissance Shares), 
then Emerald may be entitled to compulsorily acquire the Renaissance Shares it does not 
own (see section 4.17 of this Target’s Statement and 6.4.1 of the Bidder’s Statement for 
more information).
(e)  No Scrip for Scrip Rollover Relief
If the Offer results in Emerald owning less than 80% of Renaissance Shares, 
Renaissance Shareholders will not receive scrip for scrip taxation rollover relief.
4.19  Further developments
Should there be any developments during the Offer Period (for example, the emergence 
of a Superior Proposal from Emerald or another bidder) which would alter your 
Independent Directors’ recommendations in relation to the Offer, Renaissance 
Shareholders will be notified through a supplementary Target’s Statement.
4.20  Taxation Consequences
In making a decision whether to accept the Offer, Renaissance Shareholders should also 
have regard to the fact that the disposal of Renaissance Shares may have taxation 
consequences. Renaissance Shareholders should seek their own independent advice as 
to any such taxation consequence (please refer to section 7 of the Bidder's Statement).
page | 29
5  Risks associated with the Offer and being an Emerald
Shareholder
Renaissance Shareholders should be aware of the following key risks that arise from the Offer 
and from being an Emerald Shareholder.
5.1  Risks associated with the Offer
(a)  Conditions of the Offer
As described in section 1.9 of Annexure A of the Bidder’s Statement and section 4.10 of 
this Target’s Statement, the Offer is subject to a number of conditions.
If the conditions of the Offer are not satisfied by the applicable date (or waived by 
Emerald), the Offer will not be free of conditions and therefore will not proceed.
(b)
Limited withdrawal rights
Once you accept the Offer, you will not be able to accept any other offer for your 
Renaissance Shares which may arise, and there are limited circumstances under which 
you may withdraw your acceptance.  You may only withdraw your acceptance if:
(i)
(ii)
the conditions of the Offer are not fulfilled or waived by the times specified in the 
Bidder's Statement; or
Emerald extends the Offer Period for more than one month and the Offer remains 
subject to one or more of the conditions at that time (see section 1.6 of Annexure A 
of the Bidder's Statement).
Otherwise, you will be unable to withdraw your acceptance even if the value of 
Renaissance Shares varies significantly from the date of your acceptance of the Offer.
(c)  CGT
If the Offer becomes unconditional, CGT rollover relief will not be available if Emerald 
acquires less than 80% of the Renaissance Shares under the Offer. A general overview 
of the tax implication of accepting the Offer for Australian resident Renaissance 
Shareholders is set out in section 7 of the Bidder’s Statement.
(d)  Minority ownership consequences
The Offer is subject to a 90% minimum acceptance condition, however this condition may 
be waived by Emerald.  In section 6.5 of the Bidder's Statement, Emerald describes its 
intentions in the event that it obtains control of Renaissance but does not become entitled 
to at least 90% of the Renaissance Shares.
If the scenario described in section 6.5 of the Bidder’s Statement occurs, Renaissance 
Shareholders who do not accept the Offer may become minority shareholders in 
Renaissance and those Renaissance Shareholders will no longer collectively control 
Renaissance.
This has a number of possible implications including the following:
(i)
Emerald will be able to cast the majority of votes at a general meeting of 
Renaissance enabling it to control the Board and senior management,
page | 30
determine Renaissance's dividend policy and control the strategic direction 
of Renaissance.
(ii)
Subject to the requirements of the Corporations Act and Renaissance's 
constitution, Emerald may appoint nominees of Emerald to the Board.
(iii)  Your Independent Directors believe it is reasonably likely that the liquidity of
Renaissance Shares would be lower than at present if a number of 
Renaissance Shareholders accept the Offer.
(iv)  Emerald may apply for Renaissance's removal from the official list of ASX. If
this occurs, Renaissance Shares will not be able to be bought or sold on 
ASX.
(v)
If Emerald acquires 75% or more of the Renaissance Shares, it will be able 
to pass special resolutions of Renaissance. This will enable Emerald to 
amend Renaissance's constitution.
In section 6.6 of the Bidder’s Statement, Emerald describes its intentions in the event it 
acquires less than 50% of the Renaissance Shares.
(e)  Consideration
Emerald will offer 1.55 new Emerald Shares for each Renaissance Share held. As 
Emerald is listed on ASX, the value of the Offer consideration will fluctuate depending on 
the market value of Emerald Shares. There are risks associated with investing in 
Emerald. These risks are discussed in section 8 of the Bidder's Statement and also in 
section 5.3 of this Target's Statement.
5.2  Risks associated with holding Renaissance Shares
Renaissance Shareholders should be aware that there are risks associated with holding 
Renaissance Shares.  A summary of the key risks associated with an investment in 
Renaissance is set out in section 9.8 of this Target's Statement.
If the Offer becomes unconditional or the conditions are satisfied or waived, Renaissance 
Shareholders who accept the Offer will become Emerald Shareholders.  In those 
circumstances, Renaissance Shareholders will:
(a)
(b)
continue to be exposed to the risks referred to in section 9.8 as a result of their 
indirect interest in Renaissance through Emerald;
be exposed to the risks which are specific to an investment in Emerald and the 
Combined Group; and
(c)
be exposed to additional risks relating to the Offer.
5.3  Risks associated with being a shareholder of the Combined Group
Section 8.3 of the Bidder’s Statement sets out risks associated with an investment in the 
Combined Group.  As the Okvau Project is the key project for both Emerald and 
Renaissance, the risks associated with an investment in the Combined Group are largely 
similar to the risks associated with being an investor in Renaissance.  In addition, 
Renaissance Shareholders should be aware of the following risks:
page | 31
(a)
Issue of Emerald Shares as consideration
Renaissance Shareholders are being offered consideration under the Offer which 
consists of a specified number of Emerald Shares, rather than a number of Emerald 
Shares with a specified market value.  As a result, the value of the consideration will 
fluctuate depending on the market value of the Emerald Shares.
Furthermore, under the Offer, Emerald will issue a significant number of Emerald Shares.  
Some Renaissance Shareholders may not intend to continue to hold onto their Emerald 
Shares and wish to sell them on ASX.  There is a risk that if a significant number of 
Renaissance Shareholders seek to sell their Emerald Shares, this may adversely impact 
the price and liquidity of Emerald Shares.
(b)
Integration risk
There are risks that the integration between Renaissance and Emerald may take longer 
than expected and that anticipated efficiencies and benefits of that integration may be 
less than estimated.  These risks include possible differences in the management culture 
of the two groups, inability to achieve synergy benefits and cost savings and access tax 
losses, and the potential loss of key personnel.
Your Independent Directors strongly encourage Shareholders to consider section 8 of the 
Bidder's Statement before deciding their course of action in relation to the Offer.
page | 32
6  Your choices as a Renaissance Shareholder
YOUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND YOU ACCEPT 
THE OFFER IN THE ABSENCE OF A SUPERIOR PROPOSAL
However, as a Renaissance Shareholder you have three options currently available to 
you. You are encouraged to read this Target’s Statement and the Bidder’s Statement in

8  What you should know about Renaissance
8.1  Overview of Renaissance
Renaissance is an emerging gold company focused on advancing the Okvau Project in 
the eastern region of Cambodia.  Renaissance completed a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) 
for the potential development of the Okvau Project in July 2015.   A regional map of the 
Okvau Project location is shown below.
The Okvau Project area covers some of the most prospective ground in a new emerging 
gold province that has the potential to host Intrusive Related Gold systems.  A map 
illustrating the location of the two licences that make up the Okvau Project is shown 
below.
page | 36
Renaissance has ancillary projects in Western Australia and in Alaska (but is in the 
process of divesting its interest in the Alaska project).  Further information on 
Renaissance’s projects is set out in section 8.3.
8.2  History
Renaissance was incorporated as a public company limited by shares on 18 December 
2009 and subsequently listed on ASX on 11 June 2010 under the code ‘RNS’.
On 20 February 2012, Renaissance announced that it had entered into a share sale 
agreement (SSA) with Oz Exploration Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of Oz Minerals Limited) (Oz 
Exploration) to acquire (through its wholly owned subsidiary Renaissance Cambodia Pty 
Ltd (Renaissance Cambodia)) all of the issued shares in Oz Minerals (Cambodia) 
Limited which held the assets comprising the Okvau Project.
The consideration payable to Oz Exploration comprised an upfront cash payment of $7.8 
million (adjusted for working capital), 26.4 million Renaissance Shares and 3 million 
Renaissance Options (in three tranches with exercise prices of $0.25, $0.30 and $0.35 
and all expiring 31 March 2015), deferred cash payment of $5 million after completion, 
deferred cash payment of $10 million upon the earlier of the announcement of a JORC 
resource of more than 1.25 million ounces of gold and a decision to mine, and deferred 
cash payment of $12.5 million 6 months after first gold production.  The acquisition was 
completed in May 2012, and the Okvau Project became Renaissance’s primary focus.  As 
part of the acquisition, the parties entered into a general security deed under which 
Renaissance Cambodia provided an all assets security to Oz Exploration to secure the 
payment of monies under the SSA (GSD).  Oz Exploration has agreed that in certain 
circumstances, to allow Renaissance to obtain project financing, it will allow Renaissance 
to grant a first ranking security over the assets of Renaissance Cambodia and the Okvau 
Project.
In August 2015, Renaissance announced it had agreed with Oz Exploration to cancel the 
outstanding deferred cash payments under the SSA of $22.5 million in exchange for a 
1.5% gross smelter royalty over future product at the Okvau Project, capped at $22.5 
million (Oz Royalty).  An Amendment and Royalty Deed was executed on 21 June 2016 
which formally cancelled the outstanding deferred cash payments under the SSA in
page | 37
exchange for the Oz Royalty.  Payments under the Oz Royalty are secured under the 
GSD.
On 3 February 2016, Renaissance announced it had entered into a memorandum of 
agreement with Emerald with respect to the proposed Joint Venture to explore, develop 
and extract value from the Okvau Project.  Renaissance and Emerald entered into the 
formal Joint Venture Agreement on 29 March 2016.
On 19 July 2016, Emerald and Renaissance jointly announced their entry into the Bid 
Implementation Agreement under which Emerald will make the Offer to acquire all 
Renaissance Shares.  As detailed in section 2.2 of the Bidder’s Statement, the primary 
focus of the Combined Group will be on the development of the Okvau Project.  
Emerald’s intentions with respect to the Joint Venture are detailed in section 6 of the 
Bidder’s Statement.
8.3
Projects
As noted above, Renaissance’s primary asset is the Okvau Project.  The Company also 
has ancillary projects in Western Australia and Alaska (but is in the process of divesting 
its interest in the Alaska project).  A high level overview of these projects are set out 
below.  Further details of the Okvau Project are set out in section 4.3.1 of the Bidder’s 
Statement.
(a)  Okvau Project
The Okvau and adjoining O’Chhung licences, owned 100% by Renaissance but whose 
ownership and management is subject to the Joint Venture Agreement, cover 
approximately 400km2 of project area and are located within the core of a prospective 
Intrusive Related Gold (IRG) province in the eastern plains of Cambodia. The project is 
located in the Mondulkiri Province of Cambodia approximately 265 kilometres north-east 
of the capital Phnom Penh.
The topography of the project area is relatively flat with low relief of 80 metres to 200 
metres above sea level. There are isolated scattered hills rising to around 400 metres. 
The area is sparsely populated with some limited historical small scale mining activity.
An updated independent JORC Indicated and Inferred Resource estimate of 15.8Mt at 
2.2g/t for 1.13Moz of gold was completed for the Okvau Deposit in July 2015 which is set 
out below:

The mineralised vein system of the Okvau Deposit has a current strike extent of 500 
metres across a width of 400 metres and remains open along strike and at depth.
The current resource estimate is underpinned by 132 drill holes for 33,351 metres, of 
which 100 holes or 30,046 metres is diamond core drilling with the remainder being 
reverse circulation drilling.
Renaissance completed the PFS in July 2015 for the development of a 1.5Mtpa operation 
based only on the Okvau Deposit via an open pit mining operation. The PFS was
page | 38
completed to +/-20% level of accuracy. The PFS demonstrates the potential for a robust, 
low cost development with an initial Life of Mine of 8 years, producing on average 91,500 
ounces of gold per annum via conventional open pit mining methods from a single pit to 
be mined in stages. Key results of the study are presented in the table below1:

to the announcement of the Study. The OZ Royalty would add US$16.50/ounce to 
US$21.00/ounce based the gold price assumptions in the table above.  
 
Reference is made to Renaissance’s ASX release dated 27 July 2015 titled Okvau PFS 
Demonstrates Compelling Project Economics. All material assumptions underpinning the 
production target or the forecast financial information continue to apply and have not 
materially changed.
As part of the Joint Venture, Renaissance and Emerald have commenced a resource infill 
drilling program to improve the confidence level of the resource estimate for the Okvau 
Deposit.
The Okvau Deposit and other gold occurrences within the exploration licences are directly 
associated with diorite and granodiorite intrusions and are best classed as IRG 
mineralisation. Exploration to date has demonstrated the potential for large scale gold 
deposits with the geology and geochemistry analogous to other world class IRG districts, 
in particular the Tintina Gold Belt in Alaska (Donlin Creek 38Moz, Pogo 6Moz, Fort Knox 
10Moz, Livengood 20Moz).
page | 39
There are numerous high priority exploration prospects based upon anomalous 
geochemistry, geology and geophysics which remain untested with drilling. These targets 
are all located within close proximity to the Okvau Deposit.  As part of the Joint Venture, 
Renaissance and Emerald have commenced an exploration program which is focused on 
drill testing previously identified target areas. An RC drilling campaign has commenced 
testing geochemical and geophysical anomalies within close proximity to the Okvau 
Deposit.  Renaissance will continue to update the market if any material drilling results 
are received.
(b)
Pinjin Gold Project
The Pinjin Gold Project is located north-east of Kalgoorlie with the project area covering 
Archaean greenstones within the highly prospective Eastern Goldfields Province of the 
Yilgarn Craton. The tenement covers positions within the major NW-SE trending regional 
structural domain known as the Laverton Tectonic Zone. The Laverton Tectonic Zone 
hosts over 20 individual gold deposits which cumulatively contain in excess of 27 million 
ounces of gold. The two largest gold deposits on this structure being the 10+ million 
ounce Sunrise Dam deposit and the 5+ million ounce Wallaby deposit.
The Company acquired an 80% joint venture interest in Pinjin Gold Project in September 
2010.  The other 20% joint venture interest is held by Gel Resources Pty Ltd and is free 
carried to completion of a bankable feasibility study. The project area covers the Pinjin 
and Rebecca Palaeochannel systems that are host to numerous palaeochannel gold 
intersections.  The Company acquired its interest in the Pinjin Project with an objective of 
discovering the primary source of the palaeochannel gold. Drilling has intersected 
significant insitu gold mineralisation within a complex geological package beneath and 
adjacent to the Palaeochannel over a length of 5 kilometres.  Both the style and 
geological setting are comparable to the initial discovery of Sunrise Dam, which is 
approximately 100 kilometres to the north, in the same structural domain.
(c)  Quicksilver Gold Project
The Quicksilver Gold Project is located within the highly prospective Tintina Gold Belt in 
south-west Alaska.
Renaissance has entered into an agreement with Afranex Gold Limited (Afranex), an 
unlisted public company, to dispose of its 90% interest in the Quicksilver Gold Project for 
10 million shares in Afranex.  The parties are in the process of completing the transaction.

8.6  Financial profile of Renaissance
Renaissance’s reviewed accounts for the half year ended 31 December 2015 were 
released on ASX on 11 March 2016.  The only significant items post 31 December 2015 
was a $3.4 million capital raising undertaken by Renaissance as announced to the ASX 
on 9 February 2016. This capital raising is reflected in Renaissance’s quarterly cash flow
page | 43
report for the period ended 30 June 2016 released to the ASX on 29 July 2016. 
Renaissance’s audited financial accounts for the financial years ended 30 June 2013, 30 
June 2014 and 30 June 2015 are available on the Company’s website at 
www.renaissanceminerals.com.au, and are also set out in section 4.7 of the Bidder’s 
Statement.
Section 5.11 of the Bidder’s Statement sets out the unaudited pro forma consolidated 
statement of financial position of the Combined Group, prepared on the basis set out in 
section 5.10 of the Bidder’s Statement.
Renaissance’s preliminary unaudited balance sheet and income statement for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2016 (FY16) are set out in sections 5.5 and 5.6 of the 
Independent Expert’s Report (Preliminary Financial Statements).
The Preliminary Financial Statements have been prepared based on preliminary  
unaudited management accounts for FY16 and before the finalisation of the financial year 
end statutory accounting processes and external audit (FY16 Year End Processes).
The Independent Directors believe that the Preliminary Financial Statements have been 
prepared with due care and attention based on the information available to them at the 
time of preparation of this Target’s Statement, however there is a risk that the FY16 Year 
End Processes may have an impact on the actual results reported for the FY16 year 
when compared to the Preliminary Financial Statements.  Shareholders should therefore 
treat the Preliminary Financial Statements as a guide only.
Renaissance’s auditors are in the process of auditing the Company’s financial statements 
for the financial year ended 30 June 2016, however Renaissance does not expect that 
audited financial information for this period will be available until after the end of the Offer 
Period.  If the information does become available prior to the end of the Offer Period, 
Renaissance intends to release the results by way of a supplementary target’s statement.

Renaissance Options are cancelled or transferred to Emerald in return for the issue of 
Emerald Options on the basis of 1.55 Emerald Options for every Renaissance Option

relevant Renaissance Option divided by 1.55, an expiry date the same as the relevant

9.8  Risk factors of holding your Renaissance Shares
There are a number of risks which may have a material and adverse impact on the future 
operating and financial performance of Renaissance and the value of Renaissance 
Shares. These may be risks that are widespread risks associated with any form of 
business or specific risks associated with Renaissance's business and its involvement in
page | 53
the exploration and mining industry. While most risk factors are largely beyond the control 
of Renaissance and your Directors, the Company will seek to mitigate the risks where 
possible, for example by obtaining appropriate insurances and maintaining its key 
relationships.
The following summary, which is not exhaustive, represents some of the major risk 
factors which affect Renaissance. These risk factors ought not to be taken as exhaustive 
of the risks faced by Renaissance or by Renaissance Shareholders. These factors, and 
others not specifically referred to, may in the future materially affect the financial 
performance of Renaissance and the value of Renaissance Shares.  Where relevant, the 
risk factors below assume the Offer will not be successful and Renaissance will continue 
to develop the Okvau Project through the Joint Venture.
(a)
Future trading price
There is a risk that the Renaissance Share price may fall if the Offer is unsuccessful.
Your Independent Directors are not in a position to speculate on the future trading price 
of the Renaissance Shares, including if the Offer lapses. The future price of Renaissance 
Shares is dependent not only on Renaissance’s performance, but also on external market 
and other factors.
(b)  Share market risk
Share market conditions may affect the value of Renaissance’s Shares regardless of 
Renaissance’s operating performance. The market price of Renaissance Shares may be 
subject to fluctuation and may be affected by many factors including (but not limited to) 
the general economic outlook, interest rates and inflation rates, currency fluctuations, 
commodity price fluctuations, changes in investor sentiment toward particular market 
sectors, the demand for, and supply of, capital and terrorism or other hostilities.
(c)
Financing and capital
Renaissance’s continued ability to effectively implement its business plan over time may 
depend in part on its ability to raise additional funds. Notwithstanding Renaissance’s 
current financial position, Renaissance’s capacity to develop projects depends on its 
ability to put significant funding solutions in place.
There can be no assurance that Renaissance will generate sufficient cash flow, or that 
access to sufficient investments, loans or other financing alternatives will be secured on 
commercially acceptable terms.
(d)  Commodity price volatility
Internationally traded commodities and price changes are driven by a number of supply 
and demand factors which are outside of Renaissance’s control and are subject to 
exchange rate risks. In addition, commodity prices fluctuate and are affected by many 
factors beyond the control of Renaissance and your Directors.
Changes to commodity prices may impact the value of Renaissance’s projects and any 
revenue derived from those projects.
(e)  Operating and industry risks
The current and future operations of Renaissance, including exploration, appraisal, 
construction and production activities may be affected by a range of factors, including 
adverse geological conditions, limitations on activities due to seasonal weather patterns
page | 54
and cyclone activity, unanticipated operational and technical difficulties encountered in 
geophysical surveys, drilling and production activities, mechanical failure of operating 
plant and equipment, industrial and environmental accidents, industrial disputes, riots and 
other force majeure events, unexpected shortages or increases in the costs of labour, 
consumables, spare parts, plant and equipment and the inability to obtain necessary 
consents or approvals.
Further, mechanical or operational failures during drilling, sampling, test work 
construction and production could cause Renaissance substantial loss due to the cost of 
delay, personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural 
resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up 
responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. Any 
of these events might also give rise to claims against Renaissance.
Industry operating risks include fire, explosions, industrial disputes, unexpected shortages 
or increases in the costs of consumables, spare parts, plant and equipment, mechanical 
failure or breakdown, environmental hazards such as accidental spills or leakage of 
liquids, gas leaks, ruptures, discharges of toxic gases or geological uncertainty.  The 
occurrence of any of these risks could result in legal proceedings against the Company 
and substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or 
destruction of property, natural resources or equipment, pollution or other environmental 
damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation, and penalties or suspension 
of operations.  Damage occurring to third parties as a result of such risks may give rise to 
claims against the Company.
(f)
Exploration and development risk
Renaissance’s future value will be materially dependent on the success or otherwise of 
Renaissance’s activities which are directed towards the search, evaluation and 
development of gold and other resources. Exploration for these resources is speculative 
and involves a significant degree of risk. Although the rewards can be substantial, there is 
no guarantee that future exploration on territories for which Renaissance has exploration 
permits and licences will lead to a commercial discovery or, if there is such discovery, that 
Renaissance will be able to develop it economically. If at any stage Renaissance is 
precluded from pursuing any of its exploration programs or from developing any resource 
it may identify or decides not to continue with any of these, this may have an adverse 
effect on the value of Renaissance Shares.
(g)  Resource and reserve estimates
A current Mineral Resource has been released for the Okvau Project by a Competent 
Person. To advance the Okvau Project through completion of the Definitive Feasibility 
Study and potential development, additional work will be required to increase the 
confidence in the Resource classifications. 
  
Resource and reserve estimates are expressions of judgement based on knowledge, 
experience and industry practice. Estimates which were valid when originally calculated 
may alter significantly when new information (including changed commodity prices) or 
techniques become available. In addition, by their very nature, resource and reserve 
estimates are imprecise and depend to some extent on interpretations, which may prove 
to be inaccurate. As further information becomes available through additional fieldwork 
and analysis, the estimates are likely to change.
(h)
Tenure and access
Mineral exploration licences are subject to periodic renewal. There is no guarantee that 
current or future mineral exploration licences or future applications for production licences
page | 55
will be approved. The mineral exploration licences comprising the Okvau Project are 
subject to the applicable Cambodian mining acts and regulations. The renewal of the term 
of a granted mineral exploration licence is also subject to the discretion of the relevant 
Minister. Renewal conditions may include increased expenditure and work commitments 
or compulsory relinquishment of areas of the mineral exploration licences comprising 
the Okvau Project. The imposition of new conditions or the inability to meet those 
conditions may adversely affect the operations, financial position and/or performance of 
the Company and the Joint Venture. The Company considers the likelihood of tenure 
forfeiture to be low given the laws and regulations governing licensing in Cambodia and 
the ongoing expenditure history and good standing of the licences. However the 
consequence of forfeiture or involuntary surrender of a licence or licences for reasons 
beyond the control of the Company and the Joint Venture could be significant. 
 
(i)  Mine development
Possible future development of mining operations at the Okvau Project is dependent on a 
number of factors including, but not limited to, the acquisition and/or delineation of 
economically recoverable mineralisation, favourable geological conditions, receiving the 
necessary approvals from all relevant authorities and parties, seasonal weather patterns, 
unanticipated technical and operational difficulties encountered in extraction and 
production activities, mechanical failure of operating plant and equipment, shortages or 
increases in the price of consumables, spare parts and plant and equipment, cost 
overruns, access to the required level of funding and contracting risk from third 
parties providing essential services. If the Joint Venture commences production, its 
operations may be disrupted by a variety of risks and hazards which are beyond the 
control of it and the Company. No assurance can be given that the Company and the 
Joint Venture will achieve commercial viability through the development of the Okvau 
Project. The risks associated with the development of a mine will be considered in full as 
part of the Definitive Feasibility Study and will be managed with ongoing consideration of 
stakeholder interests.
(j)
Environmental
The operations and proposed activities of the Company and the Joint Venture are subject 
to applicable laws and regulations concerning the environment. As with most projects, the 
activities of the Company and the Joint Venture are expected to have some impact on the 
environment, particularly if advanced exploration or mine development proceeds. It is the 
Company’s intention to conduct its activities to the highest standard of environmental 
obligation, including compliance with applicable environmental laws. Approvals are 
required for land clearing and for ground disturbing activities. Delays in obtaining such 
approvals can result in the delay to anticipated exploration programmes or mining 
activities. The Okvau Project is located within the outer boundary of the Phnom Prich 
Wildlife Sanctuary, a protected area. Wild life preserves are protected areas under 
Cambodian law and are subject to management by the Cambodian Ministry of 
Environment (MOE). Consultation has been ongoing with the MOE on the grant, 
exploration and exclusion of a portion of the Okvau Project for the purpose of mineral 
exploitation.  
 
The MOE to date has been supportive of defining an exclusion zone within the preserve 
for the purpose of mining but formal recognition of an exploitation exclusion zone will 
depend on the submission of a mutually acceptable development plan and associated 
mineral investment convention being agreed between the Joint Venture parties and the 
Cambodian Government, including the MOE. The Company considers the inability of all 
parties to agree a development process (should a suitably economic scenario be defined 
in the DFS) to be unlikely, however, this outcome cannot be guaranteed.
page | 56
(k)  Reliance on key personnel
Renaissance has benefited from having a high quality but small management team 
available. Loss of a number of key personnel may adversely affect Renaissance.
(l)
Regulatory approvals
Any successful progression of discoveries and development of associated infrastructure 
requires obtaining and continuing to hold the necessary statutory licences, tenure and 
rights together with the relevant regulatory approvals as required from local, state, 
national government agencies and authorities.
The required tenure, rights and approvals may be issued at the discretion of the relevant 
authorities and may be delayed or subject to conditions or preconditions or forfeited or 
cancelled. Any delay or denial may result in the relevant project being curtailed or 
abandoned or imposition of prescribed conditions that may impact a project’s viability.
(m)  Foreign exchange risk
Commodity contracts are often denominated in US dollars. Renaissance will also incur 
the majority of its costs in US dollars and some in Cambodian Riel. As such, a 
strengthening or weakening of the US dollar and the Cambodian Riel relative to the 
Australian dollar may impact Renaissance’s financial position adversely or positively.
(n)
Litigation
Litigation risks relating to the Renaissance Group include contractual claims, employee 
claims, regulatory disputes, joint venture claims and disputes and the costs associated 
with such claims and disputes. There is a risk that material or costly disputes could arise 
which may have a material adverse effect on the financial performance and position of 
Renaissance.
As announced by the Company on 29 June 2015, Renaissance was previously advised 
by Oz Minerals Limited (Oz Minerals) of a potential claim by a third party for an 
encumbrance on the Okvau Project.  Renaissance has since been advised by Oz 
Minerals that it has agreed to terms with the third party to extinguish any such claim.  
Notwithstanding this, there can be no guarantee that the third party, or any other party, 
may in the future, make a claim in this respect.   There is a risk that this matter, and any 
other similar material or costly disputes that may arise, may have a material adverse 
effect on the financial performance and position of the Renaissance Group.
(o)  Environmental risks and health and safety
The proposed activities and operations of Renaissance are subject to Cambodian laws 
and regulations concerning the environment and health and safety matters. Although 
Renaissance endeavours to conduct its activities in a safe and environmentally 
responsible manner, if it is responsible for environmental damage it may incur substantial 
costs for rehabilitation, emergency response and losses by third parties resulting from its 
operations. In addition, some of Renaissance’s activities are conducted in potentially 
hazardous conditions, which can lead to accidents resulting in significant trauma and loss 
of life and compensation claims or payments, some of which may not be insured. 
Production delays can also occur as a result of a significant event.
(p)  Sovereign risk
The Company through the Joint Venture will be conducting exploration and development 
activities in Cambodia, and will be exposed to various levels of political, military,
page | 57
economic and other risks and uncertainties associated with operating in foreign 
jurisdictions.  These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: currency 
exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labour unrest; renegotiation or nullification of 
existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts; unpermitted conflicting land use; 
changes in taxation policies; restrictions on foreign exchange; changing political 
conditions; military movements, and currency controls and governmental regulations that 
favour or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign 
contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction .  
 
There is no assurance that future political and economic conditions in that country will not 
result in the Cambodian Government adopting policies precluding foreign investment 
and/or control in and development and ownership of mineral resources in Cambodia 
(directly or indirectly). Any changes in policy by the Cambodian Government may result in 
changes in the laws relating to ownership and control of assets and shares in Cambodian 
companies, taxation, rates of exchange, environmental protection, labour relations, 
repatriation of income and return of capital, which may affect the Company’s operations 
or profitability, and its ability to carry out its stated objectives. It is possible that a future 
government in Cambodia may adopt substantially different policies, which might extend to 
limitation of foreign control of shares or assets, or expropriation of assets. There can be 
no assurance that the government of Cambodia from time to time will not impose 
measures that could have a material adverse effect on the Company or the Joint 
Venture’s future operations. 
 
(q)  Artisanal mining
Artisanal miners may be active in the Okvau Project which may have many material 
adverse effects including delays and/or impediments to the Company’s exploration 
activities and schedule, and exposure to safety, security, environment and social liabilities 
and losses.    
 
(r)
Joint Venture risk
The Company is in the Joint Venture with Emerald in relation to the development of the 
Okvau Project.  Emerald notes in section 6.4.2 of the Bidder’s Statement that if it acquires 
90% of the Renaissance Shares and proceeds to compulsory acquisition, it will terminate 
the Joint Venture Agreement, otherwise the parties will continue to develop the Okvau 
Project through the Joint Venture.  Any withdrawal or breach by Emerald of the Joint 
Venture and Joint Venture Agreement could have a material adverse impact on the 
assets and financial position of the Company.
9.9  Due diligence
Renaissance has provided Emerald with certain non-public information about 
Renaissance, for the purposes of Emerald conducting a due diligence review of that 
information in connection with the Offer.
9.10
Ineligible Foreign Shareholders
If you are an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder (that is, any Renaissance Shareholder who is 
a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction, or whose address is in a place outside Australia and 
its external territories, New Zealand, Singapore and Cambodia), unless Emerald 
otherwise determines that:

page | 58
(b)

Australia and its external territories, New Zealand, Singapore and Cambodia,
then you will not be entitled to receive Emerald Shares as consideration for your 
Renaissance Shares under the Offer.
Otherwise, Emerald will:
(c)
(d)
arrange for the issue to the Nominee of the number of Emerald Shares to which 
you and all other Ineligible Foreign Shareholders would have been entitled but for 
not residing in a place within Australia and its external territories, New Zealand, 
Singapore or Cambodia;
cause those Emerald Shares to be offered for sale on ASX as soon as practicable 
and otherwise in such a manner, at such price and on such other terms and 
conditions as are determined by the Nominee acting in good faith; and
(e)
promptly pay, or procure that the Nominee pays, to you the net proceeds of the 
sale of such shares.

Dear Directors
INDEPENDENT EXPERT’S REPORT
1.
Introduction
On 19 July 2016, Renaissance Minerals Limited (‘Renaissance’ or ‘the Company’) and Emerald Resources 
NL (‘Emerald’) jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive Bid Implementation Agreement 
in relation to a proposal to merge the two companies into a single entity (‘the Merged Entity’). Emerald 
proposes to merge with Renaissance via an off-market all scrip takeover offer for all the fully paid 
ordinary shares in Renaissance that it does not already own, offering 1.55 new Emerald shares for every 1 
Renaissance share on issue (‘the Offer’).
The Offer is subject to various conditions including a 90% minimum acceptance condition and extends to 
any Renaissance shares that are issued as a result of the exercise of Renaissance options during the Offer 
Period, as defined in the section 1.1 of Annexure A of the Bidder’s Statement.
Further details of the Offer are set out in Section 4.
2.  Summary and Opinion
2.1
Purpose of the report
The directors of Renaissance have requested that BDO Corporate Finance (WA) Pty Ltd (‘BDO’) prepare an 
independent expert’s report (‘our Report’) to express an opinion as to whether or not the Offer is fair and 
reasonable to the shareholders of Renaissance other than Emerald (‘Shareholders’).
Our Report is prepared pursuant to section 640 of the Corporations Act 2001 Cth (‘Corporations Act’ or 
‘the Act’), as Emerald and Renaissance share a common director, and is to be included in the Target’s 
Statement for Renaissance in order to assist the Shareholders in their decision whether to accept the 
Offer.
2.2
Approach
Our Report has been prepared having regard to Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’), 
Regulatory Guide 111 ‘Content of Expert’s Reports’ (‘RG 111’) and Regulatory Guide 112 ‘Independence 
of Experts’ (‘RG 112’).
BDO Corporate Finance (WA) Pty Ltd  ABN 27 124  031  045  AFS Licence No 316158 is a member of  a national association of  independent entities  which are all members of  BDO 
(Australia) Ltd ABN 77 050 110 275, an Australian company limited by guarantee. BDO Corporate Finance (WA) Pty Ltd and BDO (Australia) Ltd are members of BDO International 
Ltd,  a  UK  company  limited  by  guarantee,  and  form  part  of  the  international  BDO  network  of  independent  member  firms.  Liability  limited  by  a  scheme  approved  under 
Professional Standards Legislation (other than for the acts or omissions of financial services licensees) in each State or Territory other than Tasmania.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assessed the terms of the Offer as outlined in the body of our Report. 
We have considered:
  How the value of a Renaissance share prior to the Offer on a control basis compares to the value of
the consideration offered by Emerald for each Renaissance share;

The likelihood of a superior alternative offer being available to Renaissance;
  Other factors which we consider to be relevant to the Shareholders in their assessment of the Offer;
and

The position of Shareholders should the Offer not be successful.
2.3  Opinion
We have considered the terms of the Offer as outlined in the body of our Report and have concluded that 
the Offer is not fair but reasonable to Shareholders.
In our opinion, the Offer is not fair because the value of a Renaissance share prior to the Offer on a 
controlling basis is greater than the value of consideration offered; being 1.55 Emerald shares, on a 
minority basis. However, we consider the Offer to be reasonable because the advantages of the Offer 
to Shareholders are greater than the disadvantages.
In particular we consider that if the Offer is successful Shareholders will benefit from the experience of 
the management of Emerald in developing mines, the greater likelihood of obtaining funding for the 
project and from an offer that is greater than the pre-announcement market price of Renaissance shares.
2.4
Fairness
In section 12 we determined that the Offer consideration compares to the value of Renaissance, as 
detailed below.

The above pricing indicates that, in the absence of any other relevant information, the Offer is not fair for 
Shareholders.
In our assessment of fairness we are required by RG 111.31 to make a comparison between the value of 
the securities being offered, being 1.55 shares in Emerald (allowing for a minority discount), and the value 
of the target securities, being one Renaissance share, assuming 100% of the securities are available for 
sale.  This comparison reflects the fact that:
-
-
The acquirer is obtaining or increasing control in the target; and
The security holders of the target will be receiving scrip constituting minority interests in the 
acquirer.
In our assessment of the value range of a Renaissance share we have included a premium for control as 
required under RG111.11 (b), which we have determined to be within a range of 20% to 30%. In 
determining the value range of 1.55 shares in Emerald to be received as consideration, we have taken into 
account a minority interest discount, as required under RG111.31, which we determined to be within a 
range of 17% to 23%.
We are required to take this approach notwithstanding that the only material asset of Renaissance is the 
Okvau Project, of which control will pass under the existing Joint Venture agreement with Emerald 
regardless of the outcome of the Offer.
Comparing the value of a Renaissance share on a minority basis with the consideration offered on a 
minority basis reduces the valuation range, and results in the Offer being fair, if that approach was able to 
be adopted in our fairness assessment.
2.5
Reasonableness
We have considered the analysis in section 13 of this report, in terms of both:

advantages and disadvantages of the Offer; and
  other considerations, including the practical level of control of Renaissance if the Offer is
successful and the position of Shareholders if the Offer is not successful.
In our opinion, the position of Shareholders if the Offer is successful is more advantageous than the 
position if the Offer is not successful.  Accordingly, in the absence of any other relevant information 
and/or a superior proposal we believe that the Offer is reasonable for Shareholders.
The respective advantages and disadvantages considered are summarised below:

3.  Scope of the Report
3.1
Purpose of the Report
Emerald has prepared a Bidder’s Statement in accordance with section 636 of the Act.  Under section 633 
Item 10 of the Act Renaissance is required to prepare a Target Statement in response to the Bidder’s 
Statement.
Section 640 of the Act requires the Target Statement to include an independent expert’s report to 
shareholders if:


The bidder’s voting power in the target is 30% or more; or
The bidder and the target have a common director or directors.
At the date of our Report, Mr Ross Williams is a director of both Emerald and Renaissance.  Therefore, an 
independent expert’s report is required for inclusion in the Target Statement.  The Independent Directors 
of Renaissance have engaged BDO to satisfy this requirement.
3.2
Regulatory guidance
Neither the Listing Rules nor the Corporations Act defines the meaning of ‘fair and reasonable’. In 
determining whether the Offer is fair and reasonable, we have had regard to the views expressed by ASIC 
in RG 111.  This regulatory guide provides guidance as to what matters an independent expert should 
consider to assist security holders to make informed decisions about transactions.
This regulatory guide suggests that where the transaction is a control transaction, the expert should focus 
on the substance of the control transaction rather than the legal mechanism to affect it.  RG 111 suggests 
that where a transaction is a control transaction, it should be analysed on a basis consistent with a 
takeover bid.
In our opinion, the Offer is a control transaction as defined by RG 111 and we have therefore assessed the 
Offer as a control transaction to consider whether, in our opinion, it is fair and reasonable to 
Shareholders.
3.3
Adopted basis of evaluation
RG 111 states that a transaction is fair if the value of the offer price or consideration is greater than the 
value of the securities subject of the offer. This comparison should be made assuming a knowledgeable 
and willing, but not anxious, buyer and a knowledgeable and willing, but not anxious, seller acting at 
arm’s length.  Further to this, RG 111 states that a transaction is reasonable if it is fair.  It might also be 
reasonable if despite being ‘not fair’ the expert believes that there are sufficient reasons for security 
holders to accept the offer in the absence of any higher bid.
Having regard to the above, BDO has completed this comparison in three parts:


A comparison between the value of a Renaissance share prior to the Offer on a control basis and the 
value of the consideration offered by Emerald per Renaissance share on a minority basis (fairness – 
see Section 12 ‘Is the Offer Fair?’); and
An investigation into other significant factors to which Shareholders might give consideration, prior to 
accepting the Offer, after reference to the value derived above (reasonableness – see Section 13 ‘Is 
the Offer Reasonable?’).
5
RG 111 states that if a transaction is fair and reasonable then the expert can conclude that the 
transaction is in the best interests of shareholders; if a transaction is not fair but reasonable an expert can 
still conclude that the transaction is in the best interests of shareholders; if a transaction is neither fair 
nor reasonable then the expert would conclude that the transaction is not in the best interests of 
shareholders.
This assignment is a Valuation Engagement as defined by Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards 
Board professional standard APES 225 ‘Valuation Services’ (‘APES 225’).
A Valuation Engagement is defined by APES 225 as follows:
‘an Engagement or Assignment to perform a Valuation and provide a Valuation Report where the Valuer 
is free to employ the Valuation Approaches, Valuation Methods, and Valuation Procedures that a 
reasonable and informed third party would perform taking into consideration all the specific facts and 
circumstances of the Engagement or Assignment available to the Valuer at that time.’
This Valuation Engagement has been undertaken in accordance with the requirements set out in APES 225.

4.  Outline of the Offer
On 19 July 2016, Renaissance and Emerald jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive Bid 
Implementation Agreement in relation to a proposal to merge the two companies. Emerald proposes to 
merge with Renaissance via an off-market takeover offer for all the fully paid ordinary shares in 
Renaissance that it does not already own, offering 1.55 new Emerald shares for every 1 Renaissance share.
Our Report has been prepared to satisfy the requirement of Section 640 of the Act as the bidder (Emerald) 
and target (Renaissance) share a common director, being Mr Ross Williams.
4.1  Minimum acceptance condition
The Offer is subject to a 90% minimum acceptance such that Emerald (including its associates) has a 
relevant interest in more than 90% of all Renaissance Shares on both an undiluted and fully diluted basis.
As set out in the Target’s Statement, Renaissance shareholders representing 9.42% of Renaissance shares 
have entered into binding pre-bid acceptance agreements to accept the Offer. The effect of the pre-bid 
acceptances agreements combined with Emerald’s existing 10% interest means Emerald currently has a 
relevant interest in 19.42% of Renaissance shares on issue.
In addition, signed Shareholder intention statements have been received by the following Renaissance 
Shareholders to accept the Offer.

If Emerald (including its associates) acquires at least a 90% interest in Renaissance, and acquires at least 
75% (by number) of the Renaissance Shares it is offering to acquire under the Offer, Emerald will be 
entitled to compulsorily acquire any outstanding Renaissance shares, under section 661A of the 
Corporations Act. Emerald has indicated that it intends to proceed with compulsory acquisition, if entitled 
to do so, under section 661A of the Corporations Act.
4.2  Options
The Offer extends to any Renaissance shares that are issued as a result of the exercise of Renaissance 
options during the Offer period. As at the date of our Report, Renaissance has 25.5 million options 
outstanding (‘Renaissance Options’).
Under the Bid Implementation Agreement, Emerald will, as soon as practicable after making the Offer, 
make an offer to each holder of Renaissance Options. Emerald will offer Renaissance’s option holders, 
such that their Renaissance options will be cancelled or transferred in exchange for new Emerald options. 
The exercise price will be equal to the exercise price of the relevant Renaissance option divided by 1.55, 
and the expiry dates the same as the relevant Renaissance options.
Therefore, we have not considered the issue of shares on conversion of the Renaissance Options in our 
valuation of the Offer consideration.

4.3
Capital structure of the Merged Entity following the Offer
The table below assumes 100% acceptance of the Offer on an undiluted and diluted basis. We have 
considered the shareholding of existing Renaissance shareholders on a diluted basis, assuming the 
conversion of all Renaissance Options in the table below. Renaissance’s interest following the proposed 
merger will be reduced from 90% to 38.02% on an undiluted basis, and from 94.44% to 39.16% on a diluted 
basis.

5.  Profile of Renaissance
5.1
History
Renaissance was incorporated in January 2010 and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (‘ASX’) in 
June 2010. The Company is an exploration company based in Perth, Western Australia with its primary 
focus being the Cambodian Gold Project located in the eastern region of Cambodia. Renaissance also holds 
a tenement package in the Eastern Goldfields Province of the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia.
The Company acquired the Cambodian Gold Project from Oz Minerals Limited (‘Oz Minerals’) in February 
2012, and under the terms of the agreement to acquire the project from Oz Minerals dated February 2012 
and amended September 2013, Renaissance was required to make a cash payment of $5 million 12 months 
after completion of the acquisition, $10 million upon a decision to mine and $12.5 million six months after 
first gold production. On 12 August 2015, Renaissance reached an agreement with Oz Minerals to settle 
the balance outstanding for a 1.5% gross smelter royalty capped at $22.5 million.
The current board of directors are:
  Mr Hamish Halliday, Non-Executive Chairman;
  Mr David Kelly, Non-Executive Director;
  Mr Ross Williams, Non-Executive Director; and
  Mr Justin Tremain, Managing Director.
5.2
Key Funding Events
On 15 October 2012, Renaissance raised $10 million through the placement of 55.55 million shares at 
$0.18 per share, made to sophisticated and institutional investors. Oz Minerals participated in the 
placement to the amount of $1.5 million, reducing its deferred consideration from $5 million to $3.5 
million as per the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the Cambodian Gold Project.
On 23 July 2013, Renaissance announced a $2.2 million equity placement through the placement of 44 
million shares at $0.05 per share to existing institutional investors. On the same day it also announced a 
Share Purchase Plan to raise up to $0.5 million to enable all eligible shareholders the opportunity to 
participate at the placement price. The funding was to further develop its Cambodian Gold Project.
On 10 September 2013, an agreement was reached to defer $10 million payable upon a decision to mine. 
Previously the amount was payable upon establishing a JORC resource of at least 1.25 million ounces 
(‘Moz’). Renaissance issued 15.3 million shares to Oz Minerals as consideration for deferring the milestone 
payment.
On 30 July 2014, Renaissance announced that it had successfully raised $6 million through the placement 
of 92.3 million shares at $0.065 per share.  The placement was heavily oversubscribed and made to new 
and existing institutional and sophisticated investors. The funds raised were to be used primarily to 
accelerate exploration at the Cambodian Gold Project.
On 12 August 2015, Renaissance reached an agreement with Oz Minerals to swap a $22.5 million 
outstanding deferred milestone payment for a capped 1.5% gross smelter royalty. The restructure of 
payments to Oz Minerals removed significant impediments to the development of the Okvau Deposit at the 
Cambodian Gold Project.
9
On 17 August 2015, Renaissance announced that it received firm commitments to raise $1.7 million 
through an equity placement of 56.8 million shares at $0.03 per share, made to new and existing 
institutional and sophisticated shareholders. In addition, a Share Purchase Plan was offered to all eligible 
shareholders at the placement price to raise up to $0.3 million.
In conjunction with the placement announced on 17 August 2015, Oz Minerals’ entire shareholding of 50 
million shares was placed to new and existing institutional and sophisticated shareholders.
On 3 February 2016, Renaissance completed an equity placement of 114.8 million shares at $0.03 per 
share, raising $3.4 million. Emerald subscribed for 57.4 million shares, with the remaining 57.4 million

Projects
Cambodian Gold Project
The Cambodian Gold Project comprises the 100% owned Okvau and adjoining O’Chhung licences, covering 
an area of approximately 400 square kilometres (‘km2’). The project area is located 265 kilometres (‘km’) 
north-east of Phnom Penh, within the core of a prospective intrusion-related gold province in Cambodia’s 
eastern plains.
Renaissance acquired the Cambodian Gold Project from Oz Minerals in February 2012. At the time of the 
acquisition from OZ Minerals, the Cambodian Gold Project comprised the Okvau and O’Chhung licences, 
one additional exploration licence application and three joint venture interests (where OZ Minerals had 
the right to earn 85% in three exploration licences). Renaissance has subsequently withdrawn from the 
exploration licence application and joint venture interests such that the Cambodia Gold Project now 
comprises of only the Okvau and O’Chhung licences
The Company completed a Scoping Study in October 2014, and following positive results completed a Pre-
Feasibility Study (‘PFS’) in July 2015 for the development of a 1.5 million tonnes per annum (‘Mtpa’) 
operation based on the Okvau Deposit only. The PFS demonstrated the potential for a robust, low cost 
development which is expected to have an initial Life of Mine of 8 years.
The Okvau Deposit remains open with significant potential for resource growth. There are numerous high 
priority exploration prospects based upon anomalous geochemistry, geology and geophysics which remain 
untested with drilling, all within close proximity to the Okvau Deposit.
On 3 February 2016, the Company announced it had secured Emerald as a funding and development 
partner for its Cambodian Gold Project, through the execution of a memorandum of agreement. The 
formal Joint Venture Agreement was executed on 30 March 2016 and on 17 May 2016, a drilling 
exploration program commenced. The drilling program is to initially focus on previously identified target 
areas that are considered to have considerable upside scope for the currently defined resource estimate 
at the Okvau Deposit.
Further details on the Joint Venture Agreement with Emerald are set out in Section 6.2 and further details 
of the Cambodian Gold Project may be found in Appendix 3.
10
Pinjin Gold Project, Eastern Goldfields
The Pinjin Gold Project is located approximately 120 km east of Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, and 
covers an area of approximately 40km2. Over the past year work has been limited to low cost data review, 
interpretation and tenement reporting obligations. The Company is undertaking a review of historical data 
to plan for a small exploration program expected to be carried out in the next couple of months. As at 30 
June 2016, Renaissance held an 80% interest in the Pinjin Gold Project which holds one exploration 
tenement.
Quicksilver Gold Project
The Quicksilver Gold Project is located in the Tintina Gold Belt in south-west Alaska, which Renaissance 
holds a 90% interest. Renaissance has entered into an agreement with Afranex Gold Limited (‘Afranex’), 
an unlisted company, to dispose of its 90% interest for 10 million shares in Afranex.

Source: Renaissance Minerals Limited audited financial statements for the years ended 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015, reviewed 
financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2015 and unaudited financial statements the year ended 30 June 2016.
The Company’s auditor issued unmodified audit reports for the years ended 30 June 2014 and 2015 and an 
unmodified review report for the six months ended 31 December 2015.
We have not undertaken a review of Renaissance’s unaudited financial statements in accordance with 
Australian Auditing and Assurance Standard 2405 ‘Review of Historical Financial Information’ and do not 
express an opinion on this financial information. We have performed procedures to provide us with
11
sufficient comfort that there are reasonable grounds to include unaudited 30 June 2016 financial 
information in our Report. Nothing has come to our attention as a result of our procedures that would 
suggest the financial information within the unaudited financial statements has not been prepared on a 
reasonable basis.
We note the following in relation to Renaissance’s recent financial position:
  Cash and cash equivalents increased from $1.33 million as at 31 December 2015 to $3.70 million as
at 30 June 2016 attributable to the placement of 114.8 million shares on 9 February 2016 raising 
$3.4 million. The Company also received a research and development grant for $360,055 during 
the six months to 30 June 2016 under the Research and Development Incentive Scheme.
  Current trade and other receivables as at 30 June 2016 comprise trade debtors of $64,031 and
prepayments of $50,857. The decrease from 30 June 2015 is attributable to a reduction in trade 
debtors by approximately $50,000.
  Non-current trade and other receivables of $53,000 comprise deposits.
  Exploration and evaluation expenditure relates to capitalised acquisition costs for the Cambodian
Gold Project. All expenditure for the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2016 has been 
expensed to the income statement.
  Trade and other payables comprise trade creditors and accruals. As at 30 June 2016 trade
creditors totalled $41,571.
  Provisions relate to employee entitlements.
  Contributed equity increased from $50.06 million as at 30 June 2015 to $54.98 million as at 30
June 2016 following the placement of 56.8 million shares at $0.03 per share on 17 August 2015 and 
114.8 million shares at $0.03 per share on 3 February 2016.

6.  Profile of Emerald
6.1
History
Emerald was incorporated in September 1969, and listed on the ASX in July 1994 under the name Maple Oil 
NL. The company, formerly known as Matrix Oil NL and Emerald Oil and Gas NL, is based in Perth.
Over the past year Emerald has evaluated its commercial value in the current investment climate in the 
energy and broader resources sector. Following the assignment of its oil and gas interests in Magoffin 
County, Kentucky (refer to section 6.2), it has been identifying suitable projects to invest in. As part of 
this process Emerald engaged a team of highly experienced mining consultants who have achieved a 
significant level of commercial success in developing global resource projects and maximising shareholder 
return. The current board of directors are:
  Mr Simon Lee AO, Non-Executive Chairman;
  Mr Morgan Hart, Managing Director;
  Mr Ross Stanley, Non-Executive Director; and
  Mr Ross Williams, Non-Executive Director.
6.2
Projects
Joint Venture with Renaissance
Emerald carried out a due diligence program including geological and technical analysis, site visits and a 
legal review to evaluate the commercial potential of Renaissance’s Cambodian Gold Project (refer to 
section 5.3) as part of its identification process for suitable projects to invest in. Following the due 
diligence program, on 3 February 2016, Emerald announced that it had entered into a legally binding 
Memorandum of Agreement with Renaissance.
The agreement enables Emerald to earn up to a 51% interest in Renaissance’s Cambodian Gold Project by 
sole funding a Definitive Feasibility Study (‘DFS’) for the development of the Okvau Deposit to a bankable 
level, completing an Environment and Social Impact Assessment (‘ESIA’) and a two year exploration 
program totalling US$3 million. Emerald will manage the DFS and ESIA, while the exploration program will 
be jointly managed until such time that Emerald has earned its 51% interest.
Emerald's interest will be earned progressively, based on a combination of exploration expenditure and 
DFS completion as shown below:
Cumulative Spend
DFS Status

US$2.5 million
US$3 million

The cost to complete the DFS has been estimated at $4.5 million. As at the date of the Target’s 
Statement, Emerald has met the initial exploration expenditure commitment, however that interest (5%) 
has not yet been transferred.

Appalachian Gas – Magoffin County, Kentucky
Kentucky Energy Partners, LLC (‘KEP’), a partnership between Emerald (75%) and Slone Production, LLC 
(‘Slone’) (25%) holds various oil and gas leases in Magoffin County, Kentucky as part of the Appalachian 
gas operations.
During FY15, the Board of Emerald continued to evaluate its strategy with respect to the core operating 
assets in the Magoffin County, and following evaluation of the expected returns of the Appalachian gas 
operations, KEP and Slone entered into an assignment of the oil and gas leases with Slone Energy, LLC, a 
company associated with Slone, in July 2015.
The assignment includes existing fixtures, casing and pipelines use on and for leases, and in return 
Emerald maintains a nominal 5% overriding royalty interest in all gas production from various oil and gas 
interests located in Magoffin County, Kentucky.

The Company’s auditor issued unmodified audit reports for the years ended 30 June 2014 and 2015 and an 
unmodified review report for the six months ended 31 December 2015.
We have not undertaken a review of Emerald’s unaudited financial statements in accordance with 
Australian Auditing and Assurance Standard 2405 ‘Review of Historical Financial Information’ and do not 
express an opinion on this financial information. We have performed procedures to provide us with

information in our Report. Nothing has come to our attention as a result of our procedures that would

We note the following in relation to Emerald’s recent financial position:
  Cash and cash equivalents decreased from $17.97 million as at 30 June 2015 to $16.88 million as
at 31 December 2015, attributable to the purchase of approximately $943,000 in ASX listed 
company shares as part of its short-term investing strategies whilst a long term strategic investing 
opportunity is identified.
  Trade and other receivables comprise trade debtors, deposits and prepayments, and other
receivables. As at 30 June 2016, trade and other receivables comprise interest receivable of 
$57,905 and voluntary withholding credits of $14,103.

Financial assets comprise shares in ASX listed companies as part of Emerald’s low-yielding cash 
reserve short term investing strategy. The increase from $900,000 as at 31 December 2015 to 
$3.46 million as at 30 June 2016 is largely attributable to the shares held in Renaissance. Emerald 
acquired 57.4 million shares at $0.03 per share as part of the placement announced to the market 
on 3 February 2016. As at 30 June 2016, Renaissance shares were included in the financial 
statements at a fair value of $0.053, representing a gain of $3.21 million.
  Exploration and evaluation expenditure of $1.06 million as at 30 June 2016 relates to the Okvau
Deposit, which Emerald acquired an interest in on execution of the Joint Venture with Renaissance 
on 30 March 2016.
  Trade and other payables comprise trade creditors and accruals. As at 30 June 2016 trade
creditors totalled $259,134.

Source: Emerald Resources NL audited financial statements for the years ended 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015, reviewed financial 
statements for the half year ended 31 December 2015 and unaudited for the year ended 30 June 2016.
We note the following in relation to Emerald’s recent financial performance:

Since the assignment of its 75% interest in oil and gas leases to Slone Energy LLC in July 2015, 
Emerald no longer generates any revenue from the sale of gas.
  Other comprehensive income of $1.39 million for the year ended 30 June 2016 is largely
attributable to the increase in value of the 57.4 million Renaissance shares acquired through the 
placement announced on 3 February 2016.
  Corporate, legal and administration costs increased for the year ended 30 June 2015 due to 20
million options being granted to employees and consultants as part of the incentive component of 
their remuneration packages. The fair value of the options at grant date was $384,000.
  Consulting and contracting expenses relate to wages, salaries, fees and superannuation payments
for employees and consultants.
  Profit on the sale of assets of $1.18 million for the year ended 30 June 2014 relates to the sale of
shares in Emerald Oil Inc., a company listed on the Nasdaq
  The loss on the sale of assets of $819,699 for the year ended 30 June 2015 relates to the sale of
assets following the assignment of leases in return for a royalty interest.

Finance income relates to interest received, with cash at bank attracting a floating interest rate.

7.  Economic analysis
Renaissance and Emerald are exploration companies with interests in projects located Cambodia, Australia 
and the United States. The companies have a gold focus, with global demand for gold closely linked to the 
health of the global economy and financial markets. In this section we have addressed the economic 
factors impacting Renaissance and Emerald.
7.1
Global
The global economy has continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate than what was expected. Conditions 
have become challenging for a number of emerging market economies, while many advanced economies 
have improved over the past year. China’s growth rate continued to slow down over the first part of the 
year, despite recent activities by Chinese policymakers favouring the short-term economic outlook.
Britain’s recent decision to exit from the European Union has caused increased uncertainty in global 
financial markets; with initially severe falls in the stock market. The US$2.8 trillion aggregate fall in the 
global stock markets on 24 June 2016 was the largest fall ever suffered and the drop in the value of 
Sterling on 24 June 2016 was the largest seen since 1992. The aftershocks of the vote have exacerbated an 
already poor economic environment in Europe, and the full impact of the result is probably yet to be seen. 
The reactions will continue to be felt until the political situation in the United Kingdom, and at European 
Union level, develop sufficiently to offer stability and, most importantly, certainty.
7.2
Australia
The Australian economy overall is continuing to grow, despite considerable falls in business investment. In 
2015, overall gross domestic product growth seemed to pick up, along with an increasingly healthy labour 
market. Continual growth is expected in Australia throughout 2016, however at a more moderate pace. 
Labour market signs have been mixed of late, however it has been supporting the continued expansion of 
employment in the short term. The inflation rate remains low in Australia and given the low growth in 
labour costs, this is expected to continue for some time.
Commodity prices have increased recently, however they are still much lower than that of a few years 
ago, with terms of trade remaining much lower than it has been in recent years. Prices tend to rely on 
demand, in particular from the Chinese industrial sector, along with the response to changes in supply.
Due to low oil prices, producers of bulk commodities have in general been reducing their cost of 
production, as oil is an important input for the transportation of these commodities. However, the ability 
for these producers to continue to reduce their costs is limited and may lead to firms exiting the market.
Low trade from the Australian economy will lead to tough market conditions, along with weak global 
commodity prices. This may be partially offset by the uncertainty created in global financial markets by 
Britain’s proposed exit from the European Union, which has had a positive impact on gold prices.
Gold demand reached 1,290 tonnes in the first quarter of 2016, which is the second largest quarter on 
record with at 21% increase. This rise in demand was primarily driven by huge inflows into exchange 
traded funds. Prices have soared even further in recent times, increasing by approximately 5% on the day 
of the aforementioned British exit.
The financial markets have seemed to improve after experiencing high levels of volatility over the past 
few months. The uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook and policy settings tend to have
21
participants concerned. However, funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and monetary 
policy around the globe remains loose.
Credit is recording moderate growth overall. Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing, spending 
and domestic demand. Growth in lending to the housing market has broadly been steady over recent 
months. Dwelling prices continue to remain steady in Sydney and Melbourne, and have remained quiet in 
other cities around the country.
Over the past year, the Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising USD, though less so 
against a basket of currencies. Between early February and late April, the Australian dollar appreciated by 
6% on a trade-weighted index basis and by 9% against the USD. This appreciation reflects increases in 
commodity prices, reduced expectations of the pace of policy tightening in the US by both the Federal 
Open Market Committee and the market. In order to achieve balanced growth in the economy, a lower 
exchange rate is likely to be needed.

7.3
Cambodia
Economic growth in Cambodia averaged above 7% over the last 20 years, making Cambodia one of the 
fastest growing economies in East Asia. In recent years, Cambodia has moved closer to lower-middle-
income status driven by solid performances in garment manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, and 
construction.
Cambodia’s export-led growth in 2015 was driven by strong garment exports and an expanding 
construction sector, offsetting slowdowns in the agriculture and tourism sectors. There has been strong 
growth in manufacturing due to the establishment of export oriented textile and shoe factories, labour 
market stability and moving up the value chain of goods produced. Sustained foreign direct investment 
assisted the construction sector which continued to expand despite building approvals falling.
On the other hand, the tourism sector experienced a slowdown in activity. In 2015, the number of tourist 
arrivals grew by 6.1% in 2015, a slight fall from 2014 of 6.9%. This slight reduction resulted in lower 
revenue collected at tourist sites. The agriculture sector also experienced a slowdown as a result of the 
recent drought, as well as slow improvements in yields and depressed agriculture commodity prices, 
constraining growth.
Fiscal performance improved, with substantial revenue growth and contained expenditures continuing to 
curb the overall fiscal deficit. On 14 June 2016, the government announced the budget plan for 2017, with 
spending budgeted to increase by 6.9%. Government spending over the next year will have a strong focus 
on the agricultural sector which has been severely affected by El Niño.
There has been a rapid expansion of the financial sector to accommodate economic growth. Domestic 
credit growth reached 27% in 2015 driven by increasing domestic demand for consumption and 
construction. Recent increases in capital requirements are expected to help strengthen financial stability.
The poverty rate continues to fall in Cambodia, although the pace has declined significantly in recent 
years. Further reductions of poverty are expected for both urban and rural households. This is largely due 
to the expansion of the construction and services sectors, and an increase in other sources of income 
beyond agricultural income.
22
In 2016, Cambodia is forecast to grow at 6.9%, driven by increased government spending. Strong garment 
exports should offset a slowdown in agriculture, while the construction sector is expected to remain the 
driver of economic growth.

Industry analysis
Renaissance and Emerald are exploration companies based in Perth, Western Australia with their primary 
focus being the Cambodian Gold Project located in the eastern region of Cambodia.
8.1
Gold
Gold is both a commodity and an international store of monetary value. Once mined, gold continues to 
exist indefinitely, often melted down and recycled to produce alternative or replacement products. This 
characteristic means that gold demand is supported by mine production, gold recycling and central bank 
selling.
As illustrated in the chart below, gold mine production was approximately 3,155 tonnes (‘t’) in 2015 and 
gold consumption was 4,252t. Demand for gold has consistently exceeded supply over the last 10 years, 
and the escalated level of economic and financial uncertainty during recent years has caused investors to 
move capital from risky assets to gold assets, which are perceived to be a good store of monetary value. 
As a result, total gold demand as a percentage of total gold supply has reached a high of 168% in 2010.

Until the late 1980’s, South Africa produced approximately half of the total gold produced. More recently 
however, gold production has become geographically segmented with production dominated by China, 
Australia, Russia and the United States.

8.2
Gold Prices
The price of gold fluctuates on a daily basis depending on global demand and supply factors. The softening 
of gold prices from 2013 to 2015 is reflective of the recovery of global economic conditions. The value of 
gold peaked at US$1,900 per ounce in September 2011. This peak was largely caused by the debt market 
crisis in Europe, but it was also driven by the Standard and Poor’s downgrade of the US credit rating. This 
sent global stock markets tumbling and a flood of investors towards safer havens such as gold.
Prices contracted in December 2011 reaching a low of US$1,545 per ounce followed by a recovery in 2012, 
reaching US$1,790 per ounce on 4 October 2012. Gold prices were on a steady decline over 2013 and 2014. 
More recently, gold prices from January 2015 through to December 2015 have averaged US$1,160 per 
ounce, ranging from a low of US$1,051 per ounce on 17 December 2015 to a high of US$1,302 per ounce on 
22 January 2015. Since then, the gold price has benefited from global uncertainty, along with Britain’s 
proposed exit from the European Union. This has seen the price of gold reach its highest levels in almost 
two years, with the price of gold at 4 August 2016 being US$1,361 per ounce.

According to Consensus Economics, gold prices are forecast to decrease slightly in the short to medium 
term, after having climbed 22% in the year to date. It is forecast that the gold price will remain steady in 
the long term to be approximately US$1,255 per ounce by 2020.
8.3
Gold Mining in Cambodia
Cambodia’s gold just like other minerals is largely untapped. However, this seems to be changing with the 
recent surge in interest from the international mining community. Mining remains in the exploration 
rather than exploitation stage and to date no industrial scale extraction of minerals has taken place.
The Royal Government of Cambodia has recognised that gold mining is a key to the country’s economic 
growth, and has collaborated with a number of major international and local companies to open up the 
mining sector to outside interests.  Cambodian law allows for wholly foreign-owned mining companies to 
receive licences and according to the March 2013 release on the Current Situation of Mining Industry in 
Cambodia published by the General Department of Mineral Resources, 139 exploration licences have been 
issued, with 20 projects showing positive results.
Cambodia has three major projects, all of which are still in the exploration phases, with Angkor Gold 
Limited and Renaissance Minerals Limited’s gold projects considered the most exciting.

9.  Valuation approach adopted
There are a number of methodologies which can be used to value a business or the shares in a company.  
The principal methodologies which can be used are as follows:


Capitalisation of future maintainable earnings (‘FME’)
Discounted cash flow (‘DCF’)
  Quoted market price basis (‘QMP’)
  Net asset value (‘NAV’)
A summary of each of these methodologies is outlined in Appendix 2.
Different methodologies are appropriate in valuing particular companies, based on the individual 
circumstances of that company and available information.
In assessing whether the Offer is fair for Shareholders, we have assessed the Offer as follows:

A comparison between the value of Renaissance shares on a control basis prior to the Offer and the 
value of the consideration offered on a minority basis, being 1.55 Emerald shares for every 1 
Renaissance share held.
9.1
Valuation of Renaissance shares prior to the Offer
In our assessment of the value of Renaissance shares prior to the Offer we have chosen to employ the 
following methodologies:
  NAV as our primary approach; and
  QMP as our secondary approach.
We have chosen these methodologies for the following reasons:




As Renaissance is an exploration and pre-development company, the core value of Renaissance is in 
the exploration and development assets it holds. We have instructed CSA Global Pty Ltd (‘CSA’) to act 
as independent specialist and provide an independent market valuation of the Company’s mineral 
assets in accordance with the Australian Code for Public Reporting of technical Assessments and 
Valuations of Minerals Assets (‘the Valmin Code  2015’) and the Australasian Code for Reporting of 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (‘JORC Code 2012’). CSA’s full report may 
be found in Appendix 3. We have considered this in the context of Renaissance’s other assets and 
liabilities on a NAV basis;
The QMP basis is a relevant methodology to consider as Renaissance’s shares are listed on the ASX. 
This means there is a regulated and observable market where Renaissance’s shares can be traded. 
However, in order for the QMP methodology to be considered appropriate, the Company’s shares 
should be liquid and the market should be fully informed as to its activities. We have considered 
these factors in section 10.2 of our Report;
Renaissance does not generate regular trading income. Therefore there are no historic profits that 
could be used to represent future earnings. This means that the FME valuation approach is not 
appropriate;
Renaissance has no foreseeable future net cash inflows and therefore the application of the DCF 
valuation approach is not appropriate. Under RG111, it is considered that it is only appropriate to use 
DCF to value a mining asset where we have reasonable grounds to do so.
26
9.2
Valuation of an Emerald share following the Offer
When assessing non-cash consideration in control transactions, RG 111.31 suggests that a comparison 
should be made between the value of the securities being offered (allowing for a minority discount) and 
the value of the target entity’s securities, assuming 100% of the securities are available for sale. This 
comparison reflects the fact that:
(a)  the acquirer is obtaining or increasing control of the target; and
(b)  the security holders in the target will be receiving scrip constituting minority interests in the
combined entity.
In our assessment of the value of an Emerald share following the Offer, we have adopted the Sum-of-Parts 
methodology.
We have employed the Sum-of-Parts methodology in estimating the fair market value of the Merged 
Entity, by aggregating the estimated fair market values of its underlying assets and liabilities, having 
consideration to:




The value of the Okvau Deposit and surrounding exploration ground at the Cambodian Gold Project;
The value of the other assets and liabilities of Renaissance;
The value of Emerald. In our valuation of Emerald, we have considered the NAV methodology as the 
value of net assets on a going concern basis is usually appropriate where the majority of assets consist 
of cash, passive investments or projects with a limited life; and
The number of shares on issue following the Offer which will include the issue of 1.55 new Emerald 
shares for every 1 Renaissance share that Emerald does not already own.
A minority discount is applied to the NAV to arrive at the value of an Emerald share following the Offer to 
be used in our assessment of fairness.

We have performed additional procedures in order to provide ourselves with sufficient comfort to use the 
30 June 2016 unaudited balance sheet of Renaissance. We have been advised that there has not been a 
significant change in the net assets of Renaissance since 30 June 2016.  The table above indicates the net 
asset value of a Renaissance share is between $0.029 and $0.066.
The following adjustments were made to the net assets of Renaissance as at 30 June 2016 in arriving at 
our valuation.
Note 1: Valuation of Renaissance’s mineral assets
We instructed CSA to provide an independent market valuation of Renaissance’s Cambodian Gold Project, 
comprising the Okvau Gold Deposit and surrounding exploration ground. CSA considered a number of 
different valuation methods when valuing the exploration assets of Renaissance. CSA applied the DCF, 
Comparative Transactions and the Yardstick methodologies when forming an opinion on the value of the 
Okvau Gold Deposit. CSA relied on Comparative Transactions and the Geoscientific Rating methodology
28
when forming an opinion on the value of the surrounding exploration ground. We consider these methods 
to be appropriate given the pre-feasibility stage of development for Renaissance’s mineral assets.
CSA’s Independent Technical Specialist’s Report is attached as Appendix 3.
The range of values for the Okvau Gold Deposit and surrounding exploration ground as valued by CSA is set 
out below:

The table above indicates a range of values for the Cambodian Gold Project between US$20.0 million and 
US$52.5 million, with a preferred value of US$31.5 million.
As Emerald has the right to earn a 51% interest in the Cambodian Gold Project under the terms of the 
Joint Venture Agreement as at the date of our Report, we have attributed 49% of the value ascribed by 
CSA to Renaissance.
We recognise that Emerald will only earn its 51% upon the satisfactory completion of the DFS. It is not 
possible to determine what the value of the Cambodian Gold Project will be at that time. However, a PFS 
has been completed and CSA has prepared its valuation on that basis. As explained in the JORC Code 2012 
‘A Feasibility Study is of a higher level of confidence than a Pre-Feasibility Study’. It will not necessarily 
show a higher value, but rather a more accurate value. As such we consider it appropriate to use CSA’s 
current valuation of the Project in our assessment.
Converted to Australian dollars using an exchange rate of 1 AUD: 0.7495 USD at the date the valuation was 
assessed by CSA, indicates a range of values between $26.7 million and $70.1 million, with a preferred 
value of $42.0 million. Hence, Renaissance’s 49% interest in valued between $13.1 million and $34.3 
million, with a preferred value of $20.6 million.
10.2  Quoted Market Prices for Renaissance Securities
To provide a comparison to the valuation of Renaissance in Section 10.1, we have also assessed the quoted 
market price for a Renaissance share.
The quoted market value of a company’s shares is reflective of a minority interest.  A minority interest is 
an interest in a company that is not significant enough for the holder to have an individual influence in the 
operations and value of that company.
RG 111.11 suggests that when considering the value of a company’s shares for the purposes of approval 
the expert should consider a premium for control.  An acquirer could be expected to pay a premium for 
control due to the advantages they will receive should they obtain 100% control of another company.  
These advantages include the following:
control over decision making and strategic direction;
access to underlying cash flows;
control over dividend policies; and
access to potential tax losses.

Whilst Emerald may not obtain 100% of Renaissance, RG 111 states that the expert should calculate the 
value of a target’s shares as if 100% control were being obtained.  RG 111.13 states that the expert can 
then consider an acquirer’s practical level of control when considering reasonableness.  Reasonableness 
has been considered in Section 13.
Therefore, our calculation of the quoted market price of a Renaissance share including a premium for 
control has been prepared in two parts.  The first part is to calculate the quoted market price on a 
minority interest basis.  The second part is to add a premium for control to the minority interest value to 
arrive at a quoted market price value that includes a premium for control.
Minority interest value
Our analysis of the quoted market price of a Renaissance share is based on the pricing prior to the 
announcement of the Offer.  This is because the value of a Renaissance share after the announcement 
may include the effects of any change in value as a result of the Offer.  However, we have considered the 
value of a Renaissance share following the announcement when we have considered reasonableness in 
Section 13.
Information on the Offer was announced to the market on 19 July 2016.  Therefore, the following chart 
provides a summary of the share price movement over the 12 months to 15 July 2016 which was the last 
trading day prior to the announcement.

This table indicates that Renaissance’s shares display a low level of liquidity, with 25.48% of the 
Company’s current issued capital being traded in a twelve month period.  For the quoted market price 
methodology to be reliable there needs to be a ‘deep’ market in the shares.  RG 111.69 indicates that a 
‘deep’ market should reflect a liquid and active market.  We consider the following characteristics to be 
representative of a deep market:
Regular trading in a company’s securities;
Approximately 1% of a company’s securities are traded on a weekly basis;


32


The spread of a company’s shares must not be so great that a single minority trade can significantly 
affect the market capitalisation of a company; and
There are no significant but unexplained movements in share price.
A company’s shares should meet all of the above criteria to be considered ‘deep’, however, failure of a 
company’s securities to exhibit all of the above characteristics does not necessarily mean that the value 
of its shares cannot be considered relevant.
In the case of Renaissance, we do not consider there to be a deep market as only 21.56% of the total 
number of outstanding shares have been traded in the last six months leading up to the announcement of 
the Offer.
Our assessment is that a range of values for Renaissance shares based on market pricing, after 
disregarding post announcement pricing, is between $0.050 and $0.065.

In arriving at an appropriate control premium to apply we note that observed control premiums can vary 
due to the:
  Nature and magnitude of non-operating assets;
  Nature and magnitude of discretionary expenses;

Perceived quality of existing management;
  Nature and magnitude of business opportunities not currently being exploited;



Ability to integrate the acquiree into the acquirer’s business;
Level of pre-announcement speculation of the transaction;
Level of liquidity in the trade of the acquiree’s securities.
The table above indicates that the long term average control premium paid by acquirers of gold mining 
companies listed on the ASX is approximately 37% since 2008, with a median of 40%. In assessing the 
sample of transactions for gold companies listed on the ASX, we excluded transactions where the
33
announced control premium was in excess of 100% or the acquired obtained a controlling interest at a 
discount (i.e. less than 0%) to remove the effects of outliers.
In determining a control premium range most appropriate for Renaissance, we reviewed control 
transactions of a similar nature and scale. We considered this to be an appropriate approach, noting that 
observed control premiums are generally influenced by factors such as the size of the deal and whether 
the consideration is cash or scrip. Of the 58 transactions identified, there were 35 transactions where the 
consideration was satisfied by scrip, with an average announced premium of 36%.
Based on the above research, we believe that are appropriate control premium to apply in our valuation of 
Renaissance shares is between 20% and 30%. We consider a slighter lower control premium to be 
appropriate as Emerald has the right to earn up to a 51% interest in the Cambodian Gold Project.
Quoted market price including control premium
Applying a control premium to Renaissance’s quoted market share price results in the following quoted 
market price value including a premium for control:

Therefore, our valuation of a Renaissance share based on the quoted market price method and including a 
premium for control is between $0.060 and $0.084, with a midpoint value of $0.073.

We note that the values obtained under the QMP method are higher that the values obtained from the NAV 
at the low and preferred end of the range. The difference between the values obtained under the QMP 
method and the NAV method may be explained by the following:
  The NAV value is lower than the QMP value at the low and preferred end of the range, which is not
uncommon for exploration companies which often trade at a premium to their net asset value.
34
  The QMP value reflects investors’ perception of the future prospects of Renaissance. Investors in 
mining exploration companies typically anticipate the upside potential for the company, which is 
factored into the share price in advance of any such value being warranted.
  Under RG111.69 (d), the QMP methodology is considered appropriate when a liquid and active
market exists for the securities. From our analysis of the QMP of a Renaissance share in section 
10.2, we note that only 21.56% of the Company’s issued capital has been traded in the six months 
prior to the announcement of the Offer, which represents a low level of liquidity over the period. 
As a result of the lack of liquidity, we have not relied on the QMP value in assessing the value of a 
Renaissance share prior to the Offer.
  Renaissance’s most significant assets are its exploration assets and as such, the net asset value is
the most appropriate method to value Renaissance’s shares.
Based on the results above we consider the value of a Renaissance share to be between $0.029 and 
$0.066, with a preferred value of $0.042.

The table above indicates the net asset value of an Emerald share following the Offer is between $0.014 
and $0.032.
The following adjustments were made to the net assets of Emerald following the Offer in arriving at our 
valuation.
Note 1: Exploration commitments and funding of DFS
As at the date of the Target’s Statement, Emerald has met the initial exploration expenditure 
commitment. That is, Emerald has spent US$0.5 million out of a total of US$3 million.
On earning its 51% interest in the Cambodian Gold Project, Emerald will have incurred an additional 
US$2.5 million ($3.2 million using an exchange rate of 1 AUD: 0.7699 USD as at 11 August 2015).
In addition to the exploration expenditure commitments, Emerald is to sole fund the Cambodian Gold 
Project to DFS. As set out in Emerald’s prospectus lodged on 30 March 2016, the DFS is estimated to costs 
$4.5 million.
As a result, we have deducted $3.2 million from the cash balance of Emerald in relation to the outstanding 
exploration expenditure commitments and $4.5 million that will be incurred to complete the DFS for the 
Cambodian Gold Project. We note that this is a conservative approach as this expenditure may increase 
the value of the Project.
Note 2: Minority discount
The net asset value of an Emerald share following the Offer is reflective of a controlling interest. This 
suggests that the acquirer obtains an interest in the company which allows them to have an individual 
influence in the operations and value of the company. Therefore, if the Offer is accepted, the current 
Shareholders of Renaissance may become minority interest shareholders in Emerald, meaning that 
Shareholders’ individual holding will not be considered significant enough to have an individual influence 
in the operations and value of the Company.
Therefore, we have adjusted our valuation of an Emerald share following the Offer to reflect a minority 
interest holding. A minority interest discount is the inverse of a premium for control and is calculated
36
using the formula 1 – [1 / (1+control premium)]. As discussed in Section 10.2, we consider an appropriate 
control premium for Renaissance, and Emerald following the Offer, to be in the range of 20% to 30%.
Note 3: Number of shares
We have adjusted the number of shares on issue to reflect the number of new Emerald shares to be 
issued, assuming full acceptance of the Offer.

We have performed additional procedures in order to provide ourselves with sufficient comfort to use the 
30 June 2016 unaudited balance sheet of Emerald. We have been advised that there has not been a 
significant change in the net assets of Emerald since 30 June 2016.
37
The following adjustments were made to the net assets of Emerald as at 30 June 2016 in arriving at our 
valuation.
Note 1: Financial Assets
Financial assets comprise prepayments and shares held in ASX listed companies. We have adjusted the

Note 2: Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure of $1.06 million represents expenditure incurred by Emerald in 
relation to the Okvau Gold Deposit to 30 June 2016. As Emerald has the right to earn a 51% interest in the 
Cambodian Gold Project under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement as at the date of our Report, we 
have attributed 51% of the value ascribed by CSA to Emerald.
As discussed in section 10.1 we consider it appropriate to use CSA’s current valuation of the project in our 
assessment, despite Emerald only earning its 51% interest upon the satisfactory completion of the DFS.
11.3  Value of the consideration
The consideration offered to Renaissance shareholders is 1.55 new Emerald shares for every 1 Renaissance 
share held. As set out below, the value of consideration per 1 Renaissance share is between $0.022 and 
$0.050, with a preferred value of $0.031.

We note from the table above that the value of a Renaissance share prior to the Offer is greater than the 
value of consideration offered per share, being 1.55 new Emerald shares for every 1 Renaissance share 
that Emerald does not already own.  Therefore, we consider that the Offer is not fair.
39
13.  Is the Offer reasonable?
13.1  Alternative Proposal
We are unaware of any alternative proposal that might offer the Shareholders of Renaissance a premium 
over the value ascribed to, resulting from the Offer. Given that Emerald has the right to earn up to a 51% 
interest in the Cambodian Gold Project upon meeting the exploration expenditure commitments and 
completing the DFS, we consider it unlikely that an offer will be received from an alternative bidder.
If the Offer is not successful, the only likely party to present an alternative, or superior, offer at a future 
date would be Emerald.
13.2  Practical Level of Control
The Offer is subject to a minimum acceptance level of 90%. If the Offer is successful, and this condition is 
not waived, Emerald will hold between 90% and 100% of the issued capital in Renaissance.
Renaissance shareholders will hold a maximum of approximately 39.16% (on a diluted basis) of the issued 
capital of Emerald (based on 100% acceptance).
13.3  Consequences of not Accepting the Offer
The minimum acceptance condition
The Offer is subject to a minimum acceptance condition of 90%. If 90% acceptance is reached, and 
Emerald acquire at least 75% (by number) of the Renaissance shares it is offering to acquire under the 
Offer, Emerald will be entitled under section 661A of the Corporations Act to compulsorily acquire any 
Renaissance shares not accepted under the Offer. Emerald has indicated in its Bidder’s Statement that it 
intends to proceed with compulsory acquisition if the minimum acceptance is met.
If compulsory acquisition occurs, Renaissance Shareholders, who do not accept the Offer will be paid their 
consideration later than the Renaissance Shareholders who accept the Offer and Emerald has not stated in 
its Bidder’s Statement the cash sum it would propose for any compulsory acquisition of the Renaissance 
shares or Renaissance options.

On the day the Offer was announced, the share price closed 8.8% higher than the previous day at $0.062. 
In the days subsequent to the announcement, the share price of Renaissance has traded between $0.062 
and $0.066, with the highest day of trading being 20 July 2016 where 6,686,360 shares were traded.
Given the above analysis it is possible that if the Offer is not successful then Renaissance’s share price 
may decline.
13.4  Advantages of Accepting the Offer
We have considered the following advantages when assessing whether the Offer is reasonable.

Comparing the value of a Renaissance share on
Emerald holds a 19.42% relevant interest in Renaissance through its
a minority basis with the consideration offered
own holdings (10%) and Renaissance shareholders entering binding

on executing a Joint Venture Agreement with Renaissance on 30
March 2016.
If we were to compare the value of Renaissance on a minority basis
with the value of consideration offered on a minority basis, it would
reduce the range of values prior to and following the Offer as set

Emerald and Renaissance are a natural fit
Emerald and Renaissance are a natural fit given the existing joint

company.
100% project ownership under one entity and
The merged entity allows for 100% project ownership under one
one management team will simplify project
entity and one management team.  This should lead to improved
funding and improve market appeal
funding options as development financing will be easier to source
under the merged entity and on more attractive terms.
The merged entity should also see a re-rating due to management
credibility and the improved ability to finance the Okvau Gold
Project through to development.
In addition, the Merged Entity will have broader equity market
appeal from scale, liquidity and simplified ownership.

Regis Resources Limited.
Therefore, if the Offer is successful the Cambodian Gold Project
will be managed by a well credentialed management team, with
experience in low cost mine development and proven success in the
commercial development of a number of gold projects. As a result,
operating and capital cost savings are expected under the merged
entity.

Emerald
Emerald has engaged highly experienced mining consultants who
have a proven track record in achieving commercial development
for global resource projects.
As at 30 June 2016, Emerald has a cash balance of $14.5 million.
The company has a further US$2.5 million (AU$3.2 million) in
exploration expenditure commitments, and must incur an estimated
cost of $4.5 million to fund the Cambodian Gold Project through to
DFS, in order to earn its 51% interest. As a result, Emerald will have
approximately $6.8 million in cash after expenditure commitments
on the Okvau Gold Deposit.
Eliminates a key risk for Renaissance of
Accepting the Offer will eliminate the risk of Emerald exiting the
Emerald walking away from the Joint Venture
joint venture and Renaissance losing the financial support of
Emerald as sole funder of the DFS for the development of the Okvau
Gold Deposit.
Emerald’s interest is earned progressively, as set out in section 6.2,
42
Advantage
Description
and as at the date of our Report Emerald has met the initial
exploration expenditure commitment. However, there still remains
a risk that Emerald could either fund the Okvau Gold Deposit to DFS
and not advance the project further or walk away from the Joint
Venture prior to funding the DFS for the development of the Okvau
Deposit to a bankable level, and completing an ESIA.
If Emerald were to walk away from the Joint Venture it would also
likely limit Renaissance’s ability to access future development
funding and market support as it is unlikely that another company
would present as an alternative acquirer of Renaissance.
13.5  Disadvantages of Accepting the Offer
If the Offer is approved, in our opinion, the potential disadvantages to Shareholders include those listed in 
the table below:
Disadvantage
Description
The Offer is not fair
As set out in Section 12, the Offer is not fair. RG 111 states that an
offer is reasonable if it is fair.
Dilution of existing Shareholders’ interests
In the event that the Offer is successful, existing shareholders will
have their shareholding diluted from 90% to 38.02% on an undiluted
basis, and to 39.16% on a diluted basis, prior to Emerald earning any
interest in the Cambodian Gold Project.
If Emerald continues with the Joint Venture and earns its 51%
interest, existing shareholders will have their shareholding diluted
from an effective project interest of 44.10% to 38.02% on an
undiluted basis, and from 46.28% to 39.16% on a diluted basis.
14.  Conclusion
We have considered the terms of the Offer as outlined in the body of our Report and have concluded that 
the Offer is not fair but reasonable to Shareholders.
In our opinion, the Offer is not fair because the value of a Renaissance share prior to the Offer on a 
controlling basis is greater than the value of consideration offered; being 1.55 Emerald shares, on a 
minority basis. However, we consider the Offer to be reasonable because the advantages of the Offer to 
Shareholders are greater than the disadvantages.
In particular we consider that if the Offer is successful Shareholders will benefit from the experience of 
the management of Emerald in developing mines, the greater likelihood of obtaining funding for the 
project and from an offer that is greater than the pre-announcement market price of Renaissance shares.

Appendix 2 – Valuation Methodologies
Methodologies commonly used for valuing assets and businesses are as follows:
Net asset value (‘NAV’)
1 
Asset based methods estimate the market value of an entity’s securities based on the realisable value of 
its identifiable net assets.  Asset based methods include:
  Orderly realisation of assets method

Liquidation of assets method
  Net assets on a going concern method
The orderly realisation of assets method estimates fair market value by determining the amount that 
would be distributed to entity holders, after payment of all liabilities including realisation costs and 
taxation charges that arise, assuming the entity is wound up in an orderly manner.
The liquidation method is similar to the orderly realisation of assets method except the liquidation 
method assumes the assets are sold in a shorter time frame.  Since wind up or liquidation of the entity 
may not be contemplated, these methods in their strictest form may not be appropriate.  The net assets 
on a going concern method estimates the market values of the net assets of an entity but does not take 
into account any realisation costs.
Net assets on a going concern basis are usually appropriate where the majority of assets consist of cash, 
passive investments or projects with a limited life.  All assets and liabilities of the entity are valued at 
market value under this alternative and this combined market value forms the basis for the entity’s 
valuation.
Often the FME and DCF methodologies are used in valuing assets forming part of the overall Net assets on 
a going concern basis.  This is particularly so for exploration and mining companies where investments are 
in finite life producing assets or prospective exploration areas.
These asset based methods ignore the possibility that the entity’s value could exceed the realisable value 
of its assets as they do not recognise the value of intangible assets such as management, intellectual 
property and goodwill.  Asset based methods are appropriate when an entity is not making an adequate 
return on its assets, a significant proportion of the entity’s assets are liquid or for asset holding 
companies.
Quoted Market Price Basis (‘QMP’)
2 
A valuation approach that can be used in conjunction with (or as a replacement for) other valuation 
methods is the quoted market price of listed securities.  Where there is a ready market for securities such 
as the ASX, through which shares are traded, recent prices at which shares are bought and sold can be 
taken as the market value per share.  Such market value includes all factors and influences that impact 
upon the ASX.  The use of ASX pricing is more relevant where a security displays regular high volume 
trading, creating a ‘deep’ market in that security.
Capitalisation of future maintainable earnings (‘FME’)
3 
This method places a value on the business by estimating the likely FME, capitalised at an appropriate rate 
which reflects business outlook, business risk, investor expectations, future growth prospects and other 
entity specific factors. This approach relies on the availability and analysis of comparable market data.
50
The FME approach is the most commonly applied valuation technique and is particularly applicable to 
profitable businesses with relatively steady growth histories and forecasts, regular capital expenditure 
requirements and non-finite lives.
The FME used in the valuation can be based on net profit after tax or alternatives to this such as earnings 
before interest and tax (‘EBIT’) or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(‘EBITDA’). The capitalisation rate or ‘earnings multiple’ is adjusted to reflect which base is being used 
for FME.
Discounted future cash flows (‘DCF’)
4 
The DCF methodology is based on the generally accepted theory that the value of an asset or business 
depends on its future net cash flows, discounted to their present value at an appropriate discount rate 
(often called the weighted average cost of capital). This discount rate represents an opportunity cost of 
capital reflecting the expected rate of return which investors can obtain from investments having 
equivalent risks.
Considerable judgement is required to estimate the future cash flows which must be able to be reliably 
estimated for a sufficiently long period to make this valuation methodology appropriate.
A terminal value for the asset or business is calculated at the end of the future cash flow period and this is 
also discounted to its present value using the appropriate discount rate.
DCF valuations are particularly applicable to businesses with limited lives, experiencing growth, that are 
in a start up phase, or experience irregular cash flows.
Market Based Assessment
5 
The market based approach seeks to arrive at a value for a business by reference to comparable 
transactions involving the sale of similar businesses.  This is based on the premise that companies with 
similar characteristics, such as operating in similar industries, command similar values.  In performing this 
analysis it is important to acknowledge the differences between the comparable companies being analysed 
and the company that is being valued and then to reflect these differences in the valuation.

RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
Executive Summary
CSA  Global  Pty  Ltd  (CSA  Global)  was  commissioned  by  BDO  Corporate  Finance  (WA)  Pty  Ltd  (BDO)  to 
prepare  an  independent  Technical  Specialist’s  Report  and  Valuation  of  Renaissance  Minerals  Ltd’s 
(Renaissance’s) Okvau Gold Project in Cambodia.
This independent technical assessment and valuation report (“the Report”) was prepared for BDO. The 
Report provides an opinion to support an Independent Expert’s Report to be prepared by BDO, and has 
been prepared as a public document, in the format of an independent technical specialist’s report and 
has been prepared in accordance with the VALMIN Code.
The Report provides a review of the Cambodian Mineral Assets of Renaissance and provides a technical 
valuation of these Mineral Assets. CSA Global has used a range of valuation methodologies to reach a 
conclusion on the value of the Okvau Gold Project. Note that the valuation is of the Cambodian Mineral 
Assets and not of the value of Renaissance as a company.
The statements and opinions contained in this Report are given in good faith and in the belief that they 
are not false or misleading. The conclusions are based on the reference date of 21 July 2016 and could 
alter over time depending on exploration results, mineral prices and other relevant market factors.
CSA  Global’s  valuations  are  based  on  information  provided  by  Renaissance  and  public  domain 
information.  CSA  Global  has  endeavoured,  by  making  all  reasonable  enquiries  within  the  timeframe 
available, to confirm the authenticity and completeness of the technical data upon which this Report is 
based. No audit of any financial data has been conducted. The valuations discussed in this Report have 
been prepared at a valuation date of 21 July 2016. It is stressed that the values are opinions as to likely 
values, not absolute values, which can only be tested by going to the market.
Okvau Gold Project
Renaissance’s  Okvau  Gold  Project  is  located  in  eastern  Cambodia  approximately  265 kilometres  (km) 
northeast of Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, and approximately 75 km west of the border with Vietnam.
The Okvau Gold Project is a Pre-Development Stage Project, and comprises two granted licences covering 
approximately 394 km2. It includes the Okvau deposit, with a declared gold resource of 1.13 million ounces 
(Moz) of gold. Renaissance has completed a Prefeasibility Study on the Okvau Deposit, and is progressing 
with permitting the project.
Renaissance’s tenure also holds further exploration potential, with identified prospects warranting further 
exploration, both in the near vicinity of the Okvau Deposit, and within the wider tenement holding.
Conclusions
The  Okvau  Gold  Project  has  potential,  and  further  investigation  and  development  of  the  project  is 
warranted.
There are no fatal flaws in the Mineral Resource estimate, however there is a risk that the metal content 
is potentially overstated due to a slightly optimistic density determination, and there is a material risk that 
the selectivity of the resource model is overstated – implying that dilution at time of mining is likely to be 
greater than anticipated.
We were informed that Renaissance is currently completing an infill drilling exercise aimed at increasing 
confidence  in  the  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  to  a  depth  of  120 m  below  surface  and  we  support  this 
program to improve the definition of the resources.
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016
III
RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
The mining approach and mining plan are appropriate and fit for purpose. Cut-off grades, geotechnical 
parameters and metallurgical recoveries all appear reasonable.
The proposed use of an oversized excavator however adds risk, as it is likely to increase dilution during 
mining  operations.  We  understand  that  Renaissance  plans  to  address  the  issue  of  appropriately  sized 
mining equipment in an upcoming mining study, which they are currently conducting.
Renaissance’s  financial  model  is  clear,  appropriate  and  fit  for  purpose  for  their  study,  with  costings 
consistent with what CSA Global would expect for such a project. However, in valuing the Mineral Assets 
of  the  project,  and  due  to  our  assessment  of  technical  and  non-technical  risks,  CSA  Global  applied  a 
sensitivity factor of -10% to the gold grade inputs to Renaissance’s DCF (to account for risks of dilution and 
density), and increased the discount factors in the range 10% to 15% (given the absence of declared Ore 
Reserves, the inclusion of some Inferred Mineral Resources, and uncertainties with regards to permitting 
and environmental approvals risks).
CSA Global also note that the exploration ground in Cambodia held by Renaissance has value additional 
to that attributable to the Okvau Gold Deposit, as it is highly prospective for gold and contains identified 
prospects that warrant further exploration.
CSA Global’s opinion on the Market Value of Renaissance’s Okvau Gold Deposit, as at 21 July 2016, is that 
it lies within a range of US$17.0 million to US$42.5 million, with a preferred value of US$25.0 million.
CSA Global’s opinion on the Market Value of Renaissance’s Cambodian exploration ground, as at 21 July 
2016,  is  that  it  lies  within  a  range  of  US$3.0 million  to  US$10.0 million,  with  a  preferred  value  of 
US$6.5 million.
Recommendations
It  is  suggested  that  an  updated  structural  interpretation  based  on  drill  core  should  be  completed  to 
complement Cowan’s data driven approach and to provide the basis for an updated  Mineral Resource 
estimate with improved geological constraint. Further infill drilling to confirm the geological model and 
grade localisation is also recommended. At this time further samples should be collected for measurement 
of density to improve the density database (particularly in the oxide zone).
CSA Global recommends that a portion of the initial pit be drilled using close-spaced drilling to improve 
localised  mine  planning  and  grade  control.  We  also  recommend  that  the  impact  of  including  Inferred 
Mineral Resources in the pit optimisation be assessed to quantify the financial risk of doing so.
We recommend that Renaissance consider using a smaller excavator than the one currently planned for, 
so as to minimise dilution during mining operations.

Introduction
Context, Scope and Terms of Reference
Renaissance Minerals Ltd (“Renaissance” or “the Company”) is a Perth-based gold exploration and mining 
company that is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Renaissance’s key asset is the Okvau 
Gold Project in Cambodia.
On 19 July 2016, Emerald Resources NL (Emerald) announced a proposed merger with Renaissance via an 
off-market takeover offer under which Emerald will acquire all of the shares in Renaissance that it does 
not already own by offering 1.55 new Emerald shares for every one Renaissance share.
Renaissance  engaged  BDO  Corporate  Finance  (WA) Pty  Ltd  (BDO)  to  prepare an  Independent Expert’s 
Report (“BDO Report”) for inclusion with a Target Statement to non-associated shareholders to assist in 
their decision of whether or not to approve the takeover offer from Emerald.
CSA Global Pty Ltd (CSA Global) was in turn commissioned by BDO to prepare an independent opinion on 
the Market Valuation of the Okvau Gold Project in Cambodia (“CSA Global Report” or “the Report”) in 
accordance with the requirements of the VALMIN Code 2015. BDO will rely on, and the BDO Report will 
refer to, the CSA Global valuation opinion, and a copy of the CSA Global Report will be appended to the 
BDO Report.
The  BDO  Report  will  provide  an  opinion  to  Renaissance  shareholders,  and  as  such  it  will  be  a  public 
document. CSA Global will provide its consent to the use of the Report in the form and context in which 
it will be published.
The Report will be a Technical Assessment and Valuation subject to the VALMIN Code1. The Report will 
contain a high level technical appraisal of the Okvau Gold Project in Cambodia, including geological and 
mining aspects. A valuation of the assets will also be completed. CSA Global will use a range of valuation 
methodologies to reach a conclusion on the value of the assets.
1.2

Okvau Gold Project
Information in this section of the Report is sourced primarily from Renaissance’s Development Study for 
the Okvau Gold Project, dated September 2015. CSA Global believe that Renaissance’s Development Study 
is equivalent to a Preliminary Feasibility Study (Prefeasibility Study), as defined in the JORC Code (2012).
2.1
Location and Access
The Okvau Gold Project is located in eastern Cambodia, within the Mondulkiri Province at approximately 
12°38’00”N  latitude  and  106°47’00”E  longitude.  It  is  located  approximately  265 km  northeast  of 
Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, and approximately 75 km west of the border with Vietnam (Figure 1). 
The town of Kratie is located on the Mekong River approximately 80 km to the west of the Project, and 
the  capital  of  Mondulkiri,  Saenmourom,  is  located  approximately  50 km  south-east  of  the  Project 
(Figure 8).

VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
Access to the Project from Phnom Penh is via sealed roads to Kratie, then a sealed road for approximately 
35 km to the north, then east towards the Project. An existing gravel road of good quality provides access 
to within 28 km of the Project, with the final 28 km serviced by exploration tracks.
2.2
Topography and Climate
The Project  area  is  dominated  by  gently  undulating terrain  at  elevations  ranging  from  80 m  to  200 m 
above sea level, with isolated scattered hills rising to around 400 m. The area is dissected by numerous 
ephemeral drainages that flow into the perennial Prek Te River. The Prek Te flows about 800 m north of 
the Okvau Deposit and flows  southwest across the Okvau Exploration Licence until it meets the much 
larger Mekong River about 100 km to the west.
The  Project  area  experiences  a  tropical  monsoonal  climatic,  with  a  rainy  season  between  June  and 
November and a pronounced dry season between December and May. In the Mondulkiri province, the 
heaviest rainfall occurs from September to October with the driest period from January to April. Average 
annual rainfall across the province is approximately 2,300 mm, though rainfall varies significantly over the 
region, with the Project area experiencing annual rainfall of 1,300 mm to 1,500 mm. Wet season rainfall 
accounts for around 90% of the annual total. Across the Mondulkiri province, temperatures vary from 
daily  peaks  in  excess  of  30°C  between  May  and  July,  to  mild  daily  temperatures  and  cold  nights  in 
December and January. The annual mean temperature is 24°C.
2.3
Mineral Tenure
CSA Global relies on the independent Legal Opinion of ProAsia Legal Solutions Law Office, dated 9 March 
2016, with regards to the validity of Renaissance’s Cambodian licences.
Renaissance  owns  and  manages  100%  of  the  Okvau  Gold  Project,  and  holds  two  exploration  licences 
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Renaissance Minerals (Cambodia) Limited. Details of the licences 
are provided in Table 1, and their location relative to each other is shown in Figure 2.

The Okvau Exploration Licence was last renewed on 12 May 2015 for a two-year period to 16 May 2017. 
Under the Exploration and Exploitation Agreement, following four two-year renewals, the last of which 
expired in May 2015, Renaissance is entitled to further renewals of the Exploration Licence for a total of 
three  years  (with  a  further  one-year  option)  for  the  “Feasibility  Study  Period”  in  order  to  complete 
feasibility  and  environmental  studies  which  will  then  enable  the  application  for  an  “Industrial  Mining 
Licence”. The latest two-year renewal on 12 May 2015 was the first two years of this three-year period 
(i.e. exploration tenure to May 2018 with a further one-year option).
On 3 February 2016, Renaissance announced that it had entered into an agreement whereby Emerald may 
earn up to a 51% interest in its Cambodian Gold Projects by funding a definitive Feasibility Study for the 
development of Okvau Gold Deposit to a bankable level, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment 
and a two-year exploration program of US$3 million.

Geology
Information  in  this  section  of  the  Report  is  sourced  from  CSA  Global  in-house  data  and  intellectual 
property, from Renaissance’s Development Study for the Okvau Gold Project, dated September 2015, and 
from the Technical Assessment Report of the Okvau Gold Project, prepared by KH Morgan and Associates, 
dated 23 March 2016.
3.1
Tectonic Setting
Southeast  Asia  comprises  a  mosaic  of  continental  fragments  of  Gondwana  origin  and  associated 
accretionary mobile belts that accreted with Asia over a prolonged period, most significantly during the 
Triassic Indosinian orogeny. The terranes of Southeast Asia include:
1.  The South China Terrane of southern China and northern Vietnam.
2.  The Indochina Terrane of Yunnan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao, northeast Thailand, and eastern
peninsular Malaysia.
3.  The Sibumasu or Shan-Thai Terrane comprises most of Sumatra, western peninsular Malaysia,
central and western Thailand, eastern Myanmar, and South West Yunnan.
4.  The West Burma Terrane extending into Tibet as the Lhasa terrane and Sumatra as the Sikuleh and
Natal terranes.
Two significant post-Indosinian events affected mainland Southeast and East Asia. The Late Jurassic to 
Late Cretaceous Yanshanian in eastern China and eastern Southeast Asia was a magmatic continental arc 
event related to subduction and extension on the east Asian margin. This arc is represented by the Dalat 
magmatic belt in southern Vietnam, while magmatism of this age also occurs in Cambodia in a back-arc 
setting.  The  Late  Cretaceous  to  Miocene  Himalayan  orogeny  reflected  Indian  collision  with  Asia  and 
resulted in uplift and “extrusion” of Southeast Asia along major northwest trending sinistral faults.
The  northeast  half  of  Cambodia  lies  within  the  Indochina  Terrane  and  the  Stung  Treng  fold  belt,  an 
accretionary  orogenic  belt  on  its  southern  margin  that  may  represent  the  continuation  of  the  Loei-
Phetchabun  belt  in  Thailand.  Southwest  Cambodia  lies  within  the  extension  of  the  Sukothai  belt  of 
Thailand, southwest of the Mae Ping–Chao Phraya fault that runs through Tonle Sap.
Most of the significant gold and copper deposits in Southeast Asia occur in accretionary belts associated 
with arc or back-arc magmatism. The Early Permian Sepon and Phu Bia copper-gold deposits in Laos occur 
in the Truong Son belt. The Early Triassic Chatree gold deposit in Thailand occurs in the Loei belt. The 
Okvau gold deposit is located in the Stung Treng belt but is of younger Jurassic age.
3.2
Regional Geology
The  Stung  Treng  belt  (Figure  3)  is  a  Palaeozoic  to  Triassic  volcano-sedimentary  belt  intruded  by  Late 
Triassic  and  Yanshanian  age  intrusives,  with  extensive  cover  sequences  of  Jurassic  red  beds  and 
Quaternary basalts. The oldest recognised lithologies in the Stung Treng belt are deep-water Devonian 
clastics with volcanics, separated from younger sequences by an unconformity with a general absence of 
Lower Carboniferous sediments.
Upper Carboniferous to Early Permian deep-water carbonates and clastics with volcanics are overlain by 
Upper Permian platform carbonates and clastics with volcanics. Early Triassic marginal-marine sediments 
pass up into continental sediments including coal. Late Triassic sub-alkaline rhyolites, dacites and tuffs are 
co-magmatic  with  Indosinian  granites.  Jurassic  and  Late  Cretaceous  granodiorite  and  granosyenite 
intrusions are associated with the Yanshanian continental arc and back-arc.

Figure 3:
Regional tectonic setting of the Okvau deposit in Southeast Asia
The Okvau deposit is located in eastern Cambodia, largely hosted by a diorite intrusion. This is one of a 
suite  of  Cretaceous  oxidised  to  reduced  granitic  to  dioritic  stocks  that  intrude  the  mainly  clastic 
sedimentary package of Triassic to Jurassic age. Mineralisation occurs where an east-northeast trending 
fault zone cuts the southern part of the stock forming a left-stepping relay in the stock margin.
The deposit is considered to have broad Intrusive-Related Gold (IRG) affinities. Although mineralisation 
postdates crystallisation of the host diorite and is structurally controlled, syn-mineral and post-mineral

dykes are also described. The continental back-arc tectonic setting (relative to the Yanshanian Dalat arc) 
is broadly similar to the IRG “type area”, the Tintina Belt in Alaska that hosts the Fort Knox, Donlin Creek 
and Pogo gold deposits.
3.3
Deposit Geology
Gold mineralisation at Okvau is largely localised within the diorite but extends beyond the diorite contact 
into the hornfelsed metasediments as shown in Figure 4 which has been provided by Renaissance. Gold 
mineralisation  occurs  in  a  network  of  brittle-ductile  shears  and  arsenopyrite-rich  sulphide  veins  that 
postdate pyrrhotite vens. Mineralised zones include centimetre- to metre-scale shear and fault zones with 
associated alteration selvedges, to broader zones with extensive multi-stage stockwork veining. Within 
stockwork  zones,  gold  mineralisation  is  strongly  correlated  to  the  presence  of  narrow  millimetre-  to 
centimetre-scale arsenopyrite-rich veins with narrow alteration selvedges. Individual mineralised zones 
are typically 1 m to 4 m thick separated by unmineralised diorite, occasionally up to 10 m to 30 m thick 
comprising multiple individual zones.
The  style  and  setting  of  mineralisation  at  Okvau  is  compatible  with  the  interpretation  of  a  dextral 
compressional  relay  with  mineralisation  best  developed  in  shallow-dipping,  relatively  dilational  relay 
structures. The strong structural control does not preclude IRG affinity, and the mineralisation event is 
straddled by syn- and post-mineralisation dykes. Veining occurs through hundreds of metres of individual 
drillholes indicating a large mineralising fluid system.
Gold grade continuity is best defined in zones within the diorite which have an orientation in a shallow- 
to moderate-dipping plane to the southeast as shown in Figure 5.

Exploration potential
Renaissance reports that there are numerous high priority exploration prospects based upon anomalous 
geochemistry, geology and geophysics which remain untested by drilling within the Okvau and O’Chhung 
licences (Figure 6).
Renaissance has undertaken extensive soil sampling coverage over the Okvau and O’Chhung project areas 
with follow-up trenching and rock chip sampling (Figure 6). Limited first pass drilling has been undertaken 
at the Prey Sor Lao, Okvau North, Samnang, Superman, Granite Hill and Rhyolite Ridge prospects.

Airborne magnetic data also indicate that remanent magnetic features analogous to the Okvau deposit 
are  present  elsewhere  in  the  licences  (Figure  7).  These  features  are  thought  to  represent  alteration 
associated  with  zones  of  hydrothermal  fluid  flow  associated  with  diorite  stocks.  Many  of  these  are 
proximal to strong gold in soil anomalies with critical pathfinder elements, such as bismuth, arsenic and 
tellurium. These anomalies remain to be drill tested.

Resources
The  following  review  is  based  principally  on  data  available  relating  to  the  2015  estimate  of  Mineral 
Resources conducted by Mr Brian Wolfe, of International Resource  Solutions (IRS). The review, where 
appropriate also includes data from the Okvau structural analyses of King (2008-2013) and Cowan (2014), 
and also the previous Mineral Resource estimate conducted by SRK Australia (SRK).
4.1
Input Data
The current Okvau resource model is based upon diamond drillhole data collected over numerous phases 
of  drilling.  A  comprehensive  review  of  quality  assurance/quality  control  (QAQC)  activities  and  results, 
undertaken  by  SRK  during  their  2013  resource  estimate,  deemed  the  data  available  at  the  time  to  be 
acceptable for use in estimation of resources. No mention of QAQC analysis was provided for the 2015 
resource updated conducted by IRS, other than to note that QAQC data were reviewed and the input data 
were deemed acceptable for use in resource estimation. CSA Global cannot comment on the suitability of 
the dataset used, but have operated under the assumption that no material concerns have been identified 
with the data in previous reviews by other parties.
4.2
Geology and Mineralisation Modelling
Mineralisation at Okvau is constrained predominantly within a Cretaceous diorite intrusion with shallowly 
east-to-southeast dipping metasediments as the country rock. Mineralisation is interpreted to occur as 
stacked  sheeted  veinsets  (thin  discrete  shears),  concordant  with  bedding  parallel  shearing  within  the 
metasediments.
At least two competing interpretations on the structural controls of mineralisation have been postulated, 
both with arguable merit  (King, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013;  Cowan, 2014). To attempt  to account  for this 
uncertainty, the latest resource estimate is constrained using a probabilistic shell, generated via indicator 
kriging of 5 m downhole composites, coded at a 0.4 g/t Au cut-off. The indicator was kriged into 5 x 5 x 
5 m blocks, whose centroids were then used to define an implicitly constrained shell. The probability to 
define the shell volume at 0.325 was chosen on the subjective basis of providing suitable mineralisation 
continuity,  without  (in  the  Competent  Person’s  opinion)  overstatement  of  contained  volume. 
Additionally, IRS note in their resource report that domain volumes were highly sensitive to both chosen 
cutoff and probability. Further, CSA Global notes that the experimental indicator variography does not 
correspond to the model semivariogram used for kriged estimation of the indicator values, and instead a 
preferred orientation of anisotropy was adopted.
There is no mention of the means by which the diorite-metasediment contact was modelled, and CSA 
Global assumes that the implicitly generated volume of diorite created by Jun Cowan (Cowan, 2014) has 
been used.
4.3
Estimation
Panels of dimensions 30 x 20 x 10 m (xyz) were flagged where they or any sub-cell centroid (based on sub-
cells of 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 m) fell inside the mineralisation shell. The panels were kriged, and then a local grade 
tonnage curve was derived for each panel, conditional to this kriged grade, on 5 x 5 x 5 m Selective Mining 
Unit (SMU) support, conditional to the kriged panel estimate. The Uniformly Conditioned (UC) estimate 
was localised after the process of Abzalov (2006) to yield the final estimate of resources on SMU support 
(LUC).  The  post-processing  step  of  localisation  is  designed  to  provide  better  spatial  resolution  for  the 
purposes of mine design than would otherwise be available from a UC estimate, which yields only grade 
tonnage curves over the dimensions of a Panel.
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016
23
RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
Uniform Conditioning makes a strong assumption regarding permanence of distribution, requiring that 
the histogram distribution of grades globally within a deposit (or a function modelling this distribution) 
will also be applicable for smaller subsets within the deposit, regardless of the spatial location of that 
subset. Generally, for this to be a reasonable assumption, the input data contained within the domain 
must be unimodal (have only one spatially/petrogenetically related distribution). In the case of Okvau, 
CSA  Global’s  review  of  the  data  suggests  that  more  than  one  population  exists  –  likely  related  to  the 
internal dilution by combining mineralised veinsets and surrounding waste. In order for UC to be generally 
applicable, an assumption must be made that every panel has a similar proportional mix of waste and 
mineralised veinsets to that of the whole deposit.
IRS  note  in  their  report  that  the  anisotropic  orientations  of  continuously  distributed  grade  data  (Au 
grades) do not coincide with those of the indicator variography used to define the domain shell. This too 
is  indicative  of  mixed  populations,  suggesting  that  the  method  of  domaining  chosen  may  not  be 
appropriate.
The  resultant  block  model  from  estimation,  upon  inspection  reveals  that  sub-cells  have  been  used  to 
increase volume resolution at the margins of the domain shell. This is a somewhat unusual step to have 
taken after localisation of a UC model, given that the discretisation of Panel grade-tonnage curves are 
based upon whole SMU volumes.
In-situ  bulk  densities  for  the  two  oxidation  categories  within  the  model  (transitional  and  fresh)  were 
applied on the basis of the arithmetic average value taken from 0.2 m length core samples. The values of 
2.81 g/cm3 for oxide appears to be slightly high, and the value of 2.84 g/cm3 for fresh material appears to 
be generally appropriate. However, examination of the distribution of density measurements indicates 
that  the  population  of  data  are  heavily  positively  skewed,  meaning  the  arithmetic  average  value  is 
potentially too high. A more appropriate value may be either the geometric or log mean, as the data 
population appears to approach lognormality, or the median value.
4.4
Validation and Classification
Validation of the model by IRS was described as being made through assessment of estimation quality 
parameters including number of input samples, average distance to informing samples and estimation 
pass. Input grades and locations were also visually appraised against resultant grade distributions within 
the model (presumably on a section-by-section basis). No documentation or quantification of validation 
results is provided, however, the report indicates results were deemed acceptable.
The  resource  report  provided  by  IRS  states  that  classification  is  based  partially  upon  review  of  the 
estimation  statistics  of  Panels,  and  predominantly  on  input  data  spacing.  Those  areas  with  drillhole 
coverage  between  40  x  25  and  40  x  40 m were  classified  as  Indicated,  while  all  else  was  classified  as 
Inferred. While this paradigm for classification is common and generally robust, review of the model and 
available input data by CSA Global reveals some areas within the model classified as Indicated that have 
drillhole density substantially less than that required.
No estimation quality statistics were available for review within the models provided to CSA Global, and 
their impact on likely classification, along with that of the drillhole spacing issue identified above are not 
able to be adequately quantified.

5.1
Mining Method
The mining method used for the Okvau mine is a conventional style load and haul, drill and blast open 
cut. The pit design has been split into three stages to ensure that waste is delayed for as long as possible 
whilst allowing the plant feed rate of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (Mt/a) to be maintained. There has 
been no mention of underground potential at the base of the open cut within the PFS.
A mining contractor has been proposed in order to carry out the removal of ore and waste within the 
open cut workings. The operation will operate on a continuous 365 days a year/seven days a week roster 
using two shifts per day. The deposit will be excavated by two x 260 tonne (t) machines (Komatsu PC3000) 
which will load into 11 x 90 t dump trucks (Cat 777G). The drill and blast process will be complemented by 
9 x Atlas Copco ROC D9 drill rigs. The fleet will change during the course of the life of mining due to varying 
volume movements and to maintain a consistent feed to the plant.
The orebody consists of a number of brittle shears and arsenopyrite rich sulphide veins. The mineralised 
shears comprise 10 m to 50 m wide core of strongly altered sheared rock. Gold grade continuity is best 
defined as parallel to low dipping shears with the diorite.
The blasted rock is loaded onto haulage trucks and transported to the surface run of mine (ROM) stockpile.
CSA  Global  considers  that  the  mining  approach  is  appropriate  for  the  deposit.  However,  we  strongly 
believe  that  a smaller excavator should be used  to minimise  dilution.  The current 260 t excavator will 
likely increase dilution, reduce grade and possibly put the Project at risk. It is highly recommended that 
an excavator in the order of 150 t to 200 t be chosen.
CSA Global has been informed that Renaissance is conducting a further mining study that addresses more 
appropriately sized mining equipment, with a smaller and more suitable 120 t excavator currently being 
considered.
5.2
Mine Planning
The current mine plan is based on the plant feed rate of 1.5 Mt/a and the managing of a three-staged pit 
design. Waste has been deferred for as long as possible through careful mine scheduling. To this end, pit 
Stages 2 and 3 are introduced as late as possible into the mix.
The rate of vertical advance has been limited to a maximum of 70 m in one year.
Grade control sampling will occur in conjunction with blast holes. Mining will progress in a traditional top 
down, bench-by-bench advancement.
The mine schedule has been based on 10 m high benches with two 5 m flitches. Total material of 101.2 Mt 
will be removed for 11.6 Mt of ore at a grade of 2.22 g/t and a strip ratio of 7.7 : 1.
The waste dump has been designed close to the pit crest and is outside of water catchment zones and 
rivers. It is outside the US$2,500/oz pit shell. The maximum height allowed for is 60 m with a final batter 
slope to be 18°. Waste material will be used in the construction of haul roads from the pits and in tailings 
construction.
Dilution has not been allowed for within the mine planning process whilst ore losses have been estimated 
at 2% or a mine recovery of 98%.
The three-pit stage designs can be seen in Figure 9.

Figure 9:
Okvau Pit Stage sections
CSA Global would like to see grade control receive sampling independent of the blast holes. This will allow 
a cleaner sample and more time to prepare for the planning of grade control before the bench is mined. 
CSA Global note that a potential major oversight has occurred through no application of mine dilution 
within the mine planning process. We do not believe that dilution has been adequately catered for within 
the Resource Block Model and that it needs to be allowed for within Whittle to determine the sensitivity. 
Mine dilution in the range of 5% to 15% is something we consider as fair for the Okvau deposit based on 
the modelling.
CSA Global would prefer to see the implementation of a 5 m mining bench (using 2 x 2.5 m flitches) in 
order to further minimise dilution as the ore zones dip at 30° to 45°.
5.3
Cut-off Grade and Parameters
The marginal cut-off grade (MCOG) is the grade where material above will be processed (at some stage in 
the mine life) and where material below will be sent to the waste dump or stockpiling area for potential 
processing down the track.
The MCOG has been calculated at 0.60 g/t using the gold price, processing costs, processing recoveries 
and selling costs.
The selling price for gold has been estimated as US$1,250/oz.
The selling costs include a Government royalty of 2.50% of gross revenue and US$5.00/oz for refining and 
transport costs. This computes to approximately US$36.24/oz.
Processing costs have been taken as US$19.95/t for both oxide and fresh whilst the processing recovery is 
a flat 85% for all ore bearing material.
No other parameters are used in the calculation of the MCOG.
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016
27
RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
We are in agreement with the MCOG calculation. Through the usage of pit staging at Okvau, it has enabled 
lower strip ratio material to be mined up front which improves cash flow.
CSA Global notes that Inferred Mineral Resources has been used in the calculation of the pit shells which 
the pit designs have been based on. There is currently around 9.4% of Inferred material (based on tonnes) 
within  the  pit  design.  On  Whittle  analysis,  removing  the  Inferred  out  from  the  pit  optimisation  takes 
approximately 1.8 Mt of ore from the pit shell, giving around 9.9 Mt of ore remaining. The Project still 
remains economically viable with the Inferred material being removed.
For  Ore  Reserves  to  be  declared  in  accordance  with  JORC  2012,  there  should  be  no  Inferred  Mineral 
Resources included during the pit optimisation process.
CSA Global is informed that Renaissance is currently conducting an infill drilling program to improve the 
confidence in the Inferred Mineral Resources to a level of 120 m below surface.
5.4
Mine Schedule
The mine schedule for Okvau is based primarily around achieving the plant capacity of 1.5 Mt/a. Mining 
commences four months before the process plant is commissioned. The maximum ore stockpile capacity 
will be 175,000 t.
Pit Stages 2 and 3 will be introduced as late as possible to delay waste movement. Every effort was made 
in the schedule to maintain smooth mining volumes.
The schedule sees the following mining rates:
  Month 1 – 17: 500,000 t/month
  Month 18 – 42: 1,000,000 t/month
  Month 43 – 68: 2,000,000 t/month
  Month 69 – 96: rate of mining slowly decreases.
The schedule has a total movement of 101.2 Mt with ore removal being 11.6 Mt @ 2.22 g/t Au for a strip 
ratio of 7.7: 1. The oxide ore consists of 1.0 Mt @ 1.92 g/t Au whilst the fresh ore has 10.6 Mt @ 2.25 g/t 
Au.
The pit stages consisted of the following breakdown:

The  mining  physicals  have  been  established  through  appropriate  methods  and  reflect  a  suitable 
expectation of performance. It is noted that there will need to be several changes of fleet, especially with 
haul trucks to handle the changes in mining volumes. Further detailed scheduling will most likely improve 
this to a smoother profile that suits the operation of the mine and reduces such fleet variations.
CSA Global notes that the ore grade is very consistent across the three pit stages. It is not yet known if 
there is a “sweet spot” within the deposit that could be accessed in an expedient manner to increase cash 
flow. Again, detailed mine scheduling will identify areas for improvement.

Geotechnical Engineering
The Okvau PFS includes a comprehensive geotechnical study completed by MineGeotech.
MineGeotech has used a strategy for Okvau where steeper batter angles, wider berms and greater vertical 
distance between berms is an approach often used in countries where there is a small skilled workforce.
The geotechnical parameters are summarised in Table 3 below.

The  geotechnical  parameters  were  all  selected  in  conjunction  with  the  equipment  selection,  local 
conditions, drill core data and lack of oxide near surface.
The geotechnical aspects of the Okvau operation are considered to be well catered for and more than 
adequate for a PFS.
We consider that the ramp widths for dual lane and single lane given within the pit designs are excessive. 
The operating width of a Cat 777G is generally considered to be 6.5 m (from the Cat handbook). A single 
lane ramp should be 13 m (16.77 m given in PFS) whilst a dual lane ramp should be around 22.7 m (26.8 m 
given in PFS). These ramp widths allow for an appropriate windrow, spoon drain and adequate passing 
room.
Consideration should also be given to reducing the haul road ramp gradient from 1:10 down to 1:9. This 
will allow the ore to be accessed quicker and to further reduce the strip ratio.
5.6
Plant Processing
The  Okvau  deposit  consists  predominantly  of  fresh  sulphide  ore.  Extensive  metallurgical  testwork  has 
been undertaken under the guidance of Metpro Consultants Pty Ltd. They conducted work in two phases. 
Phase 1 (during 2014) investigated how to maximise gold extraction rates whilst Phase 2 (during 2015) 
looked at optimising grind sizes and reagent consumption.
A gold recovery estimate of 85% was derived after a significant amount of testwork which was based on 
a head grade of 2.25 g/t gold, 0.37% arsenic, 1.05% sulphur and 1.8 g/t antimony. Indications are that the 
gold recovery is highly sensitive to the antimony assay in the plant feed.
Comminution  test  work  shows  a  Ball  Mill  Work  Index  at  a  value  of  17.5 kWh/t.  This  is  considered  a 
moderate level. Given the results of the comminution test results, it was decided to proceed on the basis 
of a conventional three-stage crush and ball mill circuit. The flowsheet is comprised of coarse grinding and 
flotation, fine grinding of a low mass concentrate and conventional cyanide leaching of concentrate and 
flotation tails.
The processing study for Okvau has been carried out to a suitable level and is more than adequate for a 
PFS. Oxide ore tonnes are nearly 10% of plant feed tonnes, so we would recommend a separate oxide
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016
29
RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
plant recovery to be investigated, which more than likely would be higher than the 85% used for fresh 
material. This would in turn lead to more positive results from the pit optimisation results. Some concern 
is levelled at the Phase 2 variability composites where the recoveries averaged only 77.2%. CSA Global 
understand the oxidised material referred to in the financial model is more “transitional” in nature and 
more closely aligned with harder material than highly weathered material.
5.7
Operating Costs
Mine  operating  costs  have  been  estimated  from  a  first-principles  financial  model  spreadsheet.  The 
majority of the costs are related to mining activities carried out by the contractor and processing costs 
related to the treatment of ore through the plant. Cost rates are applied to the detailed physical mining 
schedule according to the bench by bench contractor rates. The contractor rates are “generic quotes” and 
have not been tendered on. They are considered within the typical range of mining rates for a PFS.
Mining operating costs have been generated in a thorough and transparent manner, reflecting the mining 
region where Okvau is situated. The average mining cost over the life of the operation is approximately 
US$2.58 per mined tonne. This is considered a suitable average for an overall mining cost. The mining cost 
is inclusive of the following categories:

Load and Haul
  Drill and Blast
  Grade Control

Fleet Maintenance
  Mining Administration

Rehabilitation.
Total  processing operating  costs  (including  processing,  maintenance,  ore  rehandle,  plant  consumables 
and general and administration) amounts to US$19.50 per processed tonne in the Discounted Cash Flow 
(DCF) model. This is considered a fair and reasonable unit rate for a 1.5 Mt/a gold processing plant.
Both  the  mining  costs  and  processing  costs  are  considered  reasonable  and  within  a  suitable  order  of 
magnitude for similar mining operations.
5.8
Capital Costs
The capital cost estimate generated in the financial model is built from a first-principles approach using 
contractual  rates  and  other  reasonable  estimates  from  various  consultancy  groups.  The  expenditure 
includes development, infrastructure and sustaining capital costs. Resource definition drilling has been 
capitalised.
Pre-production capital costs have been estimated at US$116.8 million whilst sustaining capital costs have 
been given as US$10.0 million for total capital costs of US$126.8 million. A 10% capital contingency amount 
of US$10.4 million has been allowed for.
The  desired  employment  of  a  mining  contractor  has  removed  the  requirement  for  upfront  capital  for 
mining equipment. The majority of capital expenditure is driven by processing plant construction needs. 
The cost estimates applied to this expenditure are reasonable. Other main capital items are access roads, 
power supply and tailings storage facility.
There have been no tendered capital costs provided. The level of confidence for a PFS is generally +/- 30% 
and as such these costs are considered reasonable.
The capital costs are considered reasonable and within a suitable order of magnitude for similar mining 
operations.

Risks
Resource Model Risk
While no fatal flaws were identified within the 2015 resource estimate, a number of issues present risk 
that the model as reviewed is not optimally representative of the in-situ mineralisation. Recognition has 
been made  that  the  distribution  of mineralisation  is  highly  complex  and  that  input  drillhole  density  is 
relatively  low  for  such  a  mineralisation  style.  In  response,  rather  than  individually  model  the  spatial 
location of mineralised structures, an attempt has been made to capture a much more general deposit 
morphology incorporating a high proportion of waste, and then use non-linear estimation techniques to 
re-introduce spatial resolution, and selectivity at an SMU scale.
The definition of domain volume, on which all other processes are subsequently based, is largely arbitrary 
and it is difficult to quantify its representivity in terms of volume. The style of mineralisation recorded in 
the  numerous  structural  studies  provided  is  thin,  discrete,  and  generally  discontinuous  stacked 
veinsets/shears with a  general easterly  dip, and an apparent  south-easterly plunge. While the current 
model  attempts  to  capture  this  general  orientation,  it  also  attempts  to  establish  better  continuity,  by 
incorporating a non-quantifiable amount of internal dilution. Further, it appears that the variography used 
to define the mineralised volume has been artificially modified to describe a preferred orientation. It is 
CSA  Global’s  opinion  that  risk  exists  that  the  mineralised  proportion  of  the  enclosed  volume  is 
overstated, and that the distribution of grade from the resulting LUC estimate describes a smoother, 
more even distribution between SMUs than appropriate.
Estimation of panel grades appears to use suitable parameters, however the disagreement in anisotropy 
between indicator kriging for domain definition and grade estimation suggests the initial indicator derived 
volume does not adequately domain out a single mineralised population. The resultant mixed population 
of input data then forces the assumption that a constant ratio of waste to mineralisation exists at all scales 
throughout the model within the LUC estimate. This presents further risk that the implied distribution 
of grades within the resultant LUC model are not suitably representative.
Further, the SMU dimensions of 5 x 5 x 5 m are small in comparison to the estimated Panel from which 
their values are derived, and the model has been sub-celled at the margins of the defined; both of which 
present risk that the model indicates a greater level of selectivity than is realistic, given the potentially 
erroneous assumption of ore/waste ratios within each panel.
Densities used in the model are possibly slightly too high. Using the arithmetic average from a positively 
skewed population will high-bias the result, potentially resulting in the overstatement of metal content 
within the model.
6.2
Mining and Processing Risk
The Mine Plan is reasonable. The parameters and modifying factors used in the estimation of the mineral 
inventory are appropriate for use in the cash flow model. It should be noted that up to 10% of the ore 
production in the cash flow model is derived from Inferred Mineral Resources. The impact of removing 
these ore tonnes within the mine schedule will still ensure the Project is economically viable.
The choice of a large 260 t excavator will impact on grade control and mine dilution. A risk of the Project 
moving forward is mining the ore zones with such a large excavator.
The proposed grade control practice of sampling from vertical blast holes is considered to be a risk.
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016
31
RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
It should also be noted that no Ore Reserves have been declared by Renaissance. The reasons for this 
are  the  inclusion  of  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  within  pit  optimisation  work  and  the  absence  of  any 
mining approval or permitting at this point in time.
The gold price chosen for this project is  US$1,250/oz. World Bank projections were recently published 
(26 July 2016) that show the gold price hovering around US$1,200/oz until 2020 when it will fall to US$1130 
and continue falling to US$1,000/oz in 2025. The gold price is considered a risk on the Project because 
of these projections.
CSA Global believe that mine dilution should be allowed for within the mine plan. No time has been 
allowed in this review for a more informed analysis, but a range of 5% to 15% mine dilution would be 
considered suitable.
The  mining  physicals  have  been  established  through  appropriate  methods  and  reflect  a  reasonable 
reflection of expected performance. It should be noted that the Inferred material is included within the 
pit  stage  physicals  and  has  not  been  separated  out.  Assessing  the  impact  of  not  including  Inferred 
material and adding mining dilution within the financial model is considered to be essential at this point 
in time. Section 7.2 covers this in greater detail.
Ore processed, gold recovery, and other processing assumptions are considered reasonable.
Specific  comments  are  made  regarding  each  processing  parameter  contained  in  the  cash  flow  model 
below.

Tonnage  processed  –  Crushing  and  mill  power  is  adequate  and  a  processing  rate  of  1.5 Mt/a  is 
considered  reasonable.  A  current  eight-year  Life  of  Mine  plus  further  exploration  upside  could 
mean an expansion of this plant size.
  Gold  grade  –  The  grade  over  the  three  pit  stages  is  very  similar.  This  could  be  the  result  of  the 
incorporation of high proportions of internal waste within the modelling process, but more work 
is required here.
  Gold  recovery  –  It  is  considered  reasonable  that  the  plant  recovery  is  set  at  85%.  The  oxide  ore 
recovery needs further investigation as a higher recovery will have a positive impact on cash flow.
  Gold production – With the proposed plant circuit, it is considered reasonable that production of
around 90,000 oz per year is achievable.
6.3
Permitting and Tenure Risk
Cambodia is not a familiar jurisdiction for the international mining community, and Cambodian Mining 
Law is considered comparatively immature, with little or no in-country precedents. The Okvau Project will 
potentially  be  the  first  large,  international  mining  project  to  go  through  the  permitting  and  approval 
process for mining. There is therefore some risk attached to this process, as it is currently untried.
CSA Global understands that artisanal miners are present on site, with a minority of them actively mining. 
For the Project to be developed, the artisanal miners will need to be relocated. There is a risk that an 
agreement on relocation is not reached, or that the terms of the agreement may be overly onerous.
There are several environmental risks associated with the Project, namely potentially acid forming (PAF) 
rocks and the usage of cyanide within the gold extraction process. There will need to be sufficient cash 
funds set aside to mitigate the potential of any risks associated with these environmental risks.
CSA Global understands that the Project lies within the Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary. This may increase 
the  risk  of  environmental  permitting  not  being  granted,  or  may  result  in  extensive  environmental 
management programs. The sanctuary is considered an International Union for Conservation of Nature

one at a time.
The following key categories within the financial model were assessed:
  Metal price for gold
  Operating costs

Capital costs
  Gold grade
  Ore tonnes


The spider diagram depicting the summary for Table 4 is shown below in Figure 10. The results clearly 
show that Okvau is most sensitive to gold grade, gold price and plant recovery respectively.
CSA Global believe that the gold grade represents the greatest risk to Okvau due to our concerns with 
some aspects of work completed or assumptions relating to the following items:

Resource model;
  Grade control practices; and
  Mining equipment selection.

Valuation Methodology and Results
CSA Global conducted several checks and analysis of Renaissance’s DCF model and found it to be is clear, 
appropriate  and  fit  for  purpose  for  their  study,  with  costings  consistent  with  what  CSA  Global  would 
expect for such a project.
The gold price used in the DCF analysis is US$1,250/oz. There has been no necessity for the consideration 
of exchange rates. CSA Global notes that the average gold price for June 2016 was US$1,276.40/oz, with 
World  Bank  long-term  predictions  hovering  around  US$1,200/oz  until  2020  before  dropping  to 
US$1,000/oz  by  2025.  CSA  Global  therefore  believe  that  US$1,250/oz  is  currently  acceptable  for  this 
project, given the current higher gold price. The gold price used in the DCF analysis should be reconsidered 
once the timeframe for development is better understood.
Renaissance’s financial model was run using a 5% discount rate to determine the internal rate of return 
(IRR). All DCF values are given as an after tax value for project cash flow.
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016

RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
CSA  Global  considered  that  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  10%  should  be  used  as  the 
minimum case discount rate for the DCF for valuation purposes. With the Okvau Project being located in 
Cambodia and in a region that doesn’t have a strong mining culture, as well as the inclusion of Inferred 
material, a range of discount rates from 10% to 15% will be applied in the valuation process.
The DCF modelling approach has been selected as the most appropriate method for valuing the Okvau 
mining assets. CSA Global believe this approach is best understood, relatively easy to apply according to 
a  range  of  discount  rates,  and  factors  in  all  revenue,  operating  costs,  selling  costs,  capital  costs, 
depreciation and tax.
CSA Global notes that Renaissance has completed a PFS on the Okvau Gold Project, and has chosen to 
report “in-pit Mineral Resources” rather than to declare Ore Reserves at this time. CSA Global understands 
that this is primarily due to the following reasons:



The need to complete mining approvals and permitting in a jurisdiction where the process has not as 
yet been proven, with this project being potentially the first to go through the process.
The need to apply for an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, especially for the Phnom Prich 
Wildlife Sanctuary where the proposed Project area is located outside of the “core zone” but within 
the “conservation zone”.
The inclusion of approximately 9.4% by tonnage of Inferred Mineral Resources within the pit shell 
optimisation process and the resultant financial model.
CSA Global understands that Renaissance is currently conducting a major infill drilling program with the 
aim of upgrading the Inferred Mineral Resources for at least the upper 120 m. CSA Global also understands 
that  Renaissance  is  currently  progressing  Environmental  and  Social  Impact  Assessments,  which  are  a 
necessary part of the permitting process.
CSA Global therefore believes that there is a reasonable basis for considering DCF modelling in deriving 
an opinion on the value of the Mineral Asset, provided that the model and the analysis take into account 
the additional risks associated with using in-pit Mineral Resources as a basis.
In assessing the value of the Okvau gold deposit using the DCF modelling methodology, CSA Global needed 
to assess the impact of the following risks identified in Chapter 6 of this report:
Technical Risks:


The  estimation  method  selected  is  acceptable  for  a  global  estimate  of  the  tonnage  and  grade. 
However,  short-term  mine  planning  and  scheduling  may  be  compromised  by  the  uncertainty 
associated with the local estimate, increasing the risk of not being able to recover scheduled grade 
and tonnage in the short-term.
Risk that the tonnage, and hence contained metal, is overstated due to the use of an average density 
that may be slightly high.

Likely dilution introduced in the mining process through the use of an oversize excavator.
CSA Global has addressed these risks in the financial model used to support the valuation by applying a 
sensitivity of -10% to the gold grade input to the DCF. CSA Global considered the alternative of modelling 
dilution  through  the  addition  of  10%  of  waste  tonnes  using  a  lower-grade  ore  “skin”.  However,  this 
approach was  found  to  have  no  effect  in  accounting  for  the  uncertainty  in  the  local estimate  and the 
possible over estimation of density, and was rejected as a viable approach.
Non-technical Risks:
  Ore Reserves have not been declared for the deposit.

The model includes approximately 9.4% by tonnage of Inferred Mineral Resources, and this was used 
in the pit optimisation process as well.
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016



The risks associated with successful permitting in a jurisdiction without adequate precedents.
Environmental risks to project approval.
CSA Global has addressed these risks in the DCF model by using a discount rate range of 10% to 15%.
The following results were obtained as detailed in Table 7.

8  Market and Transactions
Valuation of Mineral Assets is not an exact science; and a number of approaches are possible, each with 
varying positives and negatives. While valuation is a subjective exercise, there are a number of generally 
accepted  procedures  for establishing  the value  of  Mineral  Assets.  CSA  Global  consider  that,  wherever 
possible, inputs from a range of methods should be assessed to inform the conclusions about the Market 
Value of Mineral Assets.
The valuation is always presented as a range, with the  preferred value  identified.  The preferred value 
need not be the median value and is determined by the Practitioner based on their experience.
Refer to Appendix 1 for a discussion of Valuation Approaches and Valuation Methodologies, including a 
description of the Valmin classification of Mineral Assets.
8.1
Gold Market
The gold price history in US$/oz for the past five years is illustrated in Figure 11. The spot price peaked 
above US$1,800/oz in August 2011, and bottomed out below US$1,100/oz in December 2015. The average 
gold price for June 2016 was US$1,276.40/oz, and the spot price on 25 July 2016 was US$1,318.03/oz. This 
variation in the  gold price over  time highlights  the need to normalise  implied transaction prices when 
considering transactions over this time period, and the need for robust long-term planning processes to 
adopt a conservative outlook on the gold price.

Transactions
In analysing the transactions, all amounts were converted to US$ at the relevant exchange rate at the time 
of the transaction announcement. Share considerations were treated at a 10% discount to cash, and share 
prices  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  were  considered,  unless  the  shares  were  issued  at  a  particular 
deemed price. Contingent payments were discounted, and the timing of payments was also considered.
The  transactions  considered  were  announced  post-January  2010,  and  sufficient  information  on  the 
transaction and material projects were available in the public domain for the analysis of the transactions.
8.2.1
Resources
CSA Global considered 15 transactions involving gold resource projects in Cambodia (2), Indonesia (4), the 
Philippines (4), PNG (2), Malaysia (1), China (1) and Burkina Faso (1). These transactions are summarised 
and analysed in Appendix 2.
The transactions related to the Martabe and Gosowong mines were excluded as the mines were operating 
at the time of the transactions, and the Romang Island transaction was excluded as it was essentially a 
polymetallic project, with significant non-gold credits.
Likewise, the two stalled projects, Pani and Maoling, were excluded as not being reasonable comparatives, 
as Okvau is not stalled.

When considering the 10 remaining transactions (Figure 12), the implied transaction prices range from 
US$3.28/oz  to  US$28.78/oz,  with  a  median  of  US$15.34/oz,  a  mean  of  US$14.58/oz  and  a  weighted 
average of  US$16.11/oz. When normalised to the average  June  2016 gold price of  US$1,276.40/oz, this

changes to a range of US$3.83/oz to US$37.02/oz, with a median of US$14.90/oz, a mean of US$17.22/oz 
and a weighted average of US$18.40/oz.
CSA Global also considered the case where the recent Burkina Faso transaction (Banfora) and the Runruno 
transaction,  both  of  which  included  declared  Ore  Reserves  at  the  time  of  the  transaction,  were  also 
excluded. This resulted in the implied transaction prices ranging from US$3.28/oz to US$25.42/oz, with a 
median of US$12.07/oz, a mean of US$12.67/oz and a weighted average of US$13.37/oz. When normalised 
to  the  average  June  2016  gold  price  of  US$1,276.40/oz,  this  changes  to  a  range  of  US$3.83/oz  to 
US$34.69/oz,  with  a  median  of  US$11.61/oz,  a  mean  of  US$14.95/oz  and  a  weighted  average  of 
US$15.66/oz.
From this analysis of comparative transactions, CSA Global concludes that reasonable valuation factors 
for the declared resources contained in the Okvau Gold Project would be a low factor of US$10/oz, a 
high factor of US$20/oz and a preferred factor of US$15.00/oz.
CSA Global notes that the transaction with an analysed value closest to the chosen preferred valuation 
factor of US$15.00/oz is the recent (June 2016) transaction involving Banfora (US$15.67/oz).
8.2.2
Exploration Areas
CSA  Global  considered  15  transactions  involving  gold  tenements  in  Cambodia  (9),  Indonesia  (4),  the 
Philippines (1) and South Korea (1). These transactions are summarised and analysed in Appendix 3.
Four transactions relating to ground holdings of less than 50 km2 were excluded, as these projects were 
more focused, and generally in a more advanced stage of exploration. The transactions were generally 
predicated on an intention to mine the property in the near term, or Mineral Resources were declared 
within months of acquiring the properties.

When  considering the  11  remaining transactions  (Figure  13),  the  implied  transaction  prices  range  from 
US$591/km2  to  US$114,638/km2,  with  a  median  of  US$15,783/km2,  a  mean  of  US$23,654/km2  and  a 
weighted  average  of  US$13,117/km2.  When  normalised  to  the  average  June  2016  gold  price  of 
US$1,276.40/oz,  this  changes  to  a  range  of  US$596/km2  to  US$114,881/km2,  with  a  median  of 
US$15,173/km2, a mean of US$24,951/km2 and a weighted average of US$14,723/km2.
CSA Global also considered the case where only Cambodian projects larger than 50km2 were included. 
This  resulted  in  seven  transactions  being  considered,  with  the  implied  transaction  prices  range  from 
US$4,247/km2  to  US$30,769/km2,  with  a  median  of  US$16,845/km2,  a  mean  of  US$18,170/km2  and  a 
weighted  average  of  US$12,940/km2.  When  normalised  to  the  average  June  2016  gold  price  of 
US$1,276.40/oz,  this  changes  to  a  range  of  US$5,698/km2  to  US$40,302/km2,  with  a  median  of 
US$22,991/km2, a mean of US$20,158/km2 and a weighted average of US$14,723/km2.
From this analysis of comparative transactions, CSA Global concludes that reasonable valuation factors 
for the exploration ground in the Okvau Gold Project would be a low factor of US$6,000/km2, a high 
factor of US$25,000/km2 and a preferred factor of US$15,000/km2.
CSA Global notes that the transaction with an analysed value closest to the chosen preferred valuation 
factor  of  US$15,000/km2  is  the  February  2015  transaction  involving  Angkor’s  Cambodian  projects 
(US$15,173/km2).

The Valuation Basis employed by CSA Global is Market Value, as defined by the VALMIN Code (2015). The 
Valuation Date is 21 July 2016. The currency is US dollars (US$) unless otherwise stated.
9.1
Previous Valuations and Transactions
CSA Global is not aware, nor have we been made aware, of any previous valuations completed on the 
Okvau tenement portfolio.
In February 2016, Emerald agreed to earn-in to Renaissance's Okvau Gold project, with sole funding the 
completion of a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)3, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), 
and a US$3 million two-year exploration program to earn up to a 51% interest. Renaissance had previously 
estimated that the cost of the DFS and ESIA alone would be in the vicinity of US$4 million to US$5 million.
In February 2013, Renaissance announced the acquisition of Oz Minerals’ Cambodian subsidiary, which 
held  a  100%  interest  in  the  Okvau  gold  deposit  and  O’Chhung  exploration  licence,  an  additional 
exploration licence application, and interests in joint ventures covering three exploration licences where 
Oz Minerals had the right to earn an 85% interest. Therefore, the transaction included the Okvau deposit 
and approximately 1,100 km2 of exploration ground. Commercial terms included an upfront cash payment 
of up to A$7.8 million, issuing 26.4 million shares and 3 million options in Renaissance to Oz Minerals, a 
deferred cash payment of A$5 million 12 months after completion of acquisition, a deferred cash payment 
of  A$10 million  upon the  earlier of  the  announcement  of  JORC  resource of more  than  1.25 Moz  and  a 
decision to mine, and a deferred cash payment of A$12.5 million six months after first gold production.
9.2
Valuation Basis
In forming an opinion on the Market Value of the Okvau deposit, CSA Global considered the results of 
three valuation methods for the declared Mineral Resource, i.e. DCF modelling, Comparative Transactions 
and the Yardstick method (Table 8).
In  forming  an  opinion  on  the  Market  Value  of  the  Renaissance  exploration  ground,  CSA  Global  has 
considered the results of two valuation methods based on area, i.e. Comparative Transactions and the

RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
CSA Global notes that Renaissance has completed a PFS on the Okvau Gold Project, and has chosen to 
report “in-pit Mineral Resources” rather than to declare Ore Reserves at this time. CSA Global understands 
that this is primarily due to the following reasons:



The need to complete mining approvals and permitting in a jurisdiction where the process has not as 
yet been proven, with this project being potentially the first to go through the process.
The need to apply for an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, especially for the Phnom Prich 
Wildlife Sanctuary where the proposed Project area is located outside of the “core zone” but within 
the “conservation zone”.
The inclusion of approximately 9.4% by tonnage of Inferred Mineral Resources within the pit shell 
optimisation process and the resultant financial model.
CSA Global understands that Renaissance is currently conducting a major infill drilling program with the 
aim of upgrading the Inferred Mineral Resources for at least the upper 120 m. CSA Global also understands 
that  Renaissance  is  currently  progressing  Environmental  and  Social  Impact  Assessments,  which  are  a 
necessary part of the permitting process.
CSA Global therefore believes that there is a reasonable basis for considering DCF modelling in deriving 
an opinion on the value of the Mineral Asset, provided that the model and the analysis take into account 
the additional risks associated with using in-pit Mineral Resources as a basis for the financial modelling.
9.3
Resources
9.3.1
Comparative Transactions
CSA Global considered the value of the Okvau deposit Mineral Resources in terms of the valuation factors 
derived from CSA Global’s analysis of comparative market transactions (Table 9). CSA Global used a low 
valuation  factor  of  US$10/oz,  a  high  valuation  factor  of  US$20/oz  and  a  preferred  valuation  factor  of 
US$15/oz. These factors were applied to the declared resource base of 1.131 Moz Au.
This  resulted  in  a  valuation  range  of  US$11.3 million  to  US$22.6 million,  with  a  preferred  value  of 
US$17.0 million.

9.3.2
Yardstick
CSA  Global  used the  Yardstick method  as  a  reasonableness  check on  the  Resource  valuation  that  was 
completed using comparable transactions.
For the Yardstick valuation, CSA Global used the following commodity spot price, which is the average 
gold price for June 2016: US$1,276.40/oz.
In addition, CSA Global utilised the following commonly used yardstick valuation factors:


Inferred Mineral Resources:
0.5% to 1% of spot price
Indicated Mineral Resources:
1% to 2% of spot price
  Measured Mineral Resources:
2% to 5% of spot price
  Ore Reserves:
5% to 10% of spot price.
CSA-Report Nº: 236.2016
43
RENAISSANCE MINERALS LTD  
VALUATION OF RENAISSANCE MINERALS’ OKVAU GOLD PROJECT, CAMBODIA
The average gold price for June 2016 was used as a basic spot price for the Yardstick valuation so that the 
results could be compared to the comparative Transactions, which were normalised to this gold price.
A summary of the comparative valuation, which are based on Yardstick Factors, are presented in Table 10.
This method resulted in a valuation range of US$13.4 million to US$26.7 million, with a preferred value of 
US$20.0 million.

Bearing in mind that this approach is simplistic (e.g. it is very generalised and does not address project 
specific  value  drivers  but  takes  an  “industry-wide”  view),  CSA  Global  considers  that  these  results  are 
broadly indicative of those derived using the market approach.
9.4
Exploration Areas
9.4.1
Comparative Transactions
CSA Global considered the value of Renaissance’s Cambodian exploration ground in terms of the valuation 
factors derived from CSA Global’s analysis of comparative market transactions (Table 11). CSA Global used 
a  low  valuation  factor  of  US$6,000/km2,  a  high  valuation  factor  of  US$25,000/km2  and  a  preferred 
valuation factor of US$15,000/km2. These factors were applied to the respective licence areas.
This  resulted  in  a  valuation  range  of  US$2.4 million  to  US$9.9 million,  with  a  preferred  value  of 
US$5.9 million.

CSA Global notes that the area underlain by the declared Mineral Resource is on the order of 500 m x 
250 m. Subtracting this area from the exploration area would not result in a material difference in value 
using this method.
9.4.2
Geoscientific Factor
The  Geoscientific  Factor Method of valuation requires the consideration of those  aspects of a mineral 
property which enhance or downgrade the intrinsic value of the property. The first and key aspect of the 
Geoscientific Factor method described  by Kilburn (1990) is the  derivation of the  Base Acquisition Cost 
(BAC) that is the basis for the valuation. Goulevitch and Eupene (1994) discuss the derivation of BAC. The 
BAC represents the average cost to identify, apply for and retain a base unit of area of tenement.

A BAC for Cambodian exploration licences has been estimated using the following data and assumptions:





Based on the original agreement between Oxiana and the Cambodian government, it is assumed that 
the average age of Exploration Licences in Cambodia is three years, and the average size of these 
licences is approximately 200 km2 
A deemed cost to identify an area of interest of US$50,000 was assumed, as well as US$5,000 for 
the cost of landowner notices, negotiations, legal costs and compensation
Application and initial administrative costs of US$10,000 were assumed 
The holding cost includes a rent of US$40/km2 per annum, as per the licence agreement
The licence agreement also references an Education Levy of US$5,000 per annum
  Ongoing administrative costs of US$15,000 per annum were assumed

Annual exploration expenses of US$50,000 per licence were assumed.
Altogether,  this  gives  an  assumed  BAC  for  the  average  Cambodian  Exploration  Licence  of  US$1,495 
per km2, as shown in Table 12.

The  Geoscientific  Factor  (Kilburn)  Method  of  valuation  was  developed  with  regards  to  the  Canadian 
mineral tenure system, where tenure consists of numerous claim blocks that average approx. 20 hectares 
(0.2 km2)  each.  Each  claim  block  is  assessed  individually,  and  the  value  for  each  block  is  summed  to 
provide the value for the tenure holding.
As the Okvau and O’Chhung licences are on the order of 200 km2 each in area, CSA Global subdivided the 
licences into subareas of similar geology and exploration knowledge (Figure 14), so that high values from 
the areas in which work was focused on, is not spread out over the entire area, and thus artificially raising 
the value of the entire licence. Likewise, this means that low values are also not inappropriately spread 
over a large area.

Figure 14:
Subdivision of Okvau (Areas 1 to 3) and O’Chhung (Areas 4 to 6) licences
CSA Global considered the various factors indicated in Table 18 in assessing the Technical Value of each of 
the identified sub-areas. The ratings for each project are indicated in Appendix 4.
A Market Factor of 60% was applied in deriving a Fair Market Value from the Technical Value obtained 
from the rating matrix. This factor was chosen such that the average value  for the tenement package 
considered (approx. US$17,700/km2) is consistent with the range of valuation factors obtained from the 
analysis  of  comparative  transactions.  CSA  Global  notes  that  the  value  assessed  for  the  approximately 
20 km2 sub-area containing the Okvau deposit was assessed at roughly US$67,000/km2, and the central 
portion of the O’Chhung licence was assessed at approximately US$3,000/km2. CSA Global is of the view 
that this adequately accounts for market factors on an empirical basis.
This  resulted  in  a  valuation  range  of  US$3.8 million  to  US$10.1 million,  with  a  preferred  value  of 
US$7.0 million (Table 13).

Okvau Deposit Valuation ranges derived from various methods
CSA  Global  believes  that  the  deposit  has  been  studied  and  documented  in  sufficient  detail  to  justify 
considering DCF modelling when deriving an opinion on the value of the Project, provided that the model 
and the analysis takes into account the additional risks, both technical and non-technical, inherent in the 
analysis of this project. These risks are detailed in Chapter  6  of this report, and the way in which CSA 
Global has dealt with these additional risks are detailed in Section 7.2 of this report.
CSA Global believe that the valuation range derived from the analysis of comparative transactions, and 
supported by the valuation range derived using the Yardstick valuation, provides insight to the potential 
value of the gold resource itself, without specific consideration of a mining plan or other advanced studies. 
The valuation based on DCF modelling, on the other hand, considers the additional value to be gained 
from the technical studies and the mine planning.
CSA Global notes that in this case, when the input gold grade is reduced by 10% due to technical risks 
(dilution and density) and the discount rate is increased to 10% to 15% based on non-technical risks (to 
the timing of development), the valuation range derived from the DCF modelling overlaps the valuation 
range derived from the comparable transactions.
In choosing a Preferred Value, CSA Global considered that the PFS completed by Renaissance has added 
value  to the Mineral Resources,  and  has  therefore  chosen  a  Preferred  Value  at  the  higher  end of  the 
Market Transactions. This is also closer to the lower end of the range from the DCF modelling, which CSA 
Global considers to be appropriate given the lack of declared Ore Reserves.

Exploration Area
In choosing a Preferred Value and Valuation Range for the 394 km2 of exploration ground that Renaissance 
holds in Cambodia (Table 15), CSA Global considered the valuation ranges and preferred values derived 
from the Comparative Transactions method and the Geoscientific Rating method.

CSA  Global  generally  place  more  weight  on  the  Comparative  Transaction  method  as  it  is  informed  by 
market events. In this case, CSA Global believes that the two methods provide a reasonably consistent 
valuation range, with the Geoscientific Factor  method providing some insight to exploration potential, 
and the relative values of the various areas.

10  Conclusions and Recommendations
10.1
Conclusions
The  Okvau  Gold  Project  has  potential  and  further  investigation  and  development  of  the  deposit  is 
warranted.
There is no fatal flaw in the Mineral Resource estimate, however, there is a risk that the metal content is 
potentially overstated due to a slightly optimistic density determination, and there is a material risk that 
the selectivity of the resource model is overstated – implying that dilution at time of mining is likely to be 
greater than anticipated.
We were informed that Renaissance is currently completing an infill drilling exercise aimed at increasing 
confidence  in  the  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  to  a  depth  of  120 m  below  surface  and  we  support  this 
program to improve the definition of the resources.
The mining approach and mining plan are appropriate and fit for purpose. Cut-off grades, geotechnical 
parameters and metallurgical recoveries all appear reasonable.
The  use  of  an  oversize  excavator  however  adds  risk,  as  it  is  likely  to  increase  dilution  during  mining 
operations.  We  understand  that  Renaissance  plans  to  address  the  issue  of  appropriately  sized  mining 
equipment in an upcoming mining study, which they are currently conducting.
The financial model is clear, appropriate and fit for purpose, with costings consistent with what CSA Global 
would  expect.  In  valuing  the  deposit,  CSA  Global  discounted  the  grade  by  10%  to  account  for  the 
anticipated increased dilution, and used discount factors in the range 10% to 15%, which we believe are 
more appropriate.
CSA Global also note that the exploration ground in Cambodia held by Renaissance has value additional 
to that attributable to the Okvau Gold Deposit, as it is highly prospective for gold and contains identified 
prospects that warrant further exploration.
CSA Global’s opinion on the Market Value of Renaissance’s Okvau Gold Deposit, as at 21 July 2016, is that 
it lies within a range of US$17.0 million to US$42.5 million, with a preferred value of US$25.0 million.
CSA Global’s opinion on the Market Value of Renaissance’s Cambodian exploration ground, as at 21 July 
2016,  is  that  it  lies  within  a  range  of  US$3.0 million  to  US$10.0 million,  with  a  preferred  value  of 
US$6.5 million.
10.2
Recommendations
It  is  suggested  that  an  updated  structural  interpretation  based  on  drill  core  should  be  completed  to 
complement Cowan’s data driven approach and to provide the basis for an updated  Mineral Resource 
estimate with improved geological constraint. Further infill drilling to confirm the geological model and 
grade localisation is also recommended. At this time further samples should be collected for measurement 
of density to improve the density database (particularly in the oxide zone).
CSA Global recommends that a portion of the initial pit be drilled using close-spaced drilling to improve 
localised  mine  planning  and  grade  control.  We  also  recommend  that  the  impact  of  including  Inferred 
Mineral Resources in the pit optimisation be assessed to quantify the financial risk of doing so.
We recommend that Renaissance consider using a smaller excavator than the one currently planned for, 
so as to minimise dilution during mining operations.

Mineral Asset means all property including (but not limited to) tangible property, intellectual property, mining and
exploration Tenure and other rights held or acquired in connection with the exploration, 
development of and production from those Tenures. This may include the plant, 
equipment and infrastructure owned or acquired for the development, extraction and 
processing of Minerals in connection with that Tenure.
Most Mineral Assets can be classified as either:
(a) Early-stage Exploration Projects – Tenure holdings where mineralisation may or may 
not have been identified, but where Mineral Resources have not been identified;
(b) Advanced Exploration Projects – Tenure holdings where considerable exploration has 
been undertaken and specific targets identified that warrant further detailed evaluation, 
usually by drill testing, trenching or some other form of detailed geological sampling. A 
Mineral Resource estimate may or may not have been made, but sufficient work will have 
been undertaken on at least one prospect to provide both a good understanding of the 
type of mineralisation present and encouragement that further work will elevate one or 
more of the prospects to the Mineral Resources category;
(c) Pre-Development Projects – Tenure holdings where Mineral Resources have been 
identified and their extent estimated (possibly incompletely), but where a decision to 
proceed with development has not been made. Properties at the early assessment stage, 
properties for which a decision has been made not to proceed with development, 
properties on care and maintenance and properties held on retention titles are included in 
this category if Mineral Resources have been identified, even if no further work is being 
undertaken;
(d) Development Projects – Tenure holdings for which a decision has been made to 
proceed with construction or production or both, but which are not yet commissioned or 
operating at design levels. Economic viability of Development Projects will be proven by at 
least a Prefeasibility Study;
(e) Production Projects – Tenure holdings – particularly mines, wellfields and processing 
plants – that have been commissioned and are in production.
Practitioner is an Expert as defined in the Corporations Act, who prepares a Public Report on a Technical 
Assessment or Valuation Report for Mineral Assets. This collective term includes 
Specialists and Securities Experts. Also see Clause 2 for guidance on Practitioners.
Production Target means a projection or forecast of the amount of Minerals to be extracted from particular
Tenure for a period that extends past the current year and the forthcoming year.
Public Report means a report prepared for the purpose of informing investors or potential investors and their 
advisers when making investment decisions, or to satisfy regulatory requirements. It 
includes, but is not limited to, Annual Reports, Quarterly Reports, press releases, 
Information Memoranda, Technical Assessment Reports, Valuation Reports, Independent 
Expert Reports, website postings and Public Presentations. Also see Clause 5 for guidance 
on Public Reports.
Reasonableness implies that an assessment which is impartial, rational, realistic and logical in its treatment of the 
inputs to a Valuation or Technical Assessment has been used, to the extent that another 
Practitioner with the same information would make a similar Technical Assessment or 
Valuation. Also see Clause 4.1 for guidance on Reasonableness and Reasonableness Test.
Reasonable Grounds Requirement has the meaning referred to in sections of the Corporations Act and sections of
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 that require statements 
about future matters to be based on reasonable grounds (as of the date of making the 
statement) or else they will be taken to be misleading.
Reasonableness Test is defined in clause 4.1(b).
Recognised Professional Organisation means any professional organisation listed on the VALMIN website as a
Recognised Professional Organisation (refer to www.valmin.org/competent.asp)

Representative Specialists are persons who are the nominated representative(s) of a legally constituted body, and 
who supervise the preparation of a Public Report and accept responsibility for it on behalf 
of that body. Representative Specialists are Specialists.
Securities has the meaning as defined in the Corporations Act.
Securities Expert are persons whose profession, reputation or experience provides them with the authority to
assess or value Securities in compliance with the requirements of the Corporations Act, 
ASIC Regulatory Guides and ASX Listing Rules.
Specialist are persons whose profession, reputation or relevant industry experience in a technical discipline (such 
as geology, mine engineering or metallurgy) provides them with the authority to assess or 
value Mineral Assets.
Specialist Report is defined in Clause 5.5.
Technical Assessment is an evaluation prepared by a Specialist of the technical aspects of a Mineral Asset.
Depending on the development status of the Mineral Asset, a Technical Assessment may 
include the review of geology, mining methods, metallurgical processes and recoveries, 
provision of infrastructure and environmental aspects.
Technical Assessment Report involves the Technical Assessment of elements that may affect the economic benefit
of a Mineral Asset.
Technical Value is an assessment of a Mineral Asset’s future net economic benefit at the Valuation Date under a
set of assumptions deemed most appropriate by a Practitioner, excluding any premium or 
discount to account for market considerations.
Tenure is any form of title, right, licence, permit or lease granted by the responsible government in accordance 
with its mining legislation that confers on the holder certain rights to explore for and/or 
extract agreed minerals that may be (or is known to be) contained. Tenure can include 
third-party ownership of the Minerals (for example, a royalty stream). Tenure and Title 
have the same connotation as Tenement.
Transparency or being Transparent requires that the reader of a Public Report is provided with sufficient
information, the presentation of which is clear and unambiguous, to understand the 
report and not be misled by this information or by omission of Material information that is 
known to the Practitioner.
Valuation is the process of determining the monetary Value of a Mineral Asset at a set Valuation Date.
Valuation Approach means a grouping of valuation methods for which there is a common underlying rationale or
basis.
Valuation Date means the reference date on which the monetary amount of a Valuation in real (dollars of the day)
terms is current. This date could be different from the dates of finalisation of the Public 
Report or the cut-off date of available data. The Valuation Date and date of finalisation of 
the Public Report must not be more than 12 months apart.
Valuation Methods means a subset of Valuation Approaches and may represent variations on a common rationale
or basis.
Valuation Report expresses an opinion as to monetary Value of a Mineral Asset but specifically excludes
commentary on the value of any related Securities.
Value means the Market Value of a Mineral Asset. See definition of Market Value.

Appendix 1:  Valuation Approaches
Background
Mineral Assets are defined in the VALMIN Code as all property including (but not limited to) tangible 
property, intellectual property, mining and exploration  Tenure and other rights  held or acquired in 
connection with the exploration, development of and production from those Tenures. This may include 
the  plant,  equipment  and  infrastructure  owned  or  acquired  for  the  development,  extraction  and 
processing of Minerals in connection with that Tenure.
Business valuers typically define market value as “The price that would be negotiated in an open and 
unrestricted market between a knowledgeable, willing, but not anxious buyer, and a knowledgeable, 
willing but not anxious seller acting at arm’s length.” The accounting criterion for a market valuation is 
that it is an assessment of “fair value”, which is defined in the accounting standards as “the amount 
for  which  an  asset  could  be  exchanged  between  knowledgeable,  willing  parties  in  an  arm’s  length 
transaction.” The VALMIN Code defines the value of a Mineral Asset as its Market Value, which is “the 
estimated amount (or the cash equivalent of some other consideration) for which the Mineral Asset 
should exchange on the date of Valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length 
transaction after appropriate marketing where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently 
and without compulsion”.
Market Value usually consists of two components, the underlying or Technical Value, and a premium 
or discount relating to market, strategic or other considerations. The VALMIN Code recommends that 
a preferred or most-likely value be selected as the most likely figure within a range after taking into 
account those factors which might impact on Value.
The concept of Market Value hinges upon the notion of an asset changing hands in an arm’s length 
transaction. Market Value must therefore take into account, inter alia, market considerations, which 
can  only  be  determined  by  reference  to  “comparable  transactions”.  Generally,  truly  comparable 
transactions for Mineral Assets are difficult to identify due to the infrequency of transactions involving 
producing assets and/or Mineral Resources, the great diversity of mineral exploration properties, the 
stage  to  which  their  evaluation  has  progressed,  perceptions  of  prospectivity,  tenement  types,  the 
commodity involved and so on.
For exploration tenements, the notion of value is very often based on considerations unrelated to the 
amount of cash which might change hands in the event of an outright sale, and in fact, for the majority 
of tenements being valued, there is unlikely to be any “cash equivalent of some other consideration”. 
Whilst acknowledging these limitations, CSA Global has identified what it considers to be comparable 
transactions that have been used in assessing the values to be attributed to the Mineral Assets.
Valuation Methods for Exploration Projects
The  choice  of valuation methodology  applied to  Mineral  Assets,  including  exploration  licences,  will 
depend on the amount of data available and the reliability of that data.
The VALMIN Code classifies Mineral Assets into categories that represent a spectrum from areas in 
which mineralisation may or may not have been found through to Operating Mines which have well-
defined Ore Reserves, as listed below:

“Early-stage Exploration Projects” – tenure holdings where mineralisation may or may not have 
been identified, but where Mineral Resources have not been identified.




“Advanced  Exploration  Projects”  –  tenure  holdings  where  considerable  exploration  has  been 
undertaken and specific targets identified that warrant further detailed evaluation, usually by drill 
testing,  trenching  or  some  other  form  of  detailed  geological  sampling.  A  Mineral  Resource 
estimate may or may not have been made but sufficient work will have been undertaken on at 
least one prospect to provide both a good understanding of the type of mineralisation present 
and encouragement that further work will elevate one or more of the prospects to the Mineral 
Resources category.
“Pre-Development  Projects”  –  tenure  holdings  where  Mineral Resources  have been  identified 
and  their  extent  estimated  (possibly  incompletely)  but  where  a  decision  to  proceed  with 
development has not been made.
“Development Projects” – tenure holdings for which a decision has been made to proceed with 
construction or production or both, but which are not yet commissioned or operating at design 
levels. Economic viability of Development Projects will be proven by at least a Prefeasibility Study.
“Production Projects” – tenure holdings – particularly mines, wellfields and processing plants - 
that have been commissioned and are in production.
Each of these different categories will require different valuation methodologies, but regardless of the 
technique employed, consideration must be given to the perceived “market valuation”.
The Market Value of Exploration Properties and Undeveloped Mineral Resources can be determined 
by four general approaches: Cost; Market; Geoscience Factor or Income.
Cost
Appraised  Value  or  Exploration  Expenditure  Method  considers  the  costs  and  results  of  historical 
exploration.
The Appraised Value Method utilises a Multiple of Exploration Expenditure (MEE), which involves the 
allocation  of  a  premium  or  discount  to  past  expenditure  through  the  use  of  the  Prospectivity 
Enhancement Multiplier (PEM). This involves a factor which is directly related to the success (or failure) 
of the exploration completed to date, during the life of the current tenements.
Guidelines  for the  selection of a PEM factor have  been proposed by several authors in the field of 
mineral asset valuation (Onley, 1994). Table 16 lists the PEM factors and criteria used in this Report.
Prospectivity Enhancement Multiplier (PEM) Factors
Criteria
Exploration (past and present) has downgraded the tenement prospectivity, no mineralisation identified 
Exploration potential has been maintained (rather than enhanced) by past and present activity from 
regional mapping 
Exploration has maintained, or slightly enhanced (but not downgraded) the prospectivity 
Exploration has considerably increased the prospectivity (geological mapping, geochemical or geophysical 
activities) 
Scout drilling (RAB, aircore, RCP) has identified interesting intersections of mineralisation  
Detailed drilling has defined targets with potential economic interest 
A Mineral Resource has been estimated at Inferred JORC category, no concept or scoping study has been 
completed 
Indicated Mineral Resources have been estimated that are likely to form the basis of a Prefeasibility Study 
Indicated and Measured Resources have been estimated and economic parameters are available for 
assessment

Market Approach Method or Comparable Transactions looks at prior transactions for the property and 
recent arm’s length transactions for comparable properties.
The Comparable Transaction method provides a useful guide where a mineral asset that is comparable 
in location and commodity has in the recent past been the subject of an “arm’s length” transaction, 
for either cash or shares.
In an exploration joint venture or farm-in, an equity interest in a tenement or group of tenements is 
usually earned in exchange  for spending on exploration, rather than a simple cash payment to the 
tenement holder. The joint venture or farm-in terms, of themselves, do not represent the Value of the 
tenements concerned. To determine a Value, the expenditure commitments should be discounted for 
time and the probability that the commitment will be met. Whilst some practitioners invoke complex 
assessments of the likelihood that commitments will be met, these are difficult to justify at the outset 
of  a  joint  venture,  and  it  seems  more  reasonable  to  assume  a  50:50  chance  that  a  joint  venture 
agreement will run its term. Therefore, in analysing joint venture terms, a 50% discount may be applied 
to future committed exploration, which is then “grossed up” according to the interest to be earned to 
derive an estimate of the Value of the tenements at the time that the agreement was entered into.
Where a progressively increasing interest is to be earned in stages, it is likely that a commitment to 
the second or subsequent stages of expenditure will be so heavily contingent upon the results achieved 
during  the  earlier  phases  of  exploration  that  assigning  a  probability  to  the  subsequent  stages 
proceeding  will  in  most  cases  be  meaningless.  A  commitment  to  a  minimum  level  of  expenditure 
before an incoming party can withdraw must reflect that party’s perception of minimum value and 
should not be discounted. Similarly, any up-front cash payments should not be discounted.
The terms of a sale or joint venture agreement should reflect the agreed value of the tenements at the 
time, irrespective of transactions or historical exploration expenditure prior to that date. Hence the 
current Value of a tenement or tenements will be the Value implied from the terms of the most recent 
transaction involving it/them, plus any change in Value as a result of subsequent exploration. Where 
the tenements comprise applications over previously open ground, little to no exploration work has 
been completed and they are not subject to any dealings, it is thought reasonable to assume that they 
have minimal, if any Value, except perhaps, the cost to apply for, and therefore secure a prior right to 
the ground, unless of course there is competition for the ground and it was keenly sought after. Such 
tenements are unlikely to have any Value until some exploration has been completed, or a deal has 
been struck to sell or joint venture them, implying that a market for them exists.
High quality Mineral Assets are likely to trade at a premium over the general market. On the other 
hand, exploration tenements that have no defined attributes apart from interesting geology or a “good 
address” may well trade at a discount to the general market. Market Values for exploration tenements 
may also be impacted by the size of the land holding, with a large, consolidated holding in an area with 
good exploration potential attracting a premium due to its appeal to large companies.
Geoscience Factors
Geoscience Factor Method seeks to rank and weight geological aspects, including proximity to mines, 
deposits and the significance of the camp and the commodity sought.
The Geoscience Factor (or Kilburn) method, as described by Kilburn (1990), provides an approach for 
the  technical  valuation  of  the  exploration  potential  of  mineral  properties,  on  which  there  are  no 
defined resources.
Valuation is based upon a calculation in which the geological prospectivity, commodity markets, and 
mineral property markets are assessed independently. The Geoscientific Factors method is essentially 
a technique to define a Value based upon geological prospectivity. The method appraises a variety of 
mineral property characteristics:


Location with respect to any off-property mineral occurrence of value, or favourable geological, 
geochemical or geophysical anomalies:
Location and nature of any mineralisation, geochemical, geological or geophysical anomaly within 
the property and the tenor of any mineralisation known to exist on the property being valued:
  Number and relative position of anomalies on the property being valued;
  Geological models appropriate to the property being valued.
The Geoscientific Factor method systematically assesses and grades these four key technical attributes 
of a tenement to arrive at a series of multiplier factors (Table 18).
The Basic Acquisition Cost (BAC) is an important input to the Geoscientific Factors Method and it is 
calculated  by  summing  the  application  fees,  annual  rent,  work  required  to  facilitate  granting  (e.g. 
native title, environmental etc.) and statutory expenditure for a period of 12 months. Each factor is 
then multiplied serially by the BAC to establish the overall technical value of each mineral property. A 
fifth factor, the market factor, is then multiplied by the  technical value to arrive  at the fair market 
value.
Yardstick
The  Rule-of-Thumb  (Yardstick)  Method  is  relevant  to  exploration  properties  where  some  data  on 
tonnage and grade exist may be valued by methods that employ the concept of an arbitrarily ascribed 
current in situ net  value  to any Ore  Reserves (or Mineral Resources) outlined within the tenement 
(Lawrence 2001, 2012).
Rules-of-Thumb (Yardstick) Methods are commonly used where a Mineral Resource remains is in the 
Inferred category and available technical/economic information is limited. This approach ascribes a 
heavily discounted in situ value to the Resources, based upon a subjective estimate of the future profit 
or net value (say per tonne of ore) to derive a rule-of-thumb.
This yardstick multiplier factor applied to the Resources delineated (depending upon category) varies 
depending on the commodity. Typically, a range from 0.4% to 3% is used for base metals and PGM, 
whereas for gold and diamonds a range of 2% to 4.5% is used. The method estimates the in situ gross 
metal content value of the mineralisation delineated (using the spot metal price and appropriate metal 
equivalents for polymetallic mineralisation as at the valuation date).
The chosen percentage is based upon the valuer’s risk assessment of the assigned JORC Code’s Mineral 
Resource  category,  the  commodity’s  likely  extraction  and  treatment  costs,  availability/proximity  of 
transport  and  other  infrastructure  (particularly  a  suitable  processing  facility),  physiography  and 
maturity of the mineral field, as well as the depth of the potential mining operation.
Income
The Income Approach is relevant to exploration properties on which undeveloped Mineral Resources 
have  been  identified  by  drilling.  Value  can  be  derived  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  confidence  by 
forecasting the cash flows that would accrue from mining the deposit, discounting to the present day 
and determining a NPV.
The Income Approach is not appropriate for properties without Mineral Resources.
Valuation Approaches by asset stage
Regardless of the technical application of various valuation methods and guidelines, the valuer should 
strive to adequately reflect the carefully considered risks and potentials of the various projects in the 
valuation  ranges  and  the  preferred  values,  with  the  overriding  objective  of  determining  the  "fair 
market value”.
The table below shows the valuation approaches that are generally considered appropriate to apply 
to each type of mineral property.
