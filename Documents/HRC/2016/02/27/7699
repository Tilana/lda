<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Jordan was held at the 7th meeting on 
24 October 2013. The delegation of Jordan was headed by H.E. Dr. Mohammad Hussein Al 
Momani, Minister of State for Media Affairs and Communications. At its 14th meeting, 
held on 31 October 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Jordan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Jordan: Libya, Montenegro and Thailand. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In his introduction the head of the Jordanian delegation emphasized that the 
universal periodic review formed a chance for Jordan to assess its human rights situation 
based on self-criticism and reiterated Jordan&#8217;s commitment to collaborating with all 
partners to ensure the success of the mechanism and the success of the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that over the past four years, there has been unprecedented 
progress in terms of reform and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
despite the serious security implications and disorder witnessed in the region. These 
regional developments did not slow down the reform, but the Arab Spring, as His Majesty 
King Abdullah has repeatedly affirmed, is an opportunity to accelerate the reform process 
as a domestically-driven process and a model for the region. Jordanian reform is gradual 
and rooted in peaceful transformation, pluralism, societal consensus, tolerance and respect 
for the opinions of others. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation stated that the pillars of the reform are rooted in the Constitution 
which guarantees the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. 
Accordingly, two years ago about one third of the articles of the Constitution were amended 
in compliance with international standards. The amended Constitution prohibits any 
violations of rights and freedoms, upholds dignity and provides physical and moral </p>


<p>protection for all citizens. It also gives all Jordanians the right to work and to establish trade 
unions and political parties and ensures that the right to education is free and compulsory.  
</p>
<p>8. The delegation stated that constitutional amendments also protect mothers and 
motherhood and people with disabilities. The amendments guarantee, inter alia, freedom of 
opinion, of the press and of expression, as well as literacy, artistic and cultural freedoms 
and privacy in personal communications, and that no civilian can be tried before non-
civilian judges. Jordan has enacted legislation, including laws on political parties, elections, 
public gatherings and press and publications. The new Independent Election Commission 
enhances transparency and the Constitutional Court oversees the constitutionality of laws. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that two major achievements in 2013 have marked the path to 
democracy and comprehensive reform: parliamentary elections in January took place in the 
framework of impartiality and transparency in accordance with the best international 
practices and with the observation of local and international monitors. Voter registration 
exceeded 70 per cent, despite calls for a boycott, and a 57 per cent voter turnout which was 
among the highest in the history of the country. All components of Jordanian society are 
now represented in the current parliament. Following the elections, the King voluntarily 
waived his constitutional right to appoint the Prime Minister and for the first time asked the 
parliament to make the nomination. The second important event was the holding of 
transparent municipal elections last August. In these elections the representation of women 
increased to 36 per cent from 25 per cent previously. Moreover, the King has recently 
issued four discussion papers in order to contribute to a national dialogue on the best 
democratic model to which Jordan aspires. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation highlighted the King&#8217;s order to the Government to amend the law of 
the State Security Court and limit its powers to the crimes of treason, espionage, terrorism, 
drug-related crimes and counterfeiting of currency. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that in order to further strengthen the rights of women and 
their participation in public life and the promotion of equality and put an end to certain 
social practices, Jordan has introduced amendments to several laws. Additional new laws 
have been enacted, such as the Law on Protection from Domestic Violence, laws on the 
prohibition of trafficking in human beings while the Personal Status Law of 2010 enhanced 
the rights of women and children. The delegation emphasized that the Penal Code had been 
amended in order to put an end to practices that stand in the way of effective 
implementation of human rights, such as so-called crimes of honour. To enhance the status 
of women and to ensure the elimination of all forms of violence, the legislative 
amendments increased sanctions for crimes of physical violence and such crimes as rape, 
indecent assault, abduction, and sexual harassment. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation stated that in order to promote women&#8217;s participation in decision-
making and raise the level of representation of women, the legislative amendments of 2012 
increased the quota of seats in parliament allocated to women to 15 and the elections in 
2013 witnessed an increase in the number of women in parliament to 18, 3 of whom won 
their seats outside the quota. The proportion of women in Parliament increased from 10.8 to 
12 per cent. Consequently the proportion of women in senior positions also increased and 
three women currently occupy ministerial posts. There are 142 female judges comprising 
15 per cent of the total in the country. The amended Municipalities Law of 2011 raised the 
quota allocated to women to 25 per cent of the members of municipal councils. In order to 
empower women economically and achieve equality in the workplace the Government 
reviewed and amended a range of economic legislation related to women, including the 
Social Security Law and also implemented laws obliging larger employers to provide 
childcare. </p>


<p>13. The delegation affirmed that in combating torture the constitutional amendments of 
2011 included the explicit prohibition of torture. Article 208 of the Penal Code criminalizes 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Guidelines and manuals for investigating 
torture crimes and for pretrial detention have been prepared to help judges and prosecutors 
to register and prosecute cases of ill-treatment and to reduce pretrial detention. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that public security personnel do not enjoy any kind of 
immunity from prosecution. Suspects are tried before the Police Court, which is 
independent and tries public security personnel. The amended Public Security Act provides 
for the inclusion of civilian judges in the police court in order to increase the appropriate 
guarantees for a fair trial. Grievance mechanisms are available for anyone who wishes to 
complain. Protection of the rights of the child will be increased through the draft child 
rights act and a national framework to combat child labour has been prepared to protect 
children from economic exploitation. Social care services have been improved through 
adopting quality assurance mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation stated that in order to continue efforts to improve the living 
conditions of persons with disabilities, Jordan had taken many steps aimed at achieving this 
goal, including supporting their right to live independently, integration in the community 
and self-reliance. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation indicated that Jordan continued its cooperation and constructive 
dialogue with the treaty bodies and special procedures, including submitting its reports. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to the promotion of freedom of opinion and expression, in addition to 
the constitutional guarantees, the delegation noted that Jordan had enacted legislation that 
provided an enabling environment for freedom of expression and the free exchange of 
information as one of the pillars of its democratic transformation. It launched the national 
media strategy for the years 2011&#8211;2015, which aims to create an environment that supports 
independent media and establish the appropriate legal framework to ensure a balance 
between freedom and responsibility. The committee in charge of monitoring the 
implementation of the media strategy completed work on a number of pieces of legislation, 
such as the Press and Publications Law, Law on the Protection of State Secrets and 
Documents, Audiovisual law and Law on Access to Information. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation stated that in 2012 parliament amended the Press and Publications 
Law to regulate the work of news websites and in order to increase transparency and 
accountability. There was a desire on the part of owners of news websites and the 
Government to organize the profession and to protect the sector from intruders who have 
practiced embezzlement, defamation and blackmailing to a degree that threatened social 
peace. The law includes several positive measures, such as the prevention of imprisonment 
of journalists, and has reduced the length of litigation procedures. The law does not impose 
fees for registration of news websites. The Government cannot block licensed websites 
without a court order. The provisions of the law do not affect the level of press freedom and 
have not reduced the level of criticism of Government policies. The law requires editors to 
be members of the journalists&#8217; union and also guarantees the rights of workers to social 
security and health insurance. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation emphasized the Government&#8217;s openness to dialogue with everyone 
about all laws and regulations. No registration request has been refused to any electronic 
news media. Thirty two radio stations, 44 local television stations and140 news websites 
are licensed while 118 specialized websites are outside the scope of the Press and 
Publications Law. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation emphasized that, in order to combat the abuse of foreign workers, the 
Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour makes field visits ensuring the safety of the work </p>


<p>environment and ensuring the protection of the rights of workers. An anti-trafficking unit 
has been established for prevention, protection and prosecution. 
</p>
<p>21. Thanks to its achievements in realization of the Millennium Development Goals, the 
delegation noted that Jordan has been selected to be among the 65 countries which will 
prepare the development agenda beyond 2015. Her Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah has 
been chosen by the Secretary-General to be one of the 26 global figures tasked with 
identifying the new targets. Jordan has developed a comprehensive policy for health-care 
services through increased numbers of hospitals, clinics and health centres. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation emphasized that the Constitution underlines judicial independence. 
The Independent Judicial Council considers the appointment of judges and all related 
matters. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation stated that the Constitution guarantees the right of peaceful assembly 
which has been seen in thousands of peaceful marches. The security forces have shown the 
highest professionalism in protecting participants, with the exception of some isolated 
incidents which have been dealt with in the framework of the law and in compliance with 
international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation acknowledged the challenges facing the reform process, which 
Jordan strives to overcome, particularly the effects of the economic situation and high 
energy costs. The influx of refugees to Jordan in general, and from Syria in particular, 
presents significant challenges for the limited resources of the country. In this context, 
Jordan has called on the international community to shoulder its legal and moral 
responsibilities in supporting the country in fulfilling its obligations as a host country and to 
find a solution to ensure the return home of the refugees in a manner that preserves their 
safety and human rights. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation emphasized that ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict would have 
the greatest impact on the maintenance of peace and security in the region and thus the 
promotion and protection of human rights.

inheritance for women are fixed in sharia law. However, for the first time in Jordan, the 
personal status law clearly defines the rights of women to inheritance with a fixed 
percentage and shares that cannot be reduced. There are also cases where men inherit less 
than women. In 85 per cent of cases, the custody of children is granted to women.  
</p>
<p>71. Regarding public participation in law&#8211;making, the delegation emphasized that the 
Personal Status Law (2010) was drafted after consultations and dialogue with civil society 
and a high degree of consensus had been reached. The same law allows women the right to 
divorce and end a marriage.  
</p>
<p>72. The delegation stated that female domestic workers are protected by the Labour Law 
of 1996, which limits their working hours to eight per day, regulates the manner of payment 
of their salaries and prohibits the withholding of passports by employers. The Ministry 
decided to designate a liaison officer to handle all issues of migrant workers with their 
relevant embassies. 
</p>
<p>73. Brazil noted the withdrawal of reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the approval of a bill on protection from

of rape to escape prosecution by marrying their victims and about &#8220;honour crimes&#8221;. It made 
recommendations. </p>

community through various means. It made recommendations.

<p>108. The Jordanian delegation referred to the enormous efforts made by the country in 
hosting and supporting Syrian refugees. There are currently over 1.3 million Syrians in a 
country with a population of almost 7 million, creating tremendous pressure and challenges 
for Jordan to meet the  needs of the refugees, particularly because of its scarce water and 
energy supplies. The health, infrastructure and education systems are not capable of 
absorbing this large influx. Many schools have to use double shifts in order to include the 
refugee children. Jordan has only received approximately 30 to 40 per cent of the financial 
aid it needs in order to sustain the Syrian refugees. It supports the Syrian refugees on behalf 
of the international community, but this burden is not equally shared. The employment 
sector, accommodation costs and inflation have also been negatively affected by the the 
presence of the refugees.

independently.

the laws and provisions of the penal code do not discriminate against women; on the 
contrary the sanctions are harder in some cases when the victim is a woman. The law on 
protection from domestic violence was adopted in order to ensure the full implementation 
of due process.  
</p>
<p>111. The delegation stated that the recent constitutional amendments clearly show the 
commitment of Jordan to combating torture. A national monitoring team is in charge of 
detecting torture; it includes the National Human Rights Commission and NGOs. There are 
also standard training systems for prosecutors, investigators and law enforcement officers 
on how to investigate and report torture. The civil code provides general rules regarding 
compensation which victims of torture can use. Under the recent constitutional 
amendments, the jurisdiction of the State Security Court has been limited to cases of crimes 
of treason, espionage and terrorism, drug-related crimes and the counterfeiting of currency; 
in addition, following the recent constitutional amendments, civilians only appear before 
civilian judges.  
</p><p>112. The delegation stated that the draft law on the rights of child is in the legislative 
process, however some members of civil society have asked for the draft to be withdrawn 
and requested a more rights-based and inclusive dialogue to discuss the law before its 
adoption and the Government has agreed to this request. The process of amending the draft 
law for protection against domestic violence has started with the aim of including 
provisions that strengthen protection of women, children and the family as a whole. The 
Government has also finalized the draft law on juveniles which is in compliance with 
international standards and ensures the protection and security of juveniles in detention 
centres and elsewhere. The Government has recently submitted plans to reform social </p>


<p>provisions for the protection of vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities. For 
social care institutions, the national team for monitoring and inspection is fully composed 
of civil society organizations for the best interests of the beneficiaries.  
</p>
<p>113. The delegation stated that civil society organizations voiced comments regarding 
registration and financing under the Law on Associations and amendments have been made. 
The new provisions will be adopted, providing greater flexibility in access to finances.  
</p>
<p>114. The delegation repeated earlier statistics on the success of empowering women in 
politics and also referred to its efforts to strengthen the economic rights of women. 
A recently adopted law on the pension rights of women will give them their own pension 
and that of a deceased husband. As for protection of women from sexual harassment in the 
work place, the Penal Code criminalizes sexual harassment. The Labour Law has additional 
sanctions for employers who commit sexual harassment. An employer&#8217;s workplace will be 
closed down if a woman is subjected to sexual harassment by him.  
</p><p>115. In conclusion, the delegation stated that Jordan took serious note of all the remarks 
and interventions. Everything raised in this review is appreciated by Jordan. 
</p>
<p>116. In relation to the international human rights treaties, the delegation promised that 
Jordan will take all necessary measures to sign the International Convention for the 
Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p>117. The delegation reiterated the positive and open attitude of Jordan to the universal 
periodic review and restated its commitment to development and the implementation of 
human rights. It stated that the interactive dialogue had been beneficial and will be 
seriously taken into consideration for the sake of the promotion and protection of human 
rights.
