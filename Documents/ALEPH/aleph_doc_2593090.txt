Forward-Looking Statements
The matters discussed within this report include forward-looking statements. These statements
may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipate,” “assume,”
“believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,”
“potential,” “predict,” “should,” or “will,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or
comparable terminology. In particular, statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans,
objectives, assumptions or future events or performance contained in this report are forward-
looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current
expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations,
assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are
only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond our control. These and other important factors may cause our actual results, performance
or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could
cause actual results to differ from our expectations include:
• our use of the proceeds of our public  offering, especially as it impacts our ability to fund the
target distribution;
• our business and investment strategy;
• our ability to make acquisitions and other investments in a timely manner or on acceptable
terms;
• our ability to pay the full target distribution, or any distribution at all;
• current credit market conditions and our ability to obtain long-term financing for our property
acquisitions and drilling activities in a timely manner and on terms that are consistent with what
we project when we invest in a property;
• the effect of general market, oil and gas market (including volatility of realized price for oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids), economic and political conditions, including the recent
economic slowdown in the oil and gas industry;
• uncertainties with respect to identified drilling locations and estimates of reserves;
• uncertainties with respect to identified drilling locations and estimates of reserves;
• our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our unitholders;
• the degree and nature of our competition;
• the potential impact of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P.’s restructuring on us, including our ability
to sell common units in our public offering; and
• the availability of qualified personnel at our general partner and Atlas Energy Group, LLC, or
ATLS.
The forward-looking statements contained in this report reflect our beliefs, assumptions and
expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to
us. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties and can
change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. If a
change occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary
materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider
these risks before you make an investment decision with respect to our common units.
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking
statements in this report are more fully described under “Risk Factors” in our prospectus for our
public offering, as amended and supplemented and Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Given these risks and
uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date
hereof. We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any such
statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of these statements to
reflect future events or developments.

ATLAS GROWTH PARTNERS, L.P.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
We are a Delaware limited partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural
gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) with operations primarily focused in the Eagle Ford
Shale in south Texas. Our general partner, Atlas Growth Partners GP, LLC (“AGP GP”) owns
100% of the general partner Class A units and all of the incentive distribution rights through
which it manages and effectively controls us. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
to “Atlas Growth Partners, L.P.,” “Atlas Growth Partners,” “the Partnership,” “we,” “us,” “our” and
“our company”, refer to Atlas Growth Partners, L.P. and our consolidated subsidiaries.
At June 30, 2016, Atlas Energy Group, LLC (“ATLS” or “Atlas Energy”), a publicly traded
Delaware limited liability company (OTC: ATLS) that manages and controls us through its
general partner interest and through the terms of the partnership agreement, owned a 2.1%
limited partner interest in us and 80.0% of AGP GP’s general partner Class A units, which are
entitled to receive 2% of the cash distributed by us without any obligation to make further capital
contributions (see Note 9). Current and former members of ATLS management own the
remaining 20% interest in AGP GP’s general partner Class A units.
In addition to its general and limited partner interest in us, ATLS also holds general and limited
partner interests in Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. (“ARP”), a publicly traded Delaware master-
limited partnership (OTC: ARPJ) and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, oil
and NGLs, with operations in basins across the United States, and in Lightfoot Capital Partners,
L.P. and Lightfoot Capital Partners GP, LLC, which incubate new MLPs and invest in existing
MLPs.
To date, we have funded our operations through the private placement of 23,300,410 of our
common limited partner units at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit which ended June 30, 2015
(the “Private Placement Offering”). The common units are a class of limited partner interests in us.
The holders of common units are entitled to participate in partnership distributions, exercise the
rights or privileges available to them, have limited voting rights and have limited liability, all as
outlined in the partnership agreement.
Our registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number: 333-207537) was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2016. We are offering in the
aggregate up to 100,000,000 Class A common units and Class T common units, each
representing limited partner interests in us, pursuant to a primary offering on a "best efforts" basis.
We must receive minimum offering proceeds of $1.0 million to break escrow, and the maximum
offering proceeds of the primary offering may not exceed $1.0 billion. The Class A common units
will be sold for a cash purchase price of $10.00 and the Class T common units will be sold for a
cash purchase price of $9.60, with the remaining $0.40 constituting the Class T common
unitholders' deferred payment obligation to us. We are also offering up to 21,505,376 Class A
common units at $9.30 per unit pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, which are unaudited except
that the balance sheet at December 31, 2015 was derived from audited financial statements,
have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim reporting. They do not include all disclosures
normally made in financial statements contained in our Form S-1. It is suggested that these
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the
notes thereto included in our Form S-1. In management’s opinion, all adjustments necessary for
a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
disclosed have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented may not
necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Transactions between us and other ATLS operations have been
identified in the condensed consolidated financial statements as transactions between affiliates,
where applicable. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
8
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that exist at
the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. Our condensed consolidated
financial statements are based on a number of significant estimates, including revenue and
expense accruals, accruals for well drilling and completion costs, depletion, depreciation and
amortization and fair value of derivative instruments. The oil and gas industry principally
conducts its business by processing actual transactions as many as 60 days after the month of
delivery.  Consequently, the most recent two months’ financial results were recorded using
estimated volumes and contract market prices. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically funded our operations, acquisitions and cash distributions primarily through
cash generated from operations and financing activities, including the Private Placement Offering
completed in 2015. Our future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including oil and
natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth
quarter of 2014 and have continued to decline and remain low in 2016. These lower commodity
prices have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Sustained low
commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position.
ARP Restructuring and Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings
On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and ATLS, solely with respect to certain
sections thereof, entered into a restructuring support agreement with ARP’s lenders (the
“Restructuring Support Agreement”) for a prepackaged restructuring that will reduce debt on its
balance sheet and position ARP for the future (the “Restructuring”). We and ARP are affiliates
through the ownership by our common parent, ATLS. ARP’s Restructuring is expected to be
completed before the end of the third quarter of 2016, after which ARP should emerge from
Chapter 11, backed by its stakeholders, committed to investing capital to develop its exploration
and production assets, as well as its tax-advantaged drilling partnership program.
On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York. The cases commenced thereby are being jointly
administered under the caption “In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.”
We are not a party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, and the ARP Restructuring is not
expected to materially impact us.
The ARP Restructuring is not expected to materailly impact ATLS or its ownership interest in us,
including ATLS’s control of our general partner, AGP GP. The debt structure of ATLS was
recently modified, and ATLS is not a party to the ARP Restructuring. ATLS remains controlled by
the same ownership group and management team and thus, the ARP Restructuring is not
expected to have a material impact on the ability of management to operate us or the other ATLS
businesses.
Segment Reporting
We derive revenue from our gas and oil production. These production facilities have been
aggregated into one reportable segment, because the facilities have similar long-term economic
characteristics, products and types of customers.
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Unit
Basic net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners per unit is computed by dividing
net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners, which is determined after the deduction
of the general partner’s interest, by the weighted average number of common limited partner units
outstanding during the period. The general partner’s interest in net income (loss) is calculated on
a quarterly basis based upon our Class A units and incentive distributions to be distributed for the
quarter (see Note 9), with a priority allocation of net income to the general partner’s incentive
distributions, if any, in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, and the remaining net
income (loss) allocated with respect to the general partner’s and limited partners’ ownership
interests.
9
We present net income (loss) per unit under the two-class method, which considers whether the
incentive distributions represent a participating security. The two-class method considers
whether the Partnership Agreement contains any contractual limitations concerning distributions
to the incentive distribution rights that would impact the amount of earnings to allocate to the
incentive distribution rights for each reporting period. If distributions are contractually limited to
the incentive distribution rights’ share of currently designated available cash for distributions as
defined under the Partnership Agreement, undistributed earnings in excess of available cash
should not be allocated to the incentive distribution rights. Under the two-class method, our
management believes the Partnership Agreement contractually limits cash distributions to
available cash; therefore, undistributed earnings are not allocated to the incentive distribution
rights.
The following is a reconciliation of net loss allocated to the common limited partners for purposes
of calculating net loss attributable to common limited partners per unit (in thousands):

Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners per unit is calculated by
dividing net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners by the sum of the weighted
average number of common limited partner units outstanding and the dilutive effect of common
limited partner warrants, as calculated by the treasury stock method.

(1)For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 2,330,000 and 1,511,000
common limited partner warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings
attributable to common limited partners per unit, because the inclusion of units issuable upon
the exercise of the warrants would have been anti-dilutive. For the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, approximately 2,330,000 and 1,379,000 common limited partner warrants
were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings attributable to common limited
partners per unit, because the inclusion of units issuable upon the exercise of the warrants
would have been anti-dilutive.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
As stated in our Form S-1, we qualify for emerging growth company status; however, we do not
elect this exemption in relation to accounting standards.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting
guidance related to leases. The updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a
lease asset and liability at the commencement date of all leases (with the exception of short-term
leases), initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. The updated guidance is
effective for us as of January 1, 2019 and requires a modified retrospective transition approach
for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest period presented. We are
currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have
on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the evaluation of whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The updated
accounting guidance requires an entity’s management to evaluate whether there are conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one
year from the date the financial statements are issued and provide footnote disclosures, if
necessary. We adopted this
10
accounting guidance on January 1, 2016, and provided enhanced disclosures, as applicable,
within our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to revenue recognition.
The updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model
to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity should
recognize revenue, and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. This
update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are
currently in process of determining the impact that the update will have on our condensed
consolidated financial statements and our method of adoption.

During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.1 million and $0.6
million, respectively, of non-cash property, plant and equipment additions, which were included
within the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $7,000 and $4,000,
respectively, of accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligations within in
depreciation, depletion and amortization in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $11,000 and $7,000,
respectively, of accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligations within in
depreciation, depletion and amortization in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations.
NOTE 4 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
We use swaps in connection with our commodity price risk management activities. We do not
apply hedge accounting to any of our derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses
associated with derivative instruments are recognized as gains on mark-to-market derivatives on
our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
We enter into commodity future option contracts to achieve more predictable cash flows by
hedging our exposure to changes in commodity prices. At any point in time, such contracts may
include regulated New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) futures and options contracts and
non-regulated over-the-counter futures contracts with qualified counterparties. NYMEX contracts
are generally settled with offsetting positions, but may be settled by the physical delivery of the
commodity. Crude oil contracts are based on a West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) index. Natural
gas liquids fixed price swaps are priced based on a WTI crude oil index, while other natural gas
liquids contracts are based on an OPIS Mt. Belvieu index.
We recorded net derivative liabilities of $0.3 million and net derivative assets of $0.4 million on
our condensed consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

(3)The production volumes for 2016 include the remaining six months of 2016 beginning July 1,

On May 1, 2015, we entered into a secured credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks. As
of June 30, 2016, the lenders under the credit facility have no commitment to lend to us under the
credit facility, but we and our subsidiaries have the ability to enter into derivative contracts to
manage our exposure to commodity price movements which will benefit from the collateral
securing the credit facility. Obligations under the credit facility are secured by mortgages on our
oil and gas properties and first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets. The credit
facility may be amended in the future if we and the lenders agree to increase the borrowing base
and the lenders’ commitments thereunder. The secured credit facility agreement contains
covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make
loans or investments, make distributions, merge into or consolidate with other persons, enter into
commodity or interest rate swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed
specified amounts, or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all
12
or substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with these covenants as of June 30,
2016. In addition, our credit facility includes customary events of default, including failure to
timely pay, breach of covenants, bankruptcy, cross-default with other material indebtedness
(including obligations under swap agreements in excess of any agreed upon threshold amount),
and change of control provisions.
NOTE 5 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We use a market approach fair value methodology to value our outstanding derivative contracts.
The fair value of a financial instrument depends on a number of factors, including the availability
of observable market data over the contractual term of the underlying instrument. We separate
the fair value of our financial instruments into the three level hierarchy (Levels 1, 2 and 3) based
on our assessment of the availability of observable market data and the significance of non-
observable data used to determine fair value. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of
our derivative financial instruments were classified as Level 2.
Information for financial instruments measured at fair value at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 was as follows (in thousands):

Other Financial Instruments
Our other current assets and liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets are
considered to be financial instruments. The estimated fair values of these instruments
approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature and thus are categorized as
Level 1.
The fair value of the warrants associated with the issuance of common limited partner units in
2015 (see Note 8) was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model which is based on Level
3 inputs including an exercise price of $10.00, discount rate of 0.5%, an expected term of 1.5
years, expected dividend yield of 7.0% and estimated volatility rate of 50%. The volatility rate
used was consistent with that of ARP. The estimated fair value per warrant was $1.47, which
includes a $0.37 liquidity adjustment. There were no warrants issued for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016.
NOTE 6 – CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Relationship with ATLS. We do not directly employ any persons to manage or operate our
business. These functions are provided by employees of ATLS and/or its affiliates. AGP GP
receives an annual management fee in connection with its management of us equivalent to 1% of
capital contributions per annum. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
paid approximately $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to this management fee.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid approximately $1.1 million and
$0.6 million, respectively, related to this management fee. We were required to pay AGP GP an
amount equal to any actual, out-of-pocket expenses related to the Private Placement Offering
and the formation and financing of us, including legal costs incurred by AGP GP, which
payments were approximately 2% of the gross proceeds of the Private Placement Offering. Other
indirect costs, such as rent for offices, are
13
allocated by ARP at the direction of ATLS based on the number of its employees who devoted
their time to activities on our behalf. We reimburse ATLS at cost for direct costs incurred on our
behalf. We reimburse all necessary and reasonable costs allocated to us by ATLS. All of the
costs paid or payable to ATLS and AGP GP discussed above were included in general and
administrative expenses – affiliate in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had payables to ATLS of $0.5 million and $0.7
million, respectively, related to the management fee, direct costs and allocated indirect costs,
which was recorded in advances from affiliates in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Relationship with ARP. At the direction of ATLS, we reimburse ARP for direct costs, such as
salaries and wages, charged to us based on ATLS employees who incurred time to activities on
our behalf and indirect costs, such as rent and other general and administrative costs, allocated
to us based on the number of ATLS employees who devoted their time to activities on our
behalf. In addition, Anthem Securities, Inc. (“Anthem”), our affiliate and a wholly owned
subsidiary of ARP, acted as dealer manager for our Private Placement Offering, which was
completed in June 2015. As the dealer manager, Anthem received compensation from us equal
to a maximum of 12% of the gross proceeds of the Private Placement Offering as selling
commissions, marketing efforts, and other issuance costs. We recorded $10.1 million and $12.3
million of costs to Anthem within common limited partners’ interests on our condensed
consolidated statements of partners’ capital for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015,
respectively. As the Private Placement Offering concluded on June 30, 2015, no costs were
included on our condensed consolidation statement of partners’ capital for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Anthem is currently acting as the dealer manager for
our issuance and sale in a continuous offering of up to a maximum agreement amount of
100,000,000 common units representing limited partner interests in us as further described in our
registration statement on Form S-1. We will pay Anthem (1) compensation equal to 3.00% of the
gross proceeds of the offering (Anthem may reallow up to 1.50% of gross offering proceeds it
receives as dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers, but expects to reallow 1.25% of
gross offering proceeds to participating broker-dealers); (2) 7.00% and 3.00% of aggregate gross
proceeds from the sale of Class A common units and Class T common units, respectively, as
sales commissions; (3) with respect to Class T common units, a distribution and unitholder
servicing fee in the aggregate amount of 4.00% of the gross proceeds from the sale of Class T
common units, which distribution and unitholder servicing fee will be withheld from cash
distributions otherwise payable to the purchasers of Class T common units at a rate of $0.025 per
quarter per unit. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a $2.4 million payable and
$8.7 million receivable, respectively, to/from ARP related to the direct costs, indirect cost
allocation, dealer manager costs and timing of funding of cash accounts, which was recorded in
advances to/from affiliates in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
NOTE 7 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
General Commitments
As of June 30, 2016, certain of our executives are parties to employment agreements with ATLS
that provide compensation and certain other benefits. The agreements provide for severance
payments under certain circumstances.
As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any commitments related to our drilling and completion and
capital expenditures.
Legal Proceedings
We and our subsidiaries are parties to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the
ordinary course of business. Our management and our subsidiaries believe that none of these
actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.
NOTE 8 – ISSUANCES OF UNITS
Under the terms of our initial offering, we offered in a private placement $500.0 million of our
common limited partner units. The termination date of the Private Placement Offering was
December 31, 2014, subject to two 90 day extensions to the extent that we had not sold $500.0
million of common units at any extension date. We exercised each of such extensions. Under the
terms of the offering, an investor received, for no additional consideration, warrants to purchase
additional common units in an amount equal to 10% of the common units purchased by such
investor. The warrants are exercisable at a price of $10.00 per common unit being purchased
and may be exercised from and after the warrant date (generally, the date upon which we give
the holder notice of a liquidity event) until the expiration date (generally, the date that is one day
prior to the liquidity event or, if the liquidity event is a listing on a national securities exchange, 30
days after the liquidity event occurs). Under the warrant, a liquidity event is defined as either (i) a
listing of the common units on a national securities exchange, (ii) a business combination with or
into an existing publicly-traded entity, or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
14
Through the completion of our Private Placement Offering on June 30, 2015, we issued
approximately $233.0 million, or 23,300,410 of our common limited partner units, in exchange for
proceeds to us, net of dealer manager fees and commissions and expenses, of $203.4 million.
ATLS purchased 500,010 common units for $5.0 million during the offering. In connection with
the issuance of common limited partner units, unitholders received 2,330,041 warrants to
purchase our common units at an exercise price of $10.00 per unit.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we sold an aggregate of 5,956,400 common limited
partner units at a gross offering price of $10.00 per unit. In connection with the issuance of
common limited partner units, unitholders received 595,640 warrants to purchase our common
limited partner units at an exercise price of $10.00 per unit.
NOTE 9 – CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
We have a cash distribution policy under which we distribute to holders of common units and
Class A units on a quarterly basis a target distribution of $0.175 per unit, or $0.70 per unit per
year, to the extent we have sufficient available cash after establishing appropriate reserves and
paying fees and expenses, including reimbursements of expenses to the general partner and its
affiliates. Distributions are generally paid within 45 days of the end of the quarter to unitholders of
record on the applicable record date. Unitholders are entitled to receive distributions from us
beginning with the quarter following the quarter in which we first admit them as limited partners.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we paid a distribution of $8.2 million to common
limited partners ($0.1750 per unit per quarter) and $0.2 million to the general partner’s Class A
units ($0.1750 per unit per quarter). During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we paid a
distribution of $3.8 million to common limited partners ($0.1750 per unit per quarter) and $0.1
million to the general partner’s Class A units ($0.1750 per unit per quarter).
NOTE 10 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Cash Distributions. On August 3, 2016, we declared a quarterly distribution of $0.1750 per
common unit for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The $4.2 million distribution, including $0.1
million to our general partner, will be paid on August 12, 2016 to unitholders of record at the
close of business on June 30, 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We are a Delaware limited partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural
gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) with operations primarily focused in the Eagle Ford
Shale in south Texas. Our general partner, Atlas Growth Partners GP, LLC (“AGP GP”) owns
100% of the general partner Class A units and all of the incentive distribution rights through
which it manages and effectively controls us.
At June 30, 2016, Atlas Energy Group, LLC (“ATLS” or “Atlas Energy”), a publicly traded
Delaware limited liability company (OTC: ATLS) that manages and controls us through its
general partner interest and through the terms of the partnership agreement, owned a 2.1%
limited partner interest in us and 80% of AGP GP’s general partner Class A units, which are
entitled to receive 2% of the cash distributed without any obligation to make further capital
contributions. Current and former members of ATLS management own the remaining 20%
interest in AGP GP’s general partner Class A units.
In addition to its general and limited partner interest in us, ATLS also holds general and limited
partner interests in Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. (“ARP”), a publicly traded Delaware master-
limited partnership (OTC: ARPJ) and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, oil
and NGLs, with operations in basins across the United States, and in Lightfoot Capital Partners,
L.P. and Lightfoot Capital Partners GP, LLC, which incubate new MLPs and invest in existing
MLPs.
FINANCIAL PRESENTATION
Our consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the
consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 include our accounts and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and related
consolidated statements of operations. Actual balances and results could be different from those
estimates. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the
consolidation of the financial statements.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
ARP Restructuring and Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings
On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and ATLS, solely with respect to certain
sections thereof, entered into a restructuring support agreement with ARP’s lenders (the
“Restructuring Support Agreement”) for a prepackaged restructuring that will reduce debt on its
balance sheet and position ARP for the future (the “Restructuring”). We and ARP are affiliates
through the ownership by our common parent, ATLS. ARP’s Restructuring is expected to be
completed before the end of the third quarter of 2016, after which ARP should emerge from
Chapter 11, backed by its stakeholders, committed to investing capital to develop its exploration
and production assets, as well as its tax-advantaged drilling partnership program.
On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York. The cases commenced thereby are being jointly
administered under the caption “In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.”
We are not a party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, and the ARP Restructuring is not
expected to materially impact us.
The ARP Restructuring is not expected to materially impact ATLS or its ownership interest in us,
including ATLS’s control of our general partner, AGP GP. The debt structure of ATLS was
recently modified, and ATLS is not a party to the ARP Restructuring. ATLS remains controlled by
the same ownership group and management team and thus, the ARP Restructuring is not
expected to have a material impact on the ability of management to operate us or the other ATLS
businesses.
Effective Registration Statement. Our registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number:
333-207537) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5,
2016. We are offering in the aggregate up to 100,000,000 Class A common units and Class T
common units, each representing limited partner interests in us, pursuant to a primary offering on
a "best efforts" basis. We must receive minimum offering proceeds of $1.0 million to break
escrow, and the maximum offering proceeds of the primary offering may not exceed $1.0 billion.
The Class A common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $10.00 and the Class T
common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $9.60, with the remaining
16
$0.40 constituting the Class T common unitholders' deferred payment obligation to us. We are
also offering up to 21,505,376 Class A common units at $9.30 per unit pursuant to a distribution
reinvestment plan.
Cash Distributions. On August 3, 2016, we declared a quarterly distribution of $0.1750 per
common unit for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The $4.2 million distribution, including $0.1
million to our general partner, will be paid on August 12, 2016 to unitholders of record at the
close of business on June 30, 2016.
GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
We expect our business to be affected by key trends in natural gas and oil production markets.
Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to
us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information
prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant
declines since the fourth quarter of 2014 through the second quarter of 2016. The causes of
these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant
increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of
exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate,
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the
development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.
Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, our ability to make payments on our
obligations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, including ATLS, depend on
our success in producing our current reserves efficiently, developing our existing acreage and
acquiring additional proved reserves economically. We face the challenge of natural production
declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted,
natural gas and oil production from particular wells decrease. We attempt to overcome this
natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we
produce. To the extent we would not have access to sufficient capital, our ability to drill and
acquire more reserves would be negatively impacted.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Gas and Oil Production
Production Profile. Currently, our gas and oil production revenues and expenses consist of our
gas and oil production activities derived from our wells drilled in the Eagle Ford, Marble Falls and
Mississippi Lime plays. We have established production positions in the following operating
areas:
·the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas, an oil-rich area, in which we acquired acreage in
November 2014;
 ·the Marble Falls play in the Fort Worth Basin in northern Texas, in which we own acreage and
producing wells, contains liquids rich natural gas and oil, and;
 ·the Mississippi Lime play in northwestern Oklahoma, an oil and NGL-rich area.

The increase in gas and oil production revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the prior year period consisted of a $1.9 million increase attributable to production
from our Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease attributable to our
Marble Falls operations. The increase in gas and oil production revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of a $3.3 million increase
attributable to production from our Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a $0.7 million
decrease attributable to our Marble Falls operations and a $0.1 million decrease attributable to
our Mississippi Lime operations.
The increase in gas and oil production expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the prior year period primarily consisted of a $0.5 million increase attributable to our
Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million attributable to our Marble
Falls operations. Total production costs per Mcfe decreased for the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of the decrease in our gas and oil
production in Marble Falls and the addition of production in the Eagle Ford Shale, which has
lower production costs per Mcfe.
The increase in gas and oil production expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the prior year period primarily consisted of a $0.9 million increase attributable to our

Gain (Loss) on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. We recognize changes in fair value of derivatives
immediately within gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives on our condensed consolidated
statements of operations. The recognized losses during the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 are related to the change in oil prices during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
as compared to the prior year period.
General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2016
as compared to the prior year period was due to a $0.1 million decrease in other corporate
activities. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year
period was due to a $1.8 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs
allocated to us by ATLS and ARP in connection with the completion of our private placement
offering in June 2015.
21
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The increase in depreciation, depletion and
amortization for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $2.5
million and a $5.2 million increase in our depletion expense as compared to the prior year period,
respectively.  The following table presents our depletion expense per Mcfe for our operations for
the respective periods (in thousands, except per Mcfe data):

The increases in depletion expense, depletion expenses as a percentage of gas and oil
revenues and depletion expenses per Mcfe, were primarily due to an increase in our depletion
expense associated with the expansion of our Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a
decrease in oil volumes from our Marble Falls operations.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
General
We have historically funded our operations, acquisitions and cash distributions primarily through
cash generated from operations and financing activities, including our private placement offering
completed in June 2015. Our future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including oil
and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the
fourth quarter of 2014 and have continued to decline and remain low in 2016. These lower
commodity prices have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Sustained
low commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position.

2015
The change in cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities when compared with the
comparable prior year period was primarily due to:
·an increase in our advances from affiliates of $17.9 million related to the direct costs, indirect
cost allocation, dealer manager costs for operating activities and timing of funding of cash
accounts;
 ·an increase in our gas and oil production revenues of $2.4 million primarily related to the
expansion of our Eagle Ford operations; and
 ·a decrease in our general and administrative expenses of $2.0 million related to a reduction in
salaries, wages and other corporate activities due to the completion of the Private Placement
Offering in June 2015.
The change in cash flows used in investing activities when compared with the comparable prior
year period was primarily due to:
·a decrease of $44.5 million in net cash paid for acquisitions related to the funding of our Eagle
Ford asset acquisition in the first half of 2016; and
 ·a decrease of $6.8 million in capital expenditures due to lower capital expenditures related to
our drilling activities.
22
The change in cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities when compared with the
comparable prior year period was primarily due to:
·a decrease of $49.9 million in net proceeds from issuance of common limited partner units and
$19.9 million in deferred capital contributions due to our Private Placement Offering funds
raised in the first half of 2015; and
 ·an increase of $4.4 million in distributions paid to unitholders due to an increase in the number
of common units outstanding after the completion of our Private Placement Offering.
Capital Requirements
At June 30, 2016, our capital expenditures primarily relate to our well drilling and leasehold
acquisition costs. The following table summarizes our total capital expenditures, excluding
amounts paid for acquisitions, for the periods presented (in thousands):

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, our total capital expenditures consisted primarily
of $0.6 million for wells drilled compared with $3.0 million for the comparable prior year period
and approximately $3,000 of leasehold acquisition costs compared with $0.2 million for the prior
year comparable period.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our total capital expenditures consisted primarily of
$6.0 million for wells drilled compared with $12.3 million for the comparable prior year period and
$0.1 million of leasehold acquisition costs compared with $0.8 million for the prior year
comparable period.
As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any commitments for our drilling and completion and
capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet commitment arrangements for our
drilling and completion and capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions
CREDIT FACILITY
On May 1, 2015, we entered into a secured credit facility agreement with Wells Fargo. As of June
30, 2016, the lenders under the credit facility have no commitment to lend to us and we have a
zero-dollar borrowing base under the credit facility, but we and our subsidiaries have the ability to
enter into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price movements that will
benefit from the collateral securing the credit facility. Obligations under the credit facility are
secured by mortgages on our oil and gas properties and first priority security interest in
substantially all of our assets. The credit facility may be amended in the future if we request a
borrowing base redetermination and the lenders agree to establish the borrowing base and
related commitments thereunder. We may request a borrowing base redetermination under our
secured credit facility. We are in discussions with our lenders to set a borrowing base for our
credit facility. If the borrowing base is redetermined to an amount greater than zero dollars, the
credit facility would allow us to borrow in an amount up to the borrowing base, which is primarily
based on the estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties and our commodity derivative
contracts as determined semiannually by our lenders in their sole discretion. Once established,
our borrowing base will be subject to redetermination on at least a semi-annual basis based on
an engineering report with respect to our estimated oil and natural gas reserves, which takes into
account the prevailing oil and natural gas prices at such time, as adjusted for the impact of our
commodity derivative contracts. A future decline in commodity prices could result in a
redetermination that lowers our borrowing base at that time and, in such case, we could be
required to repay any indebtedness outstanding at that time in excess of the borrowing base. If
we borrow under the credit facility and we are unable to repay any borrowings in excess of a
decreased borrowing base, we would be in default and no longer able to make any distributions
to our unitholders.
In addition, our credit facility includes customary events of default, including failure to timely pay,
breach of covenants, bankruptcy, cross-default with other material indebtedness (including
obligations under swap agreements in excess of any agreed upon threshold amount), and
change of control.

ISSUANCE OF UNITS
On April 5, 2016, we announced that the registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration
Number: 333-207537) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Under the terms of our initial offering, we offered in a private placement $500.0 million of our
common limited partner units. The termination date of the private placement offering was
December 31, 2014, subject to two 90 day extensions to the extent that we had not sold $500.0
million of common units at any extension date. We exercised each of such extensions. Under the
terms of the offering, an investor received, for no additional consideration, warrants to purchase
additional common units in an amount equal to 10% of the common units purchased by such
investor. The warrants are exercisable at a price of $10.00 per common unit being purchased
and may be exercised from and after the warrant date (generally, the date upon which we give
the holder notice of a liquidity event) until the expiration date (generally, the date that is one day
prior to the liquidity event or, if the liquidity event is a listing on a national securities exchange, 30
days after the liquidity event occurs). Under the warrant, a liquidity event is defined as either (i) a
listing of the common units on a national securities exchange, (ii) a business combination with or
into an existing publicly-traded entity, or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
Through the completion of our private placement offering on June 30, 2015, we issued
approximately $233.0 million, or 23,300,410 of our common limited partner units, in exchange for
proceeds to us, net of dealer manager fees and commissions and expenses, of $203.4 million.
ATLS purchased 500,010 common units for $5.0 million during the offering. In connection with
the issuance of common limited partner units, unitholders received 2,330,041 warrants to
purchase our common units at an exercise price of $10.00 per unit.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we sold an aggregate of 5,956,400 of its common
limited partner units at a gross offering price of $10.00 per unit. In connection with the issuance of
common limited partner units, unitholders received 595,640 warrants to purchase our common
limited partner units at an exercise price of $10.00 per unit.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
For a more complete discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we have identified
as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to
our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in
our Form S-1.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related
to recently issued accounting standards.
ITEM 3:QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and
qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers
to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices. The
disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators
of reasonable possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we
view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of the market risk-sensitive instruments
were entered into for purposes other than trading.
General
All of our assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars, and as a result, we do not have
exposure to currency exchange risks.
We are exposed to various market risks, principally changes in commodity prices. These risks
can impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. We manage these risks
through regular operating and financing activities and periodic use of derivative financial
instruments such as forward contracts and swap agreements. The following analysis presents
the effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position as if the hypothetical
changes in market risk factors occurred on June 30, 2016. Only the potential impact of
hypothetical assumptions was analyzed. The analysis does not consider other possible effects
that could impact our business.
Current market conditions elevate our concern over counterparty risks and may adversely affect
the ability of these counterparties to fulfill their obligations to us, if any. The counterparties related
to our commodity derivative contracts are
24
banking institutions or their affiliates, who also participate in ARP’s revolving credit facilities. The
creditworthiness of our counterparties is monitored, and we currently believe them to be
financially viable. We are not aware of any inability on the part of our counterparties to perform
under their contracts and believe our exposure to non-performance is remote.
Commodity Price Risk. Our market risk exposures to commodities are due to the fluctuations in
the commodity prices and the impact those price movements have on our financial results. To
limit the exposure to changing commodity prices, we use financial derivative instruments,
including financial swap and option instruments, to hedge portions of future production. The
swap instruments are contractual agreements between counterparties to exchange obligations of
money as the underlying commodities are sold. Under these swap agreements, we receive or
pay a fixed price and receive or remit a floating price based on certain indices for the relevant
contract period. Option instruments are contractual agreements that grant the right, but not the
obligation, to purchase or sell commodities at a fixed price for the relevant period.
Holding all other variables constant, including the effect of commodity derivatives, a 10% change
in average commodity prices would result in a change to our net loss for the twelve-month period
ending June 30, 2017 of approximately $1.8 million.
Realized pricing of natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids production is primarily driven by the
prevailing worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to United States
natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids production. Pricing for natural gas, oil and natural gas
liquids production has been volatile and unpredictable for many years.
As of June 30, 2016, we had the following commodity derivatives:

ITEM 4:CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-
benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and with the
participation of our disclosure committee appointed by such officers, we have carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most
recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
