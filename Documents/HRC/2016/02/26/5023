<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods, practices and 
financing of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever 
committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renews its 
commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism and, in 
that regard, calls upon States and other relevant actors, as appropriate, to continue to 
implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which reaffirms, inter 
alia, respect for human rights for all and the rule of law to be the fundamental basis of the 
fight against terrorism; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to ensure that any person 
whose human rights or fundamental freedoms have been violated has access to an effective 
remedy and that victims will receive adequate, effective and prompt reparations where 
appropriate, including by bringing to justice those responsible for such violations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to protect all human rights, 
including economic, social and cultural rights, bearing in mind that certain counter-
terrorism measures may have an impact on the enjoyment of these rights; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to safeguard the right to 
privacy in accordance with international law, and urges them to take measures to ensure

on Civil and Political Rights and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee 
law;

64/168 with regard to measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, and

fundamental judicial guarantees;

appeals and providing the information requested, and to give serious consideration to 
responding favourably to requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Regrets</i> that the compilation of good practices on legal and institutional 
frameworks and measures that ensure respect for human rights by intelligence agencies 
while countering terrorism was not submitted, and therefore requests the Special 
Rapporteur, with the support of the Secretariat, to present the compilation to the Council at 
its fourteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering

Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/80 and the General Assembly in its 
resolution 60/158, and requests the High Commissioner to continue her efforts in this 
regard; </p>

procedures, in particular with regard to placing on, reviewing and removing individuals and 
entities from terrorism-related sanctions lists; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision taken by the Security Council in its resolution 1904

</p>
<p> 17. <i>Stresses</i> the importance that relevant United Nations bodies and entities and 
international, regional and subregional organizations, in particular those that are 
participating in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, which provide technical 
assistance related to the prevention and suppression of terrorism to consenting States, 
include, as appropriate and where consistent with their mandates, the respect of 
international human rights law and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and 
refugee law, as well as the rule of law, as an important element of technical assistance that 
they offer to States related to counter-terrorism, including by drawing on the advice of, and 
otherwise ensuring the ongoing dialogue with, the special procedures of the Council within 
their mandates and the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant stakeholders;  
</p>

welcomes further efforts by the Security Council and its committees, in the fulfilment of 
their respective mandates, to integrate a human rights approach into its counter-terrorism 
objectives;
