<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present study, submitted pursuant to paragraph 11 of Human Rights Council 
resolution 17/11, examines the causes and manifestations of violence against women and 
girls with disabilities. It analyses national legislation, policies and programmes for the 
protection and prevention of violence against women and girls with disabilities. It 
highlights the remaining challenges in addressing the root causes of violence against 
women and girls with disabilities and incorporating women and girls with disabilities into 
gender-based violence programmes. The study concludes with recommendations on 
legislative, administrative, policy and programmatic measures to address violence against 
women and girls with disabilities, with emphasis on the need for a holistic approach aimed 
at eliminating discrimination against women and girls with disabilities, promoting their 
autonomy and addressing specific risk factors that expose them to violence.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 17/11, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a thematic analytical 
study on the issue of violence against women and girls and disability in consultation with 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the 
Special Rapporteur on disability of the Commission for Social Development of the 
Economic and Social Council, other relevant special procedure mandate holders, States, 
United Nations entities, regional organizations, civil society organizations and other 
relevant stakeholders, and to report to the Council at its twentieth session. The present 
report is submitted pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p>2. In the preparation of the study, consultations were held with the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on 
disability of the Commission for Social Development of the Economic and Social Council 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In addition, OHCHR transmitted a questionnaire to 
Member States and other relevant stakeholders requesting information for the study. At 7 
March 2012, 78 replies had been received from 45 Member States, nine United Nations 
agencies and programmes, eight national human rights institutions and 16 non-
governmental and other organizations. 1 
</p>
<p>3. For the purpose of the present report, persons with disabilities include those who 
have long-term physical, intellectual or sensory impairments, which, in interaction with 
various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal 
basis with others.2 
</p>
<p>4. Violence against women is defined by the Declaration on the Elimination of 
Violence against Women as any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to 
result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such 
acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private 
life.3 In the present study, OHCHR adopts a comprehensive definition of what constitutes 
violence against women and girls with disabilities in accordance with international human 
rights standards and as articulated by disability organizations; it thus encompasses 
&#8220;violence accomplished by physical force, legal compulsion, economic coercion, 
</p>
<p>intimidation, psychological manipulation, deception, and misinformation, and in which 
absence of free and informed consent is a key analytical component.&#8221;4 While OHCHR 
recognizes that all persons with disabilities, including men, may experience some of these 
forms of violence, it only analyses the specific situation of women and girls. 
5. In analysing violence against women with disabilities, OHCHR adopted the 
approach developed by the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences. Since the creation of the mandate, mandate holders have 
questioned approaches that treat violations in isolation from the overall subordination of 
women within a patriarchal system and viewed violence against women as an outcome of 
gender discrimination that shapes social, economic, cultural and political structures. The 
need to address the root causes of violence against women has also brought the mandate 
holders, over the years, to focus on the indivisibility of rights and to a shift from a

<p>victimization-oriented approach to one of empowerment, including education, health and 
gender equality requirements within the scope of their recommendations, as part of the due 
diligence obligation of the State to prevent violence against women.5 
</p>
<p><b> II. International legal framework and women and girls with 
disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>6. International standards provide legal protection from violence for all persons 
without discrimination. The principle of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of, 
inter alia, sex or other status, is enshrined in identical provisions in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights.6 Articles 7, 9 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights provide for the right to physical and moral integrity and the right to liberty 
and security of the person. In its general comment No. 16 on the equal right of men and 
women to the enjoyment of all economic, social, and cultural rights, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognized that gender-based violence is a form of 
discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including economic, 
social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality, and called on States parties to take 
appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men and women and act with due 
diligence to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them 
by private actors.<footnote name="7">E/C.<footnote name="1">0 General comment No. 13 (CRC/C/GC/13), paras. 21-22.  </footnote>2/2005/4, para. 27.

 9 Preamble (d) and art. 6(1). </footnote> 
</p>
<p>7. In recognition of the gender-specific nature of violence, international law has 
incorporated norms prohibiting violence against women in different contexts, within the 
family, and at the community and the State levels. The Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women provides for specific protection from 
discrimination for women and girls. In its general recommendation No. 19 on violence 
against women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted 
that, by ratifying the Convention, States had undertaken legal obligations to prevent and 
eliminate violence against women, and clarified that gender-based violence, which impairs 
or nullifies the enjoyment by women of human rights and fundamental freedoms under 
general international law or under human rights conventions, is discrimination within the 
meaning of article 1 of the Convention.8 
</p>
<p>8. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes that women 
and girls with disabilities are often at greater risk, both within and outside the home, of 
violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, and 
expresses concern about the difficult conditions faced by persons with disabilities who are 
subject to multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination&#8221;.9 In article 16, the Convention 
</p>
<p>

number of countries had undertaken studies and research on violence against women and 
</footnote>5 years of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
</p>
<p>consequences&#8221;, available from 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/15YearReviewofVAWMandate.pdf.  
 6 In its article 2, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees to all individuals, 
</p>
<p>within a State party&#8217;s territory and subject to its jurisdiction, that the rights enshrined in the Covenant 
</p>
<p>will be respected and ensured without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status; article 3 
guarantees the equal right of men and women to enjoy all the civil and political rights contained in the 
Covenant. Similar provisions are contained in articles 2 (2) and 3 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>

<p>requires States to put in place legislation and policies and to ensure that instances of 
exploitation, violence and abuse against persons with disabilities, including women and 
girls, are identified, investigated and prosecuted. In article 28 (b), it calls on States to ensure 
access by persons with disabilities, in particular women and girls with disabilities and older 
persons with disabilities, to social protection and poverty reduction programmes. 
</p>
<p>9. Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States parties to 
take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect 
the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent 
treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. The Committee on the 
Rights of the Child recognized that children with disabilities may be subject to particular 
forms of physical violence, such as forced sterilization (particularly girls); and violence in 
the guise of treatment (for example, electroconvulsive treatment and electric shocks used as 
&#8220;aversion treatment&#8221; to control children&#8217;s behaviour)&#8221;.<footnote name="1">2. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, worldwide, more than a 
billion people live with some form of disability, the majority of which live in developing 
countries, and that this figure is increasing through population growth, medical advances 
and the ageing process.12 It also notes that there are significant differences in the prevalence 
of disability between men and women in both developing and more developed countries; 
the male disability prevalence rate is 12 per cent, while the and female prevalence rate is 
19.2 per cent. 
</footnote>0 Article 37 of the Convention 
requires States parties to ensure that no child is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. This provision is closely related to article 39 of the 
Convention, which states that a child victim of, inter alia, torture or any form of cruel or 
inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment is accorded the right to the promotion of 
his or her physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration. 
</p>
<p>10. In its article 23, the Convention on the Rights of the Child addresses the rights of 
children with disabilities, stating that a mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a 
full and decent life, in conditions which ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate 
the child&#8217;s active participation in the community. In its general comment No. 9 on the rights 
of children with disabilities, the Committee on the Rights of the Child noted that girls with 
disabilities were even more vulnerable to discrimination, and requested States parties to, 
when necessary, take extra measures to ensure that girls with disabilities were well 
protected, had access to all services and were fully included in society.11 
</p>
<p>11. The above provisions must be read in conjunction with the principles enshrined in 
declarations referring to persons with disabilities and be construed to encompass a number 
of specific legal obligations for Member States. Such obligations include taking legislative, 
administrative and judicial or other measures to prohibit and prevent violence against 
women and girls with disabilities, to investigate and punish acts of violence, and to provide 
redress and remedies for victims. Specific elements of applicable international human rights 
law are referenced in the sections below. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violence against women and girls with disabilities 
</b></p>

<p>girls with disabilities, or hade available disaggregated data on instances of violence against 
them,13 in the great majority of cases such information is not available. Where incidents are 
documented, the data available often do not make a distinction between type of disability, 
seriousness and type of incident. 
</p>
<p>14. There is a number of factors that expose both men and women with disabilities to a 
greater risk of violence. One factor is the prejudice associated with disability. In many 
societies, persons with disabilities are still regarded as recipients of charity or objects of 
others&#8217; decisions instead of holders of rights, which in turn favours the perception that they 
are incapable of adopting decisions autonomously. Communication barriers experienced by 
persons with sensory disabilities can lead to them being targeted in the belief that they will 
not be able to complain. 
</p>
<p>15. Another important factor is isolation and exclusion from society in residential 
institutions. Persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, and in particular those 
living in institutionalized settings, are the most vulnerable to violence. In Europe alone, 1.2 
million children and adults with disabilities live in long-stay residential institutions.14 
</p>
<p>16. Exposure of persons with disabilities to a greater risk of violence is directly linked to 
factors that increase their dependence on others or disempower and disenfranchise them. 
Many of these factors also lead to impunity and the invisibility of the issue, and results in 
the violence lasting for extended periods; they include absence of mobility aids or assistive 
devices and the training needed to use them; laws that allow for deprivation of legal 
capacity, resulting in the appointment of a legal guardian to make and express legally 
binding decisions for the person with disabilities; lack of access to information and 
counselling services; fear of reporting the abuse for concern of losing needed care; and fear 
of institutionalization if the abusive home environment is reported. The inability of 
professionals, relatives and friends to recognize circumstances resulting from violence &#8211; as 
they are often considered to be inherent to the disability &#8211; is another factor that contributes 
to making the violence invisible.  
</p>
<p>17. Empirical evidence confirms that disability is experienced differently by women and 
men, and that this difference is largely shaped and determined by gender.15 In its general 
recommendation No. 18, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women stressed that women with disabilities may be subject to double discrimination on 
account of gender and disability, and are considered a vulnerable group. Double 
discrimination pervades all aspect of their lives. When compared with men with disabilities, 
women with disabilities are more likely to experience poverty and isolation, and tend to 
have lower salaries and be less represented in the work force. As a result, they are also 
more likely to be victims of violence and/or less able to escape the cycle of violence. Even 
in countries with a relatively high standard of living, women with disabilities are more 
likely to be poor or to have a lower standard of living than men with disabilities.16

<p>18. Some groups of women with disabilities, including indigenous women, migrant 
women, and women belonging to ethnic, linguistic, religious and other minorities face even 
greater risks of violence due to complex intersectional forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>19. The lack of sexual education of women and girls with disabilities, wrongly 
perceived as non-sexual beings, contributes to sexual violence committed against them, as 
they are unable to distinguish inappropriate or abusive behaviours.17 The intersection of 
gender-based and disability-based discrimination also contributes to stereotypical views of 
women and girls with disabilities as lacking intelligence and being compliant and timid. It 
also leads to a lack of credibility when abuse is reported, and therefore minimal risk of 
perpetrators being discovered and punished. 
</p>
<p>20. Women have higher rates of morbidity late in life when compared with men of the 
same age. As they tend to live longer, they are statistically more likely to acquire an age-
related disability. Research has also found that they are twice as likely as men to live in 
residential settings and more likely to experience restrictions in daily functioning.18 Studies 
in Sweden indicate that disability is a factor that increases the risk of assault for elderly 
women, but not for elderly men.19 Older women with disabilities may furthermore be 
particularly dependent on their abuser for daily care. All these factors heighten their 
vulnerability to violence.20 In her thematic report submitted to the Human Rights Council at 
its seventeenth session, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences made reference to<b> </b>general recommendation No. 27 of the Committee<b> </b>on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, in which it recognized that age and sex 
made older women vulnerable to violence, and that age, sex and disability made older 
women with disabilities particularly vulnerable.21 
</p>
<p>21. Women and girls with disabilities experience violence in many ways: in their homes 
or in institutions, at the hands of members of their immediate family, caregivers or 
strangers, in the community, in schools and in other public and private institutions. 
According to a report by the European Parliament, almost 80 per cent of women with 
disabilities are victims of violence, and they are four times more likely than other women to 
suffer sexual violence. According to the report, 80 per cent of those who living in 
institutions are exposed to violence from the people around them, whether health and 
service personnel or caregivers.22 Research has also found that women and girls with 
intellectual disabilities are at a particularly high risk of violence, including sexual 
violence.23 
</p>
<p>22. Women and girls with disabilities are more exposed to the forms of violence 
experienced by women without disabilities. Owing to some of the above-mentioned factors, 
acts of violence against women and girls with disabilities also include other forms of 
physical and psychological violence and neglect, including the withholding of medication 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Some countries have targeted programmes and initiatives to provide women and girls with disabilities 
</p>
<p>with sexual education (see for example the submission of Luxembourg).

<p>and assistive devices (such as wheelchairs, braces and white canes); the removal of a ramp 
or mobility devices; refusal of caregivers to assist with daily living (such as bathing, 
dressing and eating); denial of food or water, or threat of any of these acts; verbal abuse and 
ridicule relating to the disability; removing or controlling communication aids; causing fear 
by intimidation; harming or threatening to harm, take or kill pets or destroy objects ; 
psychological manipulation; and controlling behaviours involving restricting access to 
family, friends or phone calls.24 Women and girls with disabilities are also particularly 
vulnerable to forced sterilization and medical treatment, including the administration of 
drugs or electroshocks. Research has found evidence of forced sterilization of women with 
disabilities, especially intellectual disabilities, in several countries in Europe, as well as in 
Asia, Australia, Latin America and the Middle East.25 
</p>
<p>23. In its contribution to the study, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) 
indicated that children with disabilities are estimated to be 1.7 times more at risk of 
violence, including neglect, abandonment, abuse and sexual exploitation when compared 
with other children. Physical and emotional abuse appears to be the most prevalent abuse 
during childhood, while sexual violence increases during puberty.26 Children with 
disabilities are also disproportionately vulnerable to non-registration at birth, which 
undermines their right to an identity, name and nationality and exposes them to exploitation 
and violence.27 Older children with physical or intellectual disabilities may also be 
particularly vulnerable to violence and humiliation.28 Research shows that children with 
disabilities are also more vulnerable to corporal punishment in all settings.29 
</p>
<p>24. Information submitted by non-governmental organizations for the present study 
indicated that, in societies where there is prejudice and discrimination against persons with 
disabilities, some parents respond with violence because of the shame the child has brought 
upon the family. Importantly, the prejudice attached to disability is compounded by gender 
discrimination; a disabled girl infant or girl child is more likely to die through &#8220;mercy 
killings&#8221; than a boy child of the same age with a comparable disability.30 In addition, 
gender-specific neglect<b> </b>may compound discrimination against girl children with 
disabilities, who are particularly vulnerable to violence and harmful practices, including

<p>infanticide, early and forced marriage31 and forced sterilization perpetrated by family 
members, members of the community and by those with specific responsibilities towards 
them, including teachers and employees of children institutions.32 Their social isolation and 
dependence also makes them vulnerable to female genital mutilation and cutting, even in 
countries where such practices are banned. Furthermore, they are also particularly 
vulnerable to other types of violence, such as &#8220;virgin rapes&#8221; in the context of the AIDS 
epidemic.33 
</p>
<p>25. Women and girls with disabilities may in some cases be targeted for exploitation 
because of their disability, which can in turn expose them to further violence. There is 
evidence that some forms of disability are directly linked to different patterns of trafficking 
(such as forced begging and labour exploitative practices). There have been reports of 
persons, particularly women and girls,34 with physical or visual impairments being 
trafficked into forced begging because a visible disability may have a stronger impact on 
public sympathy.35 
</p>
<p>26. Women and girls with disabilities are also particularly vulnerable to violence during 
situations of conflict and other natural disasters, which may force migration and or 
displacement. Disasters compound the social effects of disability, especially for girls and 
women, who face other barriers. A report by Human Rights Watch in 2010 on violence 
against women with disabilities in Northern Uganda documented frequent abuse and 
discrimination by strangers, neighbours and even family members against women and girls 
with disabilities during the conflict in the country. Women interviewed for the report stated 
that they had no access to provisions, such as food, clothing and shelter, in camps for 
displaced persons or even in their own communities.36 
</p>
<p>27. Insufficient information was given in the submissions on the situation of women 
who develop a disability as result of violence. This may have been partly be due to the lack 
of disaggregated data and information. Nonetheless, research has found that gender-based

<p>violence, in particular sexual violence, can result in significant, long-standing physical and 
mental health consequences, including permanent injuries, for survivors.37 According to a 
study published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, among a nationally 
representative sample of Australian women, gender-based violence was significantly 
associated with mental health disorder and intellectual disability.38 Harmful practices, such 
as female genital mutilation and cutting, may also result in a wide range of physical and 
psychological impairments. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Measures to address violence against women and girls with 
disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation to address violence against women and girls with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities, and risk factors 
</b></p>
<p>28. States have clear obligations under international human rights law to enact 
legislation prohibiting all acts of violence39 against women and girls with disabilities, 
including those to which they are more vulnerable, such as forced sterilization, forced 
institutionalisation and forced abortion. This is important not only to ensure legal protection 
but also to promote a culture where no form of violence against women and girls with 
disabilities is tolerated.  
</p>
<p>29. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has expressed concern 
about involuntary treatment and involuntary confinement and has recommended States to 
incorporate into the law the abolition of surgery and treatment without the full and 
informed consent of the patient, and to ensure that national law respects women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>under articles 23 and 25 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.40 
Other international human rights standards also prohibit forced and coerced treatment of 
people suffering from intellectual disabilities, regardless of arguments of their &#8220;best 
</p>
<p>interests&#8221;. The Human Rights Committee has affirmed that special protection is necessary 
in the case of persons not capable of giving valid consent, and that such persons should not 
be subjected to any medical or scientific experimentation that may be detrimental to their 
health.41 Compulsory or forced treatment of persons with disabilities, including women, 
may amount to ill-treatment and torture.42 The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health has also 
stressed that consent to treatment is one of the most important human rights issues relating

</p>
<p> 39 International law and human rights jurisprudence sets out States responsibilities to exercise due 
diligence in taking steps to end violence against women. See E/CN.4/2006/61. 
</p>
<p> 40 CRPD/C/TUN/CO/1,, paras. 28-29. 
 41 General comment No. 20 (1992) on prohibition of torture and cruel treatment or punishment, para. 7. 
 42 In 2008, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment articulated in his interim report (A/63/175) that prolonged segregation of people with 
disabilities from society in institutions, including prisons, social care centres, orphanages and mental 
health institutions could amount to torture. He also noted that the vulnerability of persons with 
disabilities means their access to judicial remedies is severely restricted, and that involuntary 
treatment and involuntary confinement run counter to the provisions of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities.  </p>


<p>to mental disability and, accordingly, it is especially important that the procedural 
safeguards protecting the right to informed consent are both watertight and strictly 
applied.43 
</p>
<p>30. Research and the contributions submitted for the present study show that a striking 
number of States have laws that authorize forced or involuntary treatment of persons with 
psychosocial disabilities when in their &#8220;best interests&#8221;. In more than half of the countries 
</p>
<p>that submitted data, psychiatric treatment is imposed on persons with<b> </b>disabilities within 
legal safeguards if demonstrably &#8220;justified&#8221;, &#8220;reasonable&#8221;, &#8220;necessary&#8221; and &#8220;proportionate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Most countries acknowledged that persons subject to involuntary treatment require 
procedural safeguards at the time of institutionalization; some of the submissions received 
contained information on the procedures to be followed in these circumstances. These legal 
safeguards include monitoring and oversight and the right of persons in involuntary 
placement to a judicial appeal against an involuntary placement or certain treatment. The 
submissions showed that the implementation of procedural safeguards varies between 
countries, and approaches lacked consistency from one country to another.  
</p>
<p>31. States are also required to recognize the autonomy of persons with disabilities,44 
which is crucial in to the prevention of acts of violence. The Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities recognizes this and moves away from the guardianship approach 
to supported decision-making. It is also essential to ensure access to recourse and remedies 
for acts of violence. According to article 12 of the Convention, States parties are to 
recognize that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in 
all aspects of life. In its general comment No. 7, the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
noted that children are rights-holders with evolving capacities, and reminded States of their 
obligation to facilitate genuine participation of young children in the processes affecting 
their development. Many countries have enacted laws that limit, or deprive disabled women 
and girls of, the right to exercise their full legal capacity.  
</p>
<p>32. Most countries reported in their submissions that the prohibition of discrimination 
on the grounds of sex in national legislation offered sufficient protection for women with 
disabilities, although there was no specific legal framework to protect women and girls with 
disabilities from violence. In practice, however, the protection from violence generally 
accorded to women and girls may not be inclusive and attentive to the specific situations of 
those with disabilities. For example, legislation on domestic violence often fails to 
recognize the range of domestic or family settings in which women with disabilities may 
live (such as group or nursing homes) and the variety of possible perpetrators in such 
contexts (for example, not including violence at the hands of caregivers). Similarly, 
legislation on violence against women often fails to recognize some forms of disability-
specific violence (such as those mentioned in paragraphs 12 to 27 above). These represent 
limitations for the purposes of prosecution, and may further affect eligibility for such 
services as shelters and preventive strategies.  
</p>
<p>33. While discriminatory legal provisions persist in some States, most have general non-
discrimination clauses in their legislation covering discrimination based on both gender and 
disability. Furthermore, many States have expressed provisions in specific legislation, for 
example on employment and education, prohibiting discrimination based on disability. In 
many instances, however, such provisions continue not to be implemented, as women and 
</p>
<p>  
 43 E/CN.4/2005/51, paras. 48-50 and 60. 
 44 According to article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the principles of 
</p>
<p>the Convention are &#8220;respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy, including the freedom to make 
</p>
<p>one's own choices, and independence of persons&#8221;. </p>


<p>girls with disabilities face enormous difficulties in their access to justice, compounded by 
social attitudes towards both gender-based violence and disability. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prevention and protection programmes and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>34. In analysing responses to the questionnaire, attention was paid to assessing the 
existence and nature of specific policies or programmes addressing violence against women 
and girls with disabilities, as well as to the extent of inclusion of women and girls with 
disabilities in programmes and policies that address different forms of gender-based 
violence. 
</p>
<p>35. Very few examples of plans, programmes and policies addressing the underlying 
causes of violence against women and girls with disabilities were found. Most responding 
States stressed that one of the underlying causes of violence, including neglect, against 
women and girls with disabilities, were discriminatory practices and stereotypical 
perceptions. Nonetheless, the efforts made by States to raise awareness of the underlying 
causes targeted persons with disabilities in general and failed to factor in the gender 
dimension of disability.45 Several countries reported on important steps to promote the 
realization of the rights of women and girls with disabilities, including in the field of 
labour, health and education. The efforts to address de facto discrimination against women 
with disabilities in all spheres of life appear, however, to be limited, while linking disability 
to the concept of gender violence in a meaningful way into Government programmes 
continues to be a challenge. There was little information in the responses on efforts to 
promote the economic empowerment and autonomy of women with disabilities and on 
measures to eradicate poverty among persons with disability, in spite of research showing 
that many persons with disability, especially women, are disproportionately affected by 
poverty.46 
</p>
<p>36. In some responses, reference was made to specific initiatives to protect women and 
girls with disabilities who experience violence. For example, in Croatia, the Government 
and civil society have published an SOS address book for women with disabilities 
containing information on institutions and organizations that provide victims of violence 
with counselling and accommodation. Initiatives of this type are however rare, and are 
mostly operated by non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>37. Furthermore, in a limited number of responses, reference was made to cases of 
specific attention being paid to the situation and needs of women and girls with disabilities 
in programmes, plans and policies addressing gender-based violence.47 The responses 
suggested, however, that support services, including health care, community centres and 
</p>
<p>  
 45 For example, in April 2010, the Government of Italy launched a nationwide awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>campaign on disability under the slogan &#8220;Different skills, same desire to live&#8221;, aimed at changing 
social attitudes to persons with disabilities. 
</p>

<p>accommodation for women victims of violence, are often inaccessible to women and girls 
with disabilities. This is particularly true for women with a mobility limitation, as 
emergency accommodation facilities often fail to meet the minimum physical standards for 
disability access. Women and girls with disabilities also encounter difficulties in their 
access to health and social services available to the general population, owing to mobility 
and communication barriers and the lack of adequate training of staff, including on how to 
communicate with women with sensory or intellectual disabilities. Several States 
recognized this shortcoming, and some are developing pilot projects to address it.48 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to protection and prevention measures, and initiatives addressing the 
cases of women and girls with disabilities who are institutionalized or living in supported 
accommodation, several submissions referred to existing provisions to ensure regular visits 
and inspections, and to the existence of protocols for the prevention of violence by 
professional caregivers. There was, however, little data on inspection reports, the 
appropriateness and use of the data collected, and on resources available to ensure regular 
oversight of institutions and proper training of caregivers. Reports submitted by non-
governmental and disability organizations indicate that these efforts are still inadequate and 
ineffective.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>39. Article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires 
States parties to ensure that persons with disabilities have the right to have access to justice, 
including procedural and age-specific accommodations to facilitate their participation in 
legal proceedings. There was insufficient information in the submissions received to 
compare the number of State prosecution of crimes involving violence against women and 
girls with disabilities with the rest of the population. The Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment noted that societal barriers limit 
persons with disabilities access to justice on an equal basis with others.49 This view is 
supported by the findings of non-governmental organizations indicating that incidents of 
violence against women and girls with disabilities are often not investigated owing to social 
barriers.50 These barriers include the failure of law enforcement officials to file criminal 
complaints, because of their stereotypical perception of women with disabilities; and 
structural barriers, such as the requirement of legal capacity in order to be viewed as a 
&#8220;competent witness&#8221;, and laws that permit certain forms of violence, such as 
</p>
<p>electroconvulsive treatment and electric shocks, or fail to criminalize specific forms of 
violence experienced by women and girls with disabilities (see paragraphs 12 &#8211; 27 above). 
</p>
<p>40. Women and girls with disabilities may be less aware of their rights and the means to 
claim them. As discussed above, victims are also often unable to recognize instances of 
violence or may be unwilling to report them when perpetrated by caregivers or people in 
their immediate environment for fear of losing support. In addition, often women cannot 
</p>
<p>  
 48 For example, in Sweden and Norway, organizations for women with disabilities and crisis centres 
</p>
<p>have concerted their efforts to find ways to improve services offered to women with disabilities who 
have been victims of violence. In the United States of America, the State of Illinois has, since 2006, 
conducted a disability responsiveness review of all 33 rape crisis centres in the State, and developed a 
tool kit for them and all disability organizations. 
</p>
<p> 49 These vulnerabilities include &#8220;unspeakable indignities, neglect, severe forms of restraint and 
</p>
<p>seclusion, as well as physical, mental and sexual violence&#8221;. A/63/175, para. 38, 
 50 <i>Impact</i>: feature issue on violence against women with developmental or other disabilities, Institute on

Minnesota, vol. 13, No. 3 (available from http://ici.umn.edu/products/impact/133/). </p>


<p>initiate complaints because they are in institutions, have no accessible transportation or 
mobility support.  
</p>
<p>41. Even when a victim wishes to exercise her rights and file a complaint, she may be 
denied physical access to the police station and have problems communicating with law 
enforcement officials. Furthermore, the justice system may fail to accommodate her 
physical, communication or other specific needs. Victim protection measures and other 
measures to support victims may be inadequate for women with disabilities. In addition, 
women with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities acting as witnesses are often seen as 
lacking credibility.  
</p>
<p>42. Prosecutors are often reluctant to open cases of violence committed against women 
and girls with intellectual disabilities, given that they can require more resources owing to 
the need to investigate the victim&#8217;s ability to consent and testify.51 Similarly, judges and 
magistrates may minimize certain forms of violence because of widespread societal 
perceptions of disability, resulting in inadequate sentences or a tendency to favour 
mediation, forcing women to confront their abusers. In addition, legal representation is not 
often affordable for women with disabilities. In general terms, women and girls living in 
rural and remote areas can experience particular difficulties in obtaining legal advice and 
representation for domestic violence applications and associated family law and child 
protection matters. Such a situation is further compounded by a disability. 
</p>
<p>43. The responses received seemed to indicate that there were no systematic 
programmes in place to train judges, lawyers and law enforcement officials on the rights of 
women and girls with disabilities and effective ways to communicate with them.52 
</p>
<p><b> D. Recovery and rehabilitation  
</b></p>
<p>44. For women and girls who survive violence and manage to escape an abusive and 
violent environment or situation, the effects can be particularly detrimental and long 
lasting. They include low self-esteem, feelings of guilt or shame, lack of confidence in 
themselves and others, effects of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction 
problems, sadness, depression and suicidal thoughts. 
</p>
<p>45. Article 16 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires 
States parties to take all appropriate measures to promote the physical, cognitive and 
psychological recovery, rehabilitation and social reintegration of persons with disabilities 
who become victims of any forms of violence or abuse. 
</p>
<p>46. There was little information in the submissions received on gender and disability-
specific measures taken by States to rehabilitate and reintegrate women and girls with 
</p>
<p>  
 51 See &#8220;Prosecuting disability hate crime: the next frontier&#8221;, 2 March 2011, speech by Keir Starmer QC, 
</p>
<p>the Director of Public Prosecutions to the University of Sussex, United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland (available from www.cps.gov.uk/news/articles/prosecuting_disability_hate_crime/). 
In his speech, the Director noted that &#8220;to date, victims and witnesses with disabilities have not been 
well served by the criminal justice system&#8221;.  
</p>

<p>disabilities who have been victims of violence. Although some good examples were 
reported,53 specialized and accessible services seemed to be generally lacking. 
</p>
<p>47. Many of the obstacles hindering access to justice for women and girls with 
disabilities who have been victims of violence are also present when they request health 
and other services necessary to promote physical, cognitive and psychological recovery, 
rehabilitation and social integration. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences has 
highlighted discrimination with regard to health care and services. In her report on multiple 
forms of discrimination, she pointed out that women who lacked social and cultural capital 
may be denied proper health or medical services, fear the consequences of asking for 
medical assistance, receive improper or low-quality care or live in places where no health 
services are available. Women who suffered from cognitive and/or physical disabilities 
were further negatively affected, since prejudices about disability were persistent in most 
countries and they therefore might not be viewed as requiring care or live in places where 
no specialized care was available.54  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> There is a general lack of systematized and disaggregated data on violence 
against women and girls with disabilities. Where statistics exist, they are partial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>only concern certain forms of violence. Many studies and several surveys show that 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and girls with disabilities experience a high rate of violence by different actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>and in different settings. 
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> The violence experienced by women and girls with disabilities remains largely 
invisible, and current legislative, administrative and policy efforts often fail to link 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender and disability in a meaningful way and to address adequately specific risk and 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability factors.  
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> Programmes addressing gender-based violence often fail to take women and 
girls with disabilities into consideration. In addition, services are either unavailable or 
</b></p>
<p><b>inaccessible, while many obstacles seriously hinder their access to justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Programmes promoting the rights of persons with disabilities often fail to integrate a 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender dimension.  
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> A dual-track approach is needed to address violence against women and girls 
with disabilities. Programmes to prevent violence against women and ensure access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice, protection measures and legal, social and medical services must be designed 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implemented in a manner that ensures inclusion and accessibility by women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>girls with disabilities.</b>55<b> On the other hand, specific programmes and strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeting girls and women with disabilities should be implemented in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards.</b>56<b> A holistic approach aimed at eliminating discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p>  
 53 For example, the Government of Sweden organizes summer camps for battered women with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and crisis centre staff, at which participants have the opportunity to share their knowledge 
and experiences. In August 2011, the State of Illinois organized 10 workshops throughout the State 
for disability providers in order to enhance their response to persons with disabilities who experience 
sexual assault.

 55 See CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1, paras. 21-22.  
 56 Article 4 (a) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires States parties to

<p>take all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures to prevent and punish violence 
 </p>


<p><b>promoting autonomy and addressing specific risk factors should be the goal, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate attention to the fields of education, employment, health and social

<p><b>protection. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> Such policies and programmes should be developed in close partnerships with 
women and girls with disabilities and with disability organizations, including those

</b></p>
<p><b>statistical and research data, on all forms of violence experienced by women and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b>with disabilities, disaggregated by sex, age and disability. Disability should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>included in victimization surveys; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) In accordance with article 8 of the Convention, awareness-raising 
</b></p>

<p><b> (c) Reviewing and/or amending legislation on violence against women to

<p><b>Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other

</b></p>
<p><b>specific forms of violence suffered by women and girls with disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Prohibiting by law forced sterilization of children and adults on the

</b></p>
<p><b>sanction discriminatory practices. Sign language interpretation should be made
