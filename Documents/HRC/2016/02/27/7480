<p><b>  Report of the independent international commission of 
inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The findings presented in the present report, based on 480 interviews and evidence 
collected between 20 January and 15 July 2014, establish that the conduct of the warring 
parties in the Syrian Arab Republic has caused civilians immeasurable suffering. 
</p>
<p>Government forces continued to perpetrate massacres and conduct widespread 
attacks on civilians, systematically committing murder, torture, rape and enforced 
disappearance amounting to crimes against humanity. Government forces have committed 
gross violations of human rights and the war crimes of murder, hostage-taking, torture, rape 
and sexual violence, recruiting and using children in hostilities and targeting civilians. 
Government forces disregarded the special protection accorded to hospitals and medical 
and humanitarian personnel. Indiscriminate and disproportionate aerial bombardment and 
shelling led to mass civilian casualties and spread terror. Government forces used chlorine 
gas, an illegal weapon.  
</p>
<p>Non-State armed groups, named in the report, committed massacres and war crimes, 
including murder, execution without due process, torture, hostage-taking, violations of 
international humanitarian law tantamount to enforced disappearance, rape and sexual 
violence, recruiting and using children in hostilities and attacking protected objects. 
Medical and religious personnel and journalists were targeted. Armed groups besieged and 
indiscriminately shelled civilian neighbourhoods, in some instances spreading terror among 
civilians through the use of car bombings in civilian areas. Members of the Islamic State of 
Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) committed torture, murder, acts tantamount to enforced 
disappearance, and forcible displacement as part of an attack on the civilian population in 
Aleppo and Ar Raqqah governorates, amounting to crimes against humanity.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  In the present report, the independent international commission of inquiry on the 
Syrian Arab Republic1 presents its findings based on investigations conducted from 20 
January to 15 July 2014. It should be read in conjunction with the commission&#8217;s previous 
reports.2 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>2. The commission&#8217;s investigations remain curtailed by the denial of access to the 
Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p>3.  Correspondence between the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic and 
the commission is annexed to the present report (see annex I).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>4. The methodology employed by the commission is based on standard practices of 
commissions of inquiry and human rights investigations. The commission relied primarily 
on first-hand accounts. 
</p>
<p>5. The information contained in the present report is based on 480 interviews 
conducted in the region and from Geneva. Since September 2011, the commission has 
conducted 3,126 interviews and collected and analysed photographs, video recordings, 
satellite imagery and medical records and other documentary material. Reports from 
Governments and non-governmental sources, academic analyses and United Nations 
reports formed part of the investigation. 
</p>
<p>6. The standard of proof is met when the commission has reasonable grounds to 
believe that incidents occurred as described. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Conflict dynamics 
</b>7. Government forces and non-State armed groups continue to engage in fierce 
fighting. While all belligerents succeeded in securing gains in different areas, none appear 
capable of achieving a complete military victory.  
</p>
<p>8. The emergence of countless frontlines, involving different local and regional actors, 
has amplified the conflict&#8217;s complexity. The continuous involvement of extremist fighters 
mobilized on all sides along sectarian and/or ethnic lines has polarized the conflict.  
</p>
<p>9. The impact of the war is no longer confined to Syrian territory. The continuous 
influx of foreign fighters, the success of extremist groups, the rise of sectarian tensions, 
competition for resources such as water, oil or gas, and the increasingly vulnerable 
socioeconomic situation of refugees have contributed to a spillover of violence, affecting 
regional peace and stability. Risks of the conflict spreading further are palpable. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1 The commissioners are Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro (Chair), Karen Koning AbuZayd, Vitit Muntarbhorn 
and Carla Del Ponte. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2 S-17/2/Add.1, A/HRC/19/69, A/HRC/21/50, A/HRC/22/59, A/HRC/23/58, A/HRC/24/46 and 
A/HRC/25/65. </p>


<p><b> A. Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>10. Government forces3 made slow but significant advances in most strategic areas. In 
key governorates, including Rif Damascus, Homs and Aleppo, they shrunk opposition-held 
territories and severed their lines of communication. Direct confrontations with the Islamic 
State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS), however, are rare and mostly limited to sporadic air 
strikes in Ar Raqqah, Aleppo and Dayr az Zawr governorates.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. The capacity of Government forces has been enhanced through significant 
organizational, strategic and tactical readjustments. The Government is increasingly 
capable of massing all elements of military power during offensive operations targeting 
priority objectives. It succeeded in holding positions in governorates where it is unable or 
unwilling to conduct offensives, such as Idlib and Dara&#8217;a. As part of its strategy for 
controlling the population, it has combined long-lasting sieges with heavy aerial and 
artillery bombardment, leading to dozens of forced truces in Homs and Damascus and the 
surrounding countryside. Forced truces, a mark of the Government&#8217;s strategy of siege and 
bombardment, are often followed by mass arrests of men of fighting age, many of whom 
disappear. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government continues to rely on technical, training and logistical assistance 
provided by external allies. Government forces recently experienced shortages of combat 
manpower as Iraqi militia returned to fight in Iraq, which curtailed their ability to 
simultaneously deploy troops on multiple fronts.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>13. Armed groups have been simultaneously engaged on multiple fronts fighting 
Government forces, ISIS and among themselves. Lacking the necessary combat 
capabilities, they failed to reverse their adversaries&#8217; advances in areas previously part of 
their major strongholds in Rif Damascus, eastern Aleppo and Dayr az Zawr governorates. 
Weakened by infighting, they have suffered large defections to ISIS owing to the latter&#8217;s 
superior financial and operational capabilities.   
</p>
<p>14. Military successes in Dara&#8217;a and Idlib governorates underscored some armed 
groups&#8217; ability to prevent the Government from regaining full control over territory. In 
most of those victories, armed groups labelled as moderate continued to operate under ad 
hoc operation rooms, closely coordinating with extremist groups, including the Al-Qaida-
affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra. 
</p>
<p>15. Divisions and rivalries prevented insurgents from increasing their operational 
effectiveness. Despite multiple restructuring initiatives, they failed to integrate under a 
cohesive structure and leadership owing to ideological, political, tribal and personal 
divergences. Efforts by external backers to reinforce the so-called &#8220;vetted moderate armed 
opposition&#8221; failed to reverse the dominance of radical armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b></p>
<p>16. Recent gains by ISIS in Iraq boosted its military capabilities, seriously affecting the 
power balance inside the Syrian Arab Republic, both materially and psychologically. Far 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 &#8220;Government forces&#8221;, unless specified otherwise, comprise the Syrian Armed Forces, intelligence 
</p>
<p>forces and associated foreign and local militias, including Hezbollah, the <i>shabbiha</i> and the popular 
Committees/National Defence Forces. </p>


<p>better organized and financed owing to the seizure of considerable resources and military 
equipment in Iraq, the group has consolidated control over large areas in northern and 
eastern governorates, in particular oil-rich Dayr az Zawr. ISIS is increasingly battling anti-
Government armed groups, including Jabhat al-Nusra, Kurdish armed groups, and, to a 
lesser extent, Government forces. 
</p>
<p>17. Besides attracting more experienced and ideologically motivated foreign fighters 
since it proclaimed itself an Islamic caliphate, ISIS has drawn an increasing number of 
Syrians to its ranks, particularly after forming alliances with local tribes in Ar Raqqah, Al 
Hasakah and Dayr az Zawr governorates. To curb popular discontent over its harsh 
governance methods, ISIS has adopted a strategy based on the establishment of order 
through a combination of brutality and the provision of essential services, including 
security and employment.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Kurdish armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>18. Kurdish People&#8217;s Protection Units (YPG) continued to consolidate their control over 
the de facto self-regulated Kurdish regions in the north, namely Afrin, Ayn al-Arab and Al-
Jazeera. They successfully repelled ISIS attacks on territory under their control along the 
borders with Iraq and Turkey .  
</p>
<p>19. Renewed violence has been reported in Ayn al-Arab (Aleppo) as ISIS launched an 
offensive using advanced weapons seized in Iraq. Sporadic clashes between YPG and local 
National Defence Forces were reported in the cities of Qamishli and Al Hasakah. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violations in the treatment of civilians and <i>hors de combat</i> 
fighters 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Massacres and other unlawful killing</b>4<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>20. Reports of deaths in custody in government detention centres in Damascus have 
risen. In most instances, the Government failed to acknowledge the majority of detentions 
and deaths in prisons, with relatives receiving information from former detainees or bribed 
officials.  
</p>
<p>21. Detainees have died from injuries sustained during torture. Others died from lack of 
food and medical care. Many families, however, were denied information concerning the 
circumstances of their relatives&#8217; deaths. Where officially informed, families were often told 
the detainee died of a heart attack. One father, told of the death of his 28-year-old son, 
stated &#8220;it seems now everyone in Syria has a heart attack&#8221;, attesting to the Syrian 
authorities&#8217; pervasive practice of concealing the cause of death. 
</p>
<p>22. There were multiple reports of deaths in custody at the Mezzeh airport detention 
facility, Military Security Branches 215 and 235 and Sednaya Prison. A pattern of families 
being directed to the Qaboun Military Police and then to Tishreen Military Hospital 
prevailed. In most cases, bodies were not returned. Many are reportedly buried in Najha 
cemetery. Without access, that information cannot be confirmed. 
</p>
<p>23. In January, the Qaboun Military Police informed a family that a male relative, who 
had been detained and disappeared in 2011, had died of a heart attack. The family was 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4  See also annex IV. </p>


<p>directed to Tishreen Military Hospital to collect the death certificate, but could not retrieve 
the body. In March, a family visited the Qaboun Military Police, seeking the rights to visit a 
relative detained in November 2011. They were directed to Tishreen Military Hospital, 
where they received documentation stating that their relative had been detained in Sednaya 
Prison and had died of a heart condition in August 2013. The body was not returned. On 9 
May, an elderly man was arrested trying to cross into Lebanon. Four days later, his wife 
received a call from the municipal authorities in Damascus informing her that she could 
collect her husband&#8217;s body from Tishreen Military Hospital. She was too frightened to go. 
Other military hospitals, notably Mezzeh Military Hospital, also known as Hospital No. 
601, also provided death certificates to families. 
</p>
<p>24. In mid-2013, a 12-year-old boy was arrested in Damascus after speaking with his 
cousin, a member of an armed group. The family hired a lawyer, who determined that the 
boy had been held in Military Security Branch 235. On their taking the matter to court, the 
judge informed them that the boy was at a private hospital. When they arrived there, they 
were told their son was dead. His body bore marks of severe torture, including 
electrocution.  
</p>
<p>25. Other families were informed of the death of their relatives by former detainees. 
There has been no official recognition of those deaths and no return of the bodies, making 
them impossible to confirm. Multiple reports of deaths in custody in Damascus between 
March 2011 and December 2013 were also received. 
</p>
<p>26. A preliminary review and forensic analysis has been conducted of 26,948 
photographs allegedly taken between 2011 and 2013 in government detention facilities. 
Among them are photographs of case files and deceased detainees showing signs of torture 
and severe malnourishment. Certain elements &#8212; such as the location identified in some 
photographs as Military Hospital No. 601 in Damascus, the methods of torture, and the 
conditions of detention &#8212; support the commission&#8217;s long-standing findings of systematic 
torture and deaths of detainees. Investigations are ongoing, with findings largely reliant on 
the identification of further metadata.  
</p>
<p>27. Government forces encircling the besieged area of eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus) 
shot and killed civilians attempting to leave. In March, civilians, including women and 
children, hearing the road was open, left Al-Hajar al-Aswad. They were carrying a white 
flag. As they moved to within 500 metres of a government checkpoint, a sniper shot and 
killed one woman, forcing the group to retreat. In April, a 14-year-old boy attempting to 
leave eastern Ghouta to look for food was shot and killed at Al-Muhayam checkpoint.  
</p>
<p>28. Government forces perpetrated unlawful killings as part of a widespread attack 
directed against the civilian population. The attacks included widespread shelling and 
bombardment of civilian-inhabited localities and the targeting of civilians for arrest, 
detention and disappearance on the basis of their association or perceived opposition to the 
Government. The coordination and active participation of Government institutions 
indicated that the attacks were conducted as a matter of institutional policy. The unlawful 
killings formed part of those attacks and constitute crimes against humanity. Government 
forces also committed the war crime of murder and arbitrarily deprived people of life. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>29. In Al-Mataiyyeh (Dara&#8217;a), the Islamic Front killed several men suspected of 
collaborating with the Government. In March, a man was abducted from his house. His 
body was found later the same day, shot in the chest. On 20 May, another man was held by 
the Islamic Front, accused of stealing from an Al-Yarmouk Brigade fighter. His body was </p>


<p>found, shot in the chest, four days later. During the attack on Kasab (Latakia), as they 
moved into the town, armed groups, including Jabhat al-Nusra, killed at least two civilians. 
On 22 March, while inside Kasab, they shot and killed a 23-year-old man. In committing 
those acts, the anti-Government armed groups perpetrated the war crime of murder. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b>30. Executions in public spaces have become a common spectacle on Fridays in Ar 
Raqqah and ISIS-controlled areas of Aleppo governorate. ISIS informs residents 
beforehand and encourages them to attend. In some cases, ISIS forces passers-by to attend. 
Children have been present at the executions, which take the form of beheading or shooting 
in the head at close range. Before executions, ISIS fighters announce the victims&#8217; crimes. 
Bodies are placed on public display, often on crucifixes, for up to three days, serving as a 
warning to local residents.  
</p>
<p>31. Victims are usually accused of being affiliated with other armed groups, or of 
violating the ISIS criminal code. There have also been examples of the execution of men 
accused of being affiliated with the Syrian National Coalition, or of spying for the 
Government. The majority of those executed are adult men. ISIS has also executed several 
boys, aged between 15 and 17 years, who were reportedly members of other armed groups. 
In July, two women were stoned to death by an ISIS-sanctioned mob in different locations 
in Ar Raqqah governorate. 
</p>
<p>32. In Ar Raqqah city, executions regularly take place in El-Naim square and at Al-Sa&#8217;a 
roundabout. Dozens have been documented. In late April, ISIS executed seven people, five 
under the age of 18, in El-Naim square, for being members of armed groups. Three bodies 
were displayed on crucifixes for three days. On the same day, two men were executed in 
Tabqa and Slouk (Ar Raqqah). On 22 March in Tabqa, ISIS shot a man in the head and 
placed his body on a crucifix for two days. 
</p>
<p>33. As ISIS has expanded its control of areas in eastern Aleppo governorate, it has 
publicly executed people in Minbij, Al Bab and Jarabulus. In Minbij, ISIS uses a parking 
lot as its execution site. Most executions are beheadings. In February, a 15-year-old boy 
was beheaded, ostensibly for committing rape. Children were present. Several of those 
interviewed believed that he had been executed for being a member of another armed 
group. The body was left on the ground for two days. In April, ISIS fighters beheaded two 
men. Their bodies were displayed on crucifixes for two days.  
</p>
<p>34. In April, ISIS beheaded two men in Al-Bza&#8217;a, outside Al Bab. Several hundred 
people were gathered to watch, including children. The first execution was improperly 
carried out, as the knife was insufficiently sharp. In February, in Jarabulus, ISIS beheaded 
three captured fighters from another armed group, one of whom was 17 years old. Their 
heads were displayed on sticks for several days after the execution. 
</p>
<p>35. Detainees were killed in ISIS custody. In February, a man accused of kidnapping a 
child was shot and killed at a prison in Jarabulus. In March, ISIS detained a man in 
Jarabulus on suspicion of being affiliated to another armed group. Three days later his 
family was called to claim the body.  
</p>
<p>36. ISIS justifies its executions by religious law. Persons interviewed stated that 
detainees in ISIS prisons have no access to lawyers and are afforded none of the due 
process rights inherent in a fair trial. While investigations into the operation of ISIS sharia 
courts are ongoing, there are reasonable grounds to believe that ISIS has committed the war 
crime of execution without due process.  
</p>
<p>37. By its public display of bodies and failure to honourably inter them in accordance 
with the rites of the religion of the deceased, ISIS has violated customary international </p>


<p>humanitarian law. ISIS carried out public executions to instil terror among the population, 
ensuring submission to its authority. 
</p>
<p>38. ISIS has committed acts of violence against the civilian population under its control 
in Ar Raqqah and eastern Aleppo governorates. That is a continuation &#8212; and a geographic 
expansion &#8212; of the widespread and systematic attack on the civilian population identified 
in document A/HRC/25/65. ISIS, a structured group, directs and organizes those acts of 
violence against civilians, evincing an organizational policy. While victims appear to be 
largely <i>hors de combat</i> fighters, the unlawful killings in Ar Raqqah governorate and in 
identified localities in Aleppo governorate form part of the attack. In perpetrating those 
killings, ISIS has committed the crime against humanity of murder. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Hostage-taking 
</b></p>
<p>39. Parties to the conflict continue to seize hostages, in violation of international 
humanitarian and criminal law. The majority of the victims are women and children. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>40. As Government forces sought to take control of restive areas in Rif Damascus, they 
detained female relatives of wanted men to force the men&#8217;s surrender. In February, the 
mother and sister of a wanted man were arrested in eastern Ghouta. Their photographs were 
sent with the message that the women would be killed unless he surrendered, which he did 
shortly thereafter. In April, two women, one of whom had recently given birth, were 
arrested in separate incidents at Al-Jorjanieh checkpoint on the road to Zabadani. Women 
were also taken as hostages in Hawsh Arab in April. In all those instances, ultimatums sent 
to their male relatives stated that, if the men failed to surrender to Government authorities, 
the women would be killed. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>41. Armed groups continue to hold hostages for extended periods. On 4 August 2013, 
groups, including Ahrar Al-Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra, abducted over 200 civilians during 
an operation on villages in eastern Latakia. On 23 September 2013, the Islamic Front 
kidnapped over 56 civilians from Zahra (Aleppo). In both instances, most hostages were 
women and children. While a small number of hostages in both cases have been released, 
the whereabouts of the majority remain unknown. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b>42. On 29 May, ISIS fighters in Minbij abducted 153 Kurdish schoolboys, aged 13 and 
14 years old, as they returned to Ayn al-Arab from Aleppo city, where they had taken their 
year-end examinations. Five boys escaped and 15 were released on 28 June, reportedly as 
part of a prisoner exchange for three ISIS fighters held by YPG. The 133 remaining 
hostages are in ISIS-controlled territory. Negotiations for a prisoner exchange with YPG 
are said to be ongoing. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Unknown perpetrators 
</b>43. In December 2013, a pattern of holding hostages for ransom was documented in 
Damascus. In all cases, armed men abducted the hostages. It is unclear whether the 
perpetrators were armed groups or criminal gangs using the conflict for self-enrichment. </p>


<p>44. There have been several abductions where no ransom demands have been made. 
Among those are the abductions of four human rights activists, Razan Zeitouneh, Wael 
Hamada, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi, kidnapped from their office in Douma (Rif 
Damascus) in December 2013. Their fate and whereabouts remain unknown. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Enforced disappearance  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>45. Checkpoints, pervasive and inescapable, continue to instil fear in Syrians. Numerous 
accounts of enforced disappearance were documented, particularly in the towns of 
Yabroud, Beit Saber, Zakiyeh, Adra and eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus). In January, 
soldiers arrested a man on his way to work from Al-Ghizlaniyah (Damascus). He remains 
unaccounted for, despite his wife&#8217;s attempts to locate him. Fear of checkpoints prompted 
some to opt for longer and more difficult routes. Many stated that they were so frightened 
that they had become prisoners in their own homes.  
</p>
<p>46. Government forces engaged in mass arrest campaigns leading to the enforced 
disappearance of fighting-age men in areas that fell under their control. That trend was 
observed following the truces in Assal al-Ward in April and the city of Homs in May, and 
following the taking of Yabroud in March. 
</p>
<p>47. Families are often too afraid to approach the authorities to inquire about the 
whereabouts of their relatives. Those who inquired faced a systematic refusal to disclose 
information about the fate of the disappeared. Others were confronted with administrative 
hurdles seemingly aimed at deterring them from searching further. A woman, whose 
husband disappeared in May 2013 in Kaswa (Damascus) relentlessly inquired about him at 
the local police station and various security branches in Kafr Sousa (Damascus), to no 
avail. In March, she went to the Palace of Justice in Damascus, where she filled in a form. 
She was asked to return 40 days later to verify whether her husband&#8217;s name featured on a 
list of missing persons displayed in the premises of the tribunal. When she returned, her 
spouse&#8217;s name was not listed. He remains unaccounted for.  
</p>
<p>48. In some instances, families were merely notified of the death of their relatives, 
without being informed of the circumstances and cause of death, or the location of the 
remains. In March, Government officials informed a family that their relative, who had 
disappeared in April 2013 in Damascus, had died of a heart attack. When they attempted to 
obtain a copy of his identity card at the Military Police branch, their interlocutors denied 
having information about him. 
</p>
<p>49. Although it is men who are predominantly disappeared, the impact on women is 
severe and lasting. Women face specific hardships in rebuilding their lives and caring for 
their families in the absence of the main breadwinners.  
</p>
<p>50. Enforced disappearances formed part of the attack referred to in paragraph 28 above, 
and constitute a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b></p>
<p>51. Reports of persons being disappeared while in ISIS-controlled territory have 
increased. One such person is a Jesuit priest, Father Paolo Dall&#8217;Oglio, who disappeared in 
Ar Raqqah city on 28 January. ISIS is adopting practices that may lead to acts tantamount 
to enforced disappearance, in breach of its obligations under international humanitarian 
law. Forming part of the attack identified in paragraph 38 above, their practices constitute a 
crime against humanity. </p>


<p><b> D. Torture and ill-treatment  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>52. Government officials continue to commit torture and other forms of ill-treatment at 
intelligence agencies and in prisons and military hospitals, subjecting tens of thousands of 
victims to unimaginable suffering. Most are civilians initially held at checkpoints or during 
military incursions. While the majority of accounts concerned male detainees, there were 
increased reports of female detainees suffering abuse in government custody. The 
frequency, duration and severity of the torture suggest that victims are likely to suffer long-
term damage to their psychological as well as physical well-being.  
</p>
<p>53. Widespread and systematic use of torture was documented in multiple facilities in 
Damascus, including Mezzeh airport detention facility, Military Security Branch 215, 
Military Security Branch 235 (also known as Palestine branch), Military Security Branch 
227, Damascus Political Security Branch, Adra prison, Harasta Air Force Intelligence 
branch and Harasta Military Hospital.  
</p>
<p>54. In January, a man was arrested at a checkpoint in eastern Dara&#8217;a and taken to 
Mezzeh, where he remained for four months. He suffered daily beatings. Cellmates were 
beaten and burned with cigarettes. He was released without appearing in court. In February, 
a man, arrested at a checkpoint between Dara&#8217;a and Damascus, was taken to Mezzeh 
detention facility where intelligence agents beat him until he lost consciousness. In April, a 
man detained at Mezzeh detention facility was beaten with fists and a pipe and suspended 
from the ceiling by his wrists. He heard other detainees, including females, being beaten. 
He was forced to place his thumbprint on a confession and appeared unrepresented before a 
judge, before being released.  
</p><p>55. A detainee, released in 2014 after being held for over two years in Al-Ghirz prison 
(Dara&#8217;a), chronicled severe beatings with hoses and sticks and being starved. He is now 
partially paralysed; medical records document damage to his spinal cord.  
</p>
<p>56. Accounts of torture committed between 2011 and 2013 were collected by the 
commission, bolstering its previous findings of the crime against humanity of torture. In 
late 2013, a woman was arrested at a checkpoint in Jaramana (Damascus) and taken to 
Mezzeh detention facility. During interrogations, government officials hung her from the 
ceiling by her wrists and beat her on the head, body and soles of her feet. Scars are still 
visible. Another woman, a defector, held in Military Security Branch 235 in late 2012, was 
beaten until she was &#8220;swimming in blood&#8221;. She was hung from the ceiling by her wrists for 
hours. She heard other detainees screaming during interrogations. 
</p>
<p>57. The methods of torture used by the Government include severe beatings about the 
head and body and on the soles of the feet and prolonged hanging by the wrists from the 
ceiling or wall. There has been marked use of electrocution. Victims&#8217; physical injuries were 
consistent with a pattern of torture.  
</p>
<p>58. There has been a rise in reported deaths in custody. 
</p>
<p>59. Conditions of detention were characterized by a lack of food, water, space, sleep, 
hygiene and medical care and denial of life-saving medicine. Such conditions led to the 
death of detainees. Most detainees reported a severe lack of food, with some losing as much 
as half their body weight while detained. Such conditions of detention constitute cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>60. Government forces have perpetrated torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed 
against a civilian population, indicating the existence of a State policy. Torture and other </p>


<p>inhumane acts as crimes against humanity, as well as war crimes, continue to be committed 
by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>61. Civilians from Nubl and Zahra (Aleppo), taken hostage by armed groups &#8212; 
including the Islamic Front and Jabhat al-Nusra &#8212; on 23 September 2013, suffered 
beatings while being held. Hostages were divided into different groups, with at least one 
group held in cold, damp conditions and provided with inadequate food. 
</p>
<p>62. On or around 9 April, unidentified armed groups advanced through Al-Zahra 
neighbourhood of Aleppo city. Residents were assaulted by fighters. One was beaten so 
badly on the soles of his feet that he was unable to walk for days. 
</p>
<p>63. Journalists, abducted in mid-2013 and released in 2014, suffered physical abuse at 
the hands of members of unidentified armed groups, some of whom appeared to be foreign 
fighters. One journalist was beaten on the soles of his feet  and on his upper body, and was 
suspended by his wrists for several hours. Others were also severely beaten.  
</p>
<p>64. Armed groups have committed the war crime of torture and cruel treatment. The 
conditions of detention that hostages were held under constitute cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b>65. Public squares have become the scene of amputations, lashings and mock 
crucifixion in Ar Raqqah governorate, as well as in Minbij (Aleppo).   
66. In May, ISIS fighters dragged a man to Khodra square in Ar Raqqah city and 
amputated one of his hands as a punishment for theft. The amputation was improperly 
performed, causing immense suffering to the man and distress to the crowd who had been 
urged to watch.  
</p>
<p>67. Men have been lashed for smoking, possessing alcohol, trading during hours of 
prayer and failing to fast during Ramadan. In May, men were lashed publicly in El-Naim 
square in Ar Raqqah city, which lacerated their backs. Men were flogged for publicly 
accompanying an &#8220;improperly dressed&#8221; female relative. On 24 April in Ar Raqqah city, a 
man was beaten publicly after he and his wife were stopped by ISIS fighters because his 
wife&#8217;s face was uncovered. In some cases, victims were tied to a wooden board or crucifix 
and displayed publicly in the squares before being lashed. 
</p>
<p>68. Multiple accounts were received of women who had appeared in public with their 
faces uncovered being beaten with sticks by patrolling ISIS fighters. Women were publicly 
lashed on 26 and 30 April in Ar Raqqah city for failing to adhere to ISIS dress code 
regulations. Female members of ISIS sometimes administered the lashings. 
</p>
<p>69. ISIS fighters beat those held in its detention centres in Ar Raqqah and Aleppo 
governorates during interrogations. Beatings included whipping detainees with cables. 
Former detainees in ISIS detention facilities in Ar Raqqah governorate reported being held 
in overcrowded, insect-infested cells. The cells had neither light nor bedding. Detainees 
received inadequate food and were not permitted to communicate with anyone outside the 
facility. 
</p>
<p>70. According to ISIS, the use of corporal punishment &#8212; amputation and lashing &#8212; is 
based on religious law. Investigations are ongoing regarding the operations of sharia courts 
and the due process rights afforded to defendants. The use of such punishments has been </p>


<p>found to constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment by the Human 
Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture.  
</p>
<p>71. ISIS, by whipping detainees and hostages in its custody, has committed torture in 
violation of its binding obligations under common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The 
conditions of detention recorded constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>72. ISIS punishments involving amputations and beating people until they are bloody or 
scarred rise to the level of torture and amount to mutilation. The public nature of the 
punishments, including the display of persons on crucifixes, constitutes cruel and degrading 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>73. ISIS inflicts severe physical or mental pain or suffering on civilian populations in 
areas under its control, a continuation of the previously identified widespread and 
systematic attack on the civilian population. The rise in torture and the cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment of the civilian population in Ar Raqqah governorate further attests to 
that continuing attack. Torture has also been committed systematically against captured 
Free Syrian Army (FSA) and YPG fighters.  
</p><p>74. ISIS has committed war crimes of torture and cruel treatment. Their conduct 
forming part of the attack identified in paragraph 38 above, ISIS has committed crimes 
against humanity of torture and other inhumane acts in Ar Raqqah and Aleppo 
governorates. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>75. Underreporting and delayed reports of sexual violence have made an assessment of 
its magnitude difficult. In interviews with female refugees, fear of rape is often cited as a 
major factor in their decision to leave the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>76. Reports of rape and sexual assaults of women at detention facilities in Damascus, 
dating from 2012 to the present, continue to be received. In January 2013, a woman who 
was threatened with rape stated that other female detainees had been sexually assaulted in 
Mezzeh detention facility. In October 2013, another detainee in the same centre reported 
being forced to strip, being sexually assaulted and threatened with rape. A similar pattern of 
sexual violence was documented at Military Security Branch 215 and General Security 
Directorate Branch 251. In January 2014, a male government interrogator at Adra prison 
touched the breasts of a female detainee and inserted his fingers into her vagina. Female 
detainees were forced to strip naked and were threatened either with rape or with being 
displayed to male inmates. Girls as young as 13, held with adult female detainees, suffered 
sexual assault by detention officers.  
</p>
<p>77. Government forces have perpetrated rape as a war crime. Forming part of the attack 
referred to in paragraph 28 above, that conduct also constitutes a crime against humanity. In 
its sexual assaults, the Government has committed the war crime of outrages on personal 
dignity. 
</p>
<p>78. Gender-based violence, directed at women and men, continues to be documented. 
Government forces, notably in Rif Damascus and Dara&#8217;a governorates, arrest and detain 
women to force the surrender of their male relatives. Men and boys over the age of 12 years 
continue to be targeted on the basis of their gender. Arrests of men and boys at checkpoints 
ringing restive areas are commonplace, with the consequence that male civilians inside </p>


<p>those areas are unable to leave, even to seek food or medical treatment, and are unable to 
flee the areas when they come under attack. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>79. Armed groups belonging to the Islamic Front, Ahrar Al-Sham, and Jabhat al-Nusra, 
have targeted women and children, on the basis of their gender, to be taken as hostages for 
use in prisoner exchanges. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b>80. In Ar Raqqah governorate, women who appeared in public with their face and hair 
uncovered were lashed. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Impact of the conflict 
</b></p>
<p>81. Since Syrian men are unable to move around the country for fear of arrest at 
checkpoints, women are responsible for travelling between areas to seek food, medicine 
and, increasingly, work. Unaccompanied by men, they are vulnerable to physical assaults 
and are at risk of arrest or abduction by Government forces and by anti-Government armed 
groups. 
</p>
<p>82. Lack of access to medical care has affected the prenatal and postnatal health of 
women and their children. Women in labour have not been allowed through government 
checkpoints and have been forced to give birth under often dangerous circumstances. In 
areas under siege, women have given birth in unsterile conditions and without pain 
medication.  
</p>
<p>83.  Syrian men are often absent, because they are fighting, detained or have been 
disappeared or killed, forcing women to become the primary caretakers of their families. 
Given the limited employment available, both inside the Syrian Arab Republic and in 
refugee camps, women are struggling to support their families economically. With Syrian 
women isolated and under immense strain, reports of depression among them have 
skyrocketed. One woman, pregnant and with a one-year old son, fled Aleppo after the 
disappearance of her husband and the deaths of her parents in a shelling attack. Unable to 
find relatives able to take her and her son in and without the possibility of a stable job, she 
said all she could do was &#8220;cry, weep and rely on God&#8221;. Her situation is, tragically, 
increasingly common. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Violations of children&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>84. The war in the Syrian Arab Republic has taken a devastating toll on children&#8217;s lives. 
Children have been killed, injured and maimed, suffering the direct consequences of the 
indiscriminate violence of Government forces. They have also been affected by 
displacement, loss of relatives and the trauma of witnessing acts of violence.  
</p>
<p>85. Popular Committees operating in Aleppo city have recruited and used children as 
messengers, spies and guards. A member of an anti-Government armed group stated that 
16- and 17-year-old armed pro-Government fighters had been captured during military 
assaults. Multiple accounts from Aleppo describe children aged between 6 and 13 used by 
Government forces as part of coordinated military operations to locate armed group fighters 
prior to attack. Children were paid to act as informants, which exposes them to retaliation </p>


<p>and punishment. One armed group fighter stated that children caught performing 
reconnaissance for Government forces would be detained indefinitely as a security 
measure. International humanitarian and human rights law prohibits the use of children in 
combat and support roles. Conscripting or enlisting children under 15, including for support 
roles, is a war crime.   
</p>
<p>86. Schools across the Syrian Arab Republic have been converted to shelters for 
internally displaced persons. In several instances, such schools were attacked in 
government airstrikes, which caused extensive damage to their infrastructure.5  
</p>
<p>87. In Aleppo, Damascus and Dara&#8217;a, regular armed forces use schools for military 
purposes, depriving children of education and exposing educational facilities to attack. The 
Saleh Jemel primary school in Al-Sabeel (Aleppo) is used as a military barracks and firing 
post. The school and the surrounding area are regularly shelled. In May 2013, army tanks 
were positioned near a school in Beit Saber (Damascus). As a result, the school closed. 
Students in the area remain without educational alternatives. A girl from Dara&#8217;a city stated 
that most schools in Dara&#8217;a were no longer operational because they had been occupied by 
Government forces and surrounded by snipers.  
</p>
<p>88. Schools have increasingly come under fire during aerial bombardment campaigns in 
Dara&#8217;a and Aleppo.6 In January, Government forces shelled two schools in Dael (Dara&#8217;a). 
In April during the examination period for the second semester, Khawla Bint al-Azwar 
School in Al-Arbaeen neighbourhood in Dara&#8217;a city was hit by barrel bombs. In April and 
June, two aerial artillery attacks on primary schools in Dael and Namer (Dara&#8217;a) were 
recorded. Parents in Damascus, Aleppo and Dara&#8217;a stated they did not allow their children 
to attend classes because schools had become &#8220;too dangerous&#8221;. According to the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), more than half of Syrian school-age children, over 2.8 
million, are out of school as a consequence of the occupation, destruction and insecurity of 
schools.  
</p>
<p>89. Protracted intense hostilities and bombardment have left a deep mark on children. 
Parents of children from Houlah (Homs) described how after three years of violence, &#8220;our 
children start shouting and hiding when they see an airplane&#8221;. Families that fled Zakiyeh 
(Damascus) in April relayed that, after surviving a period of continuous shelling, children 
were distressed by loud noises and experienced incontinence, anxiety and panic attacks. A 
man who fled Qudsaya (Damascus) in March stated that his children&#8217;s games were based 
on what they had witnessed and learned from the war. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>90. Islamic Front-affiliated and other armed groups have recruited, trained and used 
children in active combat roles. Fighters operating in Aleppo governorate acknowledged 
that their ranks contained children under the age of 18. Younger members are assigned non-
combat roles, such as those of guard and lookouts. Once children take on combat roles, they 
are &#8220;generally seen as adults&#8221;. A fighter who joined Amar ibn al-Aas Brigade in northern 
Aleppo at the age of 15 spoke of being given the task of cleaning weapons and of 
subsequently participating in combat. His 15-year-old cousin received weapons training 
from Jaish al Mujahideen in 2014. Another fighter in Aleppo explained that children who 
initially were not permitted to use guns, use them now as &#8220;children are not children 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5 
 See annex IV. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6 
 See annex IV. </p>


<p>anymore&#8221;. Doctors working in field hospitals in Aleppo regularly treat minors injured in 
combat.  
</p>
<p>91. Parents explained that children in Al-Sukkari neighbourhood, Aleppo city, who 
joined armed group battalions around the age of 15 were motivated by poverty and 
desperation. Some armed groups actively recruit children. A fighter from the Al-Abbas 
battalion operating in Al-Haydaria (Aleppo) explained, &#8220;often young boys are braver and 
cleverer than adult fighters&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>92. Anti-Government armed groups also used children in a variety of unarmed roles, 
including as cooks, informants, first responders and porters. Fighters stated that children 
who were caught acting as informants were often killed or detained by Government forces. 
Armed groups have violated the prohibition on recruitment and use of children under 18 as 
fighters and in support roles. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict bans armed groups from recruiting 
or using children under 18 in direct hostilities. By conscripting or enlisting children under 
15, including for support roles, the groups have committed a war crime. 
</p>
<p>93. Armed groups&#8217; use of schools for military purposes has endangered children and led 
to their injury and death. Ahrar Al-Sham continued to occupy the Al-Thawra Elementary 
School in Al-Sukkari, Aleppo city, which has been closed since the group took control of 
the building. That deprives children of access to education and endangers the educational 
facility. Ansar Al-Aqida uses a building that is part of the same school complex as Ain 
Jalout School, as a barracks for 50 fighters.7 
</p>
<p>94. There was a clear pattern of targeting schoolyards.8 Al-Thaqafi School on 19 March 
and Al-Manar Armenian School were targeted on 15 April. Children from areas in 
Damascus repeatedly shelled by anti-Government armed groups exhibited nervousness, 
anxiety and clear signs of distress and trauma. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b>95. ISIS has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles under the 
guise of education. According to an account about an ISIS training camp in Al-Bab 
(Aleppo), ISIS actively recruited children from the ages of 14 or 15 to undergo the same 
training as adults, offering financial rewards. At the camps, the children recruited received 
weapons training and religious education. The existence of such camps seems to indicate 
that ISIS systematically provides weapons training for children. Subsequently, they were 
deployed in active combat during military operations, including suicide-bombing missions. 
In Ar Raqqah, children from the age of 10 are recruited and trained at ISIS camps. In the 
recruitment and use of children under 18, ISIS has violated international humanitarian and 
human rights law. In using children below the age of 15, the group has committed a war 
crime.  
</p>
<p>96. The spread of ISIS across the north of the Syrian Arab Republic has significantly 
affected the presence and operations of humanitarian agencies and actors. A mother who 
used to live in Jandaris (Aleppo) explained that, owing to attacks by ISIS, vaccination 
campaigns had ceased. Without access to medical care, she had fled the Syrian Arab 
Republic, concerned for the health of her children.

<p>7
  See annex IV. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8  See annex IV. </p>


<p><b> (c) Kurdish armed groups 
</b>97. Instances of recruitment of children under the age of 18 by YPG were documented 
in document A/HRC/25/65. Pursuant to their pledge on 5 July to abolish such practices, 
YPG have demobilized child soldiers from their ranks and undertaken to monitor adherence 
to their commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations concerning the conduct of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Unlawful attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>98. Government forces have systematically targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure, 
demonstrating the intent to kill, wound and maim. Targets have included markets, shops, 
hospitals, schools, places of worship and public spaces where civilians gather in large 
numbers. The apparent objective of the Government&#8217;s military operations is to render life 
unbearable in areas out of its control.  
</p>
<p>99. In addition to incrementally employing local and foreign irregular forces, the 
Government has relied on highly destructive firepower. The military has escalated its 
tactics, techniques and procedures in combating armed groups, progressively introducing 
heavy artillery, air force combat assets, including vacuum and barrel bombs, and ballistic 
missiles. Lacking sufficient manpower and mobility to conduct ground offensives on all 
fronts, Government forces have adopted a strategy that uses minimal manpower in favour 
of heavy bombardment during offensive and defensive operations.  
</p>
<p>100. During offensives on Qalamoun (Rif Damascus) between February and April, 
Government forces relied on superior weaponry, subjecting armed group-held areas to 
sustained indiscriminate aerial and ground bombardment in preparation for ground assaults. 
Consistent accounts from civilians who fled towns in Qalamoun described how the shelling 
followed them as they were displaced towards the border. Thousands of civilians fled by 
car and on foot, from Rankus to Hawsh Arab to Ain Al-Jaouza to Assal al-Ward. The 
assault on Yabroud, which culminated with Government forces entering the city on 16 
March, involved indiscriminate shelling by the 18th Brigade stationed at Nabak, the 155th 
Missile Regiment and the 67th Brigade. Fighter jets and helicopters fired air-to-surface 
missiles, vacuum bombs and barrel bombs on the town, often in consecutive attacks aiming 
at areas where civilians gathered in large numbers, such as funeral processions.  
</p>
<p>101. Since its onset in December 2013, the military campaign on Aleppo has had a 
devastating human cost. Rather than targeting the military capabilities of specific armed 
groups and facilities, the Government&#8217;s airstrikes and ground shelling have mostly targeted 
towns and neighbourhoods over which armed groups gained control, such as Al-
Mouwassalat, Myasser, Al-Sha&#8217;ar, Qadi Askar, Al-Maadi, Al-Sakhour and Masakin 
Hanano in eastern Aleppo and Al-Sukkari, Al-Zabedia, Sayf al-Dawala, Jisr al-Haj, Al-
Ansari al-Sharqi, and Al-Kallasa. The timing and duration of the attacks, the choice of 
weapons and the locations targeted, such as markets, intersections, schools and hospitals, 
demonstrate intent to cause maximum civilian casualties. The ongoing aerial assault on 
Aleppo has caused immeasurable suffering and loss of life. According to medical 
personnel, most victims of barrel bombs had multiple wounds and experienced burns, loss 
of eyesight and peripheral vascular injuries from blunt trauma to extremities, often leading 
to amputations.  
</p>
<p>102. Government forces increasingly relied on barrel bombs to reduce the cost of a 
protracted aerial campaign and expand the fleet of aircraft used in assault operations to </p>


<p>include transport helicopters. Barrel bombs are highly imprecise, with an extensive impact 
zone. Flying at high altitudes further reduces their accuracy. The use of barrel bombs in that 
manner is indiscriminate. In areas where armed group fighters were present, Government 
forces treated clearly separate and distinct military objectives located in densely populated 
areas with high concentrations of civilians as a single military objective. Repeatedly, the 
incidental loss of lives was excessive to the direct military advantage that could have been 
anticipated to result from attacks on military objects. Such disproportionate attacks have 
had a paralysing effect on the population and had led to mass displacement. The use of 
barrel bombs in that context amounts to area bombardment, prohibited under international 
humanitarian law as a tactic that spreads terror among the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>103. When defending areas in which ground troops could not be deployed, Government 
forces used aerial bombardment to reinforce control around major positions and lines of 
communication to disrupt armed group advances. In Dayr az Zawr city, Ar Raqqah city, 
Idlib and in the Dara&#8217;a countryside, Government forces conducted airstrikes on opposition-
held localities and neighbourhoods between January and July in an indiscriminate manner. 
Government forces clearly and deliberately targeted civilians, residential neighbourhoods 
and areas with high concentration of internally displaced persons, resulting in extensive 
civilian deaths, scores of people maimed and hundreds of thousands displaced.  
</p>
<p>104. Where frontlines have stalled, the Government has employed a strategy of 
controlling the population, combining long-lasting sieges with continuous air and ground 
bombardment. In neighbourhoods around Damascus, including Yarmouk, Darayya, Babbila 
and Barzah, civilians were targeted on the basis of their perceived opposition to the 
Government. Merely living in or originating from those neighbourhoods led to targeting. 
The Government has carried out a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian 
population of Aleppo to punish and terrorize civilians for supporting or hosting armed 
groups, in an apparent strategy to erode popular support for those groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Anti-Government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>105. Anti-Government armed groups fire mortars, artillery guns and tanks towards 
government positions within residential areas, utilizing their limited firepower in an 
indiscriminate manner, causing civilian casualties. In April and May, anti-Government 
armed groups fired mortar shells and improvised gas-canister explosives at Al-Midan, Saif 
al-Dawla, Al-Sulimaniya neighbourhoods in western Aleppo, causing deaths and injuries. 
Between 17 and 20 April, over 50 civilians were killed in indiscriminate shelling.  
</p>
<p>106. Groups have intentionally targeted civilian localities either in retaliation for 
government operations or owing to those localities&#8217; perceived support of the Government. 
Nubl and Zahra (Aleppo) continue to be shelled, with improvised explosives increasing 
casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. Residents described being forced &#8220;to live in 
basements&#8221;. Jermana and Sayda Zeinab (Damascus) were indiscriminately shelled. Al-
Maliki, Sharq Tijara, Bab Tuma and Al-Shaghour neighbourhoods in Damascus city were 
shelled, with attacks often targeting children in schoolyards.  
</p>
<p>107. Jabhat al-Nusra and affiliated groups used suicide bombings and large-scale vehicle-
borne improvised explosive devices. Between 6 March and 24 June, Homs governorate, and 
in particular Homs city, was hit by multiple car bombings in government-controlled areas. 
Attacks which targeted civilians and resulted in four or more casualties are detailed in 
annex IV. On 24 June, a car bomb exploded on Beit al-Taweel street in Wadi al-Dahab 
neighbourhood, Homs city. It killed 2 civilians and injured 20 more. Such attacks, which 
have civilians as their primary target, demonstrate a clear intent to spread terror among the 
civilian population. </p>


<p>108. The use of suicide bombers has remained limited to ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, 
groups listed as terrorist entities on the list established and maintained by the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee with respect to individuals, groups, undertakings and other entities 
associated with Al-Qaida. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Specifically protected persons and objects</b>9 <b> 
 1. Government forces </b> </p>
<p>109. The health-care system has been severely affected in the course of military 
operations carried out by Government forces, as well as through a deliberate and systematic 
campaign to persecute medical staff treating anyone perceived to be opposing the 
Government. The prevention of access to health care continues to be used to punish and 
subdue civilians residing in armed group-held or contested areas.  
</p>
<p>110. Health-care infrastructure and medical facilities in restive areas have been damaged 
in hostilities and destroyed by targeted attacks. The flight of health-care professionals 
owing to fear of arrest, and the death and injury of medical staff have left armed group-
controlled areas without adequate medical care. The continued denial and removal of 
medical supplies from humanitarian aid deliveries and the collapse of the country&#8217;s 
pharmaceutical industry have further worsened the provision of medical care.  
</p>
<p>111. Attacks on medical personnel and facilities violate common article 3 of the Geneva 
Conventions and customary international humanitarian law and amount to war crimes. The 
frequency of attacks on medical facilities in opposition-controlled areas of Aleppo city and 
governorate is indicative of a deliberate policy. Government forces target health-care 
infrastructure with the apparent intention of depriving civilians and fighters injured in 
government offensives of medical treatment, increasing the loss of life and the number of 
persons maimed, wounded or killed. Humanitarian workers continue to be targeted in grave 
violation of international humanitarian law, hampering the operations of aid organizations. 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b></p>
<p>112. ISIS continues to detain medical personnel, violating customary humanitarian law 
prohibiting the punishment of persons for carrying out medical activities. The group has 
also occupied hospitals, notably in Aleppo. Using hospitals outside their humanitarian 
function prevents the impartial provision of medical treatment, endangers patients and 
medical professionals, and compromises the humanitarian function of medical facilities. 
That has a grave impact on the fulfilment of the obligation under common article 3 to care 
for the sick and wounded. Failing to respect the emblems of the Geneva Conventions 
undermines their protective purpose.  
</p>
<p>113. Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic Front fighters stationed near the Old City of Aleppo 
continue to fire improvised gas-canister explosives at the Citadel, targeting government 
snipers stationed within. On 8 May, Ahrar Al-Sham fighters remotely detonated explosives 
packed into a tunnel dug underneath the Citadel, allegedly used as a base for government 
soldiers. On 31 May, they detonated a similar tunnel bomb next to the Citadel. Repeated 
underground high-magnitude shockwaves have caused structural damage to the thirteenth 
century Citadel, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) World Heritage Site.

<p>114. The whereabouts of the Syriac Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Archbishops of 
Aleppo, Yohanna Ibrahim and Paul Yazigi, abducted in Aleppo in April 2013, and of 
Father Paolo Dall&#8217;Oglio, abducted in Ar Raqqah city in January, remain unknown. 
Journalists continue to be systematically targeted by ISIS. Some have been executed. 
Dozens, both foreign and Syrian, remain in captivity, detained and ill-treated because of 
their professional activities. Religious personnel and civilian journalists enjoy specific 
protection under international humanitarian law and must be respected and protected by all 
parties.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Use of illegal weapons 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>115. Government forces attacked civilian-inhabited areas in Idlib and Hama 
governorates: Kafr Zeita on 11, 12, 16 and 18 April, Al-Tamana&#8217;a on 12, 18 and 29 April 
and  Tal Minnis on 21 April 2014.  
</p>
<p>116. Witnesses saw helicopters drop barrel bombs and smelled a scent akin to domestic 
chlorine immediately following impact. Accounts of victims, and of medical personnel 
involved in administering treatment, provide descriptions of symptoms compatible with 
exposure to chemical agents, namely vomiting, eye and skin irritation, choking and other 
respiratory problems. 
</p>
<p>117. Chlorine gas is a chemical weapon as defined in the Convention on the Prohibition 
of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 
Destruction, of 1992. The use of chemical weapons is prohibited in all circumstances under 
customary international humanitarian law and is a war crime under the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>118. Reasonable grounds exist to believe that chemical agents, likely chlorine, were used 
on Kafr Zeita, Al-Tamana&#8217;a and Tal Minnis in eight incidents within a 10-day period in 
April. There are also reasonable grounds to believe that those agents were dropped in barrel 
bombs from government helicopters flying overhead.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Denial of economic, social and cultural rights and basic freedoms 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>119. Compounded by rising levels of poverty and desperation, the conflict has led to a 
partition of areas under Government and non-State armed group control. This has had 
significant consequences for civilians&#8217; ability to access basic services, including food, 
water, shelter, education and health care. Approximately 20 persons wounded in barrel 
bomb attacks in Dael (Dara&#8217;a) in mid-June were prevented by Government forces from 
accessing the nearest hospital in Dara&#8217;a city. During the government operation on Qatana 
(Rif Damascus) in February and March, Beit Saber was surrounded by roadblocks, 
electricity was cut off and shelling intensified. As the siege tightened, Government forces 
blocked the supply of food and gas.  
</p>
<p>120. Owing to ongoing violence and the deliberate obstruction of communication and 
transport routes, the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance to displaced 
persons and civilian residents in areas affected by conflict has been inadequate, particularly 
in Nawa, Inkhil and Jasem (Dara&#8217;a). In Nawa, the flow of food and medicine is impeded by 
the 61st Brigade.  
</p>
<p>121. Areas in Qalamoun (Rif Damascus), such as Yabroud and Rankus, were besieged 
prior to the government assault in March. Indiscriminate shelling and bombardment </p>


<p>followed. Also facing blockades of life-sustaining necessities, people fled towards the 
border. Government forces use the denial and obstruction of food and other items 
indispensable to the survival of the civilian population as a tool to clear restive areas and 
further military objectives.  
</p><p>122. In Yarmouk and eastern Ghouta (Damascus and Rif Damascus), Government forces 
continue to encircle 180,000 people, subjecting them to heavy shelling and obstructing the 
delivery of humanitarian aid. The siege on Yarmouk is imposed by Government forces 
including elements from Palestine Branch 235 and the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine. Checkpoints surrounding eastern Ghouta are manned by elite units, including the 
4th Division, Republican Guard and 3rd Division.  
</p>
<p>123. Sieges are imposed in a coordinated manner. Soldiers at checkpoints regularly 
conduct arbitrary arrests, confiscate food and other basic supplies, and prevent sick and 
wounded persons from seeking medical attention. Al-Waer, Houlah, Rastan and Talbisah in 
Homs remain besieged, with dire consequences for the people trapped within. The 
protracted denial of humanitarian aid, including food, has led to malnutrition and starvation. 
The use of starvation as a method of warfare is prohibited. Such acts violate core 
obligations with regard to the right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health and the right to life. 
</p>
<p>124. Across the Syrian Arab Republic, Government forces have refused to allow aid 
deliveries of essential medicines and surgical supplies. As an immediate consequence, field 
hospitals lack basic necessities and can offer only rudimentary medical treatment. Doctors 
and patients described the crude conditions and inadequate supplies and equipment in field 
hospitals in Aleppo city, Tafas (Dara&#8217;a), Kisweh and Zabadani (Rif Damascus). The sole 
hospital in Beit Jin (Rif Damascus), shelled by Government forces since March, is run by 
one doctor. In continuing a policy of denying medical care on the grounds that it may be 
used to treat injured combatants, Government authorities act in direct breach of binding 
international humanitarian law obligations to ensure that wounded and sick persons are 
collected and cared for, and to ensure the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian 
relief.  
</p>
<p>125. Violence has severely impaired civilians&#8217; freedom of movement, causing many to 
restrict their activities outside the home. Many women relayed the despair of being trapped 
indoors because of insecurity and fear of injury from indiscriminate bombardment. Men are 
fearful of travelling through checkpoints to access their workplaces and medical assistance 
owing to the  risk of detention and disappearance. Women and men in agricultural areas, 
such as Sahl Al-Ghab (Hama and Idlib) and Houlah (Homs) suffer without access to their 
livelihoods or sustenance.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>126. Armed groups, including the Islamic Front, Jaish al-Mujahideen and Jabhat al-Nusra 
continue to besiege Nubl and Zahra (Aleppo) and have cut off their electricity and water 
supply.  
</p>
<p>127. In April, essential infrastructure in Aleppo city was damaged in the course of 
hostilities. Between 5 and 14 May, the electrical grid and water supply were deliberately 
impaired by Jabhat al-Nusra, depriving civilians of access to potable water and sanitation. 
International humanitarian law prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering 
useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. Such acts violate the 
right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation. </p>


<p><b> (b) Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b>128. On 28 February, in the course of `their withdrawal from Azaz, ISIS fighters 
dismantled equipment and detonated explosives inside the Al-Faisal Flour Mill in northern 
Aleppo. Its destruction had a significant impact on the availability of flour. The deliberate 
destruction of food-producing infrastructure is unlawful under customary international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>129. In Aleppo and Ar Raqqah governorates, residents reported restrictions on basic 
rights and freedoms, including movement and assembly. The imposition of a strict 
interpretation of sharia law previously unseen in the Syrian Arab Republic, setting out 
regulations on all aspects of life from food to movement, employment and religious 
observance, has restricted basic freedoms, particularly for women.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Kurdish armed groups 
</b>130. Accounts from March describe how YPG distributed humanitarian aid in Qamishli 
(Al-Hasakah) exclusively to their supporters. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Arbitrary and forcible displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>131. The Government&#8217;s aerial bombardments and shelling of civilian-inhabited areas 
have caused extensive arbitrary displacement. In fear for their lives, people, mainly women 
and children, have fled to ever-dwindling secure areas inside the Syrian Arab Republic or 
have crossed its borders. Displacements occurred in Aleppo city and in Rif Damascus and 
Dara&#8217;a governorates. 
</p>
<p>132. By causing such large-scale displacement, the Government has failed in its 
obligations under international human rights law to protect civilians. It has also failed to 
comply with its duties under customary international humanitarian law to take all possible 
measures to provide displaced civilians with shelter, hygiene, health care, safety and 
nutrition and to ensure that family members are not separated. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</b></p>
<p>133. On 18 March, ISIS fighters entered Tal Akhder village (Ar Raqqah). Fighters used 
the mosque&#8217;s minarets to deliver an ultimatum to Kurdish residents to leave the village 
within two days or be killed. On 20 March, several hundred ISIS fighters returned and 
repeated the threat. Civilians fled in fear, carrying few possessions with them.  
</p>
<p>134. Some Kurdish civilians forcibly displaced from Tal Akhder suffered an earlier 
forcible displacement by ISIS from Tal Abyad in July 2013. 
</p>
<p>135. The ISIS order that civilians leave Tal Akhder cannot be justified on the grounds 
either of the security of the civilians involved or of military necessity. Such conduct 
amounts to the war crime of forcible displacement. Forming part of the attack referred to in 
paragraph 38 above, that conduct also constitutes a crime against humanity. </p>


<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>136. <b>The conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, once between the Government and a 
limited number of anti-Government armed groups, has morphed into multiple 
shifting conflicts involving countless actors and frontlines. Violence has bled over the 
borders of the Syrian Arab Republic, with extremism fuelling the conflict&#8217;s 
heightened brutality. The regional conflagration, of which the commission has long 
warned, illustrates the fallacy of a military solution.  
</b></p>
<p>137. <b>As fighting has engulfed civilian areas, the barest possibility of a normal life has 
been destroyed. The impact has been particularly grave for women and children, 
whose most basic rights are infringed by the conduct of the parties. 
</b></p>
<p>138. <b>Clashes resulting from competition for resources, such as natural gas, oil, 
electricity, water and agricultural land, have caused civilian deaths. Damage to 
infrastructure and to the energy supply have jeopardized the livelihoods of entire 
communities.  
</b></p>
<p>139. <b>Influential States have turned away from the difficult work required for a 
political solution. Some States continue to deliver shipments of arms, artillery and 
aircraft or contribute logistical and strategic assistance to the Government. Other 
States, organizations and individuals support armed groups with weapons and 
funding. The weapons they transfer to the warring parties in the Syrian Arab 
Republic are used in the perpetration of war crimes, crimes against humanity and 
violations of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>140.  <b>Recent events emphasize the urgency of finding a political settlement to the 
war. Accountability forms an essential part of the process. As the Security Council 
recognized in its resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014), the protection of civilians is 
pivotal and victims of violations deserve effective redress.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>141.<b> The commission of inquiry reiterates the recommendations made in its previous 
reports. Further, it makes the recommendations set out below.  
</b></p>
<p>142.<b> The commission of inquiry recommends that all parties: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)  Comply comprehensively with human rights and international 
humanitarian law, and ensure that material support for individuals and groups is 
consistent with these bodies of law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure the effective implementation of  Security Council resolutions 
2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014) (and other relevant presidential statements and 
resolutions) on humanitarian access and assistance; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Promote the understanding of religious law and ensure that its 
interpretation and application avoid violence and  uphold human rights, especially the 
rights of women and children, without discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Counter extremist groups and their actions by addressing the 
environment giving rise to extremism; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that those who have committed or are otherwise responsible for 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are brought to justice, </b></p>


<p><b>as underlined in Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014) (and other 
relevant presidential statements and resolutions); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Increase substantially efforts to protect civilians and their freedom of 
movement;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure the protection of human rights defenders and humanitarian 
workers. 
</b></p>
<p>143. <b>The commission recommends that the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Cease using illegal and indiscriminate weaponry; 
(b) Allow full and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014); 
(c) Allow the commission access to the country; 
(d) Allow human rights monitors and groups access to the country and take 
</b></p>
<p><b>the necessary measures to ensure their protection. 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>144.<b> It also recommends that  non-State armed groups: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Comply effectively with Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) and 
2165 (2014); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Reject violent means in relation to the application of religious law, with 
due respect for a diversity of religious groups and practices. 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>145.<b> It further recommends that  influential States work in concert to put pressure 
on the parties to end the violence and to initiate inclusive negotiations for a 
sustainable political transition process in the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>146.<b> The commission recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Impose an arms embargo and curb the proliferation and supply of 
weapons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Sustain funding for humanitarian operations, ensure access to victims in 
all areas and facilitate the expansion of  humanitarian relief operations. 
</b></p>
<p>147. <b>It also recommends that  the Human Rights Council support the 
recommendations made, including by transmitting the present report to the 
Secretary-General for the attention of the Security Council in order that appropriate 
action may be taken, and through a formal reporting process to the General Assembly 
and to the Security Council. 
</b></p>
<p>148. <b>The commission recommends that the Security Council:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Support the recommendations of the commission; 
(b) Take appropriate action by referring the situation to justice, possibly to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that, in the context of the Syrian 
Arab Republic, only the Security Council is competent to refer the situation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Enhance the enforcement and implementation of international human 
rights and humanitarian law through the range of powers and measures at its 
disposal, as part of the imperative of accountability, pertaining to all actors. </b></p>

<p> </p>


<p><b>Annex II</b><i>  
[English only]<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p><b>  Political context 
</b></p>
<p>1. Despite the efforts of the previous Joint Special Representative (JSR) Lakhdar 
Brahimi, a political stalemate continued to impede progress towards a negotiated solution.   
The Geneva 2 talks, which took place between 22 and 31 January 2014, failed to bridge the 
diametrically opposed positions of the Government and the National Coalition for 
Revolutionary and Opposition Forces (the Coalition). The Government continued to 
prioritise the fight against terrorism while the Coalition demanded immediate engagement 
on modalities for the transitional period. Brahimi&#8217;s official resignation on 13 May has 
further complicated the prospect of bringing the parties back to the negotiating table. On 10 
July, Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon appointed Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura in a bid 
to revive the political process. 
</p>
<p>2. The likelihood of a political solution was further weakened by the results of the 
Syrian presidential elections held on 3 June, with President Assad reportedly winning 88% 
of the vote, and the gradual yet consistent military gains made by Government forces in 
certain areas. The Government has become politically and militarily entrenched and is, 
consequently, less likely to engage in a political process. The Coalition had categorically 
rejected the elections while President Assad portrayed them as a measure of legitimacy. 
The presidential inauguration on 16 July drew further regional and international criticism, 
including from the EU and the US. Russia and Iran stressed that the election results have 
reinforced President Assad&#8217;s authority and reflected his popular base of support. 
</p>
<p>3. The Coalition continued to suffer from internal divisions. Against the backdrop of 
competing interests of regional and international actors which provide military and 
financial support, divisions were particularly evident in the lead-up to the election of its 
current president, Hadi al-Bahra, on 9 July. While still representing the largest political 
umbrella for the Syrian opposition abroad, the Coalition continues to struggle to establish 
reliable links with local military councils and other, predominantly Islamist, forces inside 
the Syrian Arab Republic. Recent conflicts within the Coalition&#8217;s Supreme Military 
Council &#8211; intended to represent various &#8216;moderate&#8217; military factions &#8211; are symptomatic of 
this disconnect. 
</p>
<p>4. Influential states continue to provide financial and military support to the various 
warring parties in the Syrian Arab Republic, reinforcing the existing political and military 
impasse. Significant changes in the conflict dynamics, however, have altered the regional 
and international approach towards the Syrian conflict. The emergence of ISIS as a potent 
military force, both in the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, has increased States&#8217; caution, 
particularly in terms of supplying military aid to armed groups. Fears have arisen that any 
supplied weapons may be used by ISIS. The continued military and political fragmentation 
of the opposition has markedly reduced its overall effectiveness and compromised the trust 
of its regional and international backers.  
</p>
<p>5. With ISIS representing a regional and international threat, many States have shifted 
their priorities towards limiting its influence and preventing any potential spillover.  
Fighting extremism has become a common cause for States with otherwise conflicting 
interests, potentially signalling further changes in Governments&#8217; policies towards the 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>6. The Security Council issued resolution 2165 (2014) on humanitarian cross-border 
aid on 15 July. Despite consensus on the grave violations being committed inside the Syrian </p>


<p>Arab Republic, the Security Council to was unable to ensure implementation of its own call 
for accountability in resolution 2139 (2014), failing to refer the situation to the International 
Criminal Court. This impasse must be replaced by a genuine political will to bring the 
parties back to the negotiating table with the participation of all Syrian political actors. 
</p>
<p><b> </b></p>


<p><b>Annex III 
</b><i>[English only]<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p><b>  Humanitarian context 
</b></p>
<p>1. With 6.5 million internally displaced persons and 2.9 million registered refugees, 
Syria has become the world&#8217;s worst humanitarian catastrophe. According to UN agencies, 
10.8 million Syrians are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance inside the country, 
241,000 people still live under siege and 4.7 million reside in hard-to-reach areas. Despite 
the passing of resolution 2139 (2014), insecurity, hostilities and administrative restrictions 
continue to prevent humanitarian access to a growing number of locations. The level of 
obstruction to the delivery of aid by all warring parties was qualified as &#8220;inhuman&#8221; by 
OCHA&#8217;s Under-Secretary-General Valerie Amos.  
</p>
<p>2. Areas considered safe havens by families forced into repeated displacements came 
under attack. In June, the shelling of a camp of internally displaced persons in Ash-
Shajarah, Dara&#8217;a, resulted in dozens of casualties.   
</p><p>3. The ever-growing influx of refugees into Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq has 
heightened tensions between Syrians and their host communities, threatening the security of 
the entire region. Cases of forcible returns and denial of access are on the rise. Palestinian 
refugees seeking safety in neighbouring countries are particularly affected by these factors.  
</p>
<p>4. Syrian women and children form the vast majority of refugee and internally 
displaced communities. The social and economic impact of the conflict has placed them at 
increased risk of abuse and exploitation. Child marriages and sexual violence emerged as 
prominent issues in refugee camps, with devastating consequences on the education and 
health of Syrian girls.  
</p>
<p>5. Despite immeasurable operational challenges and deliberate attacks against them, 
humanitarian agencies and NGOs continued to provide life-saving assistance to Syrians in 
need, including through polio vaccination campaigns, water sanitation programmes and 
medical items distributions throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>6. The unanimous adoption of resolution 2165 (2014) authorising the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance across borders via Turkey, Jordan and Iraq is a very important step 
forward. The first convoy from Turkey through the Bab Al-Salam crossing took place on 24 
July, without any reported incident. The resolution potentially opens up direct routes to 
approximately three million people caught in the conflict. </p>


<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only]<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p><b>  Specific mandate on massacres 
</b>1. Acting upon the request of the Human Rights Council to investigate all massacres,10 
the commission adopted the following working definition of massacre:  
</p>
<p>An intentional mass killing of civilians not directly participating in hostilities, or 
<i>hors de combat</i> fighters, by organized armed forces or groups in a single 
incident, in violation of international human rights or humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>2. Massacres include multiple instances of the war crime of murder, the war crime of 
sentencing or execution without due process and the war crime of attacking civilians, 
perpetrated in the context of and associated with the ongoing non-international armed 
conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic. When murder is committed as part of a widespread or 
systematic attack directed against a civilian population, perpetrated pursuant to or in 
furtherance of a State or organizational policy, the commission of massacres may amount to 
the crime against humanity of murder. 
</p>
<p>3. While the majority of civilian casualties resulted from indiscriminate or 
disproportionate attacks, primarily aerial bombardments, these killings do not fall within 
the definition of a massacre. Where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the 
shelling, bombardments or bombings intentionally targeted civilians, such attacks fall 
within the definition and are detailed below.  
</p>
<p>4. Given the lack of access, special mandate to investigate massacres and delay in 
reporting, massacres perpetrated outside of the reporting period are also documented. 
</p>
<p><b>

<p><b>1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p><i>Damascus governorate <b></b></i><b> </b> </p>
<p><b>Beit Saham, Rif Damascus, 14 and 18 December 2013 
</b></p>
<p>5. In December 2013, a negotiation aimed at opening roads for food and medicine and 
to allow civilians to leave took place between Government forces and the local committee 
of Beit Saham. On the understanding that the negotiation had been successful, civilians 
attempted to leave on 14 December. Government forces opened fire on the civilians, killing 
approximately 15 and forcing survivors back into the besieged area. On 18 December, 
several hundred civilians from Beit Saham and other towns in eastern Ghouta, in desperate 
need of food and understanding that an agreement had been reached, again attempted to 
leave. While there are reasonable grounds to believe that some armed fighters were 
accompanying them, the convoy was overwhelmingly civilian. Government forces again 
opened fire, killing at least 30 civilians and wounding many others. 
</p>
<p><b>Hay Al-Qaa, Rif Damascus, early March 2014

<p>bodies from the rubble stated that all the victims were civilians and that there was no 
presence of armed fighters in the area. A resident stated that &#8220;if they wanted to hit a house, 
they would destroy the whole neighbourhood,&#8221; suggesting a punitive element to the attacks. 
</p>
<p><b>Hawsh Arab, Rif Damascus, late March 2014 
</b></p>
<p>7. In late March, a helicopter dropped a barrel bomb on a house in Hawsh Arab, 
causing its total destruction and killing two women and four children. According to 
surviving relatives, there were no armed group fighters present in the house or its vicinity 
as armed groups were positioned in the hills and mountains around the village. Former 
residents of Hawsh Arab stated that the aerial bombardment of civilians was intended to 
cause their displacement as part of a scorched earth policy to prepare the area for a ground 
assault.  
</p>
<p><i>Aleppo governorate  
</i></p>
<p><b>Al-Sukkari district, Aleppo city, 18 January 2014 
</b>8. At approximately 3pm, a Government helicopter dropped three consecutive barrel 
bombs on a street intersection in Al-Sukkari district. An alley of 20 residential buildings 
was affected by the attack, sustaining extensive damage. A victim of the attack, a 15-year-
old boy, described how he was with his brother, three of his cousins and a friend in front of 
his house when they heard a hovering helicopter. His 15-year-old cousin was killed in the 
attack, in addition to a reported 30 civilians including women and children.  
</p>
<p><b>Qadi Askar, Aleppo city, 30 January 2014 
</b>9. A barrel bomb was dropped on a residential neighbourhood in Qadi Askar, landing 
50 metres away from the Sa&#8217;ad Alla al Jabry School, killing 16 civilians including women 
and children, and maiming dozens more. The attack caused extensive destruction of

district. The first barrel bomb hit a five-storey residential building, causing its collapse. At 
the same time, a barrel bomb hit a vegetable market. The attacks killed at least 5 people, all 
civilians and wounded countless others. This attack was part of an intensive period of 
bombardment on Aleppo from 1 to 5 February, which resulted in hundreds of civilians 
killed, including dozens of children. A mass exodus of civilians from Al-Sukkari and other 
eastern districts of Aleppo followed.  
</p>
<p><b>Masakin Hanano, Aleppo city, 4 February 2014 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 4 February, a Government helicopter dropped a barrel bomb on Masakin 
Hanano, hitting two residential buildings and a mosque. The attack killed 12 people, most 
of whom were children attending religious classes at the mosque. The attack followed a 
pattern of barrel bombs hitting soft targets in Masakin Hanano in early February, including </p>


<p>two primary schools, a mosque and a field hospital. Each attack resulted in the deaths of 
dozens of children, many of whom were internally displaced persons from Rif Aleppo. 
</p>
<p>Al-<b>Haydaria, Rif Aleppo, 9 February 2014 
</b></p>
<p>13. As civilians were fleeing Aleppo following an intensive period of bombardment 
from 1 to 5 February, at 8am on 9 February a Government helicopter dropped a barrel 
bomb on Al-Haydaria roundabout, a transport hub and gathering point for vehicles 
transporting internally displaced persons. A victim of the attack, a mother whose three

<p><b>Masakin Hanano, Aleppo city, 17 February 2014 
</b></p>
<p>15. On 17 February, a Government helicopter dropped a barrel bomb on a densely 
populated roundabout. The area was a well-known and crowded bus station and transport 
hub. A witness of the attack described seeing victim&#8217;s bodies and limbs strewn about a 
large area, with many bodies torn to pieces. This made it &#8220;impossible to make a body 
count&#8221;. Available information indicates that over 15 people, all civilians, were killed in the 
attack. There were no military targets in the immediate vicinity of the targeted area.  
</p>

attempt to target those fleeing the camp.  
</p>
<p><b>Fafeen, Rif Aleppo, 22 February 2014 
</b></p>
<p>17. After a barrel bomb was dropped near Fafeen on 22 February, a family living nearby 
rushed to collect their belongings and flee the area. Surviving family members described 
how they were about to leave their house, when a Government helicopter dropped a barrel 
bomb in their yard, killing their relatives: three young women, a female child and a female 
adult.   
</p>
<p><b>Al-Sukkari, Aleppo city, 23 March 2014 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 23 March at 10am, a Government fighter jet fired a missile at Al-Wadi street, a 
crowded thoroughfare in Al-Sukkari. A victim who was in his workshop on the street 
described how his 13-year-old nephew was killed immediately as a result of severe shrapnel 
injuries. At least 20 people were killed in the attack, including 5 children. As a result of the

<p>19. A Government helicopter dropped barrel bombs on a residential neighbourhood in 
Al-Shaar district, just prior to Friday prayers. The attack killed 20 people, among them 
women and children. Dozens more were injured in the attack, which caused significant 
destruction of residential infrastructure in Al-Shaar. On 6 April, a helicopter targeted the 
same area with two consecutive barrel bombs, killing at least 20 civilians. The attacks 
appeared to target shops, residential buildings and crowded streets.   
</p>
<p><b>Tel Jabin, Aleppo, 5 April 2014 
</b>20. On 5 April, a Government helicopter dropped two barrel bombs on Tel Jabin, killing

bombs which killed 8 people, including a woman and 4 children. At least 20 other people 
were severely injured in the attack.  
<b>Biideen, Aleppo city, 20 April 2014 
</b></p>
<p>22. A Government helicopter dropped four barrel bombs in close sequence on Biideen 
neighbourhood. The attack was accompanied by artillery and mortar shelling, leading to the 
deaths of 30 people and injury of dozens more. The victims of the attack were civilians 
buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings hit by barrel bombs. The area appeared to be 
targeted due to the large number of internally displaced persons seeking shelter from 
hostilities in nearby areas.  
</p>
<p><b>Al-Fardous, Aleppo city, 20 April 2014 
</b></p>
<p>23. On 20 April, a Government helicopter consecutively dropped two barrel bombs on 
Al-Fardous neighbourhood, a densely populated area. The first barrel bomb hit a crowded 
commercial street. The second bomb fell 400 metres away, on residential buildings. At least 
40 people were killed, among them women and children. The bombs were dropped around

<p><b>Ain Jalout School, Al-Ansari al-Sharqi, Aleppo city, 30 April 
</b>24.  On the morning of 30 April, Ain Jalout School in Al-Ansari al-Sharqi, Aleppo city, 
was hit by two consecutive missiles. The attacks killed 35 people, including 33 children, 
and severely injured approximately 40 more. The school was targeted at a time when 
parents and children gathered in large numbers for an exhibition of children&#8217;s artwork 
depicting their experiences of war. Ansar Al-Aqida uses a building that is part of the same 
school complex as a barracks for approximately 50 fighters. However, the timing of the 
attacks and their repetitive nature indicates that the attacks had the intention of wounding 
and killing as many people as possible. Ain Jalout School had previously been attacked in 
2013. The character and context of the attacks on the school make it apparent that 
Government forces could not consistently mistaken their target to be the school building 
rather than the adjacent barracks of Ansar Al-Aqida. In addition to wounding and killing 
children, attacks on schools damage educational infrastructure and militarise civilian areas.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Al-Halak, Aleppo city, 1 May 2014 
</b></p>
<p>25. At 4pm on 1 May, a Government fighter jet fired three consecutive missiles on Al-

The two rockets consecutively hit the same residential building, which was inhabited by 
civilians. Residents of the building and victims of the attacks stated that there were neither 
military activities nor armed group fighters in the area. A man who witnessed the attack and 
helped pull bodies from under the rubble described seeing the dead bodies of three children 
and a woman. Nearby buildings were severely damaged. Residents whose homes were 
destroyed were forced to leave Armanaz.  
</p>
<p><b>Al-Sukkari, Aleppo city, 10 May 2014 
</b></p>
<p>27. A construction site in Al-Sukkari was attacked on the morning of 10 May with a 
barrel bomb, killing 16 men. The area, under the control of Liwa al-Tawhid at the time of 
the attack contained no military targets in the immediate vicinity of the attack. According to 
victims, there was an armed group checkpoint 300 metres away from the site. The attack 
appeared to target clear evidence of civilian life.  
</p>
<p><b>Bustan Al-Qasr, Aleppo city, 30 May 2014 
</b>28. At 1pm on 30 May, a Government helicopter dropped two barrel bombs on Karraj 
Al-Hajz street. A man described how he rushed to the site of the attack and witnessed many 
women and children among the dead and wounded. While first responders were collecting 
the dead and wounded, the site was targeted a second time. At least 10 people were killed in

mosque and Al-Sakhour hospital. The bombs caused serious damage to houses and resulted 
in the deaths of 10 children, among other civilians. Residents who helped collect their 
bodies described how without proper tools and machinery, many of the victims were 
trapped under the rubble of their homes until days following the attack.  
</p>
<p><b>Al-Sukkari, Aleppo city, 16 June 2014 
</b>30. On 16 June, a Government helicopter dropped two barrel bombs on Al-Sukkari 
district. The first bomb hit a residential building. The second bomb, fired less than 10 
minutes after the first, hit a main intersection close to the Al-Sukkari Local Council located 
less than 50 metres away from the site of the first attack. The intersection was deliberately 
targeted. Victims described that the local council office was conducting two days of aid 
distribution, with hundreds of families gathering to collect assistance at the time of the 
attack. It is unlikely that Government forces could have mistaken the crowded intersection 
with nearby Ahrar Al-Sham bases in Al-Sukkari, stationed in the Al-Thawra Elementary 
School and Al-Rabi&#8217;ee wedding hall. The timing and deliberate nature of the attack 
indicates that civilians were its object.

<p><b>Jasem, Dara&#8217;a, 12 February 2014 
</b>31. On 12 February, people shopping at a market in Jasem heard the sound of a

minutes after the initial attack, killing many of them.  
</p>
<p><b>Dael, Dara&#8217;a, mid-June 2014 
</b>33. A barrel bomb was dropped on a residential neighbourhood in Dael in mid-June, 
killing five people including a woman and a child. The closest armed group position was 
located 1.5 kilometres away. The victims of the attack could not access the nearest hospital 
as it was in a Government-controlled area and wounded persons were not allowed to pass 
through checkpoints.  
</p>
<p><b>Al-Shajara, Dara&#8217;a, 18 June 2014 
</b>34.  On 18 June, a camp for internally displaced persons located in and around a school 
in Al-Shajara was hit by a barrel bomb. Twelve people were killed in the attack and two 
others died of severe injuries before reaching medical treatment. According to doctors who 
treated victims of the attack, all those injured were civilians. They bore multiple injuries, 
many resulting in amputations due to severe wounds to their limbs, consistent with the 
damage caused by barrel bombs.

<p>36.<b> </b>Badr al-Din al-Husseini Institute in Shaghur, Old City of Damascus on 29 April was 
shelled by anti-Government armed groups stationed in Jobar, resulting in the deaths of 17 
and injury of over 86 children and adults. It followed a clear pattern of armed groups using 
their artillery and mortar shelling capabilities to target soft targets, in particular school 
yards in the Old City of Damascus, where numerous children congregate. Anti-Government 
armed groups have intentionally targeted civilian localities due to their perceived support of 
the Government, occasionally along sectarian lines. The shelling of schools in Damascus is 
calculated and deliberate. 
</p>
<p><i>Hama 
</i></p>
<p><b>Ma&#8217;an, Hama, 24 December 2013 
</b></p>
<p>37. On 24 December 2013, an anti-Government armed group entered Ma&#8217;an, a village 
30 kilometres north of Hama city. While some local men attempted to defend the village, 
they were quickly overrun. Armed group fighters killed between 10 and 15 civilians, 
including women and children, inside the village. All of those killed were Alawite. Later, 
Liwa al-Islam, Jabhat al-Nusra and Jund Al-Aqsa posted videos of the attack. The majority 
of Ma&#8217;an&#8217;s residents fled following this attack. Most of those who remained were too poor, 
elderly or disabled to leave. </p>


<p><b>Ma&#8217;an, Hama, 9 February 2014

Again, some men in the village attempted to defend it but they were quickly overrun. 
Approximately nine of them were shot and killed while fleeing. At least 20 civilians were 
shot and killed in the attack. 
</p>
<p><b>Al-Salamiya, Hama, 11 April 2014 
</b></p>
<p>39. On 11 April, a group affiliated to Jabhat al-Nusra attacked Al-Majbal checkpoint, 20 
kilometres from Al-Salamiya. The checkpoint, run by approximately 22 Syrian army and 
members of the National Defence Force, was intended to cut the rebel supply lines to Ar 
Raqqah governorate. The checkpoint had been the object of attack previously but on this 
occasion, was overrun. Some were killed in the initial attack while others managed to 
escape. Approximately 13 were captured alive and immediately executed. Three bodies 
were burnt beyond recognition and ten had been reportedly, though it is unclear whether 
they were beheaded while still alive.

line and overlooking several opposition-controlled neighbourhood. It had not been used as a 
hospital since 2012 when it was captured by the FSA. In December 2012, it was turned into 
a military base by the Syrian army. Aside from being briefly held by the FSA in May 2013, 
it remained under the control of the Government under 20 December 2013. On that date, 
Jabhat al-Nusra took control of the hospital, after targeting it with two suicide bombings. 
While most of the Syrian army soldiers escaped, between 10 and 15 were captured by 
Jabhat al-Nusra. The group later released a video showing its fighters shooting the captured 
soldiers in the head.

<p>48. On 29 April, the neighbourhood was hit with a double car bombing. The first car 
bomb exploded at approximately 1pm. After the first explosion, concerned residents ran to 
the scene to assist the injured. Ten minutes later, another car, parked 30-40 metres away, 
exploded. The second explosion was far more powerful than the first and deliberately 
targeted people who had rushed to the area to assist victims of the first bombing. The 
second bombing also caused a large fire. The impact site was a scene of horror with bodies 
of those killed on fire or torn apart by shrapnel. 
</p>
<p>49. At least 45 people were killed instantly in the two bombings, many of them below 
the age of 18. Some victims were killed by shrapnel while others had burned to death. 
Scores more were injured. Many of the injured suffered severe burns and died later in

</p>
<p><b>Qadi Askar neighbourhood, Aleppo city, early January 2014 
</b>53. By late 2013, ISIS had taken over a former Ophthalmology Hospital in Qadi Askar 
neighbourhood of Aleppo city. It used the building as its headquarters and set up a 
makeshift detention centre in its basement. Previously the building had been held by the 
Islamic Front and contained its Sharia court. With ISIS refusing to accept the court&#8217;s 
authority, relations between the groups deteriorated. ISIS was abducting people who had 
been critical of it or who had worked with foreigners, such as journalists. In early January, 
fighting erupted between ISIS and Liwa al-Tawhid, eventually forcing ISIS to negotiate a 
withdrawal eastwards, out of the city. On Liwa al-Tawhid&#8217;s entering the premises, several 
dozen bodies were found. There were all men, bound and blindfolded, who had recently 
been shot at close range.

<p>55. Al-Talaliyah is a Yazidi village in western Al-Hasakah governorate. When ISIS 
began to assert itself in the area, the village&#8217;s population fled. The village was occupied by 
Sunni Arabs, most of who had been displaced from Safira by Government bombardments. 
In late May, ISIS and the YPG, the Kurdish armed group, were engaged in violent clashes 
around Al-Talaliyah.  
</p>
<p>56. On 29 May, ISIS fighters entered the village. There they began to execute villagers, 
including women and young children, believing them to be Yazidis. According to 
survivors, the villagers, desperate to show that they were Muslims, began to recite the 
verses of the Quran. Bar one fighter from Iraq, none of the ISIS fighters spoke Arabic. The 
Iraqi fighter intervened, preventing further killings. Approximately 15 people were killed 
before the Iraqi fighter could translate to the other ISIS fighters that the residents were 
Sunni Arabs. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Unknown Perpetrators   
</b></p>

<p>61. Government forces stationed around eastern Ghouta, namely elite units including the 
4th Division, Republican Guard and 3rd Division, committed the war crime of attacking 
civilians on 14 and 18 of December 2013. The victims of the attacks were easy targets to 
the perpetrators who were positioned in checkpoints blocking all routes out of eastern 
Ghouta. The sequence of events around the efforts to negotiate the opening of roads 
demonstrates that the civilians attempting to leave the besieged area were the object of the 
attack. 
</p>
<p>62. The war crime of attacking civilians was committed by Government forces in the 
context of the offensive on Qalamoun (Rif Damascus) during March 2014. During the 
documented barrel bomb attacks on civilians in Hay Al-Qaa and Hawsh Arab, there was no 
military equipment or personnel near the victims&#8217; homes at the time and place of the 
incident. 
</p>
<p>63. The war crime of attacking civilians was committed by Government forces 
throughout the military campaign on Aleppo city and Rif Aleppo. Between 18 January and 
16 June, 23 documented instances of aerial bombardment amounted to the war crime of 
attacking civilians. In addition to reckless disregard to the possibility that the barrel bombs 
would hit, kill and maim civilians, the collected information shows that the Syrian armed 
forces attacked civilians, men and women, children and elderly in particular while engaged 
in typical civilian activities. In all the incidents documented, the information reveals that 
civilians or civilian objects were directly targeted, resulting in substantial civilian casualties 
and that the fire was not aimed at any possibly military target. Where military targets were 
present, they were located at a substantial distance or confined to an easily identifiable 
position.  
</p>
<p>64. In most incidents, multiple barrel bombs were dropped consecutively, ensuring 
maximum damage to their targets. Several attacks demonstrated that the Syrian air forces 
deliberately targeted civilian rescuers who rushed to help the victims of the first strikes. 
Such follow-up attacks clearly indicate that civilians were the object of the bombardments. 
The documented attacks constitute examples of a campaign of attacks against civilians in 
Aleppo. The gravity of the attacks, established by their scale, pattern and virtually 
continuous repetition over a six-month period indicates that the war crimes of attacking 
civilians were committed as part of a plan or policy. The attacks amounted to area 
bombardment and constituted a large-scale attack on the civilian population of non-State 
armed group-controlled districts of Aleppo city and Rif Aleppo.  
</p>
<p>65. The war crime of attacking civilians was committed by Government forces in Dara&#8217;a 
governorate in the course of its aerial bombardment campaign in incidents occurring </p>


<p>between 12 February and 18 June 2014. The pervasive and consistent nature of the barrel 
bomb attacks and their perpetration resulted in the terrorization of the inhabitants of Dara&#8217;a. 
The documented incidents are examples of the aerial campaign on non-State armed group-
controlled areas of Dara&#8217;a governorate, which have killed and wounded countless civilians 
during daily activities or while in their homes. Follow-up attacks targeting civilian rescuers 
and first responders and attacks targeting internally displaced persons demonstrate the 
deliberate nature of the bombardment.  
</p>
<p><b>Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>66. The war crime of murder was committed in massacres perpetrated by anti-
Government armed groups, namely by Jabhat al-Nusra and Jaysh al-Islam in Adra (Rif 
Damascus) in December 2013, by Jaysh al-Islam, Jabhat al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa in 
Ma&#8217;an (Hama) in December 2013, Jabhat al-Nusra in Aleppo in January 2014,  Jabhat al-
Nusra and Liwa al-Qasa in Ma&#8217;an (Hama) in February 2014, and by a group affiliated by 
Jabhat al-Nusra in Al-Salamiya (Hama) in April 2014. In all documented incidents, anti-
Government armed groups killed civilians or persons <i>hors de combat</i> in close quarters. 
</p>
<p>67. The  war crime of attacking civilians was perpetrated by armed groups stationed in 
Jobar (Rif Damascus) on 29 April 2014 in their attack on Badr al-Din al-Husseini Institute 
in the Old City of Damascus. The institute is located in a civilian neighbourhood with no 
military targets in its vicinity. Civilians, in particular children attending the institute, were 
the object of the attack. The attack followed a pattern of shelling of schoolyards in 
Damascus demonstrating the deliberate and calculated nature of the attack.  
</p>
<p>68. The war crime of attacking civilians was committed by Jabhat al-Nusra and other 
unidentified armed groups in their car bomb attacks on Government-controlled 
neighbourhoods of Homs city between 6 March and 19 June 2014. The attacks did not 
target any military objectives, nor was there any military equipment or personnel near the 
sites of the attacks. The double car bombings in Karm Al-Louz on 9 April and in Al-
Abassiya on 29 April were clearly intended to cause mass civilian casualties with the 
second car bombs targeting the civilian rescuers and first responders helping the victims of 
the first attacks. The nine documented attacks formed part of single campaign of spreading 
terror among the civilian population of Homs city by Jabhat al-Nusra.  
</p>
<p>69. The war crime of murder and the war crime of execution without due process were 
committed by ISIS in Aleppo in early January, in Ar Raqqah city (Ar Raqqah) in April and 
in Al-Talaliyah (Al-Hasakah) in May 2014. The execution of the victims, usually accused 
of affiliation with other armed groups, was linked to the ongoing non-international armed 
conflict in Syria. In its public display of bodies and failure to honourably inter the bodies in 
accordance with the rites of the religion of the deceased, ISIS has violated customary 
international humanitarian law. ISIS carried out public executions to instil terror among the 
population, ensuring submission to its authority.  
</p>
<p>70. ISIS has committed acts of violence against the civilian population under its control 
in Al-Raqqah and eastern Aleppo governorates. This is a continuation &#8211; and a geographic 
expansion &#8211; of the widespread and systematic attack on the civilian population identified in 
A/HRC/25/65. ISIS, a structured group, directs and organises these acts of violence against 
civilians, evincing an organisational policy. While the victims appear to be largely <i>hors de 
combat</i> fighters, the unlawful killings in Al-Raqqah and identified localities in Aleppo 
governorates, detailed above, form part of this attack. In perpetrating these killings, ISIS 
has committed the crime against humanity of murder. 
</p>
<p><b>Unknown perpetrator

<p>71. Where neither the perpetrator nor the circumstances of the deaths could be 
determined, incidents remain under investigation. </p>


<p><b>Annex V 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only]<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p><b>  Specifically protected persons and objects 
 1. Government forces </b> </p>
<p>1. The healthcare system has been severely affected in the course of military operations 
carried out by Government forces, as well as through a deliberate and systematic campaign 
to persecute medical staff treating anyone perceived to be opposing the Government. The 
prevention of access to healthcare continues to be used to punish and subdue civilians 
residing in armed group-held or contested areas, or persons perceived to be affiliated with 
armed opposition groups.  
</p>
<p>2. Healthcare infrastructure and medical facilities in contested areas have been 
damaged in hostilities and destroyed by targeted attacks. The flight of healthcare 
professionals owing to fear of arrest, and the death and injury of medical staff has left 
armed group-controlled areas without adequate medical care. The continued denial and 
removal of medical supplies from humanitarian aid deliveries and the collapse of the 
country&#8217;s pharmaceutical industry have further worsened the provision of medical care.  
</p>
<p>3. Medical functions continue to be targeted as part of a broader assault on civilians. 
During the Government&#8217;s offensive on Yabroud (Rif Damascus) in early February, a 
hospital in which internally displaced persons were seeking shelter was shelled, killing 
three and injuring seven people. As the military operation escalated, medical clinics were 
targeted and destroyed on 15 and 16 March. On 15 May, Government forces dropped two 
consecutive vacuum bombs on Radwan field hospital in Jasem (Dara&#8217;a), destroying the 
facility. Four medical personnel and two children were killed, and more than 15 were 
critically injured. This facility was the sole source of medical care in Jasem. Residents 
described how the hospital&#8217;s destruction and resulting lack of medical care led to an 
increase in infant mortality.  
</p>
<p>4. During the military campaign on Aleppo, Government forces attacked medical 
facilities to achieve military advantage. In eight documented attacks between early 
February and 24 June, Government forces dropped barrel bombs on M10 Trauma Field 
Hospital in Masakin Hanano, Aleppo city. Doctors and patients were killed in the attacks, 
which damaged crucial infrastructure such as operating rooms and the intensive care unit, 
as well as life-saving equipment. These attacks have severely limited access to medical care 
in Masakin Hanano during the barrel bombing campaign on northeastern Aleppo, depriving 
those injured in Government attacks on Sheikh Najar Industrial Area and around Aleppo 
Central Prison of medical treatment.  
</p>
<p>5. On 12 April, Al-Zarzour Hospital, which provides medical treatment for opposition 
forces based in Al-Ramoussa, Al-Azizia and Al-Layramoun, was targeted by two 
consecutive barrel bombs. The hospital serves the most heavily bombarded opposition-held 
districts in Aleppo city, including Al-Ansari al-Sharqi, Al-Sukkari, Bustan Al-Qasr, Salah 
Al-Din and Al-Mashahed. It was further damaged on 7 May and 18 June, when helicopters 
dropped a barrel bomb 200-400 metres away.  
</p>
<p>6. Al-Sakhour Hospital, one of the few remaining medical facilities in eastern Aleppo, 
was hit by a barrel bomb on 7 February, killing two and injuring 16 people, including four 
medical staff. In June, Al-Sakhour Hospital suffered seven barrel bomb and missile attacks, 
causing significant damage to medical equipment and the partial destruction of the facility. </p>


<p>Four medical staff were injured in the attacks. Following an attack on 23 June, the hospital 
was temporarily closed. The attacks severely limited access to medical care in opposition-
controlled areas of Aleppo.  
</p>
<p>7. On the morning of 13 April, a barrel bomb hit the M1 Trauma Hospital in Aleppo, 
destroying its top floor. The same day, a barrel bomb hit Al-Daqqaq Hospital in Al-Shaar, 
causing significant damage to its operating rooms, water and sewage infrastructure. On 24 
June, Bab Al-Hadid field hospital was attacked by missiles, injuring two patients and 
damaging equipment. Omar bin Abdulaziz Hospital in central Aleppo city was severely 
damaged on 5 July by a barrel bomb dropped in its vicinity. In Idlib, Bab Al-Hawa field 
hospital was hit by two consecutive missiles on 7 June, damaging the facility infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>8. Across the country, field hospitals and makeshift clinics are concealed in 
underground cellars and basements. Medical staff at a field hospital in Quneitra noted they 
do not mark the location with a red cross or red crescent emblem since &#8220;once the regime 
learns where the hospital is, they will attack it.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>9. Government forces and authorities acted in disrespect for medical ethics and the 
duty of health workers to treat the sick and wounded regardless of affiliation. Doctors, 
nurses, pharmacists and paramedics arrested and disappeared in 2011 and 2012 continued 
to be detained or their whereabouts remain unknown. A field hospital doctor detained in 
Damascus in spring 2013 for aiding the opposition continues to be imprisoned in the Air 
Force Intelligence Branch at Mezzeh Airport. A nurse working in Douma Hospital, arrested 
in October 2013 for treating wounded members of the armed opposition, died in the 
custody of Syrian authorities. In May, his parents were informed of his death and burial in 
Najha cemetery (Rif Damascus) and instructed to retrieve his identification and belongings 
from a hospital in Damascus.  
</p>
<p>10. Attacks on medical personnel and facilities violate common article 3 of the Geneva 
Conventions and customary international humanitarian law and amount to war crimes. The 
frequency of attacks on medical facilities in opposition-controlled areas of Aleppo city and 
governorate is indicative of a deliberate policy. Government forces target healthcare 
infrastructure with the apparent intention of depriving civilians and fighters injured in 
Government offensives of medical treatment, increasing the loss of life and the number of 
persons maimed, wounded or killed. Humanitarian workers continue to be targeted in grave 
violation of international humanitarian law, hampering the operations of aid organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</i>11. In January, a nurse working at a hospital in Byanoon (Aleppo) was abducted by ISIS 
while transporting a wounded patient. In late January, ISIS detained a pediatrician working 
for an international NGO in Jarabulus (Aleppo). In early February, three medical staff from 
a field hospital in Al-Bab (Aleppo) were detained by ISIS and brought in front of a shari&#8217;a 
court before being released. These incidents fit a previously documented pattern of ISIS 
detaining doctors in contravention of the customary international humanitarian law rule that 
under no circumstances shall any person be punished for carrying out medical activities.  
</p>
<p>12. ISIS fighters occupied Al-Jabal Hospital in Al-Bab in January, and have converted 
the operation rooms to a detention facility. Using hospitals outside their humanitarian 
function prevents the impartial provision of medical treatment, endangers patients and 
medical professionals, and compromises the humanitarian function of medical facilities. 
This has a grave impact on the fulfilment of the obligation under common article 3 to care 
for the sick and wounded. Failing to respect the emblems of the Geneva Conventions 
undermines their protective purpose.  </p>


<p>13. Journalists continue to be systematically targeted by ISIS. Two foreign journalists 
were detained by ISIS in Tal Abyad, (Ar Raqqah) after they explained that they were 
reporting on the ongoing conflict. They were subsequently interrogated and ill-treated in 
various ISIS detention facilities until late March 2014. On 29 April, ISIS executed a 
journalist in Tal Abyad.  The detention and killing of journalists violates international 
humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes. 
</p>
<p>14. Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic Front fighters stationed near the Old City of Aleppo 
continue to fire improvised gas-canister explosives at the Citadel, targeting Government 
snipers stationed within. On 8 May, Ahrar al-Sham fighters remotely detonated explosives 
packed into a tunnel dug underneath the Citadel, allegedly used as a base for Government 
soldiers. On 31 May, they detonated a similar tunnel bomb near the Zahrawi market next to 
the Citadel. Repeated underground high-magnitude shockwaves have caused structural 
damage to the thirteenth century Citadel, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site.  
</p><p>15. The whereabouts of the Syriac Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Archbishops of 
Aleppo, Yohanna Ibrahim and Paul Yazigi, abducted in Aleppo in April 2013, and of 
Father Paolo Dall&#8217;Oglio, abducted in Ar Raqqah city in January 2014, remain unknown. 
Dozens of journalists, both foreign and Syrian, remain in captivity, detained 
incommunicado because of their professional activities. Religious personnel and civilian 
journalists enjoy specific protection under international humanitarian law and must be 
respected and protected by all parties. </p>
