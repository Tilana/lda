<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report contains a comprehensive account of communications sent to Governments 
between 16 March 2008 and 15 March 2009, along with replies received between 1 May 2008 
and 30 April 2009. It also contains responses received to communications that were sent in 
earlier years. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  COMMUNICATIONS AND REPLIES 
</b></p>
<p>2. Along with fuller reproductions or summaries of correspondence, this report summarizes 
the correspondence regarding each communication under four headings for ease of reference. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Violation alleged 
</b></p>
<p>3. Violations are classified into the following categories: 
</p>
<p> (a) Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating to the 
imposition of capital punishment (&#8220;Death penalty safeguards&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (b) Death threats and fear of imminent extrajudicial executions by State officials, 
paramilitary groups, or groups cooperating with or tolerated by the Government, as well as 
unidentified persons who may be linked to the categories mentioned above and when the 
Government is failing to take appropriate protection measures (&#8220;Death threats&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (c) Deaths in custody owing to torture, neglect, or the use of force, or fear of death in 
custody due to life-threatening conditions of detention (&#8220;Deaths in custody&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (d) Deaths due to the use of force by law enforcement officials or persons acting in 
direct or indirect compliance with the State, when the use of force is inconsistent with the criteria 
of absolute necessity and proportionality (&#8220;Excessive force&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (e) Deaths due to the attacks or killings by security forces of the State, or by paramilitary 
groups, death squads, or other private forces cooperating with or tolerated by the State (&#8220;Attacks 
or killings&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (f) Violations of the right to life during armed conflicts, especially of the civilian 
population and other non-combatants, contrary to international humanitarian law (&#8220;Violations of 
right to life in armed conflict&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (g) Expulsion, refoulement, or return of persons to a country or a place where their lives 
are in danger (&#8220;Expulsion&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (h) Impunity, compensation and the rights of victims (&#8220;Impunity&#8221;).  
</p>
<p>The short versions contained in parentheses are used in the tabulation of communications. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Subject(s) of appeal 
</b>4. The subjects of appeal are classified in accordance with paragraph 6 of Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2004/37 and paragraph 5 (b) of General Assembly resolution 61/173. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Character of replies received 
</b></p>
<p>5. The replies received have been classified according to the following five categories 
designed to assist the Commission in its task of evaluating the effectiveness of the mandate: 
</p>
<p> (a) &#8220;Largely satisfactory response&#8221; denotes a reply that is responsive to the allegations 
and that substantially clarifies the facts. It does not, however, imply that the action taken 
necessarily complies with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> (b) &#8220;Cooperative but incomplete response&#8221; denotes a reply that provides some 
clarification of the allegations but that contains limited factual substantiation or that fails to 
address some issues; 
</p>
<p> (c) &#8220;Allegations rejected but without adequate substantiation&#8221; denotes a reply denying 
the allegations but which is not supported by documentation or analysis that can be considered 
satisfactory under the circumstances; 
</p>
<p> (d) &#8220;Receipt acknowledged&#8221; denotes a reply acknowledging that the communication was 
received but without providing any substantive information; 
</p>
<p> (e) &#8220;No response&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>There are two minor, additional characterizations: (i) where a response has been received but has 
not yet been translated by the United Nations, the response is characterized simply as 
&#8220;Translation awaited&#8221;; (ii) where a response has not been received from the Government but less 
than 90 days has elapsed since the communication was sent, that fact is indicated by 
characterizing the response as: &#8220;No response (recent communication)&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>6. In order to underscore the importance of the dialogue between the Special Rapporteur and 
Governments and to avoid any appearance that the principal goal is the exchange of 
correspondence for its own sake, this report contains brief comments by the Special Rapporteur 
on the extent to which he considers each reply to have responded adequately to the concerns 
arising under the mandate. An indication is also provided in instances in which additional 
information is required to respond effectively to the information received.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  TABULATION OF COMMUNICATIONS AND REPLIES 
</b></p>
<p>7. To provide an overview of the activities of the mandate in the past year, this report also 
includes a table that contains the following information by country. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a substantive response concerning the 
death in custody of Kamal Uddin. The Special Rapporteur would note, however, that the 
Government has already taken longer than the customary 90 days to respond. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 26 May 2008</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received in relation to Mr <b>Kamal Uddin</b>, age 28, resident of North Birinchi under Ward 
No. 5 of Feni Pouroshobha.  
</p>
<p> According to the allegations received:  
</p>
<p>On 20 January 2008 Bangladesh Riffles (BDR) soldiers burst into the house of 
Mr Kamal Uddin while he had dinner with guests including Mr Abul Khayer, his wife and 
their 3 year old son. The BDR soldiers took Mr Kamal Uddin and Mr Abul Khayer to the 
courtyard. They asked Mr Kamal Uddin where the heroin was kept and began to kick, 
punch and beat him with iron rods while they forced Mr Abul Khayer to lie down, kicked 
him on his thighs with boots and hit his cheeks with rifle butts. Some BDR officers then 
proceeded to search the house. They also called a magistrate, who joined the operation. 
The BDR beat Mr Kamal Uddin severely for two and half hours and, when he screamed, 
put a shawl in his mouth to silence him. Moreover, a BDR soldier forced him to drink a 
putty powder solution. At approximately 2.30 a.m. on 21 January 2008, Mr Kamal Uddin, 
Mr Abdul Khayer, his wife and child were taken to the police station.  
</p>
<p>At 7 a.m. of that same day the family of Mr Kamal Uddin was informed that he and 
Mr Abul Khayer had been transferred to Sadar hospital, while Mr Khayer&#8217;s wife and son 
were kept in police custody. At the hospital they found Mr Kamal Uddin&#8217;s body lying on 
the floor of Ward No. 4 with signs of beatings on the back, chest, lower abdomen, hands 
and feet along with deep wounds made with iron rods on the right thigh where the skin was 
scraped. He also had wounds on his hands. After completion of the death certificate, police 
took Mr Kamal Uddin&#8217;s body to his house for the burial ceremony. The burial was carried 
out in the presence of the police.  
</p>
<p>According to the authorities, when the BDR personnel tried to arrest Mr Kamal Uddin, he 
tried to run away and injured himself by running into a tree. Furthermore they indicated </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>that he died because he had drunk too much alcohol. However, the magistrate who was 
present during parts of the operation stated that Mr Kamal Uddin was slapped in order to 
make him talk.  
</p>
<p>On 28 January 2008, a petition (number 26/2008, filed under sections 302/34 of the Penal 
Code concerning the death in custody) was submitted to the Court of Chief Judicial 
Magistrate of Feni, following which Mr Kamal Uddin&#8217;s wife was asked to withdraw the 
case and to find a compromise with the accused, which she reportedly refused. The Chief 
Judicial Magistrate recorded the evidence given by five witnesses and ordered the 
Officer-in-Charge of Feni Model Police Station, Mr Kamrul Hasan to file a First 
Information Report (FIR) and investigate the case.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to draw 
your Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to 
this case. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that 
&#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or 
her life.  
</p>
<p> When the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies in State custody, 
there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this respect, we would like to recall the 
conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case (<i>Dermit Barbato v. 
Uruguay</i>, communication No. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraph 9.2): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo Dermit 
committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; yet, the 
inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either by 
act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, as 
required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death in custody, there 
must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, 
arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other 
reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions). This principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in 
Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all 
States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
 The Commission added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims 
or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify 
those responsible and bring them to justice arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to conduct the inquiry into the circumstances 
surrounding the death of Mr. Uddin expeditiously, impartially and transparently, also with a 
view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability 
of any person guilty of the alleged violations, as well as to compensate Mr. Uddin&#8217;s family.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the 
Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details on any developments in the investigation of the case. If it 
has been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken 
against the BDR officers allegedly responsible for Mr. Uddin&#8217;s death. Have penal, disciplinary 
or administrative sanctions been imposed on them? 
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate whether compensation has been paid to the family of Mr. Uddin. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a substantive response concerning the 
death in custody of Moshiul Alam Sentu. The SR would note, however, that the Government has 
already taken longer than the customary 90 days to respond. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 23 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have 
received concerning the death of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Md. Moshiul Alam Sentu</b>, a representative of the 
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, in Barisal.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Md. Moshiul Alam Sentu, aged 34, was vice-president of the Central Committee of the 
Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party) and president 
of the Barisal Metropolitan Unit of the same party. He was killed in the night from 15 to 
16 July 2008 after having been arrested by a Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) team.  
</p>
<p>A written statement issued after Mr. Sentu&#8217;s death by the Commanding Officer of RAB-8 
in Barisal stated that Mr. Sentu was a &#8220;notorious criminal&#8221;. It asserted that an RAB-8 team 
located in Dhaka learned from an undisclosed source about Mr. Sentu&#8217;s presence between 
the Palashi and Katabon areas of Dhaka. The RAB team succeeded to apprehend Mr. Sentu 
at around 7 p.m. on 15 July 2008 notwithstanding his attempts to elude arrest. Interrogation 
revealed that Mr. Sentu kept large amounts of ammunition and explosives in various parts 
of Barisal. The RAB team decided to drive to Barisal with Mr. Sentu in order to find the 
ammunition caches. On 16 July at 4:15 a.m., when the RAB team arrived at Bilbobari of 
Kashipur in Barisal, Mr. Sentu&#8217;s associates opened fire on the RAB minibus in order to 
free Mr. Sentu. An exchange of fire ensued which lasted for about 12 minutes. The RAB 
officers cordoned off the whole area and at dawn found Mr. Sentu&#8217;s body in the area of the 
shootout along with the ammunition of his associates. The windows of the RAB microbus 
were broken and two officers were injured in the incident.  
On 16 July 2008 at 8 a.m., Magistrate Mr. Mahbubul Karim prepared an inquest report on 
the body of Mr. Sentu. A sub-inspector of the Kotowali Police Station of Barisal informed 
the inquiry that Mr. Sentu&#8217;s dead body was found lying on its back in a rice paddy field. 
The body had one bullet inside the left thigh and two bullets in the chest that exited 
through the back. No blood was found at the scene. Doctors of the Forensic Medicine </p>

<p>Department of the Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital of Barisal conducted a 
post-mortem. Dr. Habibur Rahman, an Assistant Professor at the Forensic Medicine 
Department of Sher-e-Bangla Medical College, said that while conducting the post-mortem 
he found a bullet in the left thigh and two bullets in the chest that exited the back. He made 
no further comments on the death of Mr. Sentu. His body was handed over to the family at 
12 noon on 16 July 2008.  
</p>
<p>Other sources, however, provide detailed information contradicting the account of the 
Commanding Officer of RAB-8 in Barisal. According to these sources, Mr. Sentu&#8217;s family 
had heard about plans to kill Mr. Sentu in a fake &#8220;shootout&#8221; already in June 2008. Two 
persons (whose names are on record with the Special Rapporteur) assisted Mr. Sentu&#8217;s 
mother, Mrs. Chaina Momtaz Begum, to set up a meeting with a major of the RAB-8 
in Barisal (his name is on record with the Special Rapporteur as well). On 19 or 
20 June 2008, Mrs. Chaina paid the RAB-8 major BDT 300,000 (corresponding to 
USD 4,460) as a bribe in exchange for assurances that the RAB would not kill her son.  
</p>
<p>On 15 July 2008 Mr. Sentu and party colleagues had taken part in a dawn to dusk &#8220;hunger 
strike&#8221; protest in the Dhaka University campus. After the protest, Mr. Sentu and five other 
leaders of different party units decided to go to eat outside the university. About 7 p.m., 
after hiring three rickshaws, Mr. Sentu and his five companions came to the Nilkhet 
intersection in front of the Sir A.F. Rahman Hall of the university. A white microbus 
bearing the sticker of RAB-3 (Rapid Action Battalion) came from behind and signaled 
them to stop. As the rickshaws stopped, RAB personnel fired one round of into the air. 
Mr. Sentu jumped from the rickshaw and tried to escape. The RAB officers then shot 
Mr. Sentu in his left leg and managed to apprehend him, blindfolded him with a towel, tied 
his hands, took him into their vehicle and left.  
</p>
<p>One of Mr. Sentu&#8217;s companions called Mr. Sentu&#8217;s mother, Ms. Chaina, by mobile phone. 
Mrs. Chaina immediately called the office of the RAB-8 in Barisal. The RAB-8 major she 
had previously been in contact with confirmed the arrest of Mr. Sentu. The following 
morning (16 July 2008), around 6 a.m., Mrs. Chaina again called the major on his mobile 
phone. He told her that Mr. Sentu would be brought to Barisal, but assured her that nothing 
would happen to him. He requested Mrs. Chaina to come to the RAB-8 office at 9 a.m. that 
same day. At about 6:30 a.m., however, Mrs. Chaina heard that her son had been killed in a 
&#8220;crossfire&#8221; in the Bilbobari area of Kashipur of Barisal early in the morning.  
</p>
<p>Moreover, several witnesses have provided information contradicting the assertion that 
there was a shootout in the Bilbobari area of Kashipur of Barisal in the early morning 
hours of 16 July 2008. A resident of the area saw three RAB vehicles arriving at around 
4 a.m. on that morning. About 15 members of the RAB got out of the vehicles and walked 
around the road, which had a paddy field on one side and a canal on the other. The RAB 
officers then blocked the road and fired about three blank shots into the air. They began to 
continually open and close the doors of their vehicles. Then the RAB officers carried 
something (which subsequently turned out to be Mr. Sentu&#8217;s body) out of the vehicle and 
put it in the paddy field. After a few minutes there were more gunshots. Later on, RAB </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>members brought ammunition from their vehicles and scattered them on the ground. 
Another witness asserts that she witnessed the RAB members firing blank shots from their 
guns at about 4 a.m. None of the neighbors heard any noise that could be related to an 
ambush and a shootout, but only blank gunshots. 
</p>
<p>Several witnesses who saw the rice paddy where Mr. Sentu&#8217;s body was found state that 
that there was no damage to the field suggesting that there had been a fight between two 
groups. They also state that there was no blood around Mr. Sentu&#8217;s body, only two towels. 
One witness with long experience in the military asserts that Mr. Sentu had received two 
bullets in the chest from very close range and a bullet in the left leg shot from a few feet 
away. Other witnesses allege that there was serious bruising about the neck and the right 
arm of the deceased.  
</p>
<p>At about 2:30 p.m. on 16 July 2008, a large number of RAB and police accompanied by a 
Commissioner of the Barisal City Corporation brought the mortal remains of Mr. Sentu to 
his home. The RAB and police observed the burial, leaving the family home only at 5 p.m. 
Their presence was perceived as intended to threaten and intimidate relatives and 
neighbors in order to prevent discussion of the incident.  
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer your 
Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the right to life and security of 
the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life (Article 6). Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law 
enforcement officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the 
legitimate objective to be achieved (see, e.g., Principles 4 and 9 of the UN Basic Principles on 
the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials).  
</p>
<p> Moreover, when the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence 
in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies while in State 
custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In order to overcome the presumption of 
State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a 
&#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports 
suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This 
principle was reiterated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in 
Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The 
Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those 
responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their 
families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to 
bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In the light of the above principles, and particularly of the heightened level of diligence 
required from States in protecting the right to life of an individual in custody, I would like to 
recall previous communications between your Excellency&#8217;s Government and this mandate. I 
refer to my allegation letter concerning 27 specific cases (A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, pages 37-49), my 
allegation letter of 30 October 2006 in the case of Abul Hawladar and Md. Shamim, and my 
communication of 12 January 2007, drawing your Government&#8217;s attention to reports that the 
&#8220;RAB is [&#8230;] responsible for the deaths of 367 people between June 2004 (when it was first 
created) and October 2006&#8221;. Many of the deaths in connection with RAB operations which I 
have brought to your Government&#8217;s attention reportedly resulted from the exact scenario which 
the Commanding Officer of RAB-8 in Barisal describes in the case of the death of Mr. Sentu 
(see, e.g., your Government&#8217;s reply dated 22 February 2007 to my communication dated 
30 October 2006 in the case of Abul Hawladar and Md. Shamim). A &#8220;notorious criminal&#8221; or 
suspect was apprehended and asked to guide the police to a location where firearms were hidden, 
whereupon his accomplices opened fire on the police, ultimately leading to the suspects&#8217; death in 
the crossfire. Based on the information thus far received - and particularly in the light of the 
detailed allegations received in the present case - I continue to find this pattern in which suspects 
are routinely reported to have died in a &#8220;crossfire&#8221; indicative of extrajudicial executions.  
 I would therefore again appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to instruct its Rapid 
Action Battalion teams to comply with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force 
and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, and to hold accountable, disciplinarily and 
criminally, those who fail to comply with these Principles and thereby violate the right to life. 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandates provided to me by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to the 
Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the summary of the cases accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the killing of 
Mr Sentu. Please explain the measures taken to ensure that any investigation is impartial and 
independent, as well as the measures taken to ensure that witnesses and family members of the 
victim are not intimidated. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been 
undertaken. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive please explain 
why.  
</p>
<p> 3. In its above mentioned communication dated 22 February 2007 your Government 
stresses that &#8220;should members of the RAB be found to have indulged in illegal activity, 
appropriate action is taken. There are several examples of punishment or legal proceedings 
against them for illegal activities&#8221;. I would appreciate receiving more information on these 
examples. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 4. I would like to reiterate my request (A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, page 40) to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government as to why the practice of making suspects accompany police on 
follow-up raids has not been discontinued if it provides the explanation for hundreds of deaths.

violaciones de los derechos humanos.  
</p>
<p> En marzo de 2004, 3l Gobierno de su Excelencia aprob&#243; la Ley 2640 sobre Resarcimiento 
Excepcional a V&#237;ctimas de la Violencia Pol&#237;tica en Periodos de Gobiernos Inconstitucionales 
(&#8220;la Ley&#8221;), por medio de la cual se compensar&#237;a a v&#237;ctimas directas y sus familiares, en caso de 
fallecimiento de la v&#237;ctima, por hechos ocurridos entre 1964 y 1982. Los hechos resarcibles son 
la muerte, desaparici&#243;n forzada, tortura, detenci&#243;n arbitraria, exilio, lesiones y persecuci&#243;n. La 
Ley cre&#243; tambi&#233;n la Comisi&#243;n Nacional para el Resarcimiento a V&#237;ctimas de la Violencia </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Pol&#237;tica (&#8220;CONREVIP&#8221;), la cual comenz&#243; a trabajar en mayo de 2007 y es presidida por el 
Ministerio de Justicia. Sin embargo, la CONREVIP no cuenta con el apoyo institucional ni con 
los suficientes recursos econ&#243;micos para poder ocuparse de la calificaci&#243;n de todos los 
expedientes, lo que restringe su trabajo. De las 7.911 solicitudes presentadas, 6.221 han sido 
depuradas y podr&#237;an ser procedentes. No obstante, con fecha de 25 de marzo, solamente 
80 personas hab&#237;an sido notificadas, siendo ellas familiares de las v&#237;ctimas de muerte y 
desaparici&#243;n forzada. De cualquier forma, los plazos establecidos para emitir resoluciones y 
ejecutar el resarcimiento vencieron a finales de 2007. A la fecha, no se ha procedido a los pagos 
u otros beneficios establecidos en la Ley. 
</p>
<p> Uno de los principales obst&#225;culos para el resarcimiento de las v&#237;ctimas es que, de acuerdo 
con la Ley, el Estado s&#243;lo dispone del 20% del monto total requerido para el pago del 
resarcimiento, por lo que el 80% deber&#225; ser cubierto por donaciones del sector privado o 
extranjero y de organismos internacionales. 
 En este sentido, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre el 
art&#237;culo 14 de la Convenci&#243;n contra la Tortura, el cual afirma que los Estados parte tienen la 
obligaci&#243;n de garantizar que las v&#237;ctimas de tortura obtengan una reparaci&#243;n, as&#237; como una 
indemnizaci&#243;n justa y adecuada. Me gustar&#237;a tambi&#233;n reiterarle que el p&#225;rrafo 6 de la 
Resoluci&#243;n 2005/39 de la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos &#8220;destaca que la legislaci&#243;n nacional 
debe garantizar que las v&#237;ctimas de la tortura o de otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o 
degradantes obtengan reparaci&#243;n y reciban una indemnizaci&#243;n justa y adecuada, as&#237; como 
servicios de rehabilitaci&#243;n medico social apropiados y, a este respecto, alienta la creaci&#243;n de 
centros de rehabilitaci&#243;n para las v&#237;ctimas de la tortura.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> En su informe al Consejo de Derechos Humanos A/HRC/4/33, el Relator Especial se&#241;ala 
que la Convenci&#243;n contra la Tortura fija una serie de obligaciones encaminadas a castigar a los 
autores, prevenir la tortura y prestar asistencia a las v&#237;ctimas de actos de tortura. El art&#237;culo 14 
espec&#237;ficamente reconoce el derecho de la v&#237;ctima de un acto de tortura a la reparaci&#243;n y debe 
ser interpretado teniendo en cuenta los principios y directrices b&#225;sicos sobre el derecho de las 
v&#237;ctimas de violaciones manifiestas de las normas internacionales de derechos humanos y de 
violaciones graves del derecho internacional humanitario a interponer recursos y obtener 
reparaciones. 
</p>
<p> En el caso Guridi c. Espa&#241;a, el Comit&#233; contra la Tortura, determin&#243; que, pese al pago, se 
hab&#237;a producido una violaci&#243;n del art&#237;culo 14, al considerar que la reparaci&#243;n deb&#237;a cubrir todos 
los da&#241;os ocasionados a la v&#237;ctima, en particular la restituci&#243;n, la indemnizaci&#243;n y la 
rehabilitaci&#243;n de la v&#237;ctima, as&#237; como medidas para garantizar la no repetici&#243;n de las violaciones, 
teniendo siempre en cuenta las circunstancias de cada caso. 
</p>
<p> Los Estados se comprometen a establecer instituciones adecuadas (instituciones 
principalmente judiciales, por ejemplo, de &#237;ndole penal, civil, constitucional, o tribunales 
especiales de derechos humanos y tambi&#233;n instituciones nacionales de derechos humanos y 
organismos de rehabilitaci&#243;n para los casos de tortura) que permitan obtener reparaci&#243;n a las 
v&#237;ctimas de la tortura.  </p>

</p>
<p> Quisi&#233;ramos hacer referencia al Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, cuyo 
articulo 2.3 garantiza el derecho a la protecci&#243;n y recurso efectivos contra todo acto de 
discriminaci&#243;n, incluidos bajo el articulo 6 que afirma que &#8220;b) La autoridad competente, judicial, 
administrativa o legislativa, o cualquiera otra autoridad competente prevista por el sistema legal 
del Estado, decidir&#225; sobre los derechos de toda persona que interponga tal recurso, y desarrollar&#225; 
las posibilidades de recurso judicial.&#8221;  
 Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre los 
Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, 
arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y 
Social. En particular, el principio 20 establece que las familias y las personas que est&#233;n a cargo 
de las v&#237;ctimas de ejecuciones extrajudiciales, arbitrarias o sumarias tendr&#225;n derecho a recibir, 
dentro de un plazo razonable, una compensaci&#243;n justa y suficiente. En caso de que sus 
investigaciones apoyen o sugieren la exactitud de las alegaciones mencionadas m&#225;s arriba, 
quisiera instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas necesarias para el resarcimiento a las 
v&#237;ctimas de tortura o ejecuciones. 
 Es nuestra responsabilidad de acuerdo con los mandatos que nos ha entregado el Consejo 
de Derechos Humanos, y esta reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, 
intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n. En nuestro deber de 
informar sobre esos casos al Consejo de Derechos Humanos, estar&#237;amos muy agradecidos de 
tener su cooperaci&#243;n y sus observaciones sobre los asuntos siguientes: 
</p>
<p> 1. &#191;Son exactos los hechos a los que se refieren las alegaciones?

<p><b> (b) Avance del Trabajo de la CONREVIP 
</b> En este marco legal, la CONREVIP en cumplimiento de la Ley N&#176; 2640 y de su Decreto 
Reglamentario N&#176; 28015, inicio el procedimiento administrativo, reci&#233;n a partir del 1 de marzo 
de 2005, con la recepci&#243;n de solicitudes provisionales de eventuales beneficiarios del 
resarcimiento excepcional posteriormente en fecha 22 de noviembre de 2005: prosigui&#243; con la 
recepci&#243;n de solicitudes definitivas adem&#225;s de la prueba correspondiente, habiendo registrado 
un total de 6727 solicitudes, posteriormente en fecha 05 de Diciembre de 2005 se promulg&#243; la 
Ley 3275, por la que se abre un nuevo plaza para el registro de solicitudes que abarca del 12 de 
enero al 7 de abril de 2006, por 1o que adicionalmente se recibieron 1236 solicitudes sumando 
un total de 7563 solicitudes. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo de 7963 solicitudes, se depuraron 1860 solicitudes por doble registro, falta de 
declaraci&#243;n jurada y falta de presentaci&#243;n de documentos, quedando registrados oficialmente 
6221 solicitudes. (Este trabajo se realizo desde enero del 2007 hasta noviembre 2007). 
 La clasificaci&#243;n finalizada de los expedientes por Hechos Resarcibles corresponde 
al siguiente detalle: Desaparici&#243;n Forzada; 63 solicitudes, Muerte: 233 solicitudes, 
Exilio: 1451 solicitudes, Detenci&#243;n: 3521 solicitudes, Persecuci&#243;n: 816 solicitudes,  
Tortura: 17 solicitudes, lesiones; 120 solicitudes, siendo un total de 6221 expedientes en total. 
</p>
<p> Esta clasificaci&#243;n par los hechos resarcibles de persecuci&#243;n, detenci&#243;n y exilio, son 
m&#250;ltiples es decir que en cada solicitud existe mas de un hecho resarcible solicitado. 
</p>
<p> Se delega mediante Resoluci&#243;n Ministerial 026108, de fecha 05 de marzo del presente a 
diferentes reparticiones del Ministerio de Justicia a nivel nacional la facultad de notificar con las 
Resoluciones a las victimas solicitantes. 
</p>
<p> A partir del 5 de noviembre la Comisi&#243;n Nacional tiene 60 d&#237;as h&#225;biles para emitir 
resoluciones expresas y motivadas para cada caso. (Hasta el 30 de enero de 2008), se emitieron 
aproximadamente el 20% de Resoluciones expresas y motivadas de los diferentes hechos 
resarcibles. Se han recibido 152 solicitudes de reconsideraci&#243;n de los diferentes hechos 
resarcibles. 
</p>
<p> En cuanto a los hechos resarcibles de Desaparici&#243;n Forzada se han notificado en primera 
instancia 44 Resoluciones, de Muerte se han notificado 139 Resoluciones, Persecuci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica 
Sindical 64 Resoluciones y 79 con resoluci&#243;n de reconsideraci&#243;n de los distintos hechos 
resarcibles, este hecho es producto a que los solicitantes no se han apersonado a las oficinas de 
CONREVIP o a las delegaciones en el interior del pa&#237;s para notificarse. 
</p>
<p> El Ministerio de Justicia ha realizado todas las acciones necesarias tendientes al 
cumplimiento de la ley 2640, pese a que no se ha cumplido, con el 100% del trabajo el mismo se 
debe a la falta de mayor cantidad de recursos humanos en el equipo de apoyo t&#233;cnico y a la 
imposibilidad del trabajo a tiempo completo de la mayor&#237;a de los miembros que conforman la 
CCNREVIP, pese a ello se sigue adelante con este trabajo para lo cual se ha tomado medidas 
internas tendientes a la agilizaci&#243;n del proceso de calificaci&#243;n. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Se debe aclarar que el resarcimiento econ&#243;mico se har&#225; efectivo una vez emitida las 
Resoluciones finales que determine si es procedente la solicitud de resarcimiento excepcional, 
elabor&#225;ndose un Decreto Supremo que determine la lista oficial de beneficiarios y el monto qua 
recibir&#225;n las victimas, hecho que es valorado en consideraci&#243;n al grado de violencia pol&#237;tica 
sufrida por la victima, los hechos resarcibles solicitados y las agravantes si fuera el caso, por lo 
que se requiere agotar todas las v&#237;as administrativas (Resoluci&#243;n de primera instancia y 
reconsideraci&#243;n) para establecer la lista oficial de los beneficiarios y el monto individual de 
resarcimiento. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo se debe ser enf&#225;tico que la Ley 2640 en su disposici&#243;n transitoria segunda 
establece que la CQNREVIP se extinguir&#225; de pleno derecho concluida que sea su labor para la 
que fue creada. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Acciones del Ministerio do Justicia para conseguir financiamiento del 80% 
</b> En cumplimiento de lo establecido por el art, 16 de la Ley 2640, se ha elaborado un 
proyecto para gestionar financiamiento que garantice el 80% del pago a los beneficiarios de la 
Ley, asimismo desde el mes de agosto del 2006 se ha gestionado la Cooperaci&#243;n Internacional,

<p><b>Brazil:  Killing of human rights defender Manoel Mattos 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>:<b> </b>Deaths due to the attacks or killings by security forces of the State, or by 
paramilitary groups, death squads, or other private forces cooperating with or tolerated by the 
State  
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:<b> </b>1 male (HRD)

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of Brazil 
regarding the killing of Manoel Mattos and regarding the Government&#8217;s efforts to identify, 
investigate and prosecute &#8220;death squad&#8221; members. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to 
receiving the report of the investigation into Mr. Mattos&#8217; death, including any investigation 
conducted at the federal level of the Government. The Special Rapporteur also looks forward to 
receiving information about the prosecution of each alleged perpetrator and about any sentences 
imposed.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 30 January 2009</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders <b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning the killing of Mr. <b>Manoel Mattos</b>, vice-president of 
the workers&#8217; party in the state of Pernambuco and member of the local bar association&#8217;s human 
rights commission. Mr. Manoel Mattos was the subject of a communication sent by the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
1 December 2006. No response from the Government of Your Excellency has been received. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 24 January 2009, Mr. Manoel Mattos was reportedly shot dead at his home by two 
unidentified men. Mr. Mattos was the subject of repeated death threats following his 
testimony at a federal parliamentary enquiry into death squads in the north-east of Brazil, 
revealing how these armed groups operated in the border area between the states of 
Pernambuco and Para&#237;ba. He notably produced a document, in collaboration with the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office, in which he exposed over alleged 100 homicides by member of local 
death squads. Mr. Mattos also delivered a testimony to Ms. Asma Jahangir, the then UN 
Special Rapporteur on Summary, Arbitrary and Extra-Judicial executions during her visit 
to Brazil in 2003.  
</p>
<p>It is reported that despite the repeated threats, the protection provided by the federal police 
to Mr Santos was withdrawn, reportedly because it was deemed to be no longer necessary. 
</p>
<p> Grave concern is expressed that the killing of Mr. Manoel Mattos may be linked to his 
non-violent activities in defense of human rights.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to refer 
Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles applicable under international law 
to this case. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that 
every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected 
by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p> As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted in a 
report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give rise to 
State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate measures to 
deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In Resolution 8/3 on the 
&#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), 
the Human Rights Council reiterates that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The 
Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to adopt all necessary measures, 
including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the 
recurrence of such executions as stated in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions&#8221;. In particular, we would like to 
refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to principles 4 which obliges Governments to guarantee 
effective protection through judicial or other means to individuals and groups who are in danger 
of extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions, including those who receive death threats. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental 
principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have 
the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221;  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would like also to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to ensure the right to freedom of association, as recognized in article 22 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to 
freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the 
protection of his interests&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 6 points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate 
means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 12 paras. 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de 
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. 
In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in association with others, to 
be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing, through 
peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by omission, attributable to States 
that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of 
violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged on behalf of Mr. Mattos? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation 
to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why. 
</p>
<p> 4. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details 
of any prosecutions which will be undertaken. Will penal sanctions be imposed on the alleged 
perpetrators? </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 5. Please indicate the reason(s) why the police protection was removed despite the 
repeated death threats against Mr. Mattos. Will this decision be the object of an inquiry and if so 
will those deemed to be responsible be held accountable? 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government of Brazil dated 7 April 2009 
</b></p>
<p> I refer to the document n.34 dated 02 February 2009, which forwards correspondence from 
the UN Special Rapporteur on Extra judicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions, Philip Alston, 
of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Freedom of Opinion and 
Expression, Frank La Rue, and of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of the Human 
Rights Defenders, Margaret Sekaggya, requesting information concerning the killing of 
Manoel de Mattos. Our Secretariat contacted the Federal Police and the Secretariat for Public 
Security and Social Defense of the State of Para&#237;ba. As per the information received; please find 
below the answers to the questions made by the Special Rapporteurs: 
</p>
<p> 2. The answer to the first question - on the accuracy of the facts denounced - is partially 
affirmative. Manoel Mattos was receiving death threats because of the denouncing and the 
investigation that he was conducting regarding a death squad, composed of policemen 
operational in the cities of Itamb&#233; and Pedras de Fogo, on the border between the States of 
Pernambuco and Para&#237;ba. This attorney, then, counted on the protection of the Federal Police 
until March 31, 2004, when the service was suspended due to disagreements between him and 
the policemen who where protecting him. These policemen alleged that Matzos had disobeyed 
the protection rules established by the relevant protection scheme. 
</p>
<p> 3. The decision to suspend the protection afforded to Mr. Manos was a result of 
administrative procedures established by the Federal Police. Therefore, the statement that the 
protection was suspended because it was deemed unnecessary is not accurate. This fact also 
gives an answer to the fifth question proposed. Furthermore, worthy mentioning that, since 2006, 
when the Human Rights Defenders&#8217; Protection Program was implemented in the State of 
Pernambuco, the mentioned defender has never requested his inclusion in this program. 
</p>
<p> 4. In response to the second and the third questions, the investigation on this killing 
is being conducted by the Civil Police of Paraiba, where the homicide took place, with 
the cooperation of the Federal Police and the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The inquiry 
number 002.2009.000127-8 was established before the Para&#237;ba&#8217;s State Court of Justice, which 
is carried out under confidentiality (secret of justice). Worthy underscoring that the Human 
Rights Defense Council of the Pernambuco State has filed a request of federalization of the 
investigation to the Attorney-General of the Republic. It is then incumbent to the Attorney 
General of Republic to submit a request, before the Superior Court of Justice (STT) the 
competence, from the Para&#237;ba&#8217;s state Court of Justice to the Federal counterpart. 
</p>
<p> 5. Concerning the perpetrators - object of the forth question - the main involved in the 
crime have already been identified and criminally charged. Four of them are under arrest and one 
of them is under an arrest warrant issued. Finally, it is worth informing on the efforts that have 
been made in order to promote more integration between the Federal Police and the State 
Secretariats for Security and Social Defense of Para&#237;ba and Pernambuco, in order to identify all 
the members of the &#8220;death squad&#8221;. In this regard, it is possible to mention the results of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>investigations in the area conducted by the Federal Police: &#8220;Opera&#231;&#227;o Alcaides?&#8217;, which 
repressed, among other crimes, the involvement of political leaders in the region of Aguas Belas 
with the hired killing; &#8220;Opera&#231;&#227;o Aveloz&#8221;, which has curbed the activity of the death squads in 
the city of Caruaru; and the &#8220; Opera&#231;&#227;o Exodus&#8221;; which has dismantled the action of armed 
militias involving civil and military policemen in robbery and murdering in the city of Olinda.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Brazil has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 28 August 2008</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders  
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning the <b>criminalization of the <i>Movimento dos Tarabalhadores Rurias 
Sem Terra</i></b>  (MST - Landless Workers Social Movement), a non-governmental organization 
dedicated to the defense of land rights for peasant workers in Brazil, as well as concerning the 
killing of another MST leader, <b>Eli Dallemole</b>. Mandate holders have sent nine previous 
communications to your Government regarding members of the MST since 2005. While we 
welcome the response from your Government on 9 January 2007 regarding a communication 
sent on 11 October 2006, we are concerned that no other responses have been received, 
especially given that five of the nine communications sent have been in relation to killings of 
MST members in the last two years.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p>On 25 June 2007, the Superior Council of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the State 
Rio Grande do Sul opened administrative procedures into the activities of the MST. On 
3 December 2007, the Superior Council of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office unanimously 
approved a report which expressed the intention to dissolve the MST and to declare it 
illegal; to suspend marches and other mass demonstrations of the MST; to investigate 
organized crime, as well as the use of public funds and official aid in criminal and 
administrative spheres, among MST leaders and members; to work towards the closure of 
MST settlements near Coqueiros Farm and settlements being used as bases to invade 
private properties; to conduct electoral investigations in areas where there are MST 
settlements and cancel electoral cards if any irregularity is observed.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>A complaint was also filed against MST leaders of settlements near Coqueiros Farm in the 
municipality of Coqueiros do Sul by the Federal General Attorney&#8217;s Office. The complaint 
was based on the arguments of a landowner in Coqueiros do Sul regarding the Homeland 
Security Law. It accused the MST of wanting to change the Rule of Law and undo public 
order, and of having ties with guerrilla groups such as the Fuerzas Armadas 
Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). However, in 2007, a Federal Police investigation 
found that there were no ties between the MST and FARC or any other guerrilla groups. 
Moreover the Homeland Security Law was passed during the military dictatorship in 
Brazil, met subsequent amendments and criminalizes prodemocracy behavior such as 
forming anti-dictatorship associations, and advertising change of the existing political 
order. 
</p>
<p>This year, hundreds of people have been ill-treated in police searches forcefully evicted 
from MST settlements. The most recent eviction took place on 29 July 2008 when 
43 families were relocated to a potentially dangerous area.  
</p>
<p>The legal actions against the MST continue to be paralleled by killings of MST leaders 
perpetrated by gunmen suspected to be linked to associations of landholders. On 
30 March 2008, around 7.30 p.m., masked men entered the home of Eli Dallemole, a 
leader of the MST in Paran&#225;, at the Assentamento Liberta&#231;ao Camponesa) in Ortigueira in 
Paran&#225; State, and killed him in front of his wife and children. This murder had been 
preceded by repeated threats during the last two years and a previous assassination attempt. 
A man known as &#8220;Zezinho&#8221; has been arrested on suspicion of being one of the gunmen. 
Zezinho is the commander of an armed group financed by large landowners. 
</p>
<p>On 21 October 2007, an armed militia had killed another MST leader, Valmir Mota 
de Oliveira, in Santa Tereza do Oeste, Paran&#225; State (see our communication to your 
Government of 26 October 2007 which regrettably remains without a reply as of today). 
</p>
<p> Concern is expressed that the legal action taken against the MST may be related to its 
activities in the defense of the rights of the landless rural workers. We are also concerned, that 
such legal action against MST increases the vulnerability of its leaders and members to armed 
violence, including assassinations by hired gunmen. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to refer 
Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 
and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to 
promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility 
and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the 
social, economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that 
all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all 
those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 5 point a) which establishes that for the purpose of promoting and protecting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others, at the national and international levels, to meet or assemble 
peacefully. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 5 points b) and c) which provide that for the purpose of promoting and 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right to form, join 
and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups, and to 
communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, 
de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. 
In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in association with others, to 
be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing, through 
peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by omission, attributable to States 
that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of 
violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p> We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the MST leaders and membership, in 
accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right 
shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of 
his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> We would further like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure the right to freedom of association, as recognized in article 22 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to 
freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the 
protection of his interests&#8221;. In her 2004 report (A/59/401), the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders made a number of 
recommendations on good practices on NGOs regulations. We would particularly encourage 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to implement the following recommendations of paragraph 82 of 
the report: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(s) Dissolution. Actions by the Government against NGOs must be proportionate 
and subject to appeal and judicial review. Administrative irregularities or non-essential 
changes in the specifics of an organization should never be considered as sufficient 
grounds for closing down an organization&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Regarding the killing of Eli Dallemole, we would like to bring to your attention the 
Government&#8217;s duty to thoroughly, promptly and impartially investigate suspected cases of 
extrajudicial execution, and to prosecute and punish all violations of the right to life. As 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council in resolution 8/3 on &#8220;The Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigation into all suspected cases 
of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to justice those 
responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in 
order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This 
obligation, affirmed also in the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee (see the 
Committee&#8217;s views in Arhuacos v. Colombia, Communication no. 612/1995, &#167; 8.8), is indeed 
part and parcel of the obligation to respect and protect the right to life enshrined in Article 6 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> With respect to the prior death threats against Eli Dallemole, and the continuing death 
threats to other members of the MST leadership, we would like to bring to your attention that 
Article 6(1) of the ICCPR requires States to provide effective protection to those whose lives are 
in danger. As expressed in Principle 4 of the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, this requires that individuals in 
danger of such executions, including those who receive death threats, be guaranteed effective 
protection through judicial or other means. We urge your government to immediately take all 
necessary steps, as required under international law, to protect the right to life of the members 
and leaders of the MST. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and that accountability of any person 
guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopts 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide information on how the right to due process as established in 
international norms and standards was respected in the Superior Council of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office&#8217;s findings regarding the MST. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide details on the protective measures in place to ensure the physical and 
psychological security of all members of the MST. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide information on the investigations and criminal proceedings regarding 
the murders of Eli Dallemole and Valmir Mota de Oliveira. </p>

<p> Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial esp&#232;re recevoir une r&#233;ponse substantielle au sujet du d&#233;c&#232;s de 
139 ersonnes au cours de manifestations qui ont eu lieu entre le 25 et le 29 F&#233;vrier 2008.

</p>
<p> A cet &#233;gard, nous souhaiterions attirer l&#8217;attention de votre Gouvernement sur les 
affrontements qui ont oppos&#233;s les forces de police camerounaises &#224; des manifestants, entre le 25 
et le 29 f&#233;vrier 2008. Selon les informations que nous avons re&#231;ues, 139 personnes auraient 
perdues la vie au cours de ces manifestations. Un projet de modification constitutionnel, 
conjugu&#233; &#224; la hausse des prix des carburants et des denr&#233;es alimentaires, aurait pouss&#233; une partie 
de la population &#224; manifester. Au total, 31 villes auraient &#233;t&#233; touch&#233;es par ces manifestations. 
</p>
<p> Selon les informations re&#231;ues:  
</p>
<p>L&#8217;arm&#233;e et des forces sp&#233;ciales d&#8217;intervention ont &#233;t&#233; appel&#233;es en renfort de la police afin 
de conduire certaines op&#233;rations de maintien de l&#8217;ordre. Ceux-ci ont utilis&#233;s des armes 
telles que des camions lance eau, du gaz lacrymog&#232;ne et des grenades assourdissantes. 
Plusieurs intervenants poss&#233;daient &#233;galement des matraques, des boucliers et des armes &#224; 
feu. Certains t&#233;moignages font &#233;tat de l&#8217;utilisation de pistolets et de mitrailleuses l&#233;g&#232;res, 
positionn&#233;es sur des pick-up, notamment dans la r&#233;gion de Bonab&#233;ri et de Kumba. Ces 
armes ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;guli&#232;rement utilis&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;encontre de manifestants. Plusieurs individus ont 
&#233;t&#233; tu&#233;s par des forces de s&#233;curit&#233;, sans sommations pr&#233;alables et de mani&#232;re indiscrimin&#233;e.  
</p>
<p>Le 25 f&#233;vrier 2008, <b>un d&#233;c&#232;s par</b> balle est survenu au cours d&#8217;un affrontement entre des 
gendarmes et certains manifestants &#224; Douala. Apr&#232;s que des gaz lacrymog&#232;nes furent 
lanc&#233;s sur des manifestants qui br&#251;laient des pneus, une femme gendarme a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;sarm&#233;e 
par la foule et bri&#232;vement s&#233;questr&#233;e. Lorsque des renforts sont arriv&#233;s, les forces de 
l&#8217;ordre ont tir&#233; &#224; balle r&#233;elle sur la foule, bien qu&#8217;ils aient eu les mains en l&#8217;air et qu&#8217;ils 
aient d&#233;j&#224; rel&#226;ch&#233; la gendarme. 
Une <b>vingtaine de personnes</b> ont perdu la vie lors d&#8217;une marche pacifique regroupant des 
milliers de jeunes, qui avait pour objectif la rencontre du gouverneur de la province du 
Littoral, le 27 f&#233;vrier 2008. Apr&#232;s avoir &#233;t&#233; &#171; escort&#233;s &#187; par le sous-pr&#233;fet de 
l&#8217;arrondissement de Daouala IV e jusqu&#8217;au pont du Wouri, les forces de l&#8217;ordre ont 
attaqu&#233; les manifestants. Des gaz lacrymog&#232;nes furent lanc&#233;s dans la foule, aid&#233;s par des 
h&#233;licopt&#232;res d&#233;ploy&#233;s pour cette occasion. Des balles r&#233;elles ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; tir&#233;es par 
des membres des forces de l&#8217;ordre. Certains manifestants ont &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s, d&#8217;autres se sont 
jet&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;eau afin d&#8217;&#233;viter les gaz, les balles et les pi&#233;tinements. Plusieurs se sont noy&#233;s </p>

</p>
<p>faute de savoir nager. Les jeunes arr&#234;t&#233;s furent victimes de mauvais traitement; les soldats 
leur ont march&#233;s dessus et les ont frapp&#233;s avec les pieds et divers instruments, tel que 
crosses, matraques. 
</p>
<p>Le 27 f&#233;vrier 2008, <b>cinq jeunes</b> ont tu&#233;s par balles &#224; Bafoussam, par des forces de l&#8217;ordre. 
Ceux-ci ont r&#233;pondu &#224; des jets de pierres lanc&#233;s par les victimes. Le m&#234;me jour, &#224; Kumba, 
alors qu&#8217;aucune manifestation n&#8217;avait lieue, des militaires ont ouvert le feu sur des 
personnes marchant en groupe de plus de trois, ce qui a caus&#233; la mort de trois individus. 
</p>
<p>Des militaires et des &#233;l&#233;ments du Groupement sp&#233;cial d&#8217;intervention, patrouillant le secteur 
du quartier de Ndogpassi 3, &#224; Douala, auraient tir&#233;s indistinctement sur plusieurs individus 
le 27 f&#233;vrier 2008, avant d&#8217;atteindre mortellement deux personnes. 
</p>
<p>Les causes de d&#233;c&#232;s de certaines victimes des affrontements auraient &#233;t&#233; dissimul&#233;es. Peu 
de certificats de genre de mort, qui permettent d&#8217;obtenir un certificat de d&#233;c&#232;s, ont pu &#234;tre 
obtenus par les familles des victimes. Certains documents seraient &#233;galement erron&#233;s et 
pr&#233;senteraient les causes de d&#233;c&#232;s comme de simples traumatismes.  
</p>
<p> Sans vouloir &#224; ce stade nous prononcer sur les faits qui nous ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, nous 
souhaiterions n&#233;anmoins intervenir aupr&#232;s de votre Excellence afin de tirer au clair les 
circonstances ayant provoqu&#233; les faits all&#233;gu&#233;s ci-dessus et ce, conform&#233;ment aux dispositions 
pertinentes de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de l&#8217;Homme et du Pacte international relatif 
aux droits civils et politiques. 
</p>
<p> Nous aimerions rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence les principes fondamentaux 
&#233;nonc&#233;s par l&#8217;article 3 de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de l&#8217;Homme et r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;s par 
l&#8217;article 6 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, o&#249; il est stipul&#233; que tout 
individu a le droit &#224; la vie et &#224; la s&#251;ret&#233; de sa personne, que ce droit doit &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233; par la loi, et 
que nul ne peut &#234;tre arbitrairement priv&#233; de la vie. 
</p>
<p> Nous voudrions &#233;galement rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence l&#8217;applicabilit&#233; 
dans de telles situations des Principes de base sur le recours &#224; la force et l&#8217;utilisation des armes &#224; 
feu par les responsables de l&#8217;application des lois, r&#233;solution 1989/65 du 24 mai 1989 du Conseil 
&#233;conomique et social. Ceux-ci pr&#233;voient que les responsables de l&#8217;application des lois, dans 
l&#8217;accomplissement de leurs fonctions, auront recours autant que possible &#224; des moyens 
non-violents, en d&#233;limitant le recours &#224; la force &#224; certains cas exceptionnels comme la l&#233;gitime 
d&#233;fense ou pour d&#233;fendre des tiers contre une menace imminente de mort ou de blessure grave. 
Nous souhaiterions &#233;galement attirer votre attention sur le Code de conduite pour les 
responsables de l&#8217;application des lois, r&#233;solution 34/169 du 17 d&#233;cembre 1979 de l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e 
g&#233;n&#233;rale qui stipule que les responsables de l&#8217;application des lois peuvent recourir &#224; la force 
seulement lorsque cela est strictement n&#233;cessaire et dans la mesure exig&#233;e par l&#8217;accomplissement 
de leurs fonctions.  
</p>
<p> Par ailleurs nous prions votre Gouvernement de diligenter une enqu&#234;te sur les morts qui 
ont eu lieu entre le 25 et le 29 f&#233;vrier 2008, au cours des affrontements entre les forces de police 
camerounaises et les manifestants, et de traduire les responsables en justice s&#8217;il est d&#233;termin&#233; que 
les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; ont eu recours &#224; un usage excessif de la force, conform&#233;ment aux principes </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of China 
with respect to the events of March 2008. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
Government still has not provided detailed information about the deaths of the 18 persons 
referred to in the Government&#8217;s response.  
</p>
<p> Specifically, the Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving information on the 
investigations of each of those deaths, including the role, if any, of police and security forces, 
and the measures police and security forces took to avoid the loss of life. He would also 
appreciate receiving a copy of the report by the Aba police, published by the national police, 
regarding the Aba police officers&#8217; firing of weapons and injury of rioters on 16 March 2008. The 
Special Rapporteur would also request information from the Government about any independent 
investigation into the events of 16 March 2008. Finally, the Special Rapporteur looks forward to 
receiving reports of the investigations that were still in progress at the time of the Government&#8217;s 
response. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 20 March 2008</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received with regard to <b>reports of violence during demonstrations in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region and surrounding areas in China</b>, <b>killings of an unconfirmed number 
of people and arrests of hundreds of demonstrators</b>.  
</p>
<p> According to allegations received: 
</p>
<p>On 10 March 2008, demonstrations led by monks were organised demanding greater 
freedom of religion and the release of monks detained since October 2007. It is reported 
that 300 monks from Drepung Monastery, near Lhasa, proceeded with a peaceful march 
towards the Potala Palace when they were stopped by the police. It is believed that around 
<b>60 monks</b> suspected to be the leaders of the protest were arrested by the Public Security 
Bureau (PSB). 
</p>
<p>Sixteen people, including 15 visiting students monks in Sera Monastery, identified 
as <b>Lobsang</b>, aged 15, <b>Lobsang Thukjey</b>, aged 19, <b>Tsultrim Palden</b>, aged 20, 
<b>Lobsher</b>, aged 20, <b>Phurdan</b>, aged 22, <b>Thubdron</b>, aged 24, <b>Lodroe</b>, aged 30, and </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Lobsang Ngodrub</b>, aged 29, from Onpo Monastery, Sichuan Province; <b>Zoepa</b>, aged 30, 
from Mangye Monastery; <b>Trulku Tenpa Rigsang</b>, aged 26, <b>Gelek Pel</b>, aged 32, and 
<b>Samten</b>, aged 17 from Lungkar Monastery, Qinghai Province; <b>Pema Karwang</b>, aged 30 
and <b>Thubwang</b>, aged 30, from Darthang Monastery; and <b>Tsegyam</b>, aged 22, from Kashi 
Monastery led a march on Barkhor Street in Lhasa, distributing pamphlets and raising 
Tibetan flags. It is reported that they were arrested by the People&#8217;s Armed Police. 
Additional contingents of armed forces were then stationed in the area, and the police 
blocked roads and encircled Drepung and Sera monasteries around Lhasa to prevent further 
protests from taking place.  
</p>
<p>On the same day, about 350 people, including 137 monks from Lhutsang Monastery in the 
Tibetan area of Amdo in Mangra County, organised a protest in front of the Mangra 
County Assembly Hall where a government-sponsored show was taking place. The protest 
was stopped by the People&#8217;s Armed Police. A number of arrests took place during the 
disruption of the protest, but no information on the whereabouts of the arrested monks has 
been received.  
</p>
<p>Reports indicate that on 11 March, 500 to 600 monks from the Sera Monastery called for 
the release of the monks arrested the day before and began a march towards Lhasa, but 
were met on the way by approximately 2,000 armed police. The crowd was reportedly 
dispersed with tear-gas. A number of monks were detained and then released.  
</p>
<p>On 11 March, the police surrounded and sealed off Ditsa Monastery in Hualong County in 
Qinghai Province after the monks held a protest. 
</p>
<p>On 14 March, violent incidents were reported in Lhasa as tension escalated between 
hundreds of demonstrators and police forces. Gunfire was heard in the streets, and shops 
and cars were set on fire. Allegations that a significant number of Tibetans and Han and 
Hui Chinese have been killed during the demonstrations have been received. Monks from 
Ganden and Reting monasteries joined the demonstrations, and the two monasteries were 
later sealed off by police. A number of monks from Sera Monastery started a hunger strike 
to protest against the sealing off of monasteries and the detention of monks.  
</p>
<p>Reports indicate that, in particular since 14 March, the wave of demonstrations by monks 
and lay people has spread in the whole Tibet Autonomous Region and in neighbouring 
provinces. These demonstrations have reportedly sometimes been violently repressed, in 
many cases leading to arrests of demonstrators. Allegations were received that since 
14 March, the People&#8217;s Liberation Army has been patrolling the streets of Lhasa. 
</p>
<p>On 15 March, shooting was reported inside the compound of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in 
Shigatse, and at least 40 lay people demonstrating around the monastery were arrested. The 
next day, monks trying to escape the Kirti Monastery in Amdo in the Sichuan Province, 
which had been sealed off by the military, have allegedly been shot at; tear-gas was 
reportedly used on the demonstrators supporting the monks outside the monastery, and 
many demonstrators were severely beaten by the police. The police is then alleged to have 
shot into the crowd, killing and injuring a considerable but unconfirmed number of people. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 17 March, students of Marthang Nationality Middle School in Hongyuan xian County, 
Aba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, aged between 14 and 20, started a protest inside the 
school. PSB officials blocked the entrance and beat the students while they were trying to 
come out of the school. Approximately 40 students are said to have been arrested. Around 
700 students then staged a demonstration outside the Hongyuan xian County PSB office to 
protest against the detention of fellow students. 
</p>
<p>Since 10 March, it is reported that raids in the homes of people formerly imprisoned for 
their political opinions have taken place. Since 15 March, house-to-house searches are 
allegedly being carried out in Lhasa, with CDs and printed material being confiscated, and 
people being taken in custody. It is reported that on 15 March, at least 600 people had been 
arrested in Lhasa, either as a result of a house search or during demonstrations. Three 
hundred additional people were reportedly arrested on 16 March. 
</p>
<p>Reports indicate that on 13 March, the Lhasa Foreign Bureau Office has issued a warning 
to non-governmental organisations that any information given to foreigners regarding the 
protests could result in strict legal action against the concerned individuals and 
organisations, including the closing down of the latter. 
</p>
<p>On 17 March the authorities deported approximately 15 journalists from at least six 
Hong Kong television, radio and print organisations, accusing them of &#8220;illegal reporting&#8221; 
and of illegally shooting films of People&#8217;s Liberation Army soldiers. The journalists were 
escorted to the airport and put on a plane to Chengdu in Sichuan Province, and the police is 
alleged to have looked into the journalists computers and video footages. The authorities 
allegedly refused to grant permits to allow foreign journalists to travel to the Tibet 
Autonomous Region as from 12 March, and are reported to have ordered them out of the 
Tibetan parts of Gansu and Qinghai provinces on 16 March, the police reportedly saying 
that it was for their safety. Further reports indicate that within the country, video-sharing 
websites as well as news websites are inaccessible and that international news broadcasts 
are being cut when showing reports of the events in the Tibet Autonomous Region and 
surrounding areas in China.  
</p>
<p>On 15 March, the Tibet Autonomous Region High People&#8217;s Court, Tibet Autonomous 
Region High People&#8217;s Procuratorate, and Tibet Autonomous Region Public Security 
Department issued a notice, asking that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. Those who on their own volition submit themselves to police or judicial offices prior 
to midnight on 17 March shall be punished lightly or dealt mitigated punishment; those 
who surrender themselves and report on other criminal elements will be performing 
meritorious acts and may escape punishment. Criminal elements who do not submit 
themselves in time shall be punished severely according to law. 
</p>
<p>2. Those who harbour or hide criminal elements shall be punished severely according to 
law upon completion of investigations. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. Those citizens who actively report and expose the criminal behaviour of criminal 
elements shall receive personal protection, and granted commendations and awards.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>According to the latest information received, demonstrations continue to take place, both in 
the Tibet Autonomous Region and neighbouring provinces, despite the official notice. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to secure the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in 
article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of 
all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through 
any other media of his choice.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> We would like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to 
ensure the right of peaceful assembly as recognized in article 20 (1) of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone has the right to peaceful assembly and 
association&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the 
circumstances regarding the case of the persons named above. We would like to stress that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. 
This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> In this connection we would like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
fundamental principle set forth in Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which 
provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person. I would also note 
the relevance in such situations of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by 
Law Officials. Principle 4 provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, 
shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and 
firearms.&#8221; Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms is 
unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in 
proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate object to be achieved; 
(b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance 
and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment 
and (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the 
earliest possible moment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 of 
Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights which, &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all Governments to implement fully the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; </p>

<p> We would like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure the right to freedom 
of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and 
article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> We would like to call your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the principle 
enunciated in Article 19 of the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of 
Expression and Access to Information, as endorsed in E/CN.4/1996/39 of 1996, whereby any 
restriction on the free flow of information may not be of such a nature as to thwart the purposes 
of human rights and humanitarian law. In particular, governments may not prevent journalists or 
representatives of intergovernmental or non-governmental organizations with a mandate to 
monitor adherence to human rights or humanitarian standards from entering areas where there 
are reasonable grounds to believe that violations of human rights or humanitarian law are being, 
or have been, committed. Governments may not exclude journalists or representatives of such 
organizations from areas that are experiencing violence or armed conflict except where their 
presence poses a clear risk to the safety of others. 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that 
&#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote 
and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as 
may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other 
fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, 
individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in 
practice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 5 point a) which establishes that for the purpose of promoting and protecting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others, at the national and international levels, to meet or assemble 
peacefully. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 6 points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate 
means, to draw public attention to those matters. </p>

</p>
<p> In March of this year there occurred in Lhasa and other places events that were incorrectly 
described as &#8220;peaceful demonstrations&#8221; but were actually serious acts of criminal violence 
involving beating, the destruction of property, looting and arson. Faced with such violent 
criminal acts, which seriously disrupted public order and did serious damage to human life, 
property and security, no responsible Government could simply sit back and not act. At present, 
the situation in the aforementioned areas has calmed down, and stability and public order have 
been restored. The judicial authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the other areas in 
question are dealing with the criminal suspects severely, in accordance with judicial procedures. 
Those whose offences are lesser and who displayed a positive attitude, acknowledging their 
guilt, have been released. Those whose situations are more serious shall have their criminal 
responsibility investigated in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p> The aforementioned serious violent criminal events were carefully plotted in advance and 
instigated by the Dalai clique. In their handling of the entire incident, the competent authorities 
of the Tibet Autonomous Region and other areas showed great restraint; they enforced the law in 
a civilized manner, and they enjoyed broad popular support. At the international level, however, 
some people have distorted the facts, creating untrue news stories and providing the 
United Nations special procedures with inaccurate information. Tibetan affairs are part of 
China&#8217;s internal affairs; nevertheless, in an effort to help the special procedures learn the truth 
about these events and to prevent the Dalai clique and anti-China elements from exploiting them, 
the competent authorities of the Chinese Government have thoroughly investigated the incidents 
described in the aforementioned letters and wish to make the following reply: 
</p>
<p>1. The truth about the violent criminal events 
</p>
<p> (a) In mid-March 2008, a series of serious violent criminal acts took place in the city of 
Lhasa, in China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region. Starting on 10 March, a group of lawbreakers, 
acting without authorization, gathered illegally to create a disturbance; when police officers 
arrived to dissuade them, in accordance with the law, they clashed with them, cursing them and 
violently attacking the officers with clubs, rocks and knives. At approximately 11 a.m. on 
14 March, some monks at the Ramoche Temple threw stones at the police officers on duty. 
Subsequently, a group of rioters began to gather in Barkhor Street, shouting separatist slogans 
and wantonly beating, smashing and looting. The situation quickly spread. The lawbreakers 
smashed and burned shops, primary and secondary schools, hospitals, banks, electrical and 
communications installations and news agencies along the main streets of Lhasa and set fire to 
cars, chased and beat pedestrians, and attacked stores, telecommunications and Internet outlets 
and Government offices. The rioters&#8217; savage behaviour during these incidents resulted in the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>slashing or burning to death of 18 innocent persons, including an infant less than 1 year old; 
382 innocent persons were also injured, 58 of them seriously. The rioters set fire to 
over 300 sites, burning down 7 schools, 5 hospitals, more than 1,300 stores and 120 homes, 
causing extensive loss of human life and property, and occasioning a direct economic loss of 
280 billion yuan renminbi. Public order in the affected area was severely disrupted. 
</p>
<p> All ethnic minorities in Tibet expressed their great indignation at and severe criticism of 
the violent criminal acts that took place in Lhasa. The Tibet Autonomous Region quickly 
organized the police and other relevant agencies to put out the fires, provide aid to the injured 
and reinforce the security provided to schools, hospitals, banks and Government offices. The 
Chinese Government and the Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region took these measures 
to protect law and order and social stability, and to safeguard the human rights of all ethnic 
groups in Tibet. In dealing with these violent criminal incidents and restoring law and public 
order in accordance with the law, the competent Chinese and Tibetan Government authorities 
exercised the utmost restraint. While enforcing the law they consistently acted in a lawful and 
civilized manner; they did not carry or use any lethal or injurious weapons. The People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army was not involved in the efforts to quell these violent criminal incidents. 
</p>
<p> (b) At 11 a.m. on 16 March 2008, more than 300 monks in Aba, Sichuan Province, 
assaulted and beat police officers, handing out inflammatory flyers and shouting separatist 
slogans; they threw rocks and homemade Molotov cocktails at the police and went on a rampage 
of smashing and burning. At 3 p.m., a group of monks joined with other rioters to once again 
strike Government facilities, schools and police stations, engaging in smashing, looting and 
burning. That day rioters burned down 24 stores and 2 police stations and set fire to 81 police 
and civilian vehicles. Some 200 innocent bystanders, Government workers and police officers 
were injured. 
 Seeking to restore law and order, the local Government immediately took steps to bring the 
situation under control and protect life, property and fundamental human rights. During these 
incidents, law enforcement was carried out in a civilized manner by the local police, who 
consistently displayed a high degree of restraint; even though they had shields to protect 
themselves during the rioters&#8217; brutal attacks, scores of police officers were injured from blows 
and burns, one critically. The Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army did not take part in the response 
to these incidents. 
</p>
<p>2. Questions regarding the use of lethal or injurious weapons 
 In their efforts to deal with the violent criminal acts in the Tibet Autonomous Region in 
accordance with the law and to restore law and order, the local Government authorities exercised 
maximum restraint: law enforcement was consistently carried out in a lawful and civilized 
manner, and no lethal or injurious weapons were carried or used. For this very reason, there 
were only 242 casualties among law enforcement personnel, including 23 seriously injured and 
1 dead. 
</p>
<p> On 16 March, in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Aba, Sichuan Province, rioters 
broke into the Aba Township police station and stabbed the police officers. When the rioters 
stole police firearms from a safe, the police fired warning shots, in accordance with the law, to 
no effect. They were thus compelled to open fire in self-defence, striking and injuring four </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 47 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>rioters, who managed to escape with their co-conspirators in the confusion. Immediately 
afterwards, the officers involved in the incident, acting pursuant to regulations, submitted a 
report to their superiors, which the national police promptly published. The firing of weapons in 
self-defence by the Aba police was fully consistent with the Basic Principles on the Use of Force 
and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted at the Eighth United Nations Congress on 
the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. 
</p>
<p>3. Alleged control of reporting by the media 
</p>
<p> During the violent criminal acts in Lhasa, when public order was severely disrupted and 
rioters were wilfully beating, burning and killing innocent persons, it was not safe for foreign 
reporters in Lhasa to cover the events. Reporters for the British publication The Economist and 
other foreign publications who were at the scene did provide coverage of the events. After the 
situation calmed down, the Chinese Government immediately organized a series of inspection 
tours to Tibet for representatives of 19 foreign media and delegations of foreign diplomats based 
in China. The Chinese media, including the Tibetan regional media, all reported on the events. 
</p>
<p>4. The legal basis for the arrest and detention of monks and nuns 
</p>
<p> In the wake of the destructive events in Lhasa, the competent authorities of China and the 
Tibet Autonomous Region arrested a number of major criminal suspects who had participated in 
the events and had been involved in their organization and plotting. Among these were a number 
of monks and nuns. 
</p>
<p> International human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (art. 29, para. 2), stipulate that &#8220;[i]n the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone 
shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of 
securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just 
requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society&#8221;. During 
the aforementioned incidents the rioters showed absolutely no respect for the rights and freedoms 
of innocent persons but wilfully disrupted public order and harmed the welfare of others. The 
Chinese and Tibetan Regional Governments consider that the lawful measures taken were fully 
consistent with the relevant provisions of international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p> China is a country governed by the rule of law. Everyone is equal before the law, and 
anyone who violates the law shall be liable to punishment in accordance with the law, with no 
distinction made for citizens on account of their religious beliefs. During the violent criminal 
acts that were perpetrated in Lhasa and other locations, a small number of monks and nuns took 
part in unauthorized demonstrations; in the course of these demonstrations they engaged in 
violent activities that led to the death of scores of persons and the injuring of hundreds more; 
they burned and destroyed public property, including numerous homes and schools, they 
advocated separatism, they harmed the State and they jeopardized public safety, seriously 
violating the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions and 
Demonstrations and the Criminal Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The treatment shown 
by China&#8217;s law enforcement and judicial authorities will differ depending on the nature of the 
criminal offence: where the offence is serious, the offender&#8217;s criminal responsibility will be 
ascertained; where the offence is minor, the offender will be provided with education and 
released. This work is already under way. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>5. Investigations, prosecutions and trials 
</p>
<p> In the wake of the violent criminal events that transpired in Lhasa, the law enforcement 
and judicial authorities of China and the Tibet Autonomous Region conducted investigations and 
inquiries in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p> On 29 April 2008, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court held an open trial of 
some of the persons accused of participating in the &#8220;events of 14 March&#8221;. The court found 
30 accused persons (Pasang et al.) guilty of the crimes of arson, looting, instigating fights and 
troublemaking, assembling a group to attack a State organ, disrupting public service and theft. 
The defendants Pasang, Sonam Tsering and Tsering were sentenced to life imprisonment. The 
defendants Jigme, Kalsang Bagdro, Karma Dawa, Dorje, Migmar, Ngawang Choeyang and 
Bagdro were given sentences of fixed-term imprisonment of 15 years and more. The defendants 
Yargyal, Choephel Tashi, Dorje Dargye, Ngawang, Kalsang Tsering, Migmar, Sonam Tsering, 
Kelsang Samten, Tseten, Palsang Tashi, Lhagpa Tsering Chewa (Sr.), Lobsang Tashi, 
Lhagpa Tsering, Darchen, Thubten Gyatso, Tashi Gyatso, Kalsang Dondrub, Tenzin Gyaltsen, 
Kalsang Nyima and Yeshe were given sentences of fixed-term imprisonment ranging from 3 to 
14 years. 
</p>
<p> The court informed the accused that if they refused to accept these judgements they could 
file an appeal with the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court or with the Tibet 
Autonomous Region Supreme People&#8217;s Court within 10 days of the date of service of the 
judgement. 
 China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that People&#8217;s Courts may or should appoint a 
defence counsel in cases where the defendant has not appointed counsel, the case is of great 
social significance, the defendant is totally without financial resources or the court considers that 
the prosecution arguments and evidence submitted may affect the proper determination of the 
severity of the sentence. Accordingly, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court 
appointed defence attorneys for the 30 defendants. The defence arguments presented by these 
lawyers were given full value during the trial proceedings, and the mitigating circumstances that 
they cited in respect of the defendants, which were verified through investigation, were all 
accepted by the court. 
</p>
<p> China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that all citizens who are members of ethnic 
minorities have the right to use their own spoken and written language in an appeal. Of the 
14 open hearings held in the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, the proceedings were 
fully conducted in the Tibetan language in 9, while in the remaining 5 cases, the defendants were 
provided with Tibetan-Chinese interpretation.  
</p>
<p> It has been explained that the costs associated with the defence lawyers and interpreters 
provided for the defendants were entirely borne by the Tibet Autonomous Region Legal Aid 
Centre. 
</p>
<p> On the day of the hearings, more than 300 Lhasa residents, students and monks 
representing all ethnic minorities and all groups within society attended the trials. </p>

</p>
<p> The judicial authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and other localities intend to 
continue their efforts to deal in accordance with the law with the criminal suspects who 
participated in these violent criminal acts. 
</p>
<p>6. Related cases 
</p>
<p> Owing to time constraints and the incomplete nature of the information contained in the 
aforementioned letters, as well as the fact that the investigations being conducted by the Chinese 
authorities concerned are still in progress, China will continue to transmit to the relevant bodies 
information regarding the outcome of these investigations. 
</p>
<p> The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in its 
entirety in the relevant documents of the United Nations.

<p> The Special Rapporteur notes the information provided by the Government of China with 
respect to the events of March 2008. However, the response does not address the alleged use of 
lethal force by security forces and the death of 8 protesters in Zithang Township in Gan Zi Xian, 
Sichuan Province, on 3 April 2008. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the 
circumstances of these deaths and looks forward to receiving from the Government detailed 
information about the exact number of people killed, the circumstances of the deaths and the 
outcome of any investigation into those deaths.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 9 April 2008</b>, sent with the Independent Expert on minority issues, the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to

</p>
<p> A communication with regard to reports of violence during demonstrations, killings of an 
unconfirmed number of people and arrests of hundreds of demonstrators in the Tibetan 
Autonomous Region and surrounding areas in China was issued by the Special Rapporteur on </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 20 March 2008.  
</p>
<p> According to recent information received: 
</p>
<p>On 3 April 2008, at least eight protestors were killed and several injured when security 
forces opened fire during a peaceful protest in Zithang Township in Gan Zi Xian, 
Sichuan Province, calling for the release of two monks previously arrested. Several 
protestors were also arrested. 
</p>
<p>On 28 and 29 March 2008, over 570 Tibetan monks, including some children, were 
arrested following raids by security forces of the Chinese People&#8217;s Armed Police and the 
Public Security Bureau on monasteries in Aba Xian and in Ruanggui/Zoige Xian<b> </b>in the 
Tibetan Autonomous Region. Arrests were made of those suspected of participating in 
protests and those suspected of communicating with the exiled Tibetan communities. 
</p>
<p> Serious concerns are expressed over the aforementioned arrests and detention of, and the 
excessive use of force against, the above-mentioned persons, including reportedly peaceful 
protestors. Further concerns are expressed that independent observers and foreign journalists 
have been restricted from accessing regions in which protests have taken place and that 
limitations have been imposed on the media, including Internet websites, to prohibit the 
dissemination of information throughout China concerning the events in the Tibetan 
Autonomous Region and abroad. 
</p>
<p> Without in any way implying any determination on the facts of the case, we would like to 
refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principle set forth in Article 3 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides that every individual has the right to life 
and security of the person. I would also note the relevance in such situations of the UN Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials. Principle 4 provides that, &#8220;Law 
enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent 
means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221; Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, 
&#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, 
(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the 
legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve 
human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected 
persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the 
injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; 
 Furthermore, without expressing at this stage an opinion on the facts of the case and on 
whether the detention of the above-mentioned persons is arbitrary or not, we would like to 
appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee their right 
not to be deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the 
circumstances regarding the above cases. We would like to stress that each Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set 
forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> We would further like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 of 
Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights which, &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all Governments to implement fully the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental 
principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides 
that &#8220;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to 
hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through 
any media and regardless of frontiers&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We would further like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee the right to peaceful assembly enshrined in Article 20 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone has the right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and association&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We would like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure the right to freedom 
of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and 
article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles 
set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right individually 
or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has 
a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all 
conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal 
guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in 
association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
 Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration:  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 5 point a) which establishes that for the purpose of promoting and protecting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others, at the national and international levels, to meet or assemble 
peacefully. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 6 points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate 
means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 9 para. 1 which establishes that in the exercise of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, including the promotion and protection of human rights as referred to in the 
present Declaration, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, 
to benefit from an effective remedy and to be protected in the event of the violation of 
those rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, 
de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration.  
</p>
<p> In addition, we would like to refer to the 2006 report to the General Assembly (A/61/312) 
of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
and in particular to paragraph 98 which states that &#8220;in conformity with article 15 of the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, the Special Representative urges States to ensure that 
law enforcement agencies and their members are trained in and aware of international human 
rights standards and international standards for the policing of peaceful assemblies, including the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials 
and other relevant treaties, declarations and guidelines. The Special Representative also advises 
all States that all allegations of indiscriminate and/or excessive use of force by law enforcement 
officials should be properly investigated and appropriate action taken against the responsible 
officials&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the role of media and human rights defender in monitoring demonstrations, 
we would like to refer to the 2007 report to the General Assembly of the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders (A/62/225, paras. 91 and 93) 
that underline how &#8220;monitoring of assemblies can provide an impartial and objective account of 
what takes place, including a factual record of the conduct of both participants and law 
enforcement officials. [&#8230;] The very presence of human rights monitors during demonstrations 
can deter human rights violations. It is therefore important to allow human rights defenders to 
operate freely in the context of freedom of assembly. [&#8230;] Journalists as well have an important 
role to play in providing independent coverage of demonstrations and protests. [&#8230;] The media 
must therefore have access to assemblies and the policing operations mounted to facilitate them&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Finally, your Excellency&#8217;s Government is equally reminded of the provisions of the 1992 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
and Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p> In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, 
we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and accountability of any person guilty of 
the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopt effective 
measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-mentioned persons 
in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to 
our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we 
would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when 
relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provided detailed information as to the exact number of people killed, and 
explain the circumstances in which each killing occurred. In particular, please detail whether the 
police or security forces were involved in the killings. If they were, please explain whether the 
use of lethal force was justified in accordance with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force 
and Firearms by Law Officials, and what investigations have been carried out to make this 
determination.  
</p>
<p> 3. Please indicate the legal basis of the aforementioned arrest and detention of the 
persons concerned, and how these measures are compatible with international norms and 
standards, including the rights to freedom of expression and assembly, as contained, inter alia, in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigations,

</p>
<p> 5. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have 
penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators?

</p>
<p> In March of this year there occurred in Lhasa and other places events that were incorrectly 
described as &#8220;peaceful demonstrations&#8221; but were actually serious acts of criminal violence 
involving beating, the destruction of property, looting and arson. Faced with such violent 
criminal acts, which seriously disrupted public order and did serious damage to human life, 
property and security, no responsible Government could simply sit back and not act. At present, 
the situation in the aforementioned areas has calmed down, and stability and public order have 
been restored. The judicial authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the other areas in 
question are dealing with the criminal suspects severely, in accordance with judicial procedures. 
Those whose offences are lesser and who displayed a positive attitude, acknowledging their 
guilt, have been released. Those whose situations are more serious shall have their criminal 
responsibility investigated in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p> The aforementioned serious violent criminal events were carefully plotted in advance and 
instigated by the Dalai clique. In their handling of the entire incident, the competent authorities 
of the Tibet Autonomous Region and other areas showed great restraint; they enforced the law in 
a civilized manner, and they enjoyed broad popular support. At the international level, however, 
some people have distorted the facts, creating untrue news stories and providing the 
United Nations special procedures with inaccurate information. Tibetan affairs are part of 
China&#8217;s internal affairs; nevertheless, in an effort to help the special procedures learn the truth 
about these events and to prevent the Dalai clique and anti-China elements from exploiting them, 
the competent authorities of the Chinese Government have thoroughly investigated the incidents 
described in the aforementioned letters and wish to make the following reply: 
</p>
<p>1. The truth about the violent criminal events 
</p>
<p> (a) In mid-March 2008, a series of serious violent criminal acts took place in the city of 
Lhasa, in China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region. Starting on 10 March, a group of lawbreakers, 
acting without authorization, gathered illegally to create a disturbance; when police officers 
arrived to dissuade them, in accordance with the law, they clashed with them, cursing them and 
violently attacking the officers with clubs, rocks and knives. At approximately 11 a.m. on 
14 March, some monks at the Ramoche Temple threw stones at the police officers on duty. 
Subsequently, a group of rioters began to gather in Barkhor Street, shouting separatist slogans 
and wantonly beating, smashing and looting. The situation quickly spread. The lawbreakers </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 55 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>smashed and burned shops, primary and secondary schools, hospitals, banks, electrical and 
communications installations and news agencies along the main streets of Lhasa and set fire to 
cars, chased and beat pedestrians, and attacked stores, telecommunications and Internet outlets 
and Government offices. The rioters&#8217; savage behaviour during these incidents resulted in the 
slashing or burning to death of 18 innocent persons, including an infant less than 1 year old; 
382 innocent persons were also injured, 58 of them seriously. The rioters set fire to 
over 300 sites, burning down 7 schools, 5 hospitals, more than 1,300 stores and 120 homes, 
causing extensive loss of human life and property, and occasioning a direct economic loss of 
280 billion yuan renminbi. Public order in the affected area was severely disrupted. 
</p>
<p> All ethnic minorities in Tibet expressed their great indignation at and severe criticism of 
the violent criminal acts that took place in Lhasa. The Tibet Autonomous Region quickly 
organized the police and other relevant agencies to put out the fires, provide aid to the injured 
and reinforce the security provided to schools, hospitals, banks and Government offices. The 
Chinese Government and the Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region took these measures 
to protect law and order and social stability, and to safeguard the human rights of all ethnic 
groups in Tibet. In dealing with these violent criminal incidents and restoring law and public 
order in accordance with the law, the competent Chinese and Tibetan Government authorities 
exercised the utmost restraint. While enforcing the law they consistently acted in a lawful and 
civilized manner; they did not carry or use any lethal or injurious weapons. The People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army was not involved in the efforts to quell these violent criminal incidents. 
</p>
<p> (b) At 11 a.m. on 16 March 2008, more than 300 monks in Aba, Sichuan Province, 
assaulted and beat police officers, handing out inflammatory flyers and shouting separatist 
slogans; they threw rocks and homemade Molotov cocktails at the police and went on a rampage 
of smashing and burning. At 3 p.m., a group of monks joined with other rioters to once again 
strike Government facilities, schools and police stations, engaging in smashing, looting and 
burning. That day rioters burned down 24 stores and 2 police stations and set fire to 81 police 
and civilian vehicles. Some 200 innocent bystanders, Government workers and police officers 
were injured. 
 Seeking to restore law and order, the local Government immediately took steps to bring the 
situation under control and protect life, property and fundamental human rights. During these 
incidents, law enforcement was carried out in a civilized manner by the local police, who 
consistently displayed a high degree of restraint; even though they had shields to protect 
themselves during the rioters&#8217; brutal attacks, scores of police officers were injured from blows 
and burns, one critically. The Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army did not take part in the response 
to these incidents. 
</p>
<p>2. Questions regarding the use of lethal or injurious weapons 
 In their efforts to deal with the violent criminal acts in the Tibet Autonomous Region in 
accordance with the law and to restore law and order, the local Government authorities exercised 
maximum restraint: law enforcement was consistently carried out in a lawful and civilized 
manner, and no lethal or injurious weapons were carried or used. For this very reason, there were 
only 242 casualties among law enforcement personnel, including 23 seriously injured and 
1 dead. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> On 16 March, in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Aba, Sichuan Province, rioters 
broke into the Aba Township police station and stabbed the police officers. When the rioters 
stole police firearms from a safe, the police fired warning shots, in accordance with the law, to 
no effect. They were thus compelled to open fire in self-defence, striking and injuring four 
rioters, who managed to escape with their co-conspirators in the confusion. Immediately 
afterwards, the officers involved in the incident, acting pursuant to regulations, submitted a 
report to their superiors, which the national police promptly published. The firing of weapons in 
self-defence by the Aba police was fully consistent with the Basic Principles on the Use of Force 
and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted at the Eighth United Nations Congress on 
the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. 
</p>
<p>3. Alleged control of reporting by the media 
</p>
<p> During the violent criminal acts in Lhasa, when public order was severely disrupted and 
rioters were wilfully beating, burning and killing innocent persons, it was not safe for foreign 
reporters in Lhasa to cover the events. Reporters for the British publication The Economist and 
other foreign publications who were at the scene did provide coverage of the events. After the 
situation calmed down, the Chinese Government immediately organized a series of inspection 
tours to Tibet for representatives of 19 foreign media and delegations of foreign diplomats based 
in China. The Chinese media, including the Tibetan regional media, all reported on the events. 
</p>
<p>4. The legal basis for the arrest and detention of monks and nuns 
</p>
<p> In the wake of the destructive events in Lhasa, the competent authorities of China and the 
Tibet Autonomous Region arrested a number of major criminal suspects who had participated in 
the events and had been involved in their organization and plotting. Among these were a number 
of monks and nuns. 
</p>
<p> International human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (art. 29, para. 2), stipulate that &#8220;[i]n the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone 
shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of 
securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just 
requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society&#8221;. During 
the aforementioned incidents the rioters showed absolutely no respect for the rights and freedoms 
of innocent persons but wilfully disrupted public order and harmed the welfare of others. The 
Chinese and Tibetan Regional Governments consider that the lawful measures taken were fully 
consistent with the relevant provisions of international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p> China is a country governed by the rule of law. Everyone is equal before the law, and 
anyone who violates the law shall be liable to punishment in accordance with the law, with no 
distinction made for citizens on account of their religious beliefs. During the violent criminal 
acts that were perpetrated in Lhasa and other locations, a small number of monks and nuns took 
part in unauthorized demonstrations; in the course of these demonstrations they engaged in 
violent activities that led to the death of scores of persons and the injuring of hundreds more; 
they burned and destroyed public property, including numerous homes and schools, they 
advocated separatism, they harmed the State and they jeopardized public safety, seriously 
violating the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 57 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Demonstrations and the Criminal Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The treatment shown 
by China&#8217;s law enforcement and judicial authorities will differ depending on the nature of the 
criminal offence: where the offence is serious, the offender&#8217;s criminal responsibility will be 
ascertained; where the offence is minor, the offender will be provided with education and 
released. This work is already under way. 
</p>
<p>5. Investigations, prosecutions and trials 
</p>
<p> In the wake of the violent criminal events that transpired in Lhasa, the law enforcement 
and judicial authorities of China and the Tibet Autonomous Region conducted investigations and 
inquiries in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p> On 29 April 2008, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court held an open trial of 
some of the persons accused of participating in the &#8220;events of 14 March&#8221;. The court found 
30 accused persons (Pasang et al.) guilty of the crimes of arson, looting, instigating fights and 
troublemaking, assembling a group to attack a State organ, disrupting public service and theft. 
The defendants Pasang, Sonam Tsering and Tsering were sentenced to life imprisonment. The 
defendants Jigme, Kalsang Bagdro, Karma Dawa, Dorje, Migmar, Ngawang Choeyang and 
Bagdro were given sentences of fixed-term imprisonment of 15 years and more. The defendants 
Yargyal, Choephel Tashi, Dorje Dargye, Ngawang, Kalsang Tsering, Migmar, Sonam Tsering, 
Kelsang Samten, Tseten, Palsang Tashi, Lhagpa Tsering Chewa (Sr.), Lobsang Tashi, 
Lhagpa Tsering, Darchen, Thubten Gyatso, Tashi Gyatso, Kalsang Dondrub, Tenzin Gyaltsen, 
Kalsang Nyima and Yeshe were given sentences of fixed-term imprisonment ranging from 3 to 
14 years. 
</p>
<p> The court informed the accused that if they refused to accept these judgements they could 
file an appeal with the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court or with the Tibet 
Autonomous Region Supreme People&#8217;s Court within 10 days of the date of service of the 
judgement. 
 China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that People&#8217;s Courts may or should appoint a 
defence counsel in cases where the defendant has not appointed counsel, the case is of great 
social significance, the defendant is totally without financial resources or the court considers that 
the prosecution arguments and evidence submitted may affect the proper determination of the 
severity of the sentence. Accordingly, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court 
appointed defence attorneys for the 30 defendants. The defence arguments presented by these 
lawyers were given full value during the trial proceedings, and the mitigating circumstances that 
they cited in respect of the defendants, which were verified through investigation, were all 
accepted by the court. 
</p>
<p> China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that all citizens who are members of ethnic 
minorities have the right to use their own spoken and written language in an appeal. Of the 
14 open hearings held in the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, the proceedings were 
fully conducted in the Tibetan language in 9, while in the remaining 5 cases, the defendants were 
provided with Tibetan-Chinese interpretation.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> It has been explained that the costs associated with the defence lawyers and interpreters 
provided for the defendants were entirely borne by the Tibet Autonomous Region Legal Aid 
Centre. 
</p>
<p> On the day of the hearings, more than 300 Lhasa residents, students and monks 
representing all ethnic minorities and all groups within society attended the trials. 
</p>
<p> The judicial authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and other localities intend to 
continue their efforts to deal in accordance with the law with the criminal suspects who 
participated in these violent criminal acts. 
</p>
<p>6. Related cases 
</p>
<p> Owing to time constraints and the incomplete nature of the information contained in the 
aforementioned letters, as well as the fact that the investigations being conducted by the Chinese 
authorities concerned are still in progress, China will continue to transmit to the relevant bodies 
information regarding the outcome of these investigations. 
</p>
<p> The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in its 
entirety in the relevant documents of the United Nations.

</b></p>
<p> We would like to draw the attention of your Government to reports we have received 
regarding <b>the public execution of three men in Yengishahar, Xinjiang Province</b>, on 
19 July 2008. They had been found guilty of being members of the East Turkistan Islamic 
Movement (ETIM), an organization classified as terrorist by your Excellency&#8217;s Government.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>In January 2007, security forces arrested a group of 17 Uighur men, members of the 
East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), in Akto county, Xinjiang Province. The names 
of two of the men were <b>Mukhtar Setiwaldi</b> and <b>Abduweli Imin</b>. The men were </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 59 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>subsequently charged with separatist activities, organizing and leading a terrorist 
organization, and the illegal production of explosives. At a trial held in November 2007 
they were found guilty.  
</p>
<p>Mukhtar Setiwaldi, Abduweli Imin and two or three other members of the group received 
death sentences, while the others were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Some reports 
indicate that two of the defendants were executed immediately after the trial.  
</p>
<p>On 9 July 2008, the local government authorities brought thousands of students and 
workers to a public square in Yengishahar. Three men were brought before the crowd, 
death sentences were read out (indicating that the men were among those arrested in Akto 
in January 2007) and then the three men were executed by a firing squad. Some reports 
maintain that Mukhtar Setiwaldi and Abduweli Imin were among those executed on 
9 July 2008, while others state that they had already been executed in November 2007. 
</p>
<p> We fully recognize your Government&#8217;s right and duty to forcefully combat heinous acts of 
terrorism. Indeed, the very recent explosion of two buses in Kunming which reportedly killed 
two persons and might have been the result of a terrorist attack, reminded us (if at all necessary) 
of the urgency with which your Government needs to combat terrorist activities and protect the 
population. We recall, however, that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the 
framework of international law. In particular, we would like to recall UN GA Resolution 60/158 
of 28 February 2006, which in its paragraph 1, stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure 
to combat terrorism complies with their obligation under international law, in particular 
international human right, refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> While many elements of the fate of the men arrested in Akto in January 2007 and put to 
trial as members of the ETIM in November 2007 remain to be clarified, the reports we have 
received concur in indicating that three of them were executed in front of a crowd assembled for 
the purpose in Yengishahar on 9 July 2008.  
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would like to recall that the Human Rights Committee has observed that 
carrying out executions before the public is a practice that is &#8220;incompatible with human dignity&#8221;, 
and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions observed that 
&#8220;[t]here is no legitimate interest served [&#8230;] by making executions public spectacles, and this is 
itself a most inhuman form of punishment.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 43). 
</p>
<p> According to our information, public executions are also prohibited by Article 212 of the 
Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The Supreme Court, too, has to our 
knowledge stated that public parading and other actions that humiliate the person being executed 
are forbidden. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government has informed the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that, &#8220;on 24 July 1986 and again on 1 June 1988, 
the ministries responsible for law, the People&#8217;s Procuratorates, public security and justice jointly 
issued a circular strictly forbidding the public display of condemned persons, and the pertinent 
authorities have since then treated this issue with the utmost gravity. In recent years, the 
phenomenon has thus been effectively prohibited&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 60 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Turning from the execution to the circumstances under which the death penalty was 
imposed, we would recall that, although the death penalty is not prohibited under international 
law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must 
as such be applied in the most restrictive manner.  
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would further respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in 
capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees 
for a fair trial admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the 
right to have one&#8217;s conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher court. It is our understanding 
that Chinese law now enshrines this guarantee, specifically providing that all death sentences 
have to be considered and confirmed by the Supreme Court. In the present case, reports do not 
clarify whether the three men executed on 9 July 2008 were able to exercise this right.  
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this case to 
the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the names of the (four or five) persons sentenced to death in the case 
involving Mukhtar Setiwaldi and Abduweli Imin. When were the death sentences imposed? 
When were Mukhtar Setiwaldi and Abduweli Imin and the co-defendants sentenced to death 
informed of the sentences, when were they publicly pronounced?

<p><b>China:  Death sentence of Wo Weihan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>:<b> </b>Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: UN translation awaited for response of the Government of China of 
17 February 2009 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 24 November 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the situation below. 
</p>
<p> According to the allegations received:  
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Wo Weihan</b> may be at imminent risk of execution. He was sentenced to death in 
May 2007 for spying following a closed trial in Beijing. His appeal was rejected on 
29 February 2008.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Weihan had been detained in Beijing on 19 January 2005, but was not formally 
arrested until 5 May. Mr. Weihan, who reportedly had not had any health problems prior to 
his detention, suffered a brain hemorrhage in a detention centre on 6 February 2005, 
following which he was allowed to recuperate at home for six weeks. In March 2005, he 
was taken to Beijing Municipal Bo Ren Hospital (a prison hospital) where he has been held 
since.  
</p>
<p>Reports indicate that Mr. Weihan was held incommunicado during the first ten months of 
his detention and only then allowed regular meetings with his lawyers. It is further alleged 
that he confessed to the charges while in detention. 
</p>
<p> Concern has been expressed that Wo Weihan may have confessed to the spying charges 
under torture, in the absence of a lawyer. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles 
applicable to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the charges of spying, we would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government that although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long 
been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be 
interpreted in the most restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. 
A thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations 
bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that a death </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 62 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill 
which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). According to the information we have 
received, the offences for which Wo Weihan is facing the death penalty did not result in loss of 
life. 
</p>
<p> We would further remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment cases 
there is an obligation to provide criminal defendants with &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an 
independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights). 
Relevant to the case at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the right to be assisted by legal 
counsel at all stages of proceedings, the right to a public hearing and the right not to be 
compelled to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Article 15 of the 
Convention against Torture, which provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any 
statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as 
evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made.&#8221; We also recall that paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 
of 2008 urges States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of 
torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as 
evidence that the statement was made&#8221;. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this 
principle is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set 
forth, inter alia, in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
permitted under international law from a summary execution, which violates human rights 
standards. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure 
that the rights under international law of Wo Weihan are fully respected. Considering the 
irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not carried 
out unless all of the concerns raised are convincingly dispelled. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details regarding the trial of Wo Weihan: which provisions of 
criminal law was he found guilty of having violated; when did he obtain the assistance of a legal 
counsel; was his trial open to the public? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide a list of the offences punishable by death under the laws the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China. </p>

<p><b>China:  Deaths of Falun Gong practitioners 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>:<b> </b>Deaths in custody owing to torture, neglect, or the use of force, or fear of 
death in custody due to life-threatening conditions of detention 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:<b> </b>7 females; 9 males 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response (recent communication) 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a response concerning these allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 13 March 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have received 
regarding the cases of <b>16 deaths of Falun Gong practitioners due to injuries allegedly 
sustained in custody</b> in China. While the circumstances under which the deaths occurred differ, 
all the victims were Falun Gong practitioners and they all died under the supervision of law 
enforcement officers or soon after their release from custody. Concern is expressed that the 
arrests and deaths of these individuals were solely connected with their activities as Falun Gong 
practitioners. In the Annex of this letter, we have reproduced detailed information on each of the 
16 cases.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to refer you 
Government to the relevant principles of international law. In order to overcome the presumption 
of State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a 
&#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports 
suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This 
principle was reiterated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in 
Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
 The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, [&#8230;], to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which China is a Party. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 64 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In addition to the above, we would like to appeal to your Government to ensure the right to 
freedom of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the 1981 Declaration 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief 
and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p> We also would like to recall that in its resolution 63/181, the General Assembly &#8220;urges 
States to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience, religion or 
belief and to this end [&#8230;] to ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to 
life, liberty or security of person because of religion or belief and that no one is subjected to 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrary arrest or 
detention on that account and to bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these rights&#8221;.  
 Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your

midnight, a dozen police officers arrested those practitioners trapped in the house. They beat the 
practitioners with electric batons and two-inch long metal rods and forced them into police 
vehicles. The police claimed that Hu Yanrong tried to jump out of a police car. She sustained 
severe injuries and fell into a coma after being taken to the Lingyuan Prison Hospital. Her head 
was swollen, her eyes, nose and mouth were bruised, the area between her temples and eyes was

immediately. He was also asked not to leak any information to the public; otherwise, his other 
two sons would lose their jobs. According to information received, the authorities gave 
inconsistent accounts of the cause of death, saying that he committed suicide in one instance and 
that he died in a traffic accident in other instances.

Falun Gong practitioners in Pingdu City. The police confiscated some of their possessions and 
interrogated them at the police station. When they refused to reveal any information, the officers 
poured boiling water over their necks and bodies. Three days later, they were taken to 
Pingdu City Detention Centre. Guards put shackles on Zhong Zhenfu and whipped him about the 
head with metal wires. He was detained in a metal cage with the shackles still on, and the guards 
ordered other inmates to ill-treat him. The latter tried to force him to curse the founder of 
Falun Gong. When he refused, they beat him for over an hour. He was sent to the hospital and

<p>De acuerdo con los informaciones recibidas: el 22 de abril, los miembros de la <i>Central 
Unitaria de Trabajadores</i> (CUT) en el departamento de Santander, en el nordeste de 
Colombia, habr&#237;an recibido una amenaza de muerte por escrito del grupo paramilitar 
&#8216;Nueva Generaci&#243;n de &#193;guilas Negras de Santander&#8217;. La amenaza, con fecha del 18 de 
abril, advert&#237;a contra la celebraci&#243;n de marchas o manifestaciones con ocasi&#243;n del D&#237;a 
Internacional del Trabajo, 1 de mayo; &#8220;hay dispuesto un destacamento de hombres quienes 
cumplir&#225;n nuestras ordenes y har&#225;n limpieza de todos ustedes serviles de la guerrilla&#8221;. La 
comunicaci&#243;n habr&#237;a nombrado a 17 miembros de sindicatos y organizaciones de derechos 
humanos a los que declaraba &#8220;objetivo militar&#8221; y entre los que se encontraban algunos de 
los susodichos. 
</p>
<p>El 23 de abril, los Sres. Jos&#233; Humberto Torres y Jes&#250;s Tovar habr&#237;an recibido por correo 
electr&#243;nico una amenaza de muerte firmada las &#8216;&#193;guilas Negras al Rearme&#8217;. La amenaza, 
con fecha del 21 de abril, habr&#237;a acusado a los dos hombres de ser guerrilleros, 
advirti&#233;ndole a Jos&#233; Humberto Torres &#8216;que se cuide, donde lo veamos lo damos&#8217;. Adem&#225;s, 
habr&#237;a advertido a los miembros de otros sindicatos y organizaciones de derechos humanos 
de que guardaran silencio, se&#241;alando que Mar&#237;a Cede&#241;o y Nicol&#225;s Castro estaban siendo 
vigiladas. 
</p>
<p>Quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a su atenci&#243;n declaraciones hechas en contra del Sr. Iv&#225;n Cepeda 
Castro, dirigente de la Fundaci&#243;n Manuel Cepeda Vargas, representante del Movimiento 
Nacional de V&#237;ctimas de Cr&#237;menes del Estado y columnista con el seminario 
El Espectador. El susodicho fue objeto de un llamamiento urgente, emitido el 
12 de diciembre de 2006 por la Representante Especial del Secretario-General para los 
defensores de los derechos humanos.  
</p>
<p>Valoramos el respaldo y reconocimiento del importante papel de los defensores de 
derechos humanos en Colombia expresado en la respuesta del Gobierno al reciente 
comunicado de prensa y reconocemos los esfuerzos por parte del Estado colombiano para 
mejorar la seguridad de los defensores. No obstante, quisi&#233;ramos manifestar nuestra 
preocupaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con declaraciones como aquellas hechas el pasado 6 de mayo en 
Monter&#237;a y en la C&#225;tedra Colombia en Bogot&#225; por el Presidente de Colombia respecto a 
algunos defensores de derechos humanos, en particular al Sr. Iv&#225;n Cepeda Castro. Seg&#250;n se 
informa, el Presidente Uribe habr&#237;a declarado que personas como el susodicho se 
arropar&#237;an en la protecci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas, la cual &#8216;les sirve para instigar la violaci&#243;n de 
los derechos humanos en contra de las personas que no comparten sus ideas&#8217; y para &#8216;salir a 
amenazar,&#8230;calumniar, &#8230; acusar falazmente&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>A nuestro juicio, estas declaraciones, sumadas a otras hechas en los &#250;ltimos meses por 
representantes del gobierno colombiano, podr&#237;an resultar sumamente perjudiciales, dado 
que, actualmente en Colombia muchos defensores de derechos humanos se enfrentan a 
intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas como aquellas resumidas m&#225;s arriba. Se expresa profunda 
preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de todos aquellos individuos que se 
encuentran amenazados debido a su trabajo leg&#237;timo en defensa de los derechos humanos. </p>

<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n 
del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de 
Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de 
promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales universalmente 
reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos establecen, respectivamente, que toda 
persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y 
realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en los planos nacional e 
internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el deber de todos los Estados de proteger, 
promover y hacer efectivos todos los derechos humanos, adoptando las medidas necesarias para 
crear las condiciones sociales, econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as 
jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que toda persona sometida a su jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o 
colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y libertades.  
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a los art&#237;culos siguientes:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; el art&#237;culo 6, apartados b) y c), estipula que toda persona tiene derecho, individualmente 
y con otras, conforme a lo dispuesto en los instrumentos de derechos humanos y otros 
instrumentos internacionales aplicables, a publicar, impartir o difundir libremente a 
terceros opiniones, informaciones y conocimientos relativos a todos los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales y a estudiar y debatir si esos derechos y 
libertades fundamentales se observan, tanto en la ley como en la pr&#225;ctica, y a formarse y 
mantener una opini&#243;n al respecto, as&#237; como a se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n del p&#250;blico esas 
cuestiones por conducto de esos medios y de otros medios adecuados. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; el art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las 
autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o colectivamente, frente a toda 
violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, presi&#243;n 
o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los derechos 
mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al 
reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las 
omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y 
las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o 
particulares que afecten el disfrute de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales. 
</p>
<p> En este contexto, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las 
normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos 
garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que 
este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las 
siguientes normas y principios que son particularmente significativos con respecto a las 
denuncias mencionadas precedentemente. Los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e </p>

<p>Recibimos la respuesta de su Gobierno el 5 de junio de 2008, que contiene informaci&#243;n sobre las 
medidas adoptadas por su Gobierno para poner fin a la impunidad, pero no menciona el caso del 
Sr Guillermo Rivera F&#250;quene. Desde entonces hemos recibido m&#225;s informaci&#243;n sobre este caso. 
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n las nuevas informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p>El 22 de abril de 2008, aproximadamente a las 6.30 a.m., el Sr Guillermo Rivera F&#250;quene 
habr&#237;a sido detenido por una patrulla de la Polic&#237;a Nacional. El 24 de abril se habr&#237;a 
encontrado un cad&#225;ver, sin documentos de identidad y con signos de tortura, en un 
botadero de escombros. El 15 de julio de 2008, habr&#237;an enterrado este cad&#225;ver como 
persona sin identificaci&#243;n conocida (NN). Sin embargo, en una exhumaci&#243;n posterior 
ordenada por la Fiscal 49 de Ibagu&#233;, se habr&#237;a identificado el cuerpo como el del 
Sr Guillermo Rivera F&#250;quene. Se habr&#237;an descubierto signos de ahorcamiento, golpes en 
la cara y contusiones en varias partes del cuerpo. Se afirma tambi&#233;n que 32 sindicalistas 
habr&#237;an sido asesinados durante 2008 en Colombia. 
</p>
<p> Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n que el asesinato del Sr Guillermo Rivera F&#250;quene podr&#237;a estar 
directamente relacionado con sus actividades leg&#237;timas en defensa de los derechos humanos en 
Colombia. Tambi&#233;n se expresa preocupaci&#243;n que este asesinato, de ser confirmado, se enmarque 
en un contexto de gran peligro para los sindicalistas en Colombia. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las 
siguientes normas y principios que son particularmente significativos con respecto a la denuncia 
mencionada precedentemente. Los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n

</p>
<p> Consideramos tambi&#233;n apropiado hacer referencia a la resoluci&#243;n 2005/38 de la Comisi&#243;n

dirigidos contra los periodistas, incluso en situaciones de conflicto armado, y llevar ante la

<p> En caso de que sus investigaciones apoyen o sugieren la exactitud de las alegaciones 
mencionadas m&#225;s arriba, quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas 
necesarias para investigar, procesar e imponer las sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona 
responsable de las violaciones alegadas. Quisi&#233;ramos asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas 
eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales hechos.

<p> Quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que hemos 
recibido en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas contra varios sindicatos y organizaciones no

</p>
<p> De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p>El 16 de septiembre de 2008, un mensaje firmado por el grupo paramilitar <i>Comando 
Carlos Casta&#241;o Vive (CCV)</i> fue enviado al correo electr&#243;nico de la Asamblea Permanente 
de la Sociedad Civil por la Paz y al <i>Movimiento Nacional de V&#237;ctimas (MOVICE)</i>. Dicho 
mensaje contendr&#237;a amenazas contra miembros de la <i>Central Unitaria de Trabajadores

<p> 
</p>
<p>El 18 de septiembre de 2008, un email fue enviado a los correos electr&#243;nicos de 
<i>ANTHOC y de la Federaci&#243;n Agraria (FENSUAGRO)</i>, organizaciones afiliadas a la CUT, 
firmado por Ernesto B&#225;ez, Amigos de Uribe por Colombia. El mensaje se habr&#237;a referido a 
la CUT una &#8220;cuna de terroristas&#8221;, profiriendo amenazas contra esta organizaci&#243;n, contra la 
USO, y contra los Sres. <b>Angel Salas, Juan Mendoza, Miguel Bobadilla, Eberto D&#237;az, 
Luis Sandoval, Omar Hern&#225;ndez, Viviana Ortiz, Albeiro Betancourt, 
&#193;lvaro Londo&#241;o, Yesid Camacho</b> y <b>Gilberto Mart&#237;nez</b>, todos l&#237;deres sindicales y 
defensores de los derechos humanos. El mismo d&#237;a, la USO habr&#237;a recibido por correo 
electr&#243;nico amenazas de muerte firmadas por el grupo paramilitar &#193;guilas Carlos Casta&#241;o 
Vive (CCV). Las amenazas habr&#237;an sugerido que existen v&#237;nculos entre la USO y el brazo 
pol&#237;tico de la guerrilla del Ej&#233;rcito de Liberaci&#243;n Nacional (ELN), diciendo &#8220;nosotros les 
recordamos las sentencias de muerte a los guerrilleros&#8221; y &#8220;todos caer&#225;n poco a poco como 
se lo merecen por guerrilleros&#8221;. El email habr&#237;a amenazado a los Sres. Rodolfo Vecino 
Acevedo, Rafael Cabarcas, Nelson Berrio y Hernando Hern&#225;ndez en particular. 
</p>
<p>La situaci&#243;n de la USO resulta particularmente preocupante porque la organizaci&#243;n habr&#237;a 
recibido tambi&#233;n varias coronas de condolencia, refiri&#233;ndose al Sr. Rodolfo Vecino 
Acevedo. Una habr&#237;a llegado a la oficina de la USO en Barrancabermeja en 2007, y otras 
dos habr&#237;an llegado a la sede en Cartagena el 9 de septiembre de 2008. Tambi&#233;n dos 
servicios funerarios habr&#237;an llamado a la sede en Cartagena porque ten&#237;an m&#225;s coronas 
para enviar, supuestamente a petici&#243;n de una mujer no identificada. 
</p>
<p> Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n que las amenazas contra estas organizaciones, l&#237;deres sindicales y 
defensores de los derechos humanos podr&#237;an estar vinculadas con sus actividades leg&#237;timas en la 
defensa de los derechos humanos. Se expresa gran preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y 
psicol&#243;gica de los miembros de dichas organizaciones. Estos incidentes se enmarcan en un 
contexto de gran vulnerabilidad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en Colombia. 
</p>
<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de los individuos, los grupos y las 
instituciones de promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales 
universalmente reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos establecen, respectivamente, 
que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n 
y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en los planos nacional e 
internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el deber de todos los Estados de proteger, 
promover y hacer efectivos todos los derechos humanos, adoptando las medidas necesarias para 
crear las condiciones sociales, econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as 
jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que toda persona sometida a su jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o 
colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y libertades.  
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a los art&#237;culos siguientes:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; el art&#237;culo 5, apartados b) y c), establece que a fin de promover y proteger los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales, toda persona tiene derecho, individual o 
colectivamente, en el plano nacional e internacional a formar organizaciones, 
asociaciones o grupos no gubernamentales, y a afiliarse a ellos o a participar en ellos, y 
a comunicarse con las organizaciones no gubernamentales e intergubernamentales. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 79 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; el art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las 
autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o colectivamente, frente a toda 
violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, presi&#243;n 
o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los derechos 
mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al 
reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las 
omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y 
las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o 
particulares que afecten el disfrute de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales. 
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, nos permitimos hacer un llamamiento urgente al gobierno de su Excelencia para 
que tome las medidas necesarias para asegurar que el derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de 
expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de acuerdo con los principios enunciados en el art&#237;culo 19 de la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y reiterados en el art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Nadie podr&#225; ser molestado a causa de sus 
opiniones. Toda persona tiene derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n; este derecho comprende la 
libertad de buscar, recibir y difundir informaciones e ideas de toda &#237;ndole, sin consideraci&#243;n de 
fronteras, ya sea oralmente, por escrito o en forma impresa o art&#237;stica, o por cualquier otro 
procedimiento de su elecci&#243;n&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Desear&#237;amos hacer un llamamiento al Gobierno de su Excelencia para que adopte las 
medidas necesarias para el respeto del derecho de asociaci&#243;n de acuerdo con los principios 
enunciados en el art&#237;culo 22 del Pacto Internacional de los Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Toda 
persona tiene derecho a asociarse libremente con otras, incluso el derecho a fundar sindicatos y 
afiliarse a ellos para la protecci&#243;n de sus intereses&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Deseamos tambi&#233;n llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las normas 
fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos 
garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que 
este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre los 
Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, 
arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y 
Social que son especialmente significativos con respecto a las denuncias mencionadas 
precedentemente. En particular, el principio 4 obliga a los Gobiernos a garantizar una protecci&#243;n 
eficaz, judicial o de otro tipo, a los particulares y grupos que est&#233;n en peligro de ejecuci&#243;n 
extralegal, arbitraria o sumaria, en particular a aquellos que reciban amenazas de muerte. Los 
Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los 
casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe las 
conclusiones de estas investigaciones. </p>

situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas 
</p>
<p> En este sentido, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n de Su Gobierno sobre la informaci&#243;n que 
hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con la muerte de los se&#241;ores <b>Mariano Morano Diz&#250;</b>,<b> </b>Presidente de 
la Junta de Acci&#243;n Comunal de La Palma, en Pitay&#243;, <b>Jesus Antonio Neme </b>y<b> Elver Idito</b>,<b> </b>as&#237; 
como sobre <b>las amenazas y violencia en contra de los pueblos ind&#237;genas durante la &#250;ltima 
semana</b>.  
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
</p>
<p>Con ocasi&#243;n de la conmemoraci&#243;n del 12 de octubre, como recuerdo de los 516 a&#241;os 
del desembarco espa&#241;ol en el continente americano, la Organizaci&#243;n Nacional Ind&#237;gena 
de Colombia (ONIC) organiz&#243; &#8220;la Minga de Resistencia Ind&#237;gena y Popular&#8221;, que ten&#237;a 
como actividad central la movilizaci&#243;n pac&#237;fica de pueblos ind&#237;genas en los Departamentos 
del Cauca, Huila, Valle, Choc&#243;, Caldas, Risaralda, Atl&#225;ntico, Guajira, Cesar, C&#243;rdoba, 
Sucre, Arauca, Meta y Norte de Santander. Ind&#237;genas Nasa, Kokonukos, Yanacona, 
Guambianos, Embera, Eperara Siapidara, Wounaan, Bar&#237;, Kankuamos, Mokan&#225;, 
Wiwa, Arhuacos, Sen&#250;, Sikuanis, Piapocos, Salibas y U&#180;wa participaron en las 
movilizaciones.  
</p>
<p>Las movilizaciones ten&#237;an como fin protestar contra el Tratado de Libre Comercio (TLC) 
firmado con los Estados Unidos y la aprobaci&#243;n del Estatuto de Desarrollo Rural (ley 1152 
de 2007), exigir al Gobierno la adopci&#243;n de la Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre 
los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas y el cumplimiento con los acuerdos suscritos por el Gobierno 
Nacional en materia de derechos de tierra de los ind&#237;genas, y protestar por los asesinatos de 
ind&#237;genas en los 15 d&#237;as que precedieron la movilizaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>En los Departamentos del Cauca y del Valle, el Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil Antidisturbios 
(ESMAD), el Ej&#233;rcito Nacional y civiles armados con fusiles, gases lacrim&#243;genos, 
tanquetas y helic&#243;pteros se enfrentaron a las personas que participaban en las 
movilizaciones. El 14 de octubre de 2008, miembros de la Fuerza P&#250;blica habr&#237;an abierto 
fuego en contra de los aproximadamente 15.000 a 20.000 ind&#237;genas reunidos en el 
Resguardo de la Mar&#237;a Piendam&#243;, Departamento del Cauca, y contra los ind&#237;genas 
reunidos en el Departamento del Valle. Mariano Morano Dizu fue herido con arma de 
fuego en el cr&#225;neo y falleci&#243; luego de ser trasladado a Popay&#225;n. Adem&#225;s, m&#225;s de cien 
ind&#237;genas fueron heridos, al menos 16 con arma de fuego, y docenas mas se encuentran 
desaparecidos. El 21 de octubre de 2008, miembros de la Fuerza P&#250;blica habr&#237;an abierto 
fuego en contra de las aproximadamente 500 personas reunidos sobre la v&#237;a Panamericana 
en Villarica. Jesus Antonio Neme y Elver Idito resultaron muertos y cinco otros 
manifestantes fueron heridos.  
</p>
<p>En el departamento de Huila, se limit&#243; el derecho a la libre circulaci&#243;n de 750 ind&#237;genas 
que se dirig&#237;an a Neiva. Se orden&#243; a estas personas que bajaran de los camiones en 
los que eran transportadas por efectivos del Ej&#233;rcito Nacional y la Polic&#237;a Nacional, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 82 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>quienes con el pretexto de verificar la identidad de los manifestantes, les pidieron su 
identificaci&#243;n y retuvieron tanto los veh&#237;culos como las provisiones y alimentos que 
llevaban.  
</p>
<p>Durante la movilizaci&#243;n, varios ind&#237;genas han sido amenazados de muerte por grupos 
paramilitares. Se alega que un Fiscal ha impedido el ingreso de autoridades ind&#237;genas para 
identificar a otras v&#237;ctimas en el municipio del Corinto (Cauca) y examinar los cad&#225;veres y 
posibles causas de su muerte. 
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, para justificar la violencia, se usa el falso pretexto de que 
las comunidades ind&#237;genas son controladas e infiltradas por miembros de las FARC, ignorando 
as&#237; sus reclamos leg&#237;timos. 
</p>
<p> En este contexto, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las 
normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos 
garantizan a todo individuo los derechos a la vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que 
este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las 
siguientes normas y principios que son particularmente significativos con respecto a las 
denuncias mencionadas precedentemente: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Principios b&#225;sicos sobre el empleo de la fuerza y de armas de fuego por los funcionarios 
encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, adoptados por el Octavo Congreso de las Naciones 
Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, La Habana, 
27 de agosto a 7 de septiembre de 1990. Establecen que los funcionarios encargados de 
hacer cumplir la ley, en el desempe&#241;o de sus funciones, utilizar&#225;n en la medida de lo 
posible medios no violentos y delimitan el empleo de la fuerza a determinados casos 
excepcionales, incluidos los de defensa propia o de otras personas en caso de peligro 
inminente de muerte o lesiones graves. La fuerza empleada debe ser proporcional a la 
gravedad del delito y al objeto leg&#237;timo que se persiga. Los da&#241;os y lesiones deben ser 
reducidos al m&#237;nimo. El empleo de la fuerza est&#225; permitido solamente cuando otros 
medios resulten ineficaces. El empleo arbitrario o abusivo de la fuerza por parte de los 
funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley debe ser castigado como delito en la 
legislaci&#243;n nacional. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del 
Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, los principios 9 a 19 obligan a los 
Gobiernos a proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los 
casos en que haya sospecha de ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias; a 
publicar en un informa las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y a velar por que sean 
juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales 
ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. </p>

<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno de Colombia del 5 de enero del 2009 
</b></p>
<p> La respuesta del Gobierno da descripciones detalladas sobre las manifestaciones en Cauca 
y Villarica. Sobre las alegaciones de uso excesivo de la fuerza por las fuerzas de seguridad, de 
las muertes de los Sres. Mariano Morano Diz&#250; y Jes&#250;s Antonio Neme y Elver Idito, el Gobierno 
informo:  
</p>
<p><i>Contexto 
</i></p>
<p> En el marco de la referida movilizaci&#243;n, organizada por el Consejo Regional Ind&#237;gena del 
Cauca (CRC), la que cont&#243; con la participaci&#243;n de cerca de 5000 ind&#237;genas de la regi&#243;n, se 
presentaron acciones tendientes a bloquear la Carretera Panamericana en diferentes puntos, 
mediante el uso de &#225;rboles, piedras y veh&#237;culos, ocasion&#225;ndoles a &#233;stos da&#241;os en las llantas, y en 
otros casos procediendo a su incineraci&#243;n. El Bloqueo de la carretera tambi&#233;n origin&#243; da&#241;os a la 
v&#237;a, al medio ambiente y a las redes de servicios p&#250;blicos.  
</p>
<p> Es de resaltar que la V&#237;a Panamericana es una arteria troncal muy importante para la 
econom&#237;a de Colombia. &#8230; 
</p>
<p> Ante la situaci&#243;n descrita, la Polic&#237;a Nacional, a trav&#233;s del Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil Antidisturbios 
(ESMAD), acudi&#243; a los sitios bloqueados por los manifestantes, con el fin de garantizar el 
restablecimiento de la normalidad.  </p>

<p><i>En relaci&#243;n con el presunto uso desproporcionado de la fuerza del ESMAD de la Fuerza P&#250;blica 
contra los manifestantes ind&#237;genas al intentar reabrir el paso en la carretera Panamericana, el 
14 de octubre de 2008 
</i></p>
<p>&#8722; La Polic&#237;a Nacional indico que dispuso de 750 hombres del ESMAD para dispersar a 
los manifestantes, <b>sin acudir a acciones violentas</b>, atendiendo los protocolos 
establecidos para estos casos y teniendo siempre presentes <i>los Principios B&#225;sicos sobre 
el Empleo de la Fuerza y de Armas de Fuego por los Funcionarios Encargados de 
hacer cumplir la Ley</i>.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; En ese sentido, cabe se&#241;alar que la intervenci&#243;n policial inicialmente despleg&#243; el 
personal del ESMAD, en atenci&#243;n a su funci&#243;n de asegurar el normal y pac&#237;fico 
desarrollo de las protestas autorizadas; pero en vista del grado de violencia ejercido por 
los manifestantes, se procedi&#243; con el emple&#243; de bastones de mando, agua y gases 
lacrim&#243;genos para dispersar la manifestaci&#243;n tornada violenta.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; En desarrollo de la movilizaci&#243;n los manifestantes utilizaron explosivos de fabricaci&#243;n 
casera, tales como &#8220;papas explosivas,&#8221; bombas molotov, as&#237; como piedras, palos y 
machetes; electos que ocasionaron heridas a 45 uniformados, entre ellos, al intendente 
<i>Ald&#237;ver Giraldo Galeano</i>, quien present&#243; mutilaciones en los miembros superiores al 
manipular un paqueta explosivo dejado presuntamente por los manifestantes durante el 
desbloqueo de la v&#237;a Panamericana.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Con referencia a la afirmaci&#243;n que &#8220;<i>miembros de la Fuerza P&#250;blica habr&#237;a abierto 
fuego en contra de aproximadamente 15000 y 20000 ind&#237;genas</i>.&#8221; Al respecto, es de 
indicar, que tal como fue reconocido por el Gobierno Nacional a la opini&#243;n p&#250;blica, el 
hecho se present&#243; tan solo por un (1) miembro de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, quien no hace 
parte del ESMAD.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Ante la gravedad del hecho, la Oficina de Control Interno Disciplinario del 
Departamento de Polic&#237;a del Cauca abri&#243; indagaciones preliminares y la apertura de 
investigaci&#243;n disciplinaria contra dicho miembro de la Polic&#237;a Nacional y sus dos

</i></p>
<p>&#8722; El Estado indic&#243; que ha tenido conocimiento de la muerte de un (1) ind&#237;gena con

<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su Excelencia 
la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con el asesinato del Sr. <b>Edwin Legarda</b>, esposo 
de la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; Vivas, Consejera Mayor del <i>Consejo Regional Ind&#237;gena del Cauca 
(CRIC)</i>. La Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; Vivas tambi&#233;n ha tenido un papel importante en la Minga 
Nacional de Resistencia Ind&#237;gena y Popular, una jornada de unidad comunitaria, social y popular 
convocada por la <i>Organizaci&#243;n Nacional Ind&#237;gena de Colombia (ONIC)</i> para defender la vida y 
los derechos territoriales, pol&#237;ticos, ambientales y alimentarios de las poblaciones ind&#237;genas. En 
octubre de 2008, las autoridades colombianas, incluyendo al Presidente, supuestamente 
justificaron la represi&#243;n de esta Minga por parte de las Fuerzas Armadas de Colombia.  
 De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p>El 16 de diciembre de 2008, a primeras horas de la ma&#241;ana, entre las localidades de Inz&#225; y 
Totor&#243;, Departamento de Cauca, soldados del Batall&#243;n &#8220;Jos&#233; Hilario L&#243;pez&#8221; de la tercera 
divisi&#243;n del Ej&#233;rcito habr&#237;an llevado a cabo un ataque armado contra el Sr. Edwin Legarda. 
La v&#237;ctima conduc&#237;a una camioneta de la Consejer&#237;a del CRIC con vidrios semipolarizados 
que se hab&#237;a asignado a su esposa, la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; Vivas. En total 17 balas, 
disparadas desde varios &#225;ngulos, habr&#237;an llegado al veh&#237;culo. El Sr. Edwin Legarda se 
habr&#237;a muerto unas horas despu&#233;s en un hospital.  
</p>
<p>Al momento del ataque el Sr. Edwin Legarda se dirig&#237;a a recoger a la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; 
Vivas, quien regresaba de Ginebra, Suiza, donde hab&#237;a asistido como representante del 
CRIC y delegada de la Organizaci&#243;n Ind&#237;gena de Colombia (ONIC) al Examen Peri&#243;dico </p>

</p>
<p>Universal (EPU) de Colombia en las Naciones Unidas. Ante el EPU la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; 
Vivas habr&#237;a denunciado las violaciones de derechos humanos de las cuales los pueblos 
ind&#237;genas son v&#237;ctima, incluyendo supuestas ejecuciones extrajudiciales por parte de las 
fuerzas de seguridad.  
</p>
<p> Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n de que el asesinato del Sr. Edwin Legarda podr&#237;a estar vinculado 
con las actividades de la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; Vivas en la defensa de los derechos humanos, en 
particular los derechos ind&#237;genas. Considerando que el veh&#237;culo conducido por el 
Sr. Edwin Legarda ten&#237;a vidrios semipolarizados y no se pod&#237;a comprobar qui&#233;n lo conduc&#237;a, se 
teme que el ataque podr&#237;a haber sido dirigido contra la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; Vivas. As&#237; se expresa 
gran preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; Vivas. Estos 
hechos, de ser confirmados, se enmarcan en un contexto de gran vulnerabilidad de los defensores 
de los pueblos ind&#237;genas en Colombia. 
</p>
<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos,<b> </b> llamamos la atenci&#243;n del 
Gobierno Su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal

6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la vida y a la seguridad de su 
persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea arbitrariamente 
privado de su vida. 
</p>
<p> Quisi&#233;ramos tambi&#233;n llamar la atenci&#243;n sobre los Principios relativos a una eficaz 
prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, 
resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 del 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, 
llamo la atenci&#243;n sobre los principios 9 y 19 seg&#250;n los cuales, los Gobiernos deben proceder a 
una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de 
tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; 
y velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como 
participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n.  
 Asimismo nos gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre la 
Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas, aprobada por la 
Asamblea General el 13 de septiembre de 2007. El art&#237;culo 2 de la Declaraci&#243;n establece que 
&#8220;[l]os pueblos y las personas ind&#237;genas son libres e iguales a todos los dem&#225;s pueblos y personas 
y tienen derecho a no ser objeto de ninguna discriminaci&#243;n en el ejercicio de sus derechos que 
est&#233; fundada, en particular, en su origen o identidad ind&#237;gena&#8221;. El art&#237;culo 15 dispone que: 
&#8220;1. Los pueblos ind&#237;genas tienen derecho a la dignidad y diversidad de sus culturas, tradiciones, 
historias y aspiraciones, que deber&#225;n quedar debidamente reflejadas en la educaci&#243;n y la 
informaci&#243;n p&#250;blica. 2. Los Estados adoptar&#225;n medidas eficaces, en consulta y cooperaci&#243;n con 
los pueblos ind&#237;genas interesados, para combatir los prejuicios y eliminar la discriminaci&#243;n y 
promover la tolerancia, la comprensi&#243;n y las buenas relaciones entre los pueblos ind&#237;genas y

</p>
<p> Quisi&#233;ramos tambi&#233;n llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas 
fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de

<p>libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos 
establecen, respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a 
promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el

otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que toda persona sometida a su 
jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y 
libertades.  
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a los art&#237;culos siguientes:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; el art&#237;culo 6, apartados b) y c), estipula que toda persona tiene derecho, individualmente 
y con otras, conforme a lo dispuesto en los instrumentos de derechos humanos y otros 
instrumentos internacionales aplicables, a publicar, impartir o difundir libremente a 
terceros opiniones, informaciones y conocimientos relativos a todos los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales y a estudiar y debatir si esos derechos y 
libertades fundamentales se observan, tanto en la ley como en la pr&#225;ctica, y a formarse y 
mantener una opini&#243;n al respecto, as&#237; como a se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n del p&#250;blico esas 
cuestiones por conducto de esos medios y de otros medios adecuados. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; el art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las 
autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o colectivamente, frente a toda 
violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, presi&#243;n 
o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los derechos 
mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al 
reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las 
omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y 
las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o 
particulares que afecten el disfrute de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales. 
</p>
<p> Nos permitimos hacer un llamamiento urgente al gobierno de su Excelencia para que tome 
las medidas necesarias para asegurar que el derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea 
respetado, de acuerdo con los principios enunciados en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal 
de los Derechos Humanos y reiterados en el art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos 
Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Nadie podr&#225; ser molestado a causa de sus opiniones. Toda persona tiene 
derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n; este derecho comprende la libertad de buscar, recibir y 
difundir informaciones e ideas de toda &#237;ndole, sin consideraci&#243;n de fronteras, ya sea oralmente, 
por escrito o en forma impresa o art&#237;stica, o por cualquier otro procedimiento de su elecci&#243;n&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno a que adopte todas las medidas necesarias para proteger 
los derechos y las libertades de la Sra. Aida Quilcu&#233; Vivas e investigar, procesar e imponer las

<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno de Colombia del 17 de marzo del 2009 
</b></p>
<p> El Estado de Colombia repudi&#243; el homicidio del Sr. Edwin Legarda, ex esposo de la l&#237;der 
ind&#237;gena del Consejo Regional Ind&#237;gena del Cauca (CRIC), Aida Quilqu&#233;. Desde el primer 
momento en que se tuvo conocimiento de la noticia, el Estado, desde su m&#225;s alta nivel conden&#243; 
los presuntos hechos y conmin&#243; a las autoridades competentes, a adelantar las investigaciones a 
que hubiere lugar.  
</p>
<p> En este sentido, el se&#241;or Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica de Colombia, Dr. &#193;lvaro Uribe V&#233;lez 
en declaraci&#243;n de 17 de diciembre de 2008 se&#241;al&#243; lo siguiente: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Compatriotas, expreso nuestro sentido dolor y nuestras m&#225;s profundas condolencias a la 
se&#241;ora Aida Quilqu&#233;, Consejera Mayor del Consejo Regional Ind&#237;gena del Cauca (Cric), a 
toda su familia, al Cric y a toda la comunidad ind&#237;gena, por la muerte del esposo de la 
compatriota Aida, Jos&#233; Edwin Legarda. 
</p>
<p>Durante seis a&#241;os y cuatro meses de Gobierno, hemos impulsado una pol&#237;tica de Seguridad 
Democr&#225;tica pare defender a todos los colombianos. Esa pol&#237;tica ha estimulado el 
pluralismo, esa pol&#237;tica de Seguridad Democr&#225;tica ha protegido a aquellos que defienden 
las tesis del Gobierno y a los cr&#237;ticos del Gobierno. 
</p>
<p>La oposici&#243;n en Colombia ha estado rodeada de garant&#237;as, de garant&#237;as no ret&#243;ricas, de 
garant&#237;as eficaces. Seis a&#241;os, cuatro meses, de una dura oposici&#243;n con plenas garant&#237;as; 
sustentan nuestras afirmaciones. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>En la ma&#241;ana, conocidos estos luctuosos hechos, que nos duelen por el dolor de su familia, 
por el dolor del Cric del Cauca, que nos duelen por la Seguridad Democr&#225;tica, que nos 
duelen como colombianos, despu&#233;s de conocidos estos luctuosos hechos, el Ministro de la 
Defensa y mi persona acordamos que se pedir&#237;a una investigaci&#243;n a la Procuradur&#237;a, a la 
Fiscal&#237;a y tambi&#233;n al delegado de la Alta Comisionada para Derechos Humanos, que 
preside la Delegaci&#243;n en Colombia, y que el Gobierno se sujeta totalmente a las 
comunicaciones de esa investigaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>Las autoridades competentes est&#225;n adelantando con celeridad y diligencia las 
investigaciones penales y disciplinarias tendientes a esclarecer los hechos y establecer sus 
responsables. Asimismo, las autoridades competentes han fortalecido la protecci&#243;n de la 
se&#241;ora Aida Quilqu&#233; y su familia, en aras de garantizar plenamente su vida e integridad 
personal. 
</p>
<p>As&#237; como tenemos que tener la mayor objetividad, pedir las m&#225;s imparciales 
investigaciones, tambi&#233;n estamos obligados a no proceder injustamente contra integrantes 
de nuestro Ej&#233;rcito. Nosotros tenemos que guardar un gran equilibrio en lo que es la 
protecci&#243;n del Ej&#233;rcito, de sus integrantes, y lo que es la protecci&#243;n de la verdad. 
Esperamos que sean estas autoridades investigativas, quienes finalmente nos digan sobre la 
verdad de los hechos. El Cric ha tenido mucha discrepancia con este Gobierno, y esas 
discrepancias se han manejado en un plano de debate constructivo, de debate publico. 
Incluso, en el Consejo Comunitario del pasado s&#225;bado, justamente programado para ser 
realizado en Inz&#225;, municipio caucano de esta regi&#243;n de las comunidades ind&#237;genas, 
expresamos toda nuestra voluntad de poder adelantar un an&#225;lisis con calidez y con 
patriotismo de toda la problem&#225;tica, y buscar dar soluciones. 
</p>
<p>Despu&#233;s de una reuni&#243;n p&#250;blica que tuvimos en &#8220;La Mar&#237;a&#8221; hace algunos domingos, el 
Gobierno, con la coordinaci&#243;n del se&#241;or Ministro del Interior y de Justicia, se reuni&#243; 
durante m&#225;s de doce horas con la minga organizada por estas comunidades ind&#237;genas. Para 
nosotros, el debate es un debate de ideas, es un debate de franqueza, es un debate de 
garant&#237;as plenas a todas las partes, es un debate democr&#225;tico. 
</p>
<p> De otro lado, mediante un comunicado del 17 de diciembre de 2008, el Ministerio de 
Defensa lament&#243; la muerte del se&#241;or Legarda, e inform&#243; a la opini&#243;n publica lo siguiente: 
</p>
<p>1. Se estableci&#243; que tropas del batall&#243;n Jos&#233; Hilario L&#243;pez pertenecientes a la 
III divisi&#243;n del Ejercito Nacional dispararon al autom&#243;vil que conduc&#237;a el 
se&#241;or Legarda, sin que hasta el momento haya suficiente claridad sobre como 
ocurrieron los hechos. 
</p>
<p>2. Es prioridad para el Ministerio de Defensa establecer a la mayor brevedad las 
circunstancias en que ocurrieron los hechos en donde muri&#243; el Se&#241;or Legarda y para 
ellos ya se tomaron medidas. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. Se le solicit&#243; a la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n y la Procuradur&#237;a enviar una 
comisi&#243;n especial al &#225;rea para que adelante las investigaciones necesarias en materia 
penal y disciplinaria, y se les ofreci&#243; todo el apoyo que puedan necesitar. 
</p>
<p>4. Se orden&#243; el desplazamiento del Comandante de la III Divisi&#243;n, General Justo Eliseo 
Pe&#241;a, a la zona, e igualmente del Inspector General de las fuerzas Militares, para que 
encabece una comisi&#243;n interna independiente que verifique los hechos. 
</p>
<p>5. El Ministerio se puso en contacto con la Oficina de la Alta Comisionada de las 
Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos con el fin de garantizar el acceso 
necesario para que realice una investigaci&#243;n. Esta Oficina ya envi&#243; una comisi&#243;n al

</p>
<p>6. El Ministerio de Defensa mantendr&#225; informada a la opini&#243;n p&#250;blica en la medida en 
que las investigaciones arrojen resultados y claridad sobre lo ocurrido, y reitera su 
pol&#237;tica de transparencia con relaci&#243;n a las acciones de todos los integrantes de la 
Fuerza P&#250;blica.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> El Gobierno de Colombia est&#225; plenamente convencido que el respeto y la garant&#237;a de los 
Derechos Humanos son la &#250;nica herramienta para lograr los fines del Estado y en este sentido, 
cualquier violaci&#243;n a estas normas y principios debe ser sancionada a la luz de la legislaci&#243;n 
nacional y los Tratados y Convenios Internacionales debidamente ratificados por el pa&#237;s. 
</p>
<p> Colombia es un Estado Social de Derecho sujeto al imperio de la ley. Tal como se 
encuentra reflejado en los comunicados del Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica y del Ministerio de 
Defensa Nacional, las acciones adelantadas por la Fiscal&#237;a y la Procuradur&#237;a General de la 
Naci&#243;n, el Ministerio del Interior y de Justicia y el Ministerio de Defensa, tienen como objetivo 
primordial esclarecer los hechos y sancionar los responsables; brindar protecci&#243;n efectiva a la 
familia del se&#241;or Legarda y revisar procedimientos Internos al Interior de las Fuerzas Armadas 
para evitar que hechos similares se repitan.

del Cuerpo T&#233;cnico de Investigaci&#243;n (CTI) de la ciudad de Popay&#225;n, capital del departamento 
del Cauca, se desplaz&#243; al sitio donde ocurrieron los mismos con el prop&#243;sito de recolectar la 
evidencia f&#237;sica correspondiente. Una vez all&#237;, se observ&#243; que el sitio no se encontraba protegido, 
que hab&#237;a personas de la guardia ind&#237;gena y curiosos del sector, motivos por el cual se procedi&#243; a 
acordonar el sitio.

<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su Excelencia 
sobre la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas contra la Sra. <b>Lina Paola 
Malag&#243;n D&#237;az</b>, abogada de la <i>Comisi&#243;n Colombiana de Juristas</i> (CCJ) y otro miembro de la 
CCJ. La Sra. Lina Paola Malag&#243;n D&#237;az adelanta actividades sobre la impunidad en casos de 
violaciones cometidas contra las y los sindicalistas en Colombia. El trabajo de la CCJ est&#225; 
orientado a contribuir al desarrollo del derecho internacional de los derechos humanos y del 
derecho internacional humanitario de conformidad con los prop&#243;sitos y principios de la Carta 
de las Naciones Unidas, y a la plena vigencia del Estado social y democr&#225;tico de derecho en 
Colombia. La CCJ ya fue objeto de una comunicaci&#243;n de la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n 
de los defensores de derechos humanos, quien envi&#243; una carta el 3 de septiembre de 2008 
referente a la intimidaci&#243;n sufrida por tres de sus miembros en el curso de su trabajo. 
 Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida:  
</p>
<p>El 2 de marzo de 2009, a las 12h21, habr&#237;a sido recibido un fax en el que se declara como 
objetivo militar a la Sra. Lina Paola Malag&#243;n D&#237;az, abogada de la Comisi&#243;n Colombiana 
de Juristas. En el texto de la amenaza, tambi&#233;n se habr&#237;a mencionado a otro miembro de la 
CCJ, quien habr&#237;a debido salir del pa&#237;s a finales de 2008, por haber sido v&#237;ctima de 
persecuci&#243;n y amenazas por parte del mismo grupo paramilitar, que se autodenomina 
&#8220;<i>Bloque Capital de las &#193;guilas Negras AUC</i>&#8221;.  
En febrero de 2009, Sra. Lina Paola Malag&#243;n D&#237;az realiz&#243; un informe sobre la impunidad 
existente en los cr&#237;menes que se cometen en Colombia contra las y los sindicalistas por sus 
actividades de defensa de los derechos laborales. Este informe habr&#237;a sido un insumo 
importante para la audiencia que se llev&#243; a cabo el 12 de febrero de 2009 en el Congreso 
estadounidense, que fue convocada por el representante George Miller, Presidente de la 
Comisi&#243;n de Educaci&#243;n y Trabajo de la C&#225;mara de Representantes de Estados Unidos, y 
cuyo prop&#243;sito fue examinar la situaci&#243;n de los derechos de los trabajadores en Colombia y 
la violencia antisindical.  
</p>
<p>El trabajo realizado por la CCJ para dicha audiencia se habr&#237;a coordinado con el Director 
de la Escuela Nacional Sindical (ENS) el Sr. Jos&#233; Luciano San&#237;n V&#225;squez, quien habr&#237;a 
participado en el espacio convocado por el Representante a la C&#225;mara de los Estados 
Unidos George Miller. Esta participaci&#243;n habr&#237;a generado la reacci&#243;n del Presidente de la 
Rep&#250;blica &#193;lvaro Uribe V&#233;lez, quien habr&#237;a se&#241;alado a los participantes en la reuni&#243;n 
como personas que distorsionan la verdad, motivadas por &#8220;el odio pol&#237;tico&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Se teme que la amenaza en contra de la Sra. Lina Paola Malag&#243;n D&#237;az y la CCJ est&#233; 
relacionada con el trabajo de la CCJ de proteger los derechos sindicales.  </p>

<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n 
del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n 
Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los 
art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo el derecho a la vida y a la 
seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea 
arbitrariamente privado de su vida. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las 
siguientes normas y principios que son particularmente significativos con respecto a las 
denuncias mencionadas precedentemente: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del 
Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, los principios 4 y 9 a 19 obligan a los 
Gobiernos a garantizar una protecci&#243;n eficaz, judicial o de otro tipo, a los particulares y 
grupos que est&#233;n en peligro de ejecuci&#243;n extralegal, arbitraria o sumaria, en particular a 
aquellos que reciban amenazas de muerte. Los Gobiernos deben proceder a una 
investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha 
de tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas 
investigaciones; y velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya 
identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su 
jurisdicci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Principios b&#225;sicos sobre la funci&#243;n de los abogados, adoptados por el Octavo Congreso 
de las Naciones Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, 
La Habana, 27 de agosto a 7 de septiembre de 1990. Seg&#250;n los principios 16 y 17, los 
gobiernos garantizar&#225;n que los abogados puedan desempe&#241;ar todas sus funciones 
profesionales sin intimidaciones, obst&#225;culos, acosos o interferencias indebidas y sin 
sufrir, ni estar expuestos a persecuciones o sanciones administrativas, econ&#243;micas o de 
otra &#237;ndole. Cuando la seguridad de los abogados sea amenazada a ra&#237;z del ejercicio de 
sus funciones, recibir&#225;n de las autoridades protecci&#243;n adecuada. 
</p>
<p> En este contexto, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las 
normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el 
deber de los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de promover y proteger los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidos y en particular los 
art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos establecen, respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o 
colectivamente, a promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional y que es la responsabilidad 
primordial y el deber de todos los Estados de proteger, promover y hacer efectivos todos los 
derechos humanos, adoptando las medidas necesarias para crear las condiciones sociales, 
econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que toda 
persona sometida a su jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica 
todos esos derechos y libertades.  </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos al art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, que estipula que el Estado 
garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o 
colectivamente, frente a toda violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o 
de derecho, presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los 
derechos mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al reaccionar u 
oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las omisiones, imputables 
a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; 
como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o particulares que afecten el disfrute de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>
<p> Los Relatores Especiales quisieran recordar al Gobierno de su Excelencia la importancia 
que tiene para la protecci&#243;n de los defensores de derechos humanos el reconocimiento de la 
legitimidad de la labor realizada por ellos, as&#237; como la firme condena de las amenazas en su 
contra.

<p> Quisi&#233;ramos instar al Gobierno de su Excelencia a que adopte todas las medidas necesarias 
para proteger los derechos y las libertades de la persona mencionada e investigar, procesar e 
imponer las sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas. 
Quisi&#233;ramos asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales 
hechos.

<p><b>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea:  Killing of 15 persons on a bridge  
located in Joowon-gu, Onsung County in North Hamgyung Province 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of<b> </b>international standards relating to the imposition of capital 
punishment<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:<b> </b>13 females; 2 males 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 20 March 2008</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on torture, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special Rapporteur on situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea  
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the alleged public execution of 13 women and 2 men on a bridge 
located in Joowon-gu, Onsung County in North Hamgyung Province on 20 February 2008. 
</p>
<p> According to information received, the authorities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea had previously advised members of all public institutions, public enterprises, and 
neighborhood units to attend the execution. The people who were executed were reportedly 
accused of planning to cross over to a neighbouring country to receive economic assistance with 
the help of their relatives living abroad. Others were accused of helping people to cross or of 
providing coyote services to those who wanted to cross over. 
</p>
<p> It has been alleged that this execution was designed to dissuade people from crossing 
illegally. There have furthermore been reports that the sentences for illegally crossing to the 
neighbouring country have increased since 1 March 2007, from a prison term of maximum 
3 years to 5-7 years. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
respectfully remind your Excellency that States have the legal duty to ensure and respect the 
right to life and that this right shall be protected by law. Although the death penalty is not 
prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the 
fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. The 
Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
in the DPRK to investigate and report on the situation of human rights in the DPRK and on the 
Government&#8217;s compliance with its obligations under international rights instruments. The 
monitoring of the implementation of all standards relating to the imposition of the capital 
punishment include, in particular, the following:  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 100 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> (1) The &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221; 
(Article 6(2) ICCPR), it being understood that their scope should not go beyond intentional 
crimes with lethal or other extremely grave consequences (Paragraph 1 of the Safeguards 
guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, Economic and Social 
Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984). Under international human rights law, the crimes 
for which those individuals were reportedly executed cannot be considered among the &#8220;most 
serious crimes&#8221; for which the death penalty may be imposed. Furthermore, were the death 
sentences to be carried out in these cases, this would be on the basis of a law itself in violation of 
article 12(2) ICCPR which provides the right of anyone to leave his or her country. 
</p>
<p> (2) &#8220;In capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all 
the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the [ICCPR] admits of no exception&#8221; 
(<i>Little v. Jamaica</i>, communication no. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 
19 November 1991, para. 10); these guarantees include the right to have access to a defense 
counsel of one&#8217;s own choosing, or if the person does not have legal assistance to have a defense 
counsel assigned to him, and the right to be tried publicly.  
</p>
<p> (3) &#8220;Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of 
the sentence.&#8221; (Article 6(4) ICCPR). 
</p>
<p> We would further like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 12 (2) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which your Government is a 
party, which states that &#8220;everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, we consider that public executions constitute degrading punishment in violation 
of Article 7 of the ICCPR, which contains the absolute prohibition of torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p> We would also like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Article 11 (1) of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which your Government is 
also a party, which recognizes &#8220;the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for 
himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous 
improvement of living conditions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Stressing again that we do not make any determination on the facts and circumstances of 
these allegations, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly to seek to clarify 
all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human 
Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide information on the 15 persons mentioned in the summary. 
</p>
<p> 3. For which offences does the law currently provide for the imposition of the death 
penalty? </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 101 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 4. Which courts can impose the death sentence? What appeals and extraordinary 
remedies are available to a person sentenced to death? 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide a complete list of the persons currently in detention under a death 
sentence, with the dates of their sentence, the offences of which they were found guilty, and the 
remedies exhausted by them as well as those still available to them.  
</p>
<p> 6. Please provide clarification on the alleged increase in sentencing for persons who 
have left the DPRK without an exit visa.

<p> J&#8217;aimerais rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence les principes fondamentaux

<p><b>Egypt:  Killings by Egyptian border guards 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>:<b> </b>Deaths due to the use of force by law enforcement officials 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:<b> </b>17 persons (4 males; 4 females (2 minors))<b> </b> 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 16 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of migrants<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received in relation to reports of the use of lethal force by Egyptian border guards against 
migrants, asylum seekers and refugees from other African countries trying to cross the border 
between Egypt and Israel without authorization. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 22 July 2007, just after midnight, <b>Hajja Abbas Haroun</b>, a pregnant Sudanese woman 
aged 28, was trying to cross the border near Rafah together with her husband and her 
two year old daughter as part of a group of Darfurians. They were shot at by Egyptian 
border guards. <b>Hajja Abbas Haroun</b> was hit at the head and died immediately. On 
16 February 2008, <b>Mervat Mer Hatover</b>, an Erytrean citizen aged 37, was shot at by 
Egyptian security forces as she was trying to cross a barbed wire border fence near 
El Kuntillah on the Sinai Peninsula together with her two child daughters. A bullet hit 
her in her head and killed her. On 19 February 2008, Egyptian border security forces 
purportedly shot and killed <b>Ermeniry Khasheef</b>, a Sudanese citizen aged 50, as he was 
trying to cross the border near Rafah. Another Sudanese man, <b>Adam Mohamed Othman</b> 
(aged 23), was killed in the same area on 10 March 2008. On 28 June 2008, Egyptian 
border guards allegedly killed <b>a seven-year-old Sudanese girl and a man </b>as they were 
trying to cross the border near Rafah. <b>Overall 17 persons were shot dead</b> by Egyptian 
border guards to prevent them from crossing the border since the beginning of the year 
2008. Tens more were injured and taken to hospital with serious bullet injuries to the chest, 
back, thighs or legs. 
</p>
<p>The reports we have received indicate that the refugees, asylum seekers and migrants 
arrive near the border fence separating Egypt from Israel at night in small groups aided by 
local smugglers. They run towards the barbed wire fence and try to either climb over it or 
cut through it. The Egyptian border security reportedly usually first order them to stop and 
fire warning shots in the air. However, as the above alleged deadly shootings indicate, 
those who do not stop may be killed or seriously injured by shots to their head or body. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 104 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to refer 
your Government to the principles of international law governing the use of force when policing 
rallies and protests. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to 
which Egypt is a party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the 
person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived 
of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p> In particular, Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement 
officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate 
objective to be achieved. As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement officials 
shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force (Basic 
Principles, Principle 4). Further, whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law 
enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic Principles, Principle 5). Intentional 
lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life (Basic 
Principles, Principle 9). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that your Government has a 
duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. The investigation of 
such cases &#8220;shall be thorough, prompt and impartial. &#8230; The purpose of the investigation shall be 
to determine the cause, manner and time of death, the person responsible, and any pattern or 
practice which may have brought about that death.&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions 
(&#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;)). Principle 17 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention 
and Investigation Principles&#8221;) provides that &#8220;[a] written report shall be made within a reasonable 
period of time on the methods and findings of such investigations. The report shall be made 
public immediately and shall include the scope of the inquiry, procedures and methods used to 
evaluate evidence as well as conclusions and recommendations based on findings of fact and on 
applicable law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected to report on this case to 
the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>

<p><b>Egypt:  Death in custody of seven men

<p><b>Violation alleged</b>:<b> </b>Deaths in custody<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:<b> </b>4 males 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response (recent communication) 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a response concerning these allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 12 March 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture  
</p>
<p> We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government information we 
have received concerning the recent death in custody of Mr. <b>Abdessadek Zaharane Chahine</b>, 
aged 54, as well as the alleged failure to exhaustively clarify the circumstances of three further 
cases of death in custody: Messrs. <b>Ahmed Hassane Fouad</b>, aged 35, resident in Alexandria, 
<b>Mohamed Neboua Abdelhafid</b>, aged 24, and <b>Nasser Sadek Djadallah Georges</b>, aged 45, in 
Egypt.  
</p>
<p> According to information received:  
</p>
<p>M. Abdessadek Zahrane Chahine was arrested on 5 February 2009, at his daughter&#8217;s 
wedding, in Tanta. The officers beat him in front of several witnesses. They hit him with a 
stick, in addition to kicking and punching him. He then lost consciousness and was taken 
to the hospital where the doctor certified his death. The authorities claim that an autopsy 
has been performed, but no information has been communicated to the family.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to draw 
your Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to 
these cases. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that 
&#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or 
her life.  
</p>
<p> When the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies in State custody, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 106 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this respect, we would like to recall the 
conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case (<i>Dermit Barbato v. 
Uruguay</i>, communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraph 9.2): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo Dermit 
committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; yet, the 
inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either by 
act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, as 
required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death in custody, there 
must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, 
arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other 
reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions). This principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in 
Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all 
States have &#8220;the obligation [&#8230;] to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
 The Commission added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, [&#8230;], to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to [&#8230;] prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. These obligations to 
investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also under Articles 7 and 12 
of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
</p>
<p> In the light of the obligations to carry out a thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of 
all cases of death in custody, to hold those responsible accountable and to compensate the family 
of the victim, we would like to draw your attention to three other cases in which, approximately 
two years after the incident, these obligations are alleged not to have been satisfied. According to 
the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 5 November 2006, M. Ahmed Hassane Fouad was arrested by the police of 
Mina Al Bassal and was taken to their detention centre, where he was held incommunicado 
and repeatedly ill-treated. As a result, signs of torture were apparent on his face. A few 
days later, his family was told that he had committed suicide by hanging. The family 
requested that the public prosecutor carry out an autopsy and an investigation. However, 
they received no answer to their request. 
</p>
<p>Mohamed Neboua Abdelhafid was arrested on 10 July 2007, in front of his residence in 
Giza. Police officers took him to the police station of Wassim, where he was ill-treated. A 
few days after his arrest, his family was informed that he had committed suicide by 
throwing himself off the fourth floor of the building. Mr. Neboua Abdelhafid&#8217;s family 
seized the public prosecutor of the case, but he did not order an autopsy or inquiry.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 107 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Nasser Sadek Djadallah Georges died on the morning of 7 August 2007, at around 5 a.m., 
after refusing to pay &#8220;taxes&#8221; to a corrupt police officer. The police had come into his home, 
tied him to his bed while beating, kicking and punching him. Subsequently, they threw him 
out of a window, as testified by several witnesses. He died a few minutes later. The police 
officers claimed that he committed suicide. No inquiry has been ordered by the public 
prosecutor.  
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council 
and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly to seek to clarify all cases 
brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights 
Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation 
to the custodial deaths of Messrs. M. Abdessadek Zaharane Chahine, M. Ahmed Hassane Fouad, 
Mohamed Neboua Abdelhafid and Nasser Sadek Djadallah Georges. If no inquiries have taken 
place or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the deaths in custody Messrs. M. Abdessadek Zaharane Chahine, 
M. Ahmed Hassane Fouad, Mohamed Neboua Abdelhafid and Nasser Sadek Djadallah Georges. 
</p><p> 4. Please indicate whether compensation has been paid to the families of 
Messrs. M. Abdessadek Zaharane Chahine, M. Ahmed Hassane Fouad, Mohamed Neboua

sobre la tortura 
</p>
<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de Su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n 
que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con el Sr. <b>Saturnino Ncogo Mbomyo</b>, en hechos ocurridos en la 
ciudad de Malabo. 
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p>El 12 de marzo de 2008, miembros de la Polic&#237;a se presentaron en el domicilio del 
Sr. Saturnino Ncogo Mbomyo, de nacionalidad guineana, de unos 45 a&#241;os de edad, 
ubicado en el barrio Semu de la mencionada ciudad de Malabo, acus&#225;ndolo de ocultar 
&#8220;cosas&#8221; en su domicilio. Seg&#250;n las denuncias, el interesado no reconoci&#243; que ocultara nada 
en su casa y por ello los polic&#237;as procedieron a arrestarlo y a llev&#225;rselo a la Comisar&#237;a. All&#237; 
lo interrogaron y le hicieron firmar una autorizaci&#243;n de registro de su domicilio, d&#243;nde mas 
tarde regresaron acompa&#241;ados de varias autoridades para proceder a un registro legal de la 
casa. 
</p>
<p>Los polic&#237;as habr&#237;an encontrado en el cielorraso (techo) de la vivienda del Sr. Saturnino 
Ncogo Mbomyo un paquete de droga conocida con el nombre de &#8220;Banga&#8221; (planta 
alucin&#243;gena local que se fuma) y un mill&#243;n de Francos guineanos CFA (unos 1.525 &#8364;). 
Adem&#225;s, habr&#237;an descubierto una zona irregular en un rinc&#243;n de su habitaci&#243;n, en cuyo 
suelo, al ser demolido con picos y mazas, hab&#237;an armas bien conservadas en envoltorios 
que hubieran permitido su mantenimiento por mucho tiempo. Se ha dicho que la polic&#237;a 
habr&#237;a encontrado tres fusiles de asalto tipo &#8220;Cetme&#8221;, un fusil con mira telesc&#243;pica y una 
pistola provista de silenciador, as&#237; como abundante munici&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>De acuerdo con las informaciones, mientras llevaban detenido al Sr. Saturnino Ncogo 
Mbomyo empezar&#237;an a exigirle los nombres de sus c&#243;mplices, adem&#225;s su casa y sus 
negocios habr&#237;an sido precintados, y su mujer e hijos echados a la calle. Durante la tarde 
del mismo d&#237;a se desencadenar&#237;a una serie de arrestos y detenciones cuyo n&#250;mero exacto 
de detenidos se desconocer&#237;a, pero que seg&#250;n fuentes fidedignas podr&#237;an oscilar en torno a 
la decena, incluyendo el Sr. Juan Micha, alias Opalon, quien luego fue liberado el 15 de 
marzo, y el Sr. Gerardo Ang&#252;e, alias Bater&#237;a. Tambi&#233;n se encontrar&#237;a detenido un se&#241;or de 
nombre Jes&#250;s cuyo apellido no se ha informado, alias Tite, quien tendr&#237;a relaciones 
familiares directas con altos cargos del gobierno. Adem&#225;s se ha informado que otras 
personas estar&#237;an bajo &#243;rdenes de busca y captura. 
Al d&#237;a siguiente, el 13 de marzo de 2008, la familia del Sr. Saturnino Ncogo Mbomyo 
habr&#237;a sido informada de su fallecimiento y su cuerpo habr&#237;a sido discretamente entregado 
a la familia el 16 de marzo, procediendo a ser enterrado el mismo d&#237;a. Se ha informado que 
la versi&#243;n que dieron las autoridades fue que el Sr. Saturnino Ncogo Mbomyo se hab&#237;a 
suicidado, sin embargo muy pocas personas, incluyendo su abogado, habr&#237;an podido ver el 
cad&#225;ver y se habr&#237;a denunciado que algunas de ellas habr&#237;an manifestado la existencia de 
una herida en la sien (hueso temporal de la cabeza) del Sr. Ncogo Mbomyo. Se ha 
informado que hasta la redacci&#243;n de este comunicado, las autoridades seguir&#237;an sin 
pronunciarse oficial y p&#250;blicamente sobre lo ocurrido con el Sr. Saturnino Ncogo 
Mbomyo. </p>

<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n 
del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n 
Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los 
art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo los derechos a la vida y a la 
seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea 
arbitrariamente privado de su vida. Adem&#225;s, seg&#250;n los art&#237;culos 2 y 10, los Estados se 
comprometen a respetar y a garantizar el derecho de toda persona privada de libertad a ser 
tratada humanamente y con el respeto debido a la dignidad inherente al ser humano.  
</p>
<p> Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre los 
Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, 
arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y 
Social que son particularmente significativos con respecto a las denuncias mencionadas 
precedentemente. En particular, los principios 9 a 19 obligan a los Gobiernos a proceder a una 
investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de 
ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, incluyendo una autopsia adecuada; a publicar en 
un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y a velar por que sean juzgadas las 
personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones en 
cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
 Quisi&#233;ramos tambi&#233;n hacer un llamamiento a Su Excelencia para buscar una clarificaci&#243;n 
de los hechos para asegurar que el derecho a la integridad f&#237;sica y mental de estas personas sean 
protegidos, de conformidad, entre otros a la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos, el 
Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, la Declaraci&#243;n sobre la Protecci&#243;n de todas 
las Personas contra la Tortura y Otros Tratos o Penas Crueles, Inhumanos o Degradantes y la

</p>
<p> En caso de que sus investigaciones apoyen o sugieren la exactitud de las alegaciones 
mencionadas m&#225;s arriba, quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno que adopte todas las medidas 
necesarias para proteger los derechos de la persona mencionada e investigar, procesar e imponer 
las sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas. 
Quisi&#233;ramos asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales 
hechos. 
</p>
<p> Es nuestra responsabilidad de acuerdo con los mandatos que me ha entregado la Comisi&#243;n 
de Derechos Humanos, y esta reforzado por las resoluciones pertinentes de la Asamblea General, 
intentar conseguir clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos llevados a mi atenci&#243;n. En nuestro deber de 
informar sobre esos casos al Consejo de Derechos Humanos, estar&#237;amos muy agradecidos de

que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con el asesinato del Sr. <b>Miguel &#193;ngel Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez</b>, uno 
de los fundadores de SITRABANSUR (Sindicato de Trabajadores Bananeros del Sur), que 
habr&#237;a sido asesinado en el pueblo de El Semillero, departamento de Escuintla, a unos 
150 kil&#243;metros de la Ciudad de Guatemala. Quiero tambi&#233;n expresar mi preocupaci&#243;n en 
relaci&#243;n con las amenazas en contra de otros sindicalistas de SITRABANSUR. El sindicato 
SITRABANSUR fue creado por trabajadores del sector bananero en julio de 2007 para negociar 
un convenio colectivo. 
</p>
<p>Seg&#250;n los informes, los propietarios de la plantaci&#243;n no pagar&#237;an el salario m&#237;nimo, ni 
tampoco la seguridad social y otras contribuciones. 
</p>
<p>El 20 de noviembre de 2007, todos los miembros fundadores del sindicato, incluidos sus 
dirigentes y sus familias, habr&#237;an sido despedidos de sus empleos y desalojados de sus 
casas, al parecer a consecuencia de sus actividades sindicales. Los Sres. <b>Germ&#225;n Aguilar

</p>
<p>El 2 de marzo de 2008, dos hombres armados y con el rostro cubierto por pasamonta&#241;as 
habr&#237;an estado acechando cerca de la casa del Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez. Cuando &#233;ste regres&#243; a 
su casa, habr&#237;an abierto fuego contra &#233;l. El Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez habr&#237;a entrado corriendo 
en la casa y habr&#237;a tratado de escapar por la puerta trasera. Uno de los hombres lo habr&#237;a 
seguido, mientras el otro habr&#237;a rodeado la casa para interceptarlo y lo habr&#237;a arrojado al 
suelo. El Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez habr&#237;a tratado de huir, pero le dispararon por la espalda. 
Luego le habr&#237;an disparado varias veces m&#225;s, mientras yac&#237;a herido en el suelo. Habr&#237;a 
muerto unas dos horas despu&#233;s en el hospital. Los informes iniciales indican que su 
cad&#225;ver presentaba cuatro heridas de bala y al menos una de arma blanca. 
</p>
<p>Los familiares del Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez habr&#237;an declarado que, unos 15 d&#237;as antes de ser 
asesinado, habr&#237;a dicho que los gestores de la plantaci&#243;n le hab&#237;an ofrecido dinero para que 
dimitiera de su cargo en SITRABANSUR. Tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a dicho que hab&#237;a recibido 
amenazas de muerte telef&#243;nicas. 
</p>
<p>Otros miembros del Comit&#233; Ejecutivo de SITRABANSUR habr&#237;an sufrido intimidaci&#243;n. 
El 29 de febrero, el Sr. V&#237;ctor Manuel G&#243;mez Mendoza habr&#237;a informado que unos 
hombres no identificados hab&#237;an preguntado a su vecino por su paradero. El 3 de marzo, el 
Sr. Alberto L&#243;pez P&#233;rez habr&#237;a afirmado que unos hombres no identificados hab&#237;an estado 
vigilando su casa. Durante la noche del 8 de marzo, unos intrusos habr&#237;an entrado en su 
casa, pero el Sr. L&#243;pez P&#233;rez y su familia habr&#237;an logrado escapar. 
</p>
<p> Se teme que el asesinato del Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez y las amenazas contra los sindicalistas 
de SITRABANSUR est&#233;n relacionados con su labor en defensa de los derechos humanos, en 
particular los derechos de los trabajadores del sector bananero. Estos hechos, de ser confirmados, 
se enmarcan en el cuadro de gran inseguridad y riesgo que constat&#233; durante mi reciente visita a 
Guatemala en febrero de 2008. En mi comunicado de prensa, se&#241;al&#233; que &#8220;entre los grupos m&#225;s 
afectados se cuentan los defensores que trabajan en los derechos econ&#243;micos, sociales y 
culturales&#8221; y que &#8220;otros sectores de la comunidad de defensores sufren ataques espec&#237;ficos a su 
&#225;mbito de trabajo, entro otros, los sindicalistas&#8221;. 
 Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n

</p>
<p><b>Llamamiento urgente del 20 de agosto de 2008</b>, mandato con el<b> </b>Relator Especial sobre la 
promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n y la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos<b> 
</b></p>
<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n 
que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con los Sres. <b>Eliazar Hern&#225;ndez</b>, <b>Mario G&#225;mez</b> y 
<b>Juan Navarro</b>, y 15 otros miembros de la Asociaci&#243;n Cristiana de J&#243;venes de Guatemala (ACJ) 
en la municipalidad de Amatitl&#225;n. La ACJ est&#225; afiliada a la <i>World Alliance of YMCAs </i>(Alianza 
Mundial de los YMCA) y se dedica a la formaci&#243;n de j&#243;venes en liderazgo, voluntariado y 
participaci&#243;n ciudadana. Los Sres. Eliazar Hern&#225;ndez, Mario G&#225;mez y Juan Navarro eran 
voluntarios con la ACJ y trabajaban con j&#243;venes para evitar que ingresasen en pandillas o que 
participaran en actividades que les colocaran en riesgo.

<p>El 10 de agosto de 2008, aproximadamente a las 21h00, los Sres. Eliazar Hern&#225;ndez, 
Mario G&#225;mez y Juan Navarro habr&#237;an salido de la sede de la ACJ en Amatitl&#225;n despu&#233;s 
de una reuni&#243;n sobre trabajo preparatorio para abrir un centro recreativo de arte, con 
direcci&#243;n a la casa de Eliazar Hern&#225;ndez. M&#225;s tarde, esa misma noche, habr&#237;an recibido

<p> 
</p>
<p>pronto. El 11 de agosto de 2008, se habr&#237;an encontrado sus cad&#225;veres en la finca El Llano, 
en Pal&#237;n, en el Kil&#243;metro 38, Jurisdicci&#243;n de San Vicente Pacaya, a aproximadamente 
10 kil&#243;metros de Amatitl&#225;n. Los voluntarios habr&#237;an sufrido cortes de machete, golpeas 
severos y fueron ejecutados con un disparo en la cara y dos tiros de gracia dados en la parte 
de atr&#225;s de la cabeza.  
</p>
<p> Se alega que los asesinatos de los Sres. Eliazar Hern&#225;ndez, Mario G&#225;mez y Juan Navarro 
podr&#237;an estar relacionados con sus actividades para disuadir a los j&#243;venes de unirse a las 
pandillas. Estos asesinatos se enmarcan en un contexto de gran vulnerabilidad de los defensores 
de los derechos humanos en Guatemala. Por eso se expresa gran preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad 
f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de los 15 otros miembros de la ACJ en Amatitl&#225;n.  
</p>
<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las siguientes normas y principios que son 
particularmente significativos con respecto a la denuncia mencionada precedentemente. Los 
Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, 
arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y 
Social. En particular, los principios 4 y 9 a 19 obligan a los Gobiernos a garantizar una 
protecci&#243;n eficaz, judicial o de otro tipo, a los particulares y grupos que est&#233;n en peligro de 
ejecuci&#243;n extralegal, arbitraria o sumaria. Los Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n 
exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o 
amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y velar por que sean 
juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales 
ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
 En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos expresar nuestra preocupaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con la 
informaci&#243;n recibida que, al d&#237;a siguiente de la muerte de los voluntarios de la ACJ, en algunos 
medios de comunicaci&#243;n habr&#237;an aparecido acusaciones de que los muertos eran delincuentes. 
Esas acusaciones se basar&#237;an en declaraciones de miembros de la Comisar&#237;a de Pal&#237;n, entre ellos 
el Subcomisario Sr. Leonel Garc&#237;a, reforzadas por declaraciones del Subdirector de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional Civil, Sr. Henry L&#243;pez, afirmando que las v&#237;ctimas eran &#8220;roba motos&#8221;, y de la posible 
sucesi&#243;n de hechos de un ajuste de cuentas ocurrida en la mencionada carretera donde fueron 
encontrados los cuerpos.  
</p>
<p> Asimismo, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas 
fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de 
los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos 
establecen, respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos al art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, que estipula que el Estado 
garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o 
colectivamente, frente a toda violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o 
de derecho, presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los 
derechos mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al reaccionar u 
oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las omisiones, imputables 
a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; 
como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o particulares que afecten el disfrute de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>
<p> El derecho a formar asociaciones para la promoci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, como la 
ACJ, es un aspecto especialmente importante del derecho de asociaci&#243;n enunciado en el 
art&#237;culo 22 del Pacto Internacional de los Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Toda persona tiene 
derecho a asociarse libremente con otras &#8230;&#8221;. Rogamos que su Gobierno adopte las medidas 
necesarias para el pleno respeto de este derecho. 
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno las preocupaciones expresadas 
en el informe del Relator Especial sobre las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias 
durante su visita a Guatemala (A/HRC/4/20/Add.2, paras. 35 and 36): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Las amenazas de muerte, el miedo a las ejecuciones extrajudiciales inminentes y los 
asesinatos de defensores de los derechos humanos son de una frecuencia alarmante. [&#8230;] 
Son pocos los ataques contra los defensores de los derechos humanos que son investigados 
y menos a&#250;n los casos que dan lugar a condenas, y el asesinato de defensores de los 
derechos humanos ha aumentado en gran parte debido a que no se ha investigado ni 
castigado a sus autores. Un gran n&#250;mero de asesinatos va precedido de amenazas de 
muerte o actos de intimidaci&#243;n que no son investigados. Una investigaci&#243;n eficaz de esas 
amenazas de muerte podr&#237;a evitar nuevos asesinatos.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Quisi&#233;ramos instar a su Gobierno a que adopte todas las medidas necesarias para proteger 
los derechos y las libertades de los otros miembros de la Asociaci&#243;n Cristiana de J&#243;venes de 
Guatemala (ACJ) en la municipalidad de Amatitl&#225;n e investigar, procesar e imponer las 
sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas. Quisi&#233;ramos 
asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales hechos. 
</p>
<p> Teniendo en cuenta la urgencia del caso, agradecer&#237;amos recibir del Gobierno de su 
Excelencia una respuesta sobre las acciones emprendidas para proteger los derechos de las 
personas anteriormente mencionadas. 
</p>
<p> Es nuestra responsabilidad, de acuerdo con los mandatos que nos han sido otorgados por el 
Consejo de Derechos Humanos, intentar clarificar los hechos llevados a nuestra atenci&#243;n. En este 
sentido, estar&#237;amos muy agradecidos de tener su cooperaci&#243;n y sus observaciones sobre los 
asuntos siguientes, siempre y cuando sean aplicables al caso en cuesti&#243;n:

<p> De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p>El 7 de agosto de 2008, varios desconocidos habr&#237;an atacado al Sr Antonio Morales L&#243;pez. 
Le habr&#237;an matado a tiros, caus&#225;ndole cuatro heridas en el t&#243;rax y en el brazo derecho.

</p>
<p><b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n del 23 de septiembre de 2008</b>, mandado con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos 
</p>
<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n 
que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con los intentos de asesinato del Sr. <b>Yuri Melini</b>, Director del 
<i>Centro de Acci&#243;n Legal-Ambiental y Social de Guatemala (CALAS)</i>, del Sr. <b>Carlos Albacete 
Rosales </b>y de la Sra. <b>Piedad Espinosa Albacete </b>de la organizaci&#243;n medioambiental Tr&#243;pico 
Verde<i>. </i>CALAS trabaja para defender los derechos medioambientales y los derechos de los 
defensores de dichos derechos.  
</p>
<p> De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p>El 4 de septiembre de 2008, entre las 7h20 y las 7h30, el Sr. Yuri Melini habr&#237;a descendido 
de su veh&#237;culo para dirigirse a la casa de un familiar. Dos veh&#237;culos, uno de los cuales ser&#237;a 
un sed&#225;n celeste viejo, habr&#237;an estado esper&#225;ndole. Un desconocido en uno de los 
veh&#237;culos llam&#243; al Sr. Yuri Melini. Al atraerle la atenci&#243;n, el desconocido dispar&#243; cuatro 
veces al Sr. Yuri Melini. Un tiro le habr&#237;a dado al abdomen, otro a la rodilla derecha y otro 
al f&#233;mur izquierdo. El mismo d&#237;a del ataque contra el Sr. Yuri Melini, 50 otros defensores 
de los derechos medioambientales en Guatemala habr&#237;an recibido amenazas.  
</p>
<p>En un incidente parecido, el 10 de enero de 2007, el Sr. Carlos Albacete Rosales<b> </b>y la Sra. 
Piedad Espinosa Albacete<b> </b>de la organizaci&#243;n medioambiental, Tr&#243;pico Verde habr&#237;an sido 
v&#237;ctimas de disparos, resultando ilesas.  
</p>
<p> Entendemos que el Gobierno de Guatemala ha condenado los intentos de asesinato y ha 
demostrado su apoyo al trabajo de CALAS en un comunicado de prensa, y que la polic&#237;a y la 
oficina fiscal han iniciado investigaciones respecto a los incidentes. Sin embargo, estos hechos se 
han enmarcado en un contexto de gran vulnerabilidad para los defensores de los derechos 
medioambientales en Guatemala. Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n que el intento de asesinato del 
Sr. Yuri Melini, as&#237; como los del Sr. Carlos Albacete Rosales y de la Sra. Piedad Espinosa 
Albacete, podr&#237;a estar relacionado con sus actividades para defender los derechos 
medioambientales. Se expresa gran preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del 
Sr. Yuri Melini y los dem&#225;s defensores de los derechos medioambientales en Guatemala. </p>

<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e 
investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias (resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de 
mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social). En particular, el principio 4 obliga a los 
Gobiernos a garantizar una protecci&#243;n eficaz, judicial o de otro tipo, a los particulares y grupos 
que est&#233;n en peligro de ejecuci&#243;n extralegal, arbitraria o sumaria. Los Gobiernos deben proceder

tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y 
velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como 
participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
 Quisi&#233;ramos adem&#225;s llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas 
fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de 
los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos

promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el

violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, presi&#243;n 
o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los derechos 
mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al 
reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las 
omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y 
las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o

los derechos y las libertades de la persona mencionada e investigar, procesar e imponer las 
sanciones adecuadas a cualquier persona responsable de las violaciones alegadas. Quisi&#233;ramos 
asimismo instarle a que tome las medidas eficaces para evitar que se repitan tales hechos.

<p><b>Guyana:  Death in custody of Ramesh &#8216;Kenny&#8217; Sawh, Edwin Niles and  
Rocky Anthony Brunoanish 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>:<b> </b>Deaths in custody 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:<b> </b>3 males 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Guyana has failed to cooperate 
with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 24 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have received 
concerning three cases of death in custody in Guyana.  
</p>
<p> According to the allegations received: 
</p>
<p>On 17 January 2008, <b>Ramesh &#8216;Kenny&#8217; Sawh</b> (aged 19) was arrested and taken to Enmore 
police station in East Coast Demerara, allegedly on charges of stealing a car battery. He 
died in the police jail on the same day. The police never informed his family as to how he </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 123 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>had died, but allegedly told others that he committed suicide in the police jail by hanging 
himself by his jersey. A witness has reported that also on 17 January 2008, he heard 
someone screaming and asking for the beating to stop at Enmore police station. At the 
mortuary in Georgetown, members of the Sawh family were initially not allowed to see the 
body of the dead young man, but only his face. Allegedly, there were no markings around 
the neck, but instead he had swollen lips and, as the family could see later, bruises on his 
body. In April 2008, after repeated pleas from the Sawh family and several letters by an 
attorney retained by the family, the Police Complaints Authority launched an investigation 
into the death of Ramesh &#8216;Kenny&#8217; Sawh.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Sawh had previously been repeatedly held at that police station without being 
officially charged and been ill-treated by police officers. On one occasion, during 
interrogation police officers placed a plastic bag over his head and beat him. On another, 
they soaked his head in water and continued beating him with a broom head. 
</p>
<p><b>Edwin Niles</b> (aged 34) was serving a three year sentence for possession of marijuana in 
Camp Street prison in Georgetown. Approximately on 4 June 2008, during a routine search 
following a day of labour at an army base (Camp Ayanganna), the prison guards found 
ammunition in the pockets of Mr. Niles pants. He was beaten by the prison guards after the 
ammunition was discovered. The police subsequently took him to a Georgetown hospital; 
his (common law) wife was not allowed to visit him there. On 13 June 2008, Edwin Niles 
succumbed to his injuries in hospital. The autopsy revealed that he died as a result of a 
blood clot in the lungs. Photographs taken during the post mortem examination showed 
that he had sustained extensive burns on his shoulders, back and buttocks. He also had a 
broken arm when he was brought to hospital. An investigation by the police pointed to 
four officers who could have been involved in the death of Edwin Niles. On 17 or 
18 September 2008, the Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that two Assistant 
Superintendents of the Georgetown Prisons be charged with manslaughter for the killing of 
Edwin Niles. The two Assistant Superintendents have been released on bail. 
</p>
<p>In a case that remains open after seven years, <b>Rocky Anthony Brunoanish </b>(aged 29) was 
taken into police custody on 6 June 2001 by two officers of the Guyana Police Force (their 
names are on record with the Rapporteurs). On 9 June 2001, Mr. Brunoanish informed a 
visitor at the Aurora Police Station jail that he was being beaten by police. He died that 
very same day at the Aurora Police Station. On 10 June 2001, an autopsy performed on 
Mr. Brunoanish determined that the cause of death was cerebral haemorrhaging caused by 
a blunt trauma to the head. More than three years later, on 20 July 2004, the matter was 
reported to the Ombudsman, the Honourable Justice S.Y. Mohamed. No investigation has 
yet taken place in order to clarify the circumstances of Mr. Brunoanish&#8217;s death.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to draw 
your Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to 
this case. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that &#8220;[n]o 
one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When 
the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 124 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this respect - 
and particularly with regard to the case of Ramesh &#8216;Kenny&#8217; Sawh -, we would like to recall the 
conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case (<i>Dermit Barbato v. 
Uruguay</i>, communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraph 9.2): 
</p>
<p>While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo Dermit 
committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; yet, the 
inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either by 
act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, as 
required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p> In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from 
injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all 
suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where 
complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above 
circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human 
Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have 
&#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Government to complete the inquiries into the circumstances surrounding 
the deaths of Ramesh &#8216;Kenny&#8217; Sawh, Edwin Niles and Rocky Anthony Brunoanish 
expeditiously, impartially and transparently, also with a view to taking all appropriate 
disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any person guilty of the 
alleged violations, as well as to compensate their families.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the case summaries accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to each of the cases. Please explain the steps 
taken to ensure that these investigations comply with the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 125 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the deaths in custody of Ramesh &#8216;Kenny&#8217; Sawh, Edwin Niles and 
Rocky Anthony Brunoanish. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please explain how internal and external police oversight and accountability 
mechanisms, including the Police Complaints Authority, operate in the case of a death in 
custody. Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government envisage any reforms to internal police oversight 
and complaints mechanisms, to external police oversight and complaints mechanisms, or to the 
way criminal cases against police officers are prosecuted? 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide the details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants, 
witnesses and family members of the victims in these cases are not subject to any intimidation or 
retaliation, as provided in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 6. Please provide the details of any compensation payments made to the families or 
dependants of any of the victims in the cases mentioned in the Annex.

<p>El 11 de junio de 2008, aproximadamente a las 10.30 p.m., el Sr Irene Ram&#237;rez habr&#237;a sido 
asesinado en la ciudad de Trujillo, Col&#243;n. El d&#237;a anterior el Sr Irene Ram&#237;rez habr&#237;a

<p> El Relator Especial lamenta que el Gobierno de Honduras no haya cooperado con el 
mandato otorgado al Relator Especial por la Asamblea General y la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos 
Humanos. 
</p>
<p><b>Carta de alegaci&#243;n del 22 de enero de 2009</b>,<b> </b>mandado con el<b> </b>Relator Especial sobre el derecho 
a la alimentaci&#243;n<b> 
</b></p>
<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de Su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n 
que hemos recibido sobre la muerte del Sr. <b>Guillermo Norales Herrera</b> en hechos ocurridos en 
frente al &#225;rea protegida de Vida Silvestre, Cuero y Salado, en Cayos Cochinos. 
</p>
<p> De acuerdo con las informaciones que hemos recibido: 
</p>
<p>El 24 de septiembre de 2008, aproximadamente a las 9h30 de la noche, un grupo de 
8 pescadores de la comunidad Gar&#237;funa de Triunfo de la Cruz fueron requeridos por 
miembros de la Fuerza Naval de Honduras, a cargo de la vigilancia del refugio de 
Vida Silvestre Cuero y Salado, mientras estaban faenando frente al &#225;rea protegida. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 133 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Los militares se acercaron a la lancha de los pescadores, que ten&#237;a el motor apagado, 
controlaron su equipaje e interrogaron a los pescadores antes de ordenarles que les 
siguieran. Cuando uno de los pescadores, el Sr. Guillermo Norales Herrera, se dispuso 
a encender el motor de la lancha, los militares empezaron a disparar. Seg&#250;n los 
testimonios de los pescadores, hubo entre 20 y 25 disparos, uno de los cuales alcanz&#243; al 
Sr. Norales Herrera, quien falleci&#243; de manera inmediata.  
</p>
<p>Los pescadores les pidieron ayuda pero los militares se retiraron, sin ofrecerles asistencia. 
El grupo de pescadores se qued&#243; a la deriva, puesto que uno de los proyectiles hab&#237;a 
alcanzado el motor y lo hab&#237;a estropeado. A pesar de que llamaron desde alta mar por 
celular a la polic&#237;a, no recibieron asistencia. Llegaron remando hasta la orilla de las playas 
de Triunfo de la Cruz, donde fueron remolcados por miembros de su comunidad.  
</p>
<p>Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que la muerte del Sr. Norales Herrera pueda ser el 
resultado de un uso excesivo de la fuerza militar. Asimismo, se alega que la muerte del 
Sr. Herrera y otros hechos violentos ocurridos en Cayos Cochinos forman parte de una 
din&#225;mica m&#225;s amplia que surgi&#243; como consecuencia de la aplicaci&#243;n de los planes de 
manejo para esta zona y que han contribuido a generar inseguridad f&#237;sica y alimentaria.  
Aunque la creaci&#243;n de &#225;reas protegidas en la zona de Cayos Cochinos responda a 
necesidades medio ambientales importantes, se nos informa que esto ha contribuido a 
generar tensiones sobre el manejo de los recursos naturales que son vitales para el acceso a 
una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada y suficiente de las comunidades locales. Se alega que el plan de 
manejo del &#225;rea marina protegida de Cayos Cochinos comprende una serie de regulaciones 
que disciplinan la extracci&#243;n de recursos naturales y que limitan la pesca, aunque sea para 
el sustento de la familia. Estas limitaciones habr&#237;an afectado en particular a dos 
comunidades Garifunas de la isla de Chachahuate y de la isla Oriental. Se alega tambi&#233;n 
que la zona de Cayos Cochinos, como toda la costa norte del pa&#237;s, ha padecido a manos de 
la flota pesquera industrial un saqueo sistem&#225;tico de los recursos ictiol&#243;gicos, afectando el 
acceso de los pescadores artesanales, en su mayor&#237;a garifunas, a una alimentaci&#243;n 
adecuada y suficiente, basada principalmente en los frutos de la pesca. Estos pescadores 
habr&#237;an visto diminuir sus capturas teniendo que viajar a mayores distancias de sus 
comunidades para lograr el sustento de sus familias.  
</p>
<p>Adem&#225;s el acceso a los recursos naturales de estas comunidades est&#225; vinculado con el 
r&#233;gimen que disciplina el acceso a la tierra. a este respecto, parece que estas comunidades 
Garifunas no poseen todav&#237;a t&#237;tulos de propiedad de la tierra y que estos asentamientos 
contin&#250;an siendo considerados temporales. Este problema convierte a las comunidades en 
vulnerables ante las demandas de tierra que vienen de empresarios o consorcios de 
empresarios que se apropian de esta tierra con fines lucrativos. La falta de t&#237;tulos de 
propiedad de la tierra es un elemento que, parece, ha caracterizado una discriminaci&#243;n 
contra las comunidades Garifunas en todo el pa&#237;s. Por ejemplo, se nos informa que las 
comunidades se establecieron en Chachahuate y en la isla oriental porque, tras haber 
perdido su tierra, no pudieron encontrar otro trabajo en la parte continental del pa&#237;s.  </p>

</p>
<p>Las informaciones recibidas indican que Cayos Cochinos ha experimentado un aumento 
importante del turismo y en particular del turismo cient&#237;fico. Aunque las comunidades 
Garifunas parecen ser favorables a la diversificaci&#243;n de las fuentes de sustento y de 
ingresos, alegan que ellos no han gozado todav&#237;a de los beneficios que esta actividad 
deber&#237;a aportar, como por ejemplo la creaci&#243;n de nuevos puestos de trabajo y nuevas 
fuentes de sustento. En este respecto, las comunidades lamentan que los nuevos puestos de 
trabajo son preferentemente proporcionados a los forasteros.  
</p>
<p> Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y 
Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo los derechos a la 
vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que 
nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida.  
</p>
<p> Asimismo, nos gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno sobre el C&#243;digo de conducta 
para funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, resoluci&#243;n 34/169 de 17 de diciembre 
de 1979 de la Asamblea General. En particular, el art&#237;culo 3 establece que los funcionarios 
encargados de hacer cumplir la ley podr&#225;n usar la fuerza s&#243;lo cuando sea estrictamente necesario 
y en la medida en que lo requiera el desempe&#241;o de sus tareas. En este mismo sentido, nos 
gustar&#237;a referirnos tambi&#233;n a los Principios b&#225;sicos sobre el empleo de la fuerza y de armas de 
fuego por los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, adoptados por el Octavo 
Congreso de las Naciones Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, 
La Habana, 27 de agosto a 7 de septiembre de 1990. Dichos principios establecen que los 
funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, en el desempe&#241;o de sus funciones, utilizar&#225;n en 
la medida de lo posible medios no violentos y delimitar&#225;n el empleo de la fuerza a determinados 
casos excepcionales, incluidos los de defensa propia o de otras personas en caso de peligro 
inminente de muerte o lesiones graves.  
</p>
<p> Nos gustar&#237;a referirnos tambi&#233;n a los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e 
investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de 
mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, los principios 9 a 19 obligan a los 
Gobiernos a proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en 
que haya sospecha de ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias; a publicar en un informe 
las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y a velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la 
investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio 
bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
 En este contexto, exhortamos respetuosamente a las autoridades de su Gobierno a que 
investiguen de forma completa y exhaustiva los hechos que dieron lugar a la muerte del 
Sr. Guillermo Norales Herrera, que se impongan las sanciones adecuadas al responsable o los 
responsables de dicha muerte, y que se otorgue compensaci&#243;n adecuada a la familia de la 
v&#237;ctima. 
</p>
<p> Quisi&#233;ramos tambi&#233;n hacer referencia al derecho a un nivel de vida adecuado que incluye 
el acceso a una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada que est&#225; reconocido, entre otros, en la Declaraci&#243;n </p>

<p>Universal sobre los Derechos Humanos y en el art&#237;culo 11 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos 
Econ&#243;micos, Sociales y Culturales. Todos los Estados Partes tienen las obligaciones de respetar, 
proteger y realizar este derecho. En particular la obligaci&#243;n de respetar el acceso existente a una 
alimentaci&#243;n adecuada requiere que los Estados no adopten medidas de ning&#250;n tipo que tengan 
por resultado impedir ese acceso. Asimismo la obligaci&#243;n de proteger un nivel de vida adecuado 
requiere que los Estados Partes adopten medidas para velar por que las empresas o los 
particulares no priven a las personas del acceso a una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada.

<p>derechos de las personas transg&#233;nero en Honduras, los asesinatos de tres otras personas 
transg&#233;nero, la Sra. <b>Jazm&#237;n</b> (Pablo Rafael Zepeda), la Sra. <b>Bibi</b> (Alex Eduardo Vargas Medina) 
y la Sra. <b>Nohelia</b> (Carlos Alberto Rodriguez), y otros recientes actos de agresi&#243;n contra personas 
transg&#233;nero en Honduras.  
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p>En la madrugada del 9 de enero de 2009, tres hombres desconocidos efectuaron varios 
disparos contra la Sra. Nicole, activista por los derechos de las personas transg&#233;nero en 
Honduras, desde un autom&#243;vil azul en marcha en el Barrio Guaserique, Comayaguela, una 
ciudad colindante a Tegucigalpa. La Sra. Nicole recibi&#243; tres disparos en el pecho y uno en 
la cabeza, y muri&#243; a causa de las heridas. 
</p>
<p>El 20 de diciembre de 2008, cuatro agentes del cuerpo de polic&#237;a golpearon a una 
trabajadora sexual y activista transg&#233;nero dedicada a la difusi&#243;n de campa&#241;as de 
prevenci&#243;n del VIH/SIDA en el distrito del Palmira, Tegucigalpa. Los agentes intentaron 
robarla pero cuando se resisti&#243;, le asaltaron. Los agentes entonces le rotaron la cabeza 
contra una ventana y ella recibi&#243; cortes numerosos en su cara. Los agentes dijeron que 
estaban arrestando a la se&#241;ora por romper la ventana para entrar a una propiedad privada. 
La llevaron a un centro medico local para tratar sus heridas. Despu&#233;s de que les dijo a los 
agentes que tiene SIDA, le insultaron. Luego le amenazaron: &#8220;si hablas, te dejaremos 
muerta en el monte.&#8221; Se le liber&#243; sin cargos el d&#237;a siguiente.  
</p>
<p>El 17 de diciembre de 2008, un agresor desconocido mat&#243; la Sra. Nohelia  
(Carlos Alberto Rodriguez), una trabajadora sexual transg&#233;nero cuando le asest&#243; 
catorce pu&#241;aladas. 
</p>
<p>El 21 de noviembre de 2008, otro agresor dispar&#243; a la se&#241;ora Bibi (Alex Eduardo 
Vargas Medina), otra trabajadora sexual transg&#233;nero, mientras se encontraba trabajando en 
el Obelisco, parque ubicado en la zona c&#233;ntrica de Comayag&#252;ela.  
</p>
<p>El d&#237;a 30 de octubre de 2008 un agresor, cuya identidad permanece desconocida, asesin&#243; a 
la Sra. Jazm&#237;n (Pablo Rafael Zepeda), tambi&#233;n trabajadora sexual transg&#233;nero.  
</p>
<p> Sin que de alguna manera constituya prejuzgamiento sobre los hechos o el fondo del 
asunto, expresamos una grave preocupaci&#243;n por el asesinato de las Sras. Cynthia Nicole, 
Nohelia, Bibi y Jazm&#237;n, y por la seguridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de los miembros de la comunidad

de la Declaraci&#243;n afirma la responsabilidad de los Estados de proceder con la debida diligencia a 
fin de prevenir, investigar y, conforme a la legislaci&#243;n nacional, castigar todo acto de violencia 
contra la mujer, ya se trate de actos perpetrados por el Estado o por particulares. 
 Consideramos apropiado hacer referencia a la Resoluci&#243;n 2005/41 de la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos sobre la Eliminaci&#243;n de la Violencia Contra la Mujer, la cual subraya que es 
preciso dotar a las mujeres de los medios para protegerse contra la violencia y, al respecto, 
recalca que la mujer tiene derecho a ejercer el control y decidir libre y responsablemente sobre 
los asuntos relacionados con su sexualidad, incluida la salud sexual y reproductiva, libre de toda 
coacci&#243;n, discriminaci&#243;n y violencia. 
</p>
<p> En relaci&#243;n con el asesinato de la Sra. Cynthia Nicole, nos permitimos hacer un 
llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de su Excelencia para que tome las medidas necesarias para 
asegurar que el derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de acuerdo con los 
principios enunciados en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y 
reiterados en el art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Esas normas 
establecen que &#8220;Nadie podr&#225; ser molestado a causa de sus opiniones. Toda persona tiene derecho 
a la libertad de expresi&#243;n; este derecho comprende la libertad de buscar, recibir y difundir 
informaciones e ideas de toda &#237;ndole, sin consideraci&#243;n de fronteras, ya sea oralmente, por 
escrito o en forma impresa o art&#237;stica, o por cualquier otro procedimiento de su elecci&#243;n&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, en relaci&#243;n con el asesinato de la defensora de derechos humanos, Sra Cynthia 
Nicole, quisi&#233;ramos hacer referencia a las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n 
de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones 
de promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales universalmente 
reconocidos. El art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por 
las autoridades competentes, de toda persona frente a toda violencia, amenaza, represalia, 
discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria 
resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los derechos mencionados en la Declaraci&#243;n. Toda persona 
tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al 
reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las 
omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y las 
libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o particulares 
que afecten el disfrute de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales.

<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 2 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
information I have received regarding the <b>killing of several civilians by the Border Security 
Force (BSF)</b> in West Bengal. 
 According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Members of the BSF in West Bengal have on several occasions used excessive force on 
civilians, in some cases resulting in the death of the persons concerned. The violence has 
taken place in and around different districts and police stations in West Bengal. The BSF 
claims to have acted in self-defence, however several reports contradict this.  
</p>
<p>In particular, I would like to refer to the following cases which have been brought to my 
attention: 
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Basudeb Mondal</b> was shot dead by BSF personnel of F Company, Batallion 
Number 90, Rajanagar Border Out Post Number 1 and 2, on 26 June 2007 in the 
Murshidabad district. He was reportedly trying to smuggle cows together with 
Mr. Satyen Mondal, a 17 year-old boy who was seriously injured by a gunshot from BSF. 
According to eye-witnesses, both victims were unarmed. 
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Kalidas Ghosh</b>, 17 years old, was shot dead by a BSF constable in Battalion 
Number 126 of &#8216;E&#8217; Company, Border Out Post Number 6, on 28 December 2007 in the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 141 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>North 24 Parganas district. Kalidas Ghosh was reportedly playing at the playground of his 
school with a ball when the ball flew into the outpost of the BSF. A BSF constable chased 
the boy and ultimately shot him.  
</p>
<p>The same day the victim&#8217;s uncle filed a complaint with Gaighata Police Station and a case 
under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for murder was initiated. Following the filing 
of the complaint by the victim&#8217;s uncle the BSF lodged a complaint for attempted murder 
and assault of a public servant. On 30 December 2007 four identified persons affiliated 
with or known to the BSF visited the house of the victim&#8217;s family and offered them money 
as a way to settle the complaint.  
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Basudeb Sarkar</b> was arrested on 31 December 2007 by BSF personnel in the 
North 24 Parganas district, presumably for his smuggling activities. He was shot and 
seriously wounded while trying to escape. He was sent to J.R Dhar hospital, Bangaon 
(instead of the nearby Sharapool hospital or Basirhat hospital), and declared dead the same 
day, however a post-mortem was only conducted two days later. The BSF stated that 
Basudeb Sarkar attacked a constable, who shot the former in self defence.  
</p>
<p>The BSF lodged a complaint against the deceased for attempted murder, theft and 
obstructing a public servant in discharging his duties. Basudeb Sarkar&#8217;s wife lodged a 
complaint for murder. The responsible BSF constable was arrested but later released on 
bail. The charge sheet against him is still to be completed and the case has not been 
brought before a court. 
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Bishnu Pada Roy</b> was killed on 10 December 2007 by a member of the BSF of 
Gaighata, on Ramnagar Road in the North 24 Parganas district. Bishnu Prada Roy left his 
house around 9 pm. Shortly after his wife heard a gun shot. He did not return home that 
night and the following morning his wife and brother in law were told that he had been 
killed by the BSF. An unnatural death case (No. 83) dated 11 December 2008 was initiated 
at Gaighata Police Station and a post-mortem was conducted by a surgeon from 
S. D. Hospital in Bongaon. The BSF lodged a counter complaint against the deceased for 
attempted murder of a member of the BSF. The brother of the deceased was threatened by 
the BSF not to lodge any complaint against them. The family received money from the 
BSF as compensation for the killing: Rs 50,000 for the victim&#8217;s daughters and 60,000 for 
his wife. 
</p>
<p> Concern is expressed that the authorities have failed to carry out satisfactory investigations 
into the killings, bring those responsible to justice and provide remedies to the families of the 
victims. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to refer 
Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR) to which India is a party and which provides that every individual has the right 
to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law and that no one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his or her life.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 142 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In its General Comment on Article 6, the Human Rights Committee has observed &#8220;that 
States parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life by criminal 
acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The deprivation of life by 
the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. Therefore, the law must strictly 
control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by such 
authorities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> I would also note the relevance in these cases of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Officials. Principle 4 provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement officials, in 
carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the 
use of force and firearms.&#8221; Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever the use of force 
and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint in such use and 
act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate object to be achieved; 
(b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance 
and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment 
and (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the 
earliest possible moment.&#8221; Besides, Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement 
Officials provides that law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and 
to the extent required for the performance of their duty. 
</p>
<p> Finally, I would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of the principle whereby all 
States have &#8220;the obligation (&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, as recently reiterated by the 
61st Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4). The Commission added that this obligation includes the obligation 
&#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, (&#8230;) to grant adequate compensation within a 
reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including 
legal and judicial measures, in order to (&#8230;) prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. Also 
relevant for these cases is Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, according to which 
&#8220;Complainants, witnesses, those conducting the investigation and their families shall be 
protected from violence, threats of violence or any other form of intimidation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human 
Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all such cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council I would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries of the cases accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged in the case of Basudeb Mondal and what action has 
been taken in response? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, or 
judicial or other form of inquiry carried out in relation to these cases. 
</p><p> 4. Please provide the full details of the prosecutions undertaken. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide information on the measures taken to prevent any form of 
intimidation of victims or their families that would discourage them from filing a complaint with 
the competent authorities. 
</p>
<p> 6. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the families of the

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 29 July 2008</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received in relation to <b>Serajul Mondol</b>, aged about-14 years, resident in Delhi, Muslim, 
son of Rezaul Mondol of Hariharpur, Bagdah, Police Station-Bagdah, District-North 
24 Parganas, West Bengal. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 24 December 2007 Serajul Mondol had come from Delhi, where he lived, to Harharpur 
to celebrate Eid Festival with his family. When he returned from a meeting with his mother 
across the border at around 11.45 pm, he was killed by Border Security Force officers near 
Madhupur Bridge, Police Station-Bagdah, District-North 24 Parganas. 
</p>
<p>Assistant Commandant of Border Security Force (BSF) of 37 BD, B.S.F., Sunil Yadav, 
explained the death of Serajul Mondol indicating that B.S.F jawans fired on a group of 
about five or six persons who crossed the border and did not obey their order to stop. 
However, while three deep penetrating injuries were noticed on Serajul Mondol&#8217;s chest, no 
bullet injury was detected on the dead body.  
The police of Bagdah Police Station launched an investigation into the unnatural death 
(case no 86/2007). However, according to Sub-Inspector Sadhan Kumar Ghosh of 
Bagdah Police Station, a criminal case was also initiated against the deceased victim, 
Serajul Mondal (Bagdah Police Station case no 303; General Diary Entry No. 1661/07 
dated 25 December 2007 under sections 143/186/353/447/506/427 of the Indian Penal 
Code on the basis of the complaint lodged by the Assistant Commandant 
Mr. Sunil Yadav).  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 144 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The case against Serajul Mondol is based on a complaint lodged by BSF and indicates 
that the body of the victim was recovered by the BSF on 24 December 2007 at about 
11.45 p.m. and handed over to the police on 25 December 2007 at about 8.45 a.m., which 
clearly indicates that the body of the victim remained with the BSF for several hours. The 
complaint alleges that B.S.F. Jawan of 37 Battalion of C-Company constable, N.H. Boro 
(Constable no 05128115), when being attacked by four or five persons on the night of 
24 December 2007, opened fire on them and later recovered a dead body from the place of 
the incident which was situated about 250 meters from the international border near Border 
Point No. 49/2/s. Later the unknown body was identified as the body of Serajul Mondol by 
local people. The complaint lodged by the BSF also alleges that on the night of the incident 
a wire cutter, 100 Bangladesh taka and a Daw (Sharp cutting weapon) were recovered from 
the place of incident. Serajul Mondol was described as aged 20 in the complaint whereas 
the father of the deceased victim disclosed his age as 14. The charges relating to offences 
like criminal trespass, preventing public officers from doing their duty and assaulting 
public officers, participating in an unlawful assembly, criminal intimidation etc.  
</p>
<p> The relatives of the deceased have not received a post-mortem report yet. Given that the 
body was with the BSF from about midnight until almost 9 a.m. and the type of injuries on the 
dead body, it is feared that Serajul Mondoal died following ill-treatment in custody.  
 While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we wish to appeal to 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances regarding the case of 
Serajul Mondol. We would like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the 
right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
</p>
<p> We would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Resolution 8/8 adopted on 
18 June 2008 which urges States &#8220;to take persistent, determined and effective measures to have 
all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly 
and impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold persons, who encourage, 
order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and 
severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited 
act is found to have been committed&#8221; and &#8220;to ensure that victims of torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment obtain redress and are awarded fair and adequate 
compensation and receive appropriate socio-medical rehabilitation [&#8230;]&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that accountability 
of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Government 
adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your

<p><b>India:  Death of Langpoklakpam Bimolchandra

</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:<b> </b>1 male

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 6 August 2008  
</b></p>
<p> I would like to draw the attention of your Government to reports I have received regarding 
the death of Mr. <b>Langpoklakpam Bimolchandra</b>, who was allegedly killed by a Manipur Police 
Commando on 4 July 2008.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>In the early morning hours of 4 July 2008, Mr. Bimolchandra, owner of a private rice mill 
and a resident of Haobam Marak Ngangom Leikai, Imphal West District, Manipur, was 
riding his scooter near his home. He was stopped at Haobam Marak Irom Leikai, near 
Mangi Dukan, by a team of Manipur Police Commando traveling in a vehicle bearing 
registration number 9150. Mr. Bimolchandra was asked to get inside the vehicle, while one 
of the officers drove away with the scooter. This incident was witnessed by several 
persons. 
</p>
<p>At 9.30 a.m. of the same day, Mr. Bimolchandra&#8217;s family was informed that he had been 
killed by Police Commando members at Changangei, near Imphal Airport. His wife, 
Ms. Langpoklakpam Ongbi Rani Devi, tried to lodge a written report to the 
Officer-in-Charge at Singjamei Police Station, but the police officer refused to put his 
signature on the report, which is needed as his proof of acceptance. She then submitted a 
written report to the Superintendent of Police, Imphal West District, seeking to take up </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 146 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>legal action against the Manipur Police Commandos she accused of being responsible for 
killing her husband. On the following day, 5 July 2008, Ms. Devi also submitted a written 
application to the Director General of Police of Manipur. 
</p>
<p>Also on 4 July 2008, the Manipur Police issued a statement to the media. They reported 
that, having received information regarding the movement of armed underground anti-state 
activists operating in the Changangei area, a combined force of Imphal West District 
Police Commandos and personnel of the Maratha Light Infantry rushed to the area. There 
the security forces encountered three armed underground activists and a shoot-out ensued. 
According to the police statement, Mr. Bimolchandra and another suspect were killed on 
the spot. The police also stated that a hand grenade was recovered from the deceased. 
</p>
<p>On 6 July 2008, Mr. Bimolchandra&#8217;s family received his mortal remains after an autopsy 
had been carried out. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer your 
Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the right to life and security of 
the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life (Article 6). Should Mr. Bimolchandra have been taken into custody by 
Manipur Police Commando at Haobam Marak Irom Leikai, near Mangi Dukan, as the reports I 
have received allege, there would be a rebuttable presumption of State responsibility for his 
death. 
</p>
<p> In any event, Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement 
officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate 
objective to be achieved. As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement officials 
shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force (Basic 
Principles, Principle 4). Further, whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law 
enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic Principles, Principle 5). Intentional 
lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life (Basic 
Principles, Principle 9).  
</p>
<p> I would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that your Government has a duty 
to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. To fulfill this legal 
obligation, governments must ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force by law enforcement 
officials is punished as a criminal offence (Basic Principles, Principle 7). There must be 
thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions. Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation 
of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;) 
provides guidelines for investigations, which includes conducting an adequate autopsy, and the 
collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence. Families of the deceased 
should be informed of information relevant to the investigation, and the findings of the 
investigation should be made public (Prevention and Investigation Principles, Principles 16 
and 17). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 147 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In this respect, concern has been expressed that section 8 of the Armed Forces (Special 
Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA), which is applicable in Manipur, facilitates impunity by preventing 
any person from starting legal action against any members of the armed forces for anything done 
under the Act, or purported to be done under the Act, without permission of the Central 
Government. This would appear to be incompatible with the obligations of the Government 
under Article 2 (3) of the ICCPR to ensure the provision of an effective remedy in cases 
involving violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandates provided to me by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to 
the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please refer to the status or 
results of any police, medical, or military investigation, or judicial or other inquiries carried out 
in relation to the alleged incident.  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, or criminal 
prosecutions against, members of the forces involved in the death of Mr. Bimolchandra.  
</p>
<p> 3. Please explain whether, in this specific case, section 8 of the Armed Forces (Special 
Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA), has any impact on the ability of the victim&#8217;s family or the public 
prosecution to take legal action against members of the forces involved in the death of 
Mr. Bimolchandra. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please state whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to 
Mr. Bimolchandra&#8217;s family.

the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 29 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding <b>attacks on the Christian community in the Kandhamal district </b>of 
the state of Orissa since 24 August 2008.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 148 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the allegations: 
</p>
<p>The context of violence has been triggered by the murder of Swami Lakhmananda 
Saraswati, a local leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), as well as four other VHP 
members, who were shot dead on the night of the 23 August 2008. Before his death, 
Swami Lakhmananda Saraswati was reportedly active in opposing conversions away from 
Hinduism and negatively portraying the Christian minority. On 24 August 2008, the State 
VHP General Secretary Gouri Prasad Radh told the Hindustan Times that &#8220;this attack is the 
handiwork of Christians. There were four home guards at the ashram. Had the attackers 
been Maoists, they would have first attacked these cops. Swami was fighting the 
missionaries for four decades. We see a clear Christian conspiracy behind this attack&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>Although the Christian leadership condemned the killing of the VHP leader and his four 
associates, attacks on Christians and their places of worship, as well as Christian-ran 
orphanages and businesses, began on 24 August 2008. The incidents have been focused on 
Kandhamal district, but other districts reported to have been affected include Angul, 
Bargarh, Baudh, Debagarh, Gajapati, Jajapur, Koraput, Rayagada, Sambalpur and 
Sundargarh. Many mobs reportedly carried out their attacks while chanting slogans in the 
Oriya language, translating as &#8220;Kill the Christians&#8221;. At least 10 people have been killed so 
far, and the violence is continuing, putting many others in danger.  
</p>
<p>Among the victims, a nun was burnt to death on 25 August 2008, after a mob set fire to an 
orphanage in at Phutpali in Bargarh district. 20 children, who were at the orphanage, 
managed to escape but a priest suffered serious burn injuries in the attack. Pastors were 
also murdered on 25 August 2008. They include Nayak Samuel, a Seventh Day Adventist 
pastor from Bakingia, and Nayak Akbar, a Pentecostal pastor from Mandakia. 
</p>
<p>Allegedly, the police delayed taking action and did not enough to protect the district 
population. Further, though the State Government announced on 25 August 2008 that a 
special team had been constituted to investigate the murder of the Hindu leader and his 
associates, this appeared to have had little effect on the violence.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
appeal to Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure the right to freedom of religion or belief in 
accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and article 18 of the Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which India is a State Party. In addition, we would like to recall your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government that the Human Rights Council has, in its Resolution 6/37, urged States to &#8220;take all 
necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international standards of human rights, to 
combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by 
intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to hostility and violence, with 
particular regard to religious minorities&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> In the press statement released by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
at the end of her visit in India on 20 March 2008, she had already referred to the widespread 
violence in December 2007 targeting primarily Christian communities in the State of Orissa. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 149 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, she had expressed concern about organized groups based on religious ideologies 
which had unleashed the fear of mob violence in many parts of the country and noted that law 
enforcement was often reluctant to take any action against individuals or groups that perpetuate 
violence in the name of religion or belief. This institutionalized impunity for those who exploit 
religion and impose their religious intolerance on others has made peaceful citizens, particularly 
the minorities, vulnerable and fearful. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would like to bring to your attention that Article 6(1) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires States to provide effective 
protection to those whose lives are in danger. As expressed in Principle 4 of the UN Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, 
this requires that individuals in danger of such executions be guaranteed effective protection. We 
urge your government to immediately take all necessary steps, as required under international 
law, to protect the right to life of the Christian communities in the State of Orissa. 
</p>
<p> Regarding the killings that already have taken place, we would like to bring to your 
attention the Government&#8217;s duty to thoroughly, promptly and impartially investigate suspected 
cases of extrajudicial execution, and to prosecute and punish all violations of the right to life. As 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council in resolution 8/3 on &#8220;The Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigation into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to justice those 
responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in 
order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. We would 
submit that an exhaustive investigation into the alleged incidents described above must include 
investigation of allegations of police inaction or connivance in the face of the violence against 
the Christian communities in the State of Orissa. 
</p>
<p> In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, 
we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the Christian community in the State of Orissa are respected and accountability of 
any person guilty of the alleged violations ensured. We also request that your Government 
adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. 
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by Your Excellency&#8217;s Government in this matter, in compliance with the above 
international instruments. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the incidents accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged with regard to the incidents mentioned above?  </p>

<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the incidents mentioned above. We are 
interested in both inquiries, investigations and prosecutions regarding the perpetrators of the 
violence and in inquiries regarding allegations of police inaction or connivance in the face of the 
violence against the Christian communities in the State of Orissa. If no inquiries have taken 
place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate which measures your Government has implemented to physically 
protect members of the Christian community in the affected Orissa districts against violent acts.

<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 5 September 2008</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received in relation to <b>allegedly excessive use of force by the security forces in 
confronting the ongoing demonstrations in Jammu and Kashmir</b>. 
</p>
<p>According to information received, since June 2008, protests have increased in Jammu and 
Kashmir. The demonstrations began after a state government decision on 26 May 2008, to 
transfer 100 acres of land to a Hindu trust (the Amarnath Shrine Board) to build temporary 
shelters during an annual Hindu pilgrimage. Once the decision became public knowledge 
in June, Muslim Kashmiris started protesting against the land transfer. The decision to 
transfer the land was revoked on 1 July 2008, fuelling counter protests from Hindu 
Kashmiris calling for the reinstatement of the transfer. During these demonstrations in 
Jammu, Hindu protesters reportedly obstructed traffic on the Jammu-Panthankot National 
Highway, the main land route to the Kashmir region. The blockades allegedly led to 
shortages in essential food and medical supplies in the Kashmir valley. Protesters chanted 
anti-Indian slogans, burned Indian flags and effigies of Indian leaders, blocked highways 
and attacked the security forces with sticks and stones.

<p>On 11 August 2008, approximately 100,000 Kashmiris marched toward the Line of 
Control in protest. Police, military and paramilitary forces responded with bamboo rods, 
tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition, resulting in at least ten deaths of protestors 
(see attached Annex for details). At least another 17 protestors and one news cameraman </p>

  page 151 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>were shot by security forces the next day, on 12 August 2008 (see attached Annex). On 
13 August 2008, the Government allegedly issued an order authorising state security forces 
to &#8216;shoot on sight&#8217; in response to communal violence in the town of Kishtwar, Doda 
District. More protestors were shot by state forces in the following days (see attached 
Annex). On 24 August 2008, hundreds of protesters defied a Government imposed curfew 
and tried to march from Narbal to the Lal Chowk (Red Square) in Srinagar, where a rally 
was planned on the following day. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) opened fire 
on the protesters, killing one person (see attached Annex). At least eight protestors were 
killed the following day, on 25 August 2008, and three on 27 August 2008 (see attached 
Annex). According to the allegations we have received, each of these 43 deaths was the 
result of excessive use of force by state security forces (see attached Annex for details of 
each incident).  
</p>
<p>At least 13 journalists were also reportedly beaten by CRPF officers in Srinagar, 
on 24 August, as they tried to reach their offices despite the curfew introduced earlier in 
the day. The journalists had passes issued on 11 August but police officers reportedly said 
they were no longer valid. The curfew also prevented the publication of regional 
newspapers on 25 August, and the authorities asked local TV stations not to broadcast 
reports liable to &#8220;excite&#8221; the population until further notice. TV executives and editors 
were reportedly summoned and told it would be preferable if they suspended news 
programmes and just broadcast entertainment. The government claimed that reports 
broadcast by certain stations violated the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act 1995. 
</p>
<p> Concern is expressed that, while it appears that some of the aforementioned 
demonstrations may not have been entirely peaceful, the alleged use of excessive force by police 
personnel may seek to restrict the legitimate right to freedom of assembly. Further concern is 
expressed that the reported ban on media publications and broadcasting may represent an attempt 
to prevent independent reporting during the ongoing demonstrations in Jammu and Kashmir.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to appeal to 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which provides that &#8220;[e]veryone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right 
shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of 
his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> While we recognize that some of the demonstrations may not have been entirely peaceful, 
we would also like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all necessary steps to 
ensure the right of peaceful assembly as recognized in article 21 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;[t]he right of peaceful assembly shall be 
recognized. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed 
in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of 
national security of public safety, public order (<i>ordre</i> <i>public</i>), the protection of public health or 
morals of the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 152 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In this context, we would further like to refer your Government to the principles of 
international law governing the use of force when policing rallies and protests. The International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which India is a party, provides that every 
individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, 
and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p> The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (General Assembly resolution 34/169 
of 17 December 1979) and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials (adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 27 August to 7 September 1990), though not in 
themselves binding law, provide an authoritative and convincing interpretation of the limits the 
prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of life places on the conduct of law enforcement forces 
facing allegedly violent crowds, namely by putting forward the twin safeguards of necessity and 
proportionality in the use of force.  
</p>
<p> In particular, Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials states: &#8220;Law 
enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for 
the performance of their duty.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
provide that law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duties, shall as far as possible apply 
non-violent means and shall only use force in exceptional cases including self-defence or 
defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury. Such force must be 
proportional to these objectives, the seriousness of the crime and must minimize damage and 
injury. Force may only be used when less extreme means are insufficient (Principle 9). Of 
particular relevance in the present context are principles 12 to 14 which govern the policing of 
unlawful assemblies. In the dispersal of assemblies that are unlawful but non-violent, law 
enforcement officials shall avoid the use of force or, where that is not practicable, shall restrict 
such force to the minimum extent necessary. In the dispersal of violent assemblies, law 
enforcement officials may use firearms only when less dangerous means are not practicable and 
only to the minimum extent necessary. Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms in such 
cases, except under the conditions stipulated in Principle 9. 
</p>
<p> Principle 22 establishes that Governments and law enforcement agencies shall establish 
effective reporting and review procedures for all incidents where death or serious injury are 
caused by the use of firearms by law enforcement officials. This includes ensuring that 
independent administrative or prosecutorial authorities are in a position to exercise jurisdiction in 
such circumstances. Governments and law enforcement agencies shall promptly send a detailed 
report to the competent authorities responsible for administrative review and judicial control.  
 We should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the 
circumstances regarding the case of the persons named above. We would like to stress that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. 
This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 153 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Principle 4 of the UN Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;Law 
enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent 
means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221; Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, 
&#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, 
(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the 
legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve 
human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected 
persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the 
injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; (Adopted by the Eighth 
United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 
Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990). 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. What were the instructions given to the security forces before and during the 
demonstrations and other incidents mentioned above? How did the security forces ensure 
compliance with the requirements of necessity and proportionality? Is it accurate that, as alleged, 
on 13 August 2008, the Government issued an order authorising state security forces to &#8216;shoot on 
sight&#8217; in response to communal violence in the town of Kishtwar, Doda District? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the above incidents (including those listed in 
the attached Annex). Please explain the steps taken to ensure that these investigations comply 
with the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the alleged killings listed in the attached Annex. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please state whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to the 
families of persons killed by the security forces in the course of the incidents alleged here. 
</p>
<p> 6. Please provide the details on how the actions undertaken by public officials 
regarding the aforementioned events are compatible with the international norms and standards 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the related right to peaceful assembly and 
association as contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p>

<p><b>India:  Six cases of arbitrary killings and insufficient medical care in West Bengal

due to neglect or life-threatening conditions of detention 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 6 males (1 minor) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 16 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to draw the attention of your Government to reports we have received 
regarding several cases of alleged arbitrary killings by members of the Border Security Forces 
(BSF) in West Bengal in the course of the past five months. The names of the alleged victims are 
<b>Mr. Neel Kumar Mondal</b>, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dwijen Mondal</b>, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mofijul Seikh</b>, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sentu Mondal</b>, and 
<b>Mr.</b> <b>Shilajit Mondal</b>. We would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to the 
allegations we have received regarding the insufficient medical care another victim of BSF 
shooting, <b>Mr. Aptarul Hossain</b>, is receiving in custody. Summaries of the allegations received 
regarding these six cases are contained in the Annex to this communication. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports summarized in the Annex, 
we would like to refer your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which India is a party, 
provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall 
be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 157 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> When the State detains an individual, as was the case with Neel Kumar Mondal, 
Dwijen Mondal and Sentu Mondal, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries 
sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In order to 
overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries sustained in 
custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions) into the causes and circumstances of death. This principle was reiterated by the 
Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all 
States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
 Article 6 of the ICCPR also requires that force be used by law enforcement officials only 
when strictly necessary, and that the use of force must be in proportion to the legitimate 
objective to be achieved. As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement officials 
shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force (Basic 
Principles, Principle 4). Further, whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law 
enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic Principles, Principle 5). Intentional 
lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life (Basic 
Principles, Principle 9).  
</p>
<p> Both in cases of death in custody and in cases of possibly excessive use of force by 
members of the police, armed forces, or other security forces, your Government has a duty to 
investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. The reports received allege 
that in some cases of killing by the BSF, the police refused to receive complaints by family 
members or neglected to carry out any significant investigative activity (we refer to the cases of 
Neel Kumar Mondal, Mojiful Seikh, and Sentu Mondal). Complaints filed by the BSF against 
their dead victims, on the contrary, are registered and possibly even investigated (see the cases of 
Neel Kumar Mondal and Mofijul Seikh). In the case of Dwijen Mondal, the police appeared to 
be willing to investigate the killing, but reportedly met with a refusal of the BSF to cooperate. 
</p>
<p> We would finally like to stress that families of the deceased should be informed about the 
investigation, and the findings of the investigation should be made public (Prevention and 
Investigation Principles, Principles 16 and 17). Moreover, the families and dependents of victims 
of extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be entitled to fair and adequate 
compensation within a reasonable period of time (Prevention and Investigation Principles, 
Principle 20). As extrajudicial executions are a most serious violation of criminal law and human 
rights law, such compensation must not be conditioned upon the family withdrawing its criminal 
complaint against the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on the cases 
summarized in the Annex to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: </p>

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>Neel Kumar Mondal, 15 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p> On 15 April 2008 at about 4 a.m., Neel Kumar Mondal of Char Durgapur Village in 
Murshidabad District, West Bengal, a fisherman and laborer, was returning home after fishing 
from Ilsemarir damoud near the border between India and Bangladesh. Troops of BSF Battalion 
No.105, Company A patrolling in the area arrested him on the suspicion of smuggling. They then 
beat him with iron rods and boots. One of the BSF soldiers fired at Neel Kumar Mondal and hit 
him in the back. Neel Kumar Mondal died on the spot. The BSF soldiers tied his legs with a rope 
and dragged the body to their out-post. Neighbors and family members of Neel Kumar Mondal 
who had heard about the incident were not allowed by the BSF to see his body at the out-post. 
</p>
<p> At around 2 p.m. on the same day, the BSF delivered the corpse to Ranitala Police Station. 
On the basis of complaints filed by the BSF, the police registered case no.45/08 against 
Neel Kumar Mondal, charging him under Penal Code sections 186 (obstructing a public servant 
in the discharge of public functions), 188 (disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public 
servant), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty) 
and 307 (attempted murder). The police at Ranitala Police Station refused to take any complaint 
against the BSF from Neel Kumar Mondal&#8217;s family. 
</p>
<p> On 16 April 2008, Ranitala Police Station delivered the body of Neel Kumar Mondal to 
Lalbagh Sub-Divisional Hospital in Murshidabad. The corpse was labeled as belonging to an 
&#8220;unidentified&#8221; man, although Neel Kumar Mondal&#8217;s wife and family had identified the body at 
the Ranitala Police Station. The post mortem report of the Hospital referred to the case as an 
&#8220;unnatural death&#8221; case and recorded the deceased as an unidentified man. The family later on 
received the mortal remains of Neel Kumar Mondal from Ranitala Police Station.  </p>

<p><b>Dwijen Mondal, 3 and 4 May 2008 
</b> On 3 May 2008, Mr. Dwijen Mondal, son of Mr. Hridoy Mondal, and another man went to 
the river Padma in Murshidabad district. Members of the BSF from Bamnabad Camp, Battalion 
No.90, E Company, who were patrolling the river, apprehended Dwijen Mondal and took him to 
BSF Out-Post No.3, Point D.  
</p>
<p> The following morning, on 4 May 2008, Dwijen Mondal&#8217;s family was informed of his 
detention. His eldest son and two other men went to the BSF Camp. Dwijen Mondal was badly 
injured and could not sit properly as his legs were tied with chains. As to the causes of his 
injuries, Dwijen Mondal told his eldest son and the two men that he had been hung from a tree. 
A witness to Dwijen Mondal&#8217;s apprehension by the BSF the previous day alleges that he heard 
someone shouting orders in Hindi: &#8220;Shir me mar, shir me mar&#8221;, which means &#8220;strike on the 
head&#8221;. At the inquest (see below), it was noticed that there were black, swollen spots on the 
victim&#8217;s body, particularly the throat and neck. There were some bruise marks on the legs and 
some prominent dark spots on the back of the victim. A police officer present at the inquest was 
of the opinion that these were boot marks, while further broader black marks on the chest of the 
victim were attributed to the handle of a rifle. On that same morning, in the presence of his son, 
Dwijen Mondal fell to the ground and died after drinking some water. 
 Around noon of 4 May 2008, police officers from Raninagar Police Station reached BSF 
Border Out-Post No.3. Their request to see the Entry Book of the Border Out-Post but was 
refused, and they did not receive answers to their questions from the BSF. Raninagar Police 
Station registered a case of unnatural death (Unnatural Death Case No.05/08). In the afternoon, 
inquest proceedings took place at Lalbagh Sub-Divisional Hospital. A relative of Dwijen Mondal 
was present. At 9.30 p.m. in the evening, a magistrate took the statements of family members. 
The family were not given copies of the First Information Report (FIR). The post-mortem was 
carried out on the 5 May 2008. The Disposal Order of Lalbagh Sub-Divisional Hospital does not 
mention the cause of death. 
</p>
<p> Also on the evening of 4 May all the BSF men stationed at Bamnabad BSF Camp were 
transferred and new BSF stationed at the camp. Senior BSF and police officers have been 
sending Dwijen Mondal&#8217;s family 3,000 Indian Rupees (corresponding to 70 USD) and one sack 
of rice every month, and have pledged to give a job in the BSF to a son of the deceased. The 
victim's family have withdrawn their case against the BSF, allegedly under the influence of some 
local political leaders. 
</p>
<p><b>Mofijul Seikh, 1 June 2008  
</b> Mofijul Seikh, son of Mr. Mojer Seikh, aged about 25 years, was a share-cropper of 
Mohangunj village in Murshidabad district. Mofijul Seikh died in the night from 1 to 
2 June 2008 in the vicinity of Border Out-Post No. 2 and 3 of the Mohangunj BSF Camp. 
A bullet fired by a BSF soldier (whose name is on record with the Special Rapporteur) entered 
his body from the back and exited from the chest. He died on the spot. As to the circumstances 
in which Mofijul Seikh was lethally shot by the BSF, two differing reports were received. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>According to one version, he was smuggling cattle from India into Pakistan and failed to stop 
when BSF soldiers appeared. The other version states that he was trying to prevent cattle 
smugglers from crossing his fields (to prevent damage to the crop) and was shot by BSF soldiers 
complicit with the cattle smugglers.  
</p>
<p> The BSF informed the police and on 2 June 2008 the body of the deceased was taken to 
Raninagar Police Station. During that morning the widow of Mofijul Seikh, Ms. Nargis Bewa, 
went to Raninagar Police Station to lodge a written complaint against the BSF for killing her 
husband. The officer in charge of the police station refused to accept the complaint. A few hours 
later, the BSF filed a case against the deceased with Raninagar Police Station (Case No. 118/08). 
A post mortem examination was carried out at Lalbagh Morgue. 
</p>
<p><b>Sentu Mondal, 17 June 2008  
</b></p>
<p> Sentu Mondal, aged 19, son of Ershad Mondal, a resident of Chakmathura village 
in Murshidabad district, was apprehended by BSF soldiers on 17 June 2008 around 11 p.m.  
as he was trying to smuggle cattle across the Indian-Bangladeshi border. The BSF soldiers  
took Sentu Mondal to Out-Post No.1 of Udaynagar under Singhpara BSF Camp (BSF 
Battalion 90). There they beat him to death with their fists and rifle buts. Thereafter, 
BSF soldiers threw his body into the river Padma near Out-Post No.1. On 19 June 2008, at 
about 4 p.m. in the evening, the lifeless body of Sentu Mondal surfaced in the river Padma near 
Out-Post No. 1. Police from Jalangi Police Station came to the spot and sent the body of the 
victim for autopsy to Berhampore General Hospital (post mortem report no.562 dated 
20 June 2008).  
</p>
<p> Jalangi Police Station registered the death of Sentu Mondal as an unnatural death case 
(Case no. 15/2008). Sentu Mondal&#8217;s father alleges that the police have failed to take any action 
against the perpetrators.  
</p>
<p><b>Shilajit Mondal, 23 July 2008 
</b> On 23 July 2008 around noon, Shilajit Mondal, the 15-year-old son of Mr. Golok Mondal 
from Rajanagar village, Mushidabad district was sitting in front of his family&#8217;s mud hut by the 
road side. A constable of BSF Battalion no. 90 (whose name is on record with the Special 
Rapporteur) approached Shilajit Mondal and asked him in Hindi about the whereabouts of 
certain fertilizer smugglers operating in the area. Shilajit Mondal was unable to reply as he did 
not speak Hindi. The BSF constable grabbed him and began to beat him. Neighbors heard the 
cries and tried to intervene to protect Shilajit Mondal, but - in front of numerous eye witnesses - 
the BSF constable fired his gun at him. The bullet entered the victim through the left side of the 
chest and exited through his back. Shilajit Mondal was rushed to the district hospital, 
Berhampore New General Hospital, but died there at 3 p.m. before reaching the operating 
theatre. 
</p>
<p> The police at Raningar police station registered both a case against the BSF filed by 
Shilajit Mondal&#8217;s mother (Case No. 151/08) and a case against Shilajit filed by the Company </p>

<p>Commander of G-Company, BSF Battalion 90. On the following day, 24 July 2008, the 
post mortem was conducted in the morgue in Berhampore New General Hospital. The 
post mortem report recorded unnatural death (case no. 521/08).  
</p>
<p> The BSF constable who shot Shilajit Mondal continues to serve and has not been 
reprimanded for his actions. 
</p>
<p><b>Mr. Md. Aptarul Hossain alias Aktarul Jamal, 15 February 2008  
</b></p>
<p> Md. Aptarul Hossain alias Aktarul Jamal, son of Khalil Mondal, aged about 21, is a 
resident of Baronoberia Biswas Para village, North 24 Parganas district. He was shot in his leg 
by a BSF constable on 15 February 2008. According to the case filed by the BSF against him 
(Gaighata Police Station Case no. 54/08), Md. Aptarul Hossain was caught by the BSF as he and 
two other men were smuggling across the Indian-Bangladeshi border and was shot in the leg as 
he and his accomplices tried to attack the BSF constable.  
</p>
<p> According to two eye-witnesses (names on record with the Special Rapporteur), however, 
Md. Aptarul Hossain was approached by a BSF soldier as he was cleaning rice crops in the 
paddy fields near Out Post no.2. The BSF soldier asked Md. Aptarul Hossain whether his name 
was &#8220;Akbar&#8221;. Md. Aptarul Hossain denied and gave his name. The BSF soldier did not believe 
him and suddenly fired a round from his rifle at the victim&#8217;s left leg below the knee. It is also 
alleged that the documents filed by the BSF in connection with their complaint against 
Md. Aptarul Hossain (such as the reports concerning his arrest) contain such inconsistencies as 
to undermine the BSF version of the incident. 
</p>
<p> Md. Aptarul Hossain is currently detained on remand at Dum Dum Central Correctional 
Home. When he was produced before the Bongaon Court on 24 June 2008, his left leg had lost 
flexibility due to the insufficient medical treatment given to his wound, which was swelling and 
releasing fluid. On 8 July 2008, Md. Aptarul Hossain was again produced before the Bongaon 
Magistrate&#8217;s Court. The wound was not covered by bandage but tied with an unhygienic piece of 
cloth. Md. Aptarul Hossain informed the court that the treatment of his injury was not going 
well, but was cut short by the Public Prosecutor. Also counsel acting for Md. Aptarul Hossain 
has repeatedly drawn the court&#8217;s attention to the insufficiency of the medical treatment.

<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  </p>

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 29 October 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief, the Independent Expert on minority issues and the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning the <b>eruption of violence between the Bodo tribal and the Muslim 
communities in the Indian state of Assam</b>.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>The violence between members of the Muslim community and members of Bodo tribal 
groups in the Indian state of Assam started on Friday 3 October 2008. The incidents that 
sparked this wave of violence remain unclear, yet there have been long running tensions 
between the two communities.  
</p>
<p>Despite the large number of paramilitary officers deployed by the Government and the 
imposition of a curfew, mobs from both communities armed with machetes and knives 
fuelled violence between the two communities in the districts of Udalguri, Darrang and 
Baksa.  
</p>
<p>As a result of the communal violence, reportedly more than 50 people were killed, more 
than 500 houses were burnt and more than 80&#8217;000 people, both from the Bodo and the 
Muslim communities, have been forced to flee from their village and to seek shelter in 
camps set up by the Government.  
</p>
<p>To counteract the communal violence, the government of the Indian state of Assam has 
allegedly issued shoot on sight orders to the security forces in response to the clashes. 
Indeed, 25 of the more than 50 victims mentioned above were reportedly killed by police 
fire in Darrang and Udalguri districts. 
</p>
<p>In addition to the above, coordinated bombings killed 77 people and wounded more than 
320 took place in the State of Assam on 30 October 2008. Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan 
Singh strongly condemned the blasts and said that the Government would take all possible 
steps to bring the perpetrators of terror attacks to justice. While responsibility still needs to 
be determined by the authorities, the Islamic Security Force-Indian Mujahideen reportedly 
claimed to have committed the bombings. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to bring 
to your Government&#8217;s attention Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which provides that &#8220;In compliance with the fundamental 
obligations laid down in article 2 of this Convention, States Parties undertake to prohibit and to 
eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without 
distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in 
the enjoyment of the following rights: [&#8230;] (b) The right to security of person and protection by 
the State against violence or bodily harm, whether inflicted by government officials or by any 
individual group or institution&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 163 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We acknowledge that in the present case, security forces appear to have taken forceful 
action to protect themselves and civilians from the violence. With regard to the shoot on sight 
orders allegedly issued by the state government, however, we would like to refer your 
Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which India is a party, provides that every individual has the 
right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no 
person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p> The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (General Assembly resolution 34/169 
of 17 December 1979) and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials provide an authoritative and convincing interpretation of the limits the 
prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of life places on the conduct of law enforcement forces 
facing allegedly violent crowds, namely by putting forward the twin safeguards of necessity and 
proportionality in the use of force.  
</p>
<p> In particular, Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials states: &#8220;Law 
enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for 
the performance of their duty.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
provide that law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duties, shall as far as possible apply 
non-violent means and shall only use force in exceptional cases including self-defence or 
defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury. Such force must be 
proportional to these objectives, the seriousness of the crime and must minimize damage and 
injury. Force may only be used when less extreme means are insufficient (Principle 9). Of 
particular relevance in the present context are principles 12 to 14 which govern the policing of 
unlawful assemblies. In the dispersal of violent assemblies, law enforcement officials may use 
firearms only when less dangerous means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent 
necessary. Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms in such cases, except under the 
conditions stipulated in Principle 9. 
</p>
<p> Principle 22 establishes that Governments and law enforcement agencies shall establish 
effective reporting and review procedures for all incidents where death or serious injury are 
caused by the use of firearms by law enforcement officials. This includes ensuring that 
independent administrative or prosecutorial authorities are in a position to exercise jurisdiction in 
such circumstances. Governments and law enforcement agencies shall promptly send a detailed 
report to the competent authorities responsible for administrative review and judicial control.  
 We would also like to recall your Excellency&#8217;s Government that Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/37 urges States &#8220;to take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with 
international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, 
intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as 
incitement to hostility and violence, with particular regard to religious minorities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> As far as the inter-communal violence and the attacks of 30 October 2008 are concerned, 
in the event that your investigations support the above allegations, we urge your Government to 
take all necessary measures to ensure the accountability of persons responsible for the violence. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 164 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to prevent the aggravation of 
inter-communal tensions and to effectively protect individuals against further violence. In view 
of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government in this matter, in compliance with international human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. What orders were issued to the security forces engaged in stopping the violence? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information on any inquiries carried out into the use of lethal force by 
the police in accordance with Principle 22 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details and where available, the results, of any judicial 
investigation, or any criminal charges and other inquiries carried out in relation to the violence 
between members of the Muslim community and members of Bodo tribal groups in Darrang, 
Udalguri and Baksa districts of the Indian state of Assam. 
</p>
<p> 5. What measures are being taken to provide humanitarian aid to the people affected by 
the inter-communal riots? What steps are being taken for the safe return to their homes of the 
people victimized by violence?

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed and thoughtful response of the 
Government. He notes the explanation that, under domestic law, retroactive legislation of the 
type called into question may be adopted in the event of a compelling emergency. But the 
question here is whether this also comports with the applicable international law. The 
Government suggests that the exception provided for in Article 15(2) permits retroactive laws 
&#8220;in cases of extraordinary or heinous crimes such as, but not excluding, terrorism&#8221;. Given the 
non-derogable status of the principle of non-retroactivity enunciated in Article 15 of the ICCPR 
it is difficult to conclude that this explanation would satisfy the requirements of international </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>law, unless it can be shown that a clearly defined crime of terrorism is part of &#8220;the general 
principles of law recognized by the community of nations&#8221;. The response of the Government 
does not seek to make this case, beyond emphasizing the heinous nature of the crime. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 3 May 2006</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw your attention to information we have received 
regarding three men who are reportedly at imminent risk of execution: Mr. <b>Amrozi bin H. 
Nurhasyim</b>, Mr. <b>Ali Ghufron</b> alias <b>Mukhlas</b>, and Mr. <b>Imam Samudera</b>.  
</p>
<p> Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera have been 
found guilty of involvement in the 12 October 2002 bombings on the island of Bali, which killed 
202 people and injured a further 209. They were sentenced to death by the Denpasar District 
Court between August and October 2003. The men and their families have declined to seek a 
pardon from the President. On 14 April 2006, the Attorney General&#8217;s office stated that the 
refusal to seek clemency would mean that they have exhausted all the legal remedies available to 
them and that, as a result, they would be executed immediately. On 25 April 2006, the Bali 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office announced that it has &#8220;completed preparations&#8221; for the execution and stated 
that it was waiting for the Attorney General&#8217;s order to proceed with the executions. 
</p>
<p> It is our understanding that on 18 October 2002, six days after the Bali bombing, President 
Megawati issued two &#8220;'Government Regulations in lieu of law&#8221; (Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti 
Undang-Undang, or &#8220;Perpus&#8221;), Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002. Perpu 1/2002 provides that an act of 
terrorism, or the planning of or assisting in an act of terrorism, is punishable by death. Section 46 
allows for its retroactive application if this is authorised by another Perpu or law. Perpu 2/2002 
authorised that retroactive application &#8220;in relation to the [Bali] bombing incident&#8221;. Perpus 1/2002 
and 2/2002 were subsequently approved by Parliament in March 2003 and converted into the 
Law on Combating Criminal Acts of Terrorism 15/2003. We have further been informed that 
on 23 July 2004, the Constitutional Court has ruled that the retroactive application of 
Perpu 1/2002 (i.e. Law 15/2003) violates Article 28I (1) of the Constitution and is therefore 
unconstitutional.  
</p>
<p> International law does not prohibit the death penalty <i>per se</i> as automatically violating the 
rights to life, but it mandates that it must be applied in the most restrictive manner. It is therefore 
crucial that all restrictions pertaining to capital punishment contained in international human 
rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital offences. One such fundamental 
guarantee is that &#8220;the death penalty may be imposed only &#8230; in accordance with the law in force 
at the time of the commission of the crime&#8221; (Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Indonesia has become a party on 23 February 2006). This 
provision reinforces with regard to capital punishment the general principle that &#8220;[n]o one shall 
be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute 
a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor 
shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time when the criminal 
offence was committed.&#8221; (Article 15 ICCPR). We note that this principle is also enshrined in the 
Constitution of Indonesia, which in Article 28I(1) provides that &#8220;the right not to be prosecuted </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 166 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>under retrospective laws [is a] basic human right that may not be diminished under any 
circumstances at all.&#8221; All of these provisions, or at least their core, represent universal standards 
and customary international law. Moreover, Article 4(2) ICCPR provides that the right to life as 
enshrined in Article 6 and the protection against retroactive criminal legislation in Article 15 are 
among those rights that cannot be derogated from even &#8220;[i]n time of public emergency which 
threatens the life of the nation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> While we fully recognize your Government&#8217;s right and duty to forcefully combat heinous 
acts of terrorism such as those the three above-named men have been found to be complicit in, 
we recall that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the framework of 
international law. In particular, we would like to recall UN GA Resolution 60/158 of 
28 February 2006, which in its paragraph 1, stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure 
to combat terrorism complies with their obligation under international law, in particular 
international human right, refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> If the information we have received is correct, it would appear that the death sentence 
against Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera is not 
compatible with Article 6(2) and Article 15 of the ICCPR. We accordingly urge your 
Government not to proceed to their execution until all doubts in this respect have been dispelled. 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolution of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this case to the 
Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts presented in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please explain the grounds on which your Excellency&#8217;s Government intends to 
proceed with the execution of Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and 
Imam Samudera notwithstanding Article 28I(1) of the Constitution, the ruling of the 
Constitutional Court and your Government&#8217;s obligations under Articles 6(2) and 15 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up urgent appeal dated 22 July 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the

<p> On 3 May 2006, we already wrote to your Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding these cases. 
In that communication, we &#8220;fully recognize[d] your Government&#8217;s right and duty to forcefully

</p>
<p>within the framework of international law and expressed the concern that &#8220;it would appear that 
the death sentence against Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and 
Imam Samudera is not compatible with Article 6(2) and Article 15 of the ICCPR.&#8221; We 
accordingly urged your Government not to proceed to their execution until all doubts in this 
respect have been dispelled. The executions, which appeared to be imminent in May 2006, were 
in fact put on hold at the time, but are reportedly imminent now. 
</p>
<p> According to information we have received, in January 2008 police and court officials 
informed Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera that their 
renewed demands for a second judicial review had been rejected. The three men appealed against 
this decision, but on 17 July 2008, the Indonesian Supreme Court reportedly rejected this appeal 
and announced that they had exhausted their right of appeal, stating only one judicial review is 
permitted.

<p> It would thus appear that the concerns we expressed in our communication of 3 May 2006, 
have not been addressed. As your Excellency will recall, our concerns were based on the 
apparently retroactive application of the law allowing the imposition of the death penalty against 
the three men. We wrote:  
</p>
<p>It is our understanding that on 18 October 2002, six days after the Bali bombing, 
President Megawati issued two &#8220;Government Regulations in lieu of law&#8221; (Peraturan 
Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang, or &#8220;Perpus&#8221;), Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002. 
Perpu 1/2002 provides that an act of terrorism, or the planning of or assisting in an act of 
terrorism, is punishable by death. Section 46 allows for its retroactive application if this is 
authorised by another Perpu or law. Perpu 2/2002 authorised that retroactive application 
&#8220;in relation to the [Bali] bombing incident&#8221;. Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002 were subsequently 
approved by Parliament in March 2003 and converted into the Law on Combating 
Criminal Acts of Terrorism 15/2003. We have further been informed that on 23 July 2004, 
the Constitutional Court has ruled that the retroactive application of Perpu 1/2002 
(i.e. Law 15/2003) violates Article 28I (1) of the Constitution and is therefore 
unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p>International law does not prohibit the death penalty per se as automatically violating the 
rights to life, but it mandates that it must be applied in the most restrictive manner. It is 
therefore crucial that all restrictions pertaining to capital punishment contained in 
international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital 
offences. One such fundamental guarantee is that &#8220;the death penalty may be imposed 
only &#8230; in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime&#8221; 
(Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which 
Indonesia has become a party on 23 February 2006). This provision reinforces with regard 
to capital punishment the general principle that &#8220;[n]o one shall be held guilty of any 
criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal 
offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a 
heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time when the criminal 
offence was committed.&#8221; (Article 15 ICCPR). We note that this principle is also enshrined 
in the Constitution of Indonesia, which in Article 28I(1) provides that &#8220;the right not to be 
prosecuted under retrospective laws [is a] basic human right that may not be diminished </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 168 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>under any circumstances at all.&#8221; All of these provisions, or at least their core, represent 
universal standards and customary international law. Moreover, Article 4(2) ICCPR 
provides that the right to life as enshrined in Article 6 and the protection against retroactive 
criminal legislation in Article 15 are among those rights that cannot be derogated from 
even &#8220;[i]n time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Unfortunately, no reply to our communication was received from your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government in the intervening two years. We therefore again urge your Government not to 
proceed to their execution until all doubts in respect of the concerns raised have been dispelled. 
In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would like to reiterate our queries raised in the 
communication of 3 May 2006 and would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts presented in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please explain the grounds on which your Excellency&#8217;s Government intends to 
proceed with the execution of Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and 
Imam Samudera notwithstanding Article 28I(1) of the Constitution, the ruling of the 
Constitutional Court and your Government&#8217;s obligations under Articles 6(2) and 15 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up urgent appeal dated 17 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I am writing to you in relation to recent information I have received regarding the 
reportedly imminent execution of three men found guilty of involvement in the 12 October 2002 
bombings on the island of Bali, which killed 202 people and injured a further 209: Mr. <b>Amrozi 
bin H. Nurhasyim</b>, Mr. <b>Ali Ghufron </b>alias <b>Mukhlas</b>, and Mr. <b>Imam Samudera</b>. Reports 
indicate that your Government announced that it would release a statement on 24 October 2008, 
regarding the execution of the three men. These reports also indicate that it is not clear whether 
your Government intends to inform on 24 October 2008 that the execution of the three men took 
place, or to announce a future date concerning their execution. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, I would like to recall the two communications regarding this matter I 
addressed to your Government on 3 May 2006 and 22 July 2008, both jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism. In both letters, we drew your Government&#8217;s attention to serious concerns 
that the death sentence imposed on Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and 
Imam Samudera was based on a law enacted after the fact and applied retro-actively, in violation 
of your Government&#8217;s obligations under Articles 6(2) and 15 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. Regrettably, your Government has so far failed to reply to our 
communications. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 169 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> I again urge your Government not to proceed with the execution of Amrozi bin H. 
Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera until all doubts in respect of the 
concerns raised have been dispelled.  
</p>
<p> On this occasion, I would also like to recall my communication of 31 July 2008, sent 
jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture. In that communication we brought 
to your Government&#8217;s attention our concerns with regard to certain aspects of the use of the 
death penalty in Indonesia. Our concerns related specifically to: (i) respect for the requirement 
that the death penalty be imposed only for &#8220;the most serious crimes&#8221;, and therefore not for 
narcotics-related offences, (ii) the disproportionate number of foreigners sentenced to death for 
narcotics-related offences, and (iii) the requirement that in capital punishment cases all fair trial 
guarantees are rigorously observed, particularly the right not to be compelled to confess guilt. As 
of today, this communication also has remained without a reply from your Government. 
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on the situation of 
Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera. I would also 
appreciate a response to the questions posed in the communications of 22 and 31 July 2008, 
respectively. I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response to each of these questions is 
accurately reflected in the report I will submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of Indonesia dated 17 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Indonesia has the honour of providing the 
following information concerning the questions relative to Mr. Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, 
Mr. Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Mr. Imam Samudera. 
</p>
<p> The three abovementioned men, Mr. Nurhasyim (a 44 year old former mechanic), 
Mr. Ghufron alias Mukhlas (aged 46, a native of Tenggulun, East Java) and Mr. Samudera 
(aged 36) were arrested, charged and convicted for their role in the bombing that took place 
on 12th of October 2002 on the island of Bali and which resulted in the death of 202 people, as 
well as injury to 209 other. Mr. Nurhasyim was found guilty of various charges which included, 
among others, the purchase of a Mitsubishi minivan and bomb-making chemicals which were 
used in the Bali bombings. 
</p>
<p> Following their much publicized trials, they were convicted as terrorists under the 
provisions of the Government Regulation on the Elimination of Terrorism and were sentenced to 
death by the Denpasar District Court in 2003. It is true that aforementioned Regulation (Perpu) 
was one of two presidential decrees passed in the aftermath of the bomb attacks. These two 
presidential decrees have since been turned into Lau No. 15/2003, also known as the Law on 
Combating Criminal Acts of Terrorism. This law imposes a death penalty in specific instances 
for convictions that have been judged as falling under the legally established definition of 
&#8220;terrorist&#8221; acts. 
</p>
<p> It also allowed for those involved in the bombings in Bali to be tried retroactively as well 
as granting powers to security authorities to deter and eradicate acts of terrorism. The exact 
explanation for this decision is explained in greater detail below. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 170 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Following the bombing, the then incumbent President, Megawati Soekarnoputri issued 
two Government Regulations in Lieu of Law (Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang), 
namely Perpu No. 112002 on the Eradication of Criminal Acts of Terrorism, and Perpu 
No. 212002 on the Eradication of Criminal Acts of Terrorism in Relation to the Bomb Explosion 
Incident in Bali, on 12 October 2002. 
</p>
<p> It was argued by some quarters that these laws, especially Perpu No.1/2002 which was the 
revised version of an anti-terrorism Bill which was previously debated by the DPR (the 
Indonesian Parliament). In fact, Article 46 of this Bill allowed for its retrospective application as 
long as it is authorised by another, Perpu or law. The Perpu No. 2/2002 authorised this 
retrospective application in relation to the Bali bombing incident. 
</p>
<p> These Regulations were subsequently approved by Parliament in March 2003 and were 
then converted, as already mentioned above, into Law on Combating Criminal Acts of 
Terrorism, ie, Law No.1512003. Subsequently, the retroactive application of the latter Law was 
challenged at the Constitutional Court level, which on 23 July 2004 had ruled that the retroactive 
application of the 2003 Law on Terrorism legislation violated Article 281(1) of the amended 
1945 Constitution, and was as a result, unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p> In actual fact, according to the provisions of Article 22 of the 1945, Constitution, the 
President can in `the event of a compelling emergency&#8221;, issue with the delayed and subsequent 
consent of the DPR, a Perpu/government regulation in lieu of law which has the power to take 
precedence over the rule of law or the opinions of the Constitutional court. 
</p>
<p> In this case, the trials of the three men took place over the course of several years and 
finally, the judgment of the court was handed dawn on separate occasions between 
7 August 2003 and 2 October 2003. The three men refused to appeal or seek clemency as is their 
legal right under Indonesian law. On 14th of April 2006, the Attorney General's office made it 
clear to them that this deliberate refusal to seek clemency meant that according to the norms of 
Indonesia law, they had exhausted all the legal remedies available to them and as a result, their 
execution-was-set-to-proceed. 
</p>
<p> It should also be clearly noted that the families of the convicted defendants can also 
request a presidential pardon or a judicial review. The Attorney General also confirmed that 
although the relatives were made aware of their legal right to seek these options on behalf of the 
accused, rather, they had chosen to respect the request of the detainees and had waived their right 
to seek a pardon. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that &#8216;the carnage and destructive loss of life caused 
by these men, who had so carefully and mercilessly plotted out and carried out this heinous act 
of terrorism led to unspeakable suffering and sorrow for the families and friends of the victims 
who today, survive them. Concurrently, innumerable are the Balinese who also lost their 
revenues, jobs and savings as a result and also almost totally destroyed what had once been a 
peaceful and beautiful tourist retreat. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 171 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> On the issue of retroactivity, since this dreadful tragedy and during the trial of those 
arrested for their involvement, there have been some questions raised on the validity of the law 
that was applied to convict these individuals. To this, it should be understood that while some of 
the laws may have had some retroactive effect, it should more importantly be recalled that in 
principle, as well as in actual application, the use of retroactive laws is often subject to 
exceptions. In certain cases, including in international law, they may be applied in cases of 
extraordinary or heinous crimes such as, but not excluding, terrorism. 
</p>
<p> Indonesia wishes to recall to attention that as a signatory to the ICCPR which it ratified, 
does not believe that it is erroneous to apply to these terrorists, the provisions of its national law 
which imposes for such heinous crimes, the death penalty. Indeed, it should be recalled that 
according to Article 15 alinea 2 of the ICCPR, there would be no prejudice for: &#8220;the trial and 
punishment of any person for any acts or omission which at the time when it was committed, 
was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by the community of 
nations&#8221;. It is clear that because of the extraneous circumstances of the crimes committed, the 
government felt justified in applying a retroactive law which its Constitution legally allows it to 
impose. 
</p>
<p> The various arguments relative to this matter have been considered in great detail and 
contrasted against potentially contradictory provisions of national legislation while at the same 
time realizing that the interests of national security were of greater importance. Furthermore, the 
government&#8217;s decision was not taken lightly given both international pressure following the 
terrorist attacks and the ensuing sensitivity it engendered for the different parties. In fact, the 
death penalty in Indonesia is not imposed arbitrarily or inevitably for crimes of a very serious 
nature. It must therefore be clear that although the law, as is the case with the provisions of 
international law relative to this matter, does not prohibit the death penalty, it is still not a 
sentence that is automatically or irrevocably imposed for similar crimes of this nature. The 
circumstances for its imposition always require a deliberate series of procedures to have been 
respected and a particular set of legal remedies to have been extinguished for its application to be 
considered definitive. 
</p>
<p> In the case of the three above mentioned men, the crimes committed were indeed heinous, 
and the proof against them conclusive enough to exclude reasonable doubt , moreover, their 
deliberate failure to seek clemency or appeal - though they were clearly advised to do so by their 
legal counsel and the office of the Attorney General - indicates their unwillingness to utilize the 
legal resources at their disposal especially when informed of the relevance and the serious 
implications their consequent decisions would produce. It is therefore amiss to imply that 
derogations of this nature are not within the sovereign policy decisions of any nation that wishes 
to impose them as is clearly stipulated in the provisions of Article 6 (2) of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p> The Government of Indonesia takes this opportunity to renew its commitment to the 
promotion and protection of human rights, while at the same time, believes it is no less 
significant to ensure the respect of the norms that govern exceptional situations that threaten 
national security. </p>

<p><b>Indonesia:  End of the informal moratorium on executions:  six persons executed 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 5 males; 1 female 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Cooperative but incomplete response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of 
Indonesia with respect to the executions of Iwuchukwu Okoye, Hansen Anthoni Nwolisa, 
Achmad Suradji, Tubagus Maulana Yusuf, and Nyonya Sumiarsih and her son Sugeng.  
 In relation to the broader issues raised the Special Rapporteur notes the detailed response 
provided by the Government. He acknowledges the decision by the Constitutional Court to 
uphold the death penalty for non-lethal drug-related crimes on the basis of the relevant 
provisions of the Indonesian Constitution, but notes that this decision is not consistent with the 
interpretations adopted by international human rights bodies on this issue. He regrets that the 
Government&#8217;s reply failed to address the concern that the death penalty appears to be applied in 
a discriminatory manner in relation to non-nationals. The statement that &#8220;all are judged equally 
before the law&#8221; does not, of itself, provide a response to the apparently highly disproportionate 
statistics cited in the communication.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also regrets that the Government has not addressed concerns about 
the alleged use of torture and other compulsion to extort confessions that might result in 
execution. He looks forward to receiving from the government information about any 
investigations into such allegations and reiterates that executions should be suspended until such 
investigations are complete and any doubt about the use of coercion to elicit confessions is 
eliminated.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government is not in a position to comment on 
pending cases referred to in the annex. However, he would appreciate receiving detailed 
information on these cases as soon as it is available.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 31 July 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We are writing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government in relation to reports we have received 
regarding the resumption of executions in Indonesia. It is our understanding that, bringing to an 
end an informal moratorium on executions which lasted since 2004, six persons were executed 
since 27 June 2008: on 27 June 2008, <b>Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye </b>and <b>Hansen Anthoni 
Nwolisa</b>, two Nigerian citizens; on 10 July 2008, <b>Achmad Suradji</b>; on 18 July 2008, 
<b>Tubagus Maulana Yusuf</b>; and on the following day, <b>Nyonya Sumiarsih</b> and her son <b>Sugeng</b>. 
The first two had been found guilty of drug trafficking, the remaining four of multiple murders.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 173 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to recall that, although the death penalty is not prohibited 
under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental 
right to life, and must as such be applied in the most restrictive manner. Based on the reports we 
have received, including detailed information your Excellency&#8217;s Government has submitted to 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in November 2007, we would like to bring to 
your Government&#8217;s attention our concerns in three regards: (i) respect for the requirement that 
the death penalty be imposed only for &#8220;the most serious crimes&#8221;, (ii) the disproportionate number 
of foreigners sentenced to death for narcotics-related offences, and (iii) the requirement that in 
capital punishment cases all fair trial guarantees are rigorously observed.  
</p>
<p><i>Most serious crime requirement 
</i></p>
<p> Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Indonesia 
is a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence 
of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, two of those recently executed had been found 
guilty of drug trafficking. Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Anthoni Nwolisa, the two 
Nigerians who were executed by firing squad near Pasir Putih prison on 27 June 2008, had 
reportedly attempted to smuggle 7 kg of heroin into Indonesia.  
</p>
<p> More in general, according to detailed information provided by your Government to the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in November 2007, there were (as of 
October 2007) 99 prisoners sentenced to death in Indonesia. Recent reports indicate that the 
number of prisoners on death row has since risen, possibly to 108 at present. Five had been 
sentenced to death on terrorism charges, 36 for murder and one on charges of robbery. The 
remaining 57 were sentenced to death on charges of illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances. On 26 June 2008 (the International Day against Drug Abuse and 
Trafficking), National Police Chief General Sutanto reportedly stated that the Government 
intends to speed up executions of persons sentenced to death for drug trafficking. 
</p>
<p> Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances can certainly be considered 
a serious offence. Indeed, international treaties oblige Governments to criminalize international 
trafficking in illicit drugs and to cooperate in combating the trade. In interpreting Article 6 (2) of 
the Covenant, however, the Human Rights Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of 
a death sentence for offences that do not result in the loss of life, finding only cases involving 
murder not to raise concerns under the most serious crimes provision. As observed in a recent 
report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic 
review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with 
interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in 
cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). 
</p>
<p> To sum up, international law, specifically your Government&#8217;s obligations under the 
Covenant, requires that capital punishment for drugs trafficking (and for robbery) be abolished 
and that death sentences already imposed for drug trafficking and robbery (Abdul Hasan, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 174 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sentenced to death in 2003) be commuted to prison terms. In this respect, we commend the 
recent decision of the Supreme Court of Indonesia to commute the death sentence in the cases 
of three Australian citizens convicted of drugs smuggling, Matthew Norman, Thanh Duc 
Tan Nguyen and Si Yi Chen. 
</p>
<p><i>Disproportionate representation of foreigners among those sentenced to death 
</i> According to the data your Government provided to the Special Rapporteur on the question 
of torture, while all the death row inmates convicted for non-drug related offences are Indonesian 
nationals, of the 57 awaiting execution on drugs trafficking charges 43 are foreigners. Half of 
these foreigners (21) are citizens of African countries. While it seems clear that foreigners play a 
significant role in smuggling drugs into Indonesia, the fact that four out of five prisoners 
awaiting execution on drugs trafficking charges are foreigners raises certain questions in terms of 
possible discrimination in relation to both criminal enforcement and sentencing in drug-related 
cases. It would be important to know if there are four times more foreigners than locals involved 
in the drug trade, if the police use the same approach in investigating and charging both locals 
and foreigners, and if the sentences handed down are equally harsh in relation to both foreigners 
and locals. In addition, foreigners in conflict with the law are particularly vulnerable and require 
special measures to ensure the fairness of the proceedings against them, including interpretation 
and consular assistance. These needs are protected by international law, in particular 
Article 14(3)(a) and (f) of the Covenant and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. We 
are concerned that in some cases these guarantees might not have been respected (see the cases 
of Zulfikar Ali and Indra Tamang in the Annex to this letter). 
</p>
<p><i>Respect for fair trial guarantees 
</i> We would also respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital 
punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a 
fair trial set out in Article 14 of the Covenant admits of no exception. These guarantees include 
the right not to be compelled to confess guilt, the right to be assisted by a lawyer of one&#8217;s own 
choosing and to have legal aid assigned where one is unable to defend himself or herself in 
serious offences. With regard to the latter, the Human Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;[i]n 
cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted 
by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings.&#8221; (General Comment No. 32, para. 38). The fair trial 
guarantees also include the right to be assisted by an interpreter, as mentioned above. 
</p>
<p> With regard to statements allegedly extorted by torture, we also recall that paragraph 6(c) 
of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 urges States &#8220;to ensure that no statement 
established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made&#8221;. In addition 
to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an essential aspect of the 
non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in Article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> When the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture visited Pasir Putih prison 
on 20 November 2007, he interviewed a number of prisoners sentenced to death. As reflected in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 175 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Appendix I to his report on the visit to Indonesia (A/HRC/7/3/Add.7), many of these prisoners 
alleged prolonged detention in police custody, ill-treatment to extort confessions, judicial 
indifference to allegations of ill-treatment, and, in some cases, violations of the right to be 
assisted by legal counsel. Relevant parts of the Appendix to the report on the visit to Indonesia 
are reproduced as Annex to this communication. While we do not wish to prejudge the 
truthfulness and accuracy of the allegations made by the detainees, which have, to our 
knowledge, neither been corroborated nor refuted, they would - even if only partially true - raise 
serious concerns with respect to the fairness of the proceedings in which these persons were 
sentenced to death. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that 
the rights under international law of all prisoners sentenced to death (as well as of persons 
currently charged with capital offences) are respected. With regard to those sentenced to death 
on charges of trafficking in narcotics or psychotropic substances or of robbery, this can only 
mean suspension of the execution and eventually commutation of the death sentence. It also 
means thorough investigation of all allegations of torture or other forms of compulsion to extort 
confessions and suspension of execution until all doubts in this respect have been dispelled. 
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the persons sentenced to 
death, in compliance with your Government&#8217;s international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the communication above and in the Annex accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please indicate any steps your Government intends to take or has taken to comply 
with article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Indonesia 
is a party, that the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in 
accordance with the law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 3. Please indicate the basis upon which your Government considers that the imposition 
of the death penalty is not discriminatory in relation to foreigners in light of the fact that four out 
of five persons sentenced to death on drugs trafficking charges are said to be foreigners. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to allegations by 
prisoners sentenced to death that confessions were extorted by torture or other forms of 
ill-treatment, that they were denied access to counsel, interpretation, or consular access. If no 
inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. </p>

he was blindfolded and beaten many times to force him to sign a confession. He was held in 
police custody for several months at POSTPOL Senopati &#8230;&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 102. <b>Hillary Chimezie</b>, aged 40, Nigerian citizen, was arrested on 29 August 2002 by 
police in Jakarta. He then spent four months at Polda before his case went on trial for the first 
time, after which he was returned to Polda and held there for another four months. During his 
time in police custody he was severely beaten with a hammer, as a result of which his leg was 
broken. He still has difficulties walking. He was also beaten on the chest. He did not receive any 
medical treatment. At one point his lawyer was beaten as well, after which he withdrew from the

</p>
<p> 108. <b>Adami Wilson</b>, aged 34, Nigerian citizen [or rather a citizen of Malawi according to 
the list provided by your Government] and Indonesian resident since 1991, was arrested in 2003 
by officers of Polda Jakarta and charged under article 55 with drug related offences. During the 
interrogation, the officers blindfolded Mr. Wilson, put a gun into his mouth and threatened to kill 
him unless he confessed or paid the amount of 100 million IDR (about 10,600 $US) for his 
release. Mr. Wilson eventually confessed and was sentenced to death in 2004. During the trial 
proceedings he informed the lawyer assigned to him about the ill-treatment he experienced. 
However, in his assessment the defence lawyer cooperated with the judge and the prosecutor in 
order to extract money from him. In 2005 Mr. Wilson tried to appeal the sentence. He did not 
receive any legal aid and the appeal was unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p> 109. <b>Mr. Zulfiqaraw </b>[<b>Zulfikar Ali</b>, according to the list provided by your Government], 
aged 40, from Lahore, Pakistan, was arrested at Jakarta Airport in November 2004 on allegations 
of drug related offences. While he was abroad the police raided his apartment in Jakarta which 
he shared with a friend who possessed drugs. Despite the friend&#8217;s confession and assurances that 
Mr. Zulfiqaraw was not involved in any drug related matter, the police took Mr. Zulfiqaraw from </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the airport to a private house, where he was tortured for three days. He was frequently punched, 
kicked and threatened with being shot unless he would confess. Nobody knew his whereabouts. 
After three days his health deteriorated so much that he had to be taken to the police hospital, 
where he was treated for 17 days. Subsequently, he was transferred to Polda Jakarta where he 
spent two and a half months in official police custody. The prosecutor in charge, Mr. Hutagaol, 
offered to drop any charges for a payment of 400 million IDR (about 42,700 $US). 
Mr. Zulfiqaraw perceived his ensuing trial as strikingly unfair and biased against him since he is 
a foreigner. No convincing evidence was presented; during the trial session his judge fell asleep. 
He did not receive any legal aid although he was not able to finance a lawyer; his embassy was 
wrongly informed and failed to support him. He was sentenced to death. &#8230;  
</p>
<p> 110. <b>Gurdip Singh </b>[<b>Gurdi Singh Aus Vishal</b>, according to the list provided by your 
Government], aged 38, from India, was sentenced to death in relation to the above-mentioned

involved in any drug related matter; however, his statement was not taken into account during 
the trial proceedings.  
</p>
<p> 111. <b>Mansyur Hamada </b>[his name does not appear on the list provided by your 
Government], aged 72, was arrested by officers of Polda Jakarta in January 2004 for possessing 
100 grammes of heroin. He was offered to be freed for the payment of 25 million IDR 
(2,670 $US) but did not have enough money. During his custody at Polda Jakarta he was beaten 
up for three days. His hands were cuffed behind his back and the officers beat him with their fists 
as well as with their shoes until he could not see any more. 40 days later, Mr. Hamada suffered a 
heart attack. In March 2004 Mr. Hamada was transferred to Cipinang prison, and in July 2004 he 
was sentenced to capital punishment. During the trial, Mr. Hamada stated that he was tortured; 
however, neither the judge nor the prosecutor took note of his allegations.  
 112. <b>Indra Tamang</b>, aged 27, from Nepal, was sentenced to death in 2001 for drug 
related offences. In 2002 he appealed unsuccessfully against the verdict. He perceived his trial as 
unfair since he did not speak Indonesian sufficiently well in order to understand the court 
documents and did not have a lawyer.

<p><b>Response of the Government of Indonesia dated 17 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Indonesia presents its compliments to the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and with reference to 
the note of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, under reference No. AL G/SO 214(33-24) 
G/SO 2,14(53-21) IDN 6/2008, dated 31 July 2008, has the honour of providing further 
clarifications on the case concerning the allegations of the execution of six individuals for 
various crimes in Indonesia. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 178 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> With reference to the communication concerning the following six individuals namely; 
Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye, Hansen Anthony Nwolisa, Achmed Suradji, Tubagus Maulana 
Yusuf, Nyonya Sumiarsih and her son, Sugeng, the Government of Indonesia has the following 
points to, make. 
</p>
<p> Indonesia went ahead with the judicial decision and executed the two. Nigerians, 
Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Anthony Nwolisa on Thursday 26 June 2008, on the 
Nuskambangan Island of the Nirbaya region, which is an island off Central Java. They were 
convicted of drug trafficking charges over a year ago. 
</p>
<p> As regards Achmed Suradji, he was one of the convicted terrorists of the 2002 Bali 
bombing in Indonesia, while Tubagus Maulana Yusuf was convicted of murdering eight people 
in March 2007. He was executed on 18th July 2008 in Benten, North Java. In a separate judicial 
decision, Nyonya Sumiarsih and her son, Sugeng, were sentenced to death in 1989 for murder. 
Their last stage of appeal for presidential clemency was rejected in 2003. 
 As regards the individual cases: 
</p>
<p> Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Anthony Nwolisa were arrested and charged with 
drug possession. In 2007, they were convicted of drug trafficking charges (for smuggling in 
3.8 kg of heroin to Indonesia) and a death sentence was retained when their appeals at the 
various levels all failed to acquit them of the charges against them. 
</p>
<p> Achmad Suradji was sentenced to death in April 27, 1997 by the Lubuk Pakam district 
court in Deli Serdang, North Sumatra Province, for killing 42 women and girls in a series of 
ritual slayings. His appeals in higher courts and subsequent application for clemency were all 
rejected. 
 Tubagus Maulana Yusuf was convicted of murdering eight people in March 2007 and was 
sentenced to death. It is understood that he committed these murders under the deluded belief 
that this would enhance his powers of 'witchcraft. He subsequently made no appeals nor did he 
make any requests for clemency to the concerned authorities. 
</p>
<p> Nyonya Sumiarsih and her son, Sugeng, were sentenced to death in 1989 for the murder of 
a family of five in the city of Surabaya. Their last appeal for clemency was rejected in 2003. 
 At this juncture, it should be clearly understood that the Government of Indonesia has an 
independent judiciary which has been functioning effectively in Indonesia for several years. 
There are several strict stages which must first be respected before any execution may be carried 
out in Indonesia. 
</p>
<p> Contrary to any negative inferences in the letter, Indonesia wishes to recall to your 
attention that as a signatory to the ICCPR, which it has ratified, Indonesia does not take lightly 
the commitments it has undertaken. However, for heinous crimes committed and which have 
been, judicially adjudicated, certain provisions of the national law impose the death penalty. 
Furthermore, the provisions of national legislation are not discriminatory in relation to foreigners 
as all are judged equally before the law. Therefore, the fact that Indonesia is a signatory of the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 179 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ICCPR does not pre-empt any decisions the government may take as part of its sovereign and 
democratic legal process in deciding, within its borders and by applying its judicial norms, the 
applicable rule of law. 
</p>
<p> Once again, the death penalty in Indonesia is only imposed for crimes of a very serious 
nature. Moreover the law does not prohibit, the death penalty, it is still not, a sentence that is 
automatically or irrevocably imposed for similar crimes of this nature. As a democratic nation, 
Indonesia is committed to the fair and equitable application of the human rights norms. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, it has been four years since the last person was executed in Indonesia, this 
clearly indicates it is not a decision that is taken lightly or without first fully applying the due 
process of law. In this connection and given that this issue has been subject to controversy in 
Indonesia as well, the government has reassessed its position on this issue and in 2007, the 
Constitutional Court upheld the death penalty for serious drug offenses. 
</p>
<p> In addition, it bears stating unequivocally that the names mentioned in the Annex of the 
communication remain within the jurisdiction of the judiciary. It is up to the court and the 
constitution to determine how the provisions of national legislation apply to the mentioned 
individuals. To this effect, the Government of Indonesia is not at liberty to comment on the 
decisions that will be taken on their cases at this point in time.

<p><b>Indonesia:  Killing of Opinus Tabuni 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Death due to the use of force by law enforcement officials 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male (HRD) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of 
Indonesia with respect to the death of Opinus Tabuni. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to 
receiving continued updates on the status of the investigation into Mr. Tabuni&#8217;s death and 
information about any related criminal proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 8 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders  
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received in relation to reports of the killing of Mr. <b>Opinus Tabuni</b>, an activist of an 
indigenous peoples&#8217; organisation in West Papua, at a rally on 9 August 2008. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 9 August 2008, International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People, a peaceful rally 
took place through the town of Wamena, in the middle mountain region of West Papua. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 180 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>A march concluded with an event staged near Santa Thomas school in Wamena. Police 
were stationed around the ground where the event took place. Army and intelligence 
services were present as well. Only the security forces were carrying guns. 
</p>
<p>In the course of the event the Morning Star flag, which is a symbol of the West Papua 
independence movement, was raised. Raising the Morning Star flag reportedly constitutes, 
under Indonesian law, the offence of subversion and carries a sentence of up to 20 years 
imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>At this point, the police started moving in on the demonstrators and started shooting. 
Mr. Opinus Tabuni, a leader of the Wamena branch of an indigenous peoples&#8217; organisation 
in West Papua, was hit by a bullet and died. An autopsy performed on Mr Tabuni at the 
hospital in Wamena on 10 August 2008 showed that a bullet travelled through his right 
side and through his heart. The bullet has been sent by the police to Makassar for further 
analysis. 
</p>
<p>Another Papuan man, who was not identified, was reportedly seriously injured by gunshot. 
This man has disappeared since then. A further man was reportedly beaten by police with 
rifle butts and has also disappeared. There are concerns that the two men could have been 
apprehended by the police and may be in police detention.  
</p>
<p>The Indonesian police are reportedly investigating the incident and have detained a number 
of witnesses. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to refer 
your Government to the principles of international law governing the use of force when policing 
rallies and protests. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to 
which Indonesia is a party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the 
person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived 
of his or her life (Article 6). In particular, Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by 
law enforcement officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to 
the legitimate objective to be achieved. As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement 
officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force 
(Basic Principles, Principle 4). Further, whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law 
enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic Principles, Principle 5). Intentional 
lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life (Basic 
Principles, Principle 9).  
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that your Government has a 
duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. To fulfil this legal 
obligation, governments must ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force by law enforcement 
officials is punished as a criminal offence (Basic Principles, Principle 7). There must be 
thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions. Principle 18 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation 
of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;) </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 181 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>provides that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that persons identified by the investigation as having 
participated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions in any territory under their 
jurisdiction are brought to justice.&#8221;  
 With regard to witnesses and family members of victims, Principle 15 of the Prevention 
and Investigation Principles provides that complainants, witnesses, and their families shall be 
protected from violence and any other form of intimidation. Those potentially implicated in 
extra-legal executions shall be removed from any position of control or power, whether direct or 
indirect, over complainants, witnesses and their families, as well as over those conducting 
investigations. Families of the deceased should be informed about the investigation, and the 
findings of the investigation should be made public (Prevention and Investigation Principles, 
Principles 16 and 17). The families and dependents of victims of extra-legal, arbitrary or 
summary executions shall be entitled to fair and adequate compensation within a reasonable 
period of time (Prevention and Investigation Principles, Principle 20). 
</p>
<p> We are encouraged by the reports indicating that the Indonesian police are investigating 
the use of force at the rally in Wanema. We would ask your Excellency&#8217;s Government to keep us 
informed of the developments and outcomes of this investigation, as well as of disciplinary and 
criminal proceedings initiated against the perpetrators of extra-judicial executions. 
 We would also like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all necessary steps 
to ensure the right of peaceful assembly as recognized in article 21 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;[t]he right of peaceful assembly shall be 
recognized. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed 
in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of 
national security of public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or 
morals of the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In this context, we would also like to draw the attention of your Government to the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the 
General Assembly on 13 September 2007, and in particular to article 2, which states that 
&#8220;Indigenous peoples and individuals are free and equal to all other peoples and individuals and 
have the right to be free from any kind of discrimination, in the exercise of their rights, in 
particular based on their indigenous origin or identity.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We would further like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right 
individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; 
and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary 
to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other fields, as well as the 
legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in 
association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 182 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
article 12, paras 2 and 3, of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all necessary 
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate 
exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, 
individually and in association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in 
reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
 It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this case to 
the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the allegations in the above summary of the events accurate? If not, please share 
all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Are there demonstrators arrested at the rally who continue to be in detention? Have 
the police received any information on alleged disappearances? 
</p>
<p> 3. What were the instructions given to the security forces before and during the rally in 
Wanema? How did the security forces ensure compliance with the requirements of necessity and 
proportionality?  
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. Please explain the steps taken to 
ensure that these investigations comply with the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the killing of Opinus Tabuni and other excessive use of force in connection 
with the rally on 9 August 2008 in Wanema. 
</p>
<p> 6. Please provide the details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants, 
witnesses and family members of the victims are not subject to any intimidation or retaliation. 
</p><p> 7. Please state whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to the

G/SO 214(67-14) G/SO 214 (107-6) GS0214 (33-24) IDN 9/2008, dated 8 September 2008, has 
the honour of providing the following information on the case concerning the death of 
Mr. Opius Tabuni during the commemoration rally for the World&#8217;s Indigenous People Day. 
</p>
<p> On Saturday, 9th August 2008, at 9 am, sympathizers to the Dewan Adat Papua / DAP 
(Papuan Custom Council) cause from the sub-district of VI Lapago Balliem marched from 
Sinakma Wouma, Pikhe and Wesaput Wamena. They brought with them traditional defense 
armaments such as arrows, spears and machetes. They yelled continuously &#8220;International Koteka 
Naire and Independence for Papua&#8221;. Their march then continued onwards to the conference 
building on Yos Sudarso Street in the Wamena District of the Papua Province. 
</p>
<p> At 1.45 am, in the public square of Sinapuk which is located on Gatot Subroto Street, 
Wamena, sub-district of Jayawijaya, there was a commemoration of the &#8220;International Day of the 
World's Indigenous People&#8221;. The rally was attended by approximately 10,000 sympathizers of 
the DAP group and they chose to celebrate the event by illegally raising the Morning Star flag, a 
separatist flag. 
</p>
<p> The sympathizers of this movement then marched together with the leaders of the DAP, 
Mr. Forkorus Yaboisembut, Mr. Thaha AI Hamid (Secretary-General of the DAFT), 
Yakomina lsir, Lemok Mabel (leader of the DAP in Jayawijaya) and Arson Jikwa (leader of 
the West Papua Indigenous Association). They then arrived at Sinapuk Wamena, which is a 
public square. They also brought with them the banner upon which was written; &#8220;We are 
the international indigenous society of Papua (United Nations, 13 September 2007, 
Number 14842)&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> At 2.15 pm, the participants of the &#8220;International Day of the World's Indigenous People&#8221; 
carried the Morning Star flag side by side with the Indonesian flag, the UN flag and the SOS 
(emergency) flag on which was written also &#8220;Papuan are in danger&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Upon seeing the Morning Star flag raised, the county police of Jayawijaya, led by the head 
of the county police of Jayawijaya, tried to lower and confiscate the Morning Star flag. However, 
there was a strong opposition from the crowds. In order to calm the protestors down, the police 
officer(s) fired a warning shot in the air and this happened to strike the flag of the DAP 
sympathizers. Chaos ensued and within approximately 30 minutes, individuals in the crowds 
started using a gun, arrows, spears, and machetes. 
</p>
<p> At 3.30 pm, Mr. Forkorus Yaboisernbut (leader of the DAP), Mr. Thaha AI Hamid 
(Secretary-General of DAP), Mr. Lemok Mabel (leader of the DAP of Jayawijaya) and 
Mr, Yakomina Isir held a meeting with the head of the county police of Jayawijaya and 
Dandim 1702, and were informed that the individual(s) who raised the Morning Star Flag must 
be given up to the police officers and thereafter face legal prosecution. 
</p>
<p> At that moment, just as the crowds began to leave the area in order to return home, a man 
was found dead. He was identified as Mr. Opius Tabuni, 30 years old, who apparently lived in 
Piramid village, Wamena. An investigation into the cause of his death commenced immediately. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 184 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>At 4.45 pm, the DAP sympathizers carried the body of Mr. Opius Tabuni to the Honai 
(traditional house) of the DAP Lapago in Mapina. They requested an inquiry into the death of 
Mr. Opius Tabuni. 
</p>
<p> On Sunday, 10 August 2008, at about 2 pm until 6.58 pm the autopsy of the body 
Mr. Opius Tabuni was performed by Dr. Deri M. Sihombing, Dr. Edward, Dr. Ondolan and 
Dr. Roal. From the autopsy results, it was found that there was a bullet in his left heart: (more 
precisely, there was a wound on the right side caused by the bullet which had travelled through 
to the heart). 
</p>
<p> On Wednesday, 13 August 2008, at 9 am, at the Sinapuk Wamena public square, a team 
from the Indonesian Police Headquarters, consisting of the Deputy Commissioner Dr. Bagus, the 
Deputy Commissioner Dr. Agi and members of the Criminal Investigation (Reskrim) team of the 
county police of Jayawijaya investigated the third crime scene with regard to the raising of the 
Bintang Kejora Flag, and the incident which also led to the death of Mr; Opius Tabuni. At 
4.30 pm another team from the Indonesian Police Headquarters led by the head of the forensics 
department of the Indonesian Police Criminal Investigation Body (Bareskrim), namely, 
Brigadier General Ruslan Reza, together with other members from similar teams from the 
regional police office in Papua and Jayawijaya carried out investigations on the fourth crime 
scene at the Sinapuk public square. 
</p>
<p> From these investigations, it was determined that the individuals responsible for the 
deterioration of the rally commemorating the International Day of the World's Indigenous People 
included the head of the DAP (Mr. Forkorus Yaboisembut) as well as several prominent 
members of the Presidium Dewan Papua (DPD). 
</p>
<p> It has also been discovered that the aforementioned rally was attended by several 
prominent figures from the contentious Papuan People's Congress of 2000 and this separatist 
group was ultimately found to be behind the creation of the Presidium Dewan Papua/PDP (Papua 
Presidium Council) and other civilian separatist movements in general. 
</p>
<p> The individuals who raised the Morning Star flag have since been identified as having the 
initials AW and AH. It was also found that these individuals originate from the Piramid village 
in the Assologaima district. 
</p>
<p> Since then, there have been several steps taken by the regional police of Papua to address 
this problem. These have included: 
</p>
<p>1. Conducting investigations into finding the perpetrators who shot Mr. Opius Tabuni. 
</p>
<p>2. Conducting interrogations of the 4 (four) witnesses from the civil society body, 
31 (thirty-one) members of the county police of Jayawijaya who were on duty and who 
were supposed to provide security during the rally and 19 (nineteen) members of the 
county police of Jayawijaya who were armed during the rally. 
</p>
<p>3. The Papua regional police conducted &#8220;back-up&#8221; support from the county police of 
Jayawijaya and assisted the team of forensic experts from the Indonesian Police 
Headquarters and the Criminal Investigation Body (Bareskrim). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to recall here that the freedom of expression and the, 
freedom of association are guaranteed under the tenets of the Indonesian Constitution. In fact, 
there have been several laws which have been enacted to further strengthen the enjoyment of 
these rights in Indonesia, including, but not limited to, Article 28 of the 1945 Constitution. In 
addition, Article 28 J sub-paragraph (2) provides that &#8220;in exercising his/her rights and freedoms, 
every person shall have the duty to accept the restrictions established by law for the sole 
purposes of guaranteeing the recognition and respect of the rights and freedoms of others and of 
satisfying just demands based upon considerations of morality, religious values, security and 
public order in a democratic society.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, it should also be recalled that these human rights freedoms are also subject to 
restrictions within international legislation notably when these rights impinge on territorial 
integrity and regional peace. Reading from Article 19 subparagraph (3) alinea (b) and Article 21 
of the ICCPR, it clearly states that these freedoms are limited in instances which fall contrary 
to &#8220;... the interests of national security or public safety, public order (order public), the protection 
of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, for the enjoyment of the freedom of expression and association, it is required 
to seek permission from the existing local government or authorities as regulated in Law No. 9 
of 1998 on Freedom of Opinion in Public Sphere. Under the provisions of chapter 510 of the 
Criminal Code, permission must be sought and attained in advance from the law enforcement 
authorities in the region in order to hold such public events. This is so as to ensure that 
demonstrations are carried out in a safe and orderly manner with law officials present in case any 
problems arise. 
</p>
<p> In this case the DAP association is not registered nor is it listed in the Papua provincial 
register. There was also no registration or permission to hold the rally, nor - as is the norm - did 
they guarantee that their organisation would be responsible if any problems were to arise. The 
organisers illicitly insisted on holding the rally under other pretences, namely that of their 
traditional &#8220;burning of stones&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The participants also brought along with them to the rally traditional armaments such as 
spears and machetes (with the argument that this was for the occasion of the indigenous day). 
Hence, one can imagine how difficult it was for the local police officers to control the masses, in 
particular when the police tried to lower down the separatist flag. Indeed, even if they had 
permits to hold a rally, it goes without saying that this is conditional on them not bringing along 
any separatist symbols since it is illegal to do so. 
</p>
<p> It is very regretful that the incident took the life of Mr. Tabuni. Indeed, the government 
does not take this incident lightly and thus, various investigations have since been conducted, 
including a series of internal affairs investigations into the police officers who were present at 
the scene of the rally. 
</p>
<p> Following thorough ballistics examination by the experts, it has been discovered that it 
was a bullet from a 9mm pistol which caused the death of Mr Tabuni. Upon comparison with the 
47 weapons which were in possession of the police present at the time of the incident, it became 
evident that the bullets do not in fact match any from those belonging to the police. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 186 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> As part of their ongoing investigation, the police are trying to find out who raised the flag 
and secondly, from this, discover who also fired the gun. They are still calling witnesses and 
investigating all leads pertaining to the case. 
</p>
<p> In this context, and by way of conclusion, Indonesian law clearly states that the raising of 
separatist symbols such as the Morning Star Flag is expressly prohibited by Article 6 of the 
Regulation PP 77/2007 and may be charged with Articles 106 and 107 and 110 of the Indonesian 
Criminal Code. Therefore, the raising of this flag during the said rally was considered as a 
blatant act of defiance against the established precepts of Indonesian law. 
</p>
<p> Nonetheless, the Government of Indonesia will be continuing its investigations into this 
incident and all the perpetrators will be dealt with in a fair manner and in accordance with the 
prescribed national judicial process. To this effect, it must be left for the judiciary to finalise the 
prosecution of any suspects in the murder of Mr. Tabuni.

<p><b>Indonesia:  Imminent execution of Ona Denis 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur greatly appreciates the detailed and substantive response provided. 
He notes the various points made and would wish to address only two issues in this observation. 
The first relates to the apparently disproportionate number of foreigners sentenced to death for 
drug offences. In order to sustain the arguments put forth by the Government a detailed statistical 
analysis would be required. The Special Rapporteur would welcome the provision of such 
statistics. The second observation relates to the argument that drug offences satisfy the 
requirements of international law that the death penalty can only be imposed for &#8220;the most 
serious crimes&#8221;. According to the Constitutional Court, there is, &#8220;in Indonesian law, &#8230; no 
substantive difference between, on the one hand, particularly serious narcotics crimes and on the 
other, genocide or crimes against humanity&#8221;. This may well be the case in domestic law, but it is 
not in accordance with the approach reflected in international law and applicable to Indonesia. In 
addition, the argument that drug offences pose &#8216;a danger of incalculable gravity&#8217; and could 
undermine the &#8216;economic, cultural and political foundations of society&#8217;, could be, and has been, 
applied in relation to a wide range of different crimes in different countries. The objective of 
international law, as reflected in the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; requirement is to move beyond such 
subjective approaches and to establish a more uniform international approach. It is for that 
reason that international human rights bodies have consistently interpreted the provision as 
requiring the direct loss of life. If the law were to encompass forms of indirect loss of life, such 
as those implied in relation to drug offences, the category of crimes for which the death penalty 
could be applied would be vastly enlarged, thus defeating the meaning, as well as the intent of 
the drafters, of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; provision. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 19 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I write to your Excellency&#8217;s Government in relation to reports I have received regarding 
the allegedly imminent execution of a man of Nigerian origin convicted on drug trafficking 
charges, Mr. <b>Ona Denis</b>. I also would like to seize this opportunity to continue the dialogue with 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government on the death penalty for drug trafficking offences and on the 
number of foreigners on death row for such offences in Indonesia. In this respect, I refer to the 
communication I sent to your Excellency&#8217;s Government jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture on 31 July 2008 and to your Government&#8217;s highly appreciated reply 
of 17 October 2008.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received, Ona Denis, who was born in Nigeria, travelled to 
Indonesia on a Malawian passport in 2001. He was apprehended, tried and convicted of 
smuggling 1kg of heroin into Indonesia. The trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. 
Ona Denis appealed, and the High Court of Appeal sentenced him to death. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the imposition of the death penalty in drugs trafficking cases, your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s communication of 17 October 2008 argues that &#8220;the fact that 
Indonesia is a signatory of the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)] 
does not pre-empt any decisions the government may take as part of its sovereign and democratic 
judicial process in deciding, within its borders and by applying its judicial norms, the applicable 
rule of law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> I respectfully submit that, as a matter of international law, by becoming a party to the 
ICCPR, Indonesia - as all other State parties - took the sovereign decision to subject its internal 
legal order to the principles and norms enshrined in that instrument. One of these norms is 
Article 6(2) of the ICCPR which provides that, &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> I recognize that Your Excellency&#8217;s Government appears to accept this principle to some 
extent. The communication of 17 October 2008 stresses that &#8220;the death penalty in Indonesia is 
only imposed for crimes of a very serious nature&#8221;. It adds that the Constitutional Court of 
Indonesia confirmed in 2007 that narcotics offences did fall into this category. 
</p>
<p> Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances can certainly be considered 
a serious offence. The term &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; in Article 6(2), however, has acquired an 
autonomous meaning through interpretation by United Nations bodies, particularly by the 
Human Rights Committee, the expert body appointed by the State Parties of the ICCPR to 
interpret the treaty and oversee its implementation. In interpreting Article 6(2) of the Covenant, 
the Human Rights Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a death sentence for 
offences that do not result in the loss of life, finding only cases involving murder not to raise 
concerns under the most serious crimes provision. A thorough and systematic review of the 
jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most 
serious crimes provision gives the same result, i.e. that a death sentence can only be imposed in 
cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 188 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> I respectfully reiterate that international law, specifically your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
obligations under the ICCPR, requires that capital punishment for drugs trafficking be abolished 
and that death sentences already imposed for drug trafficking be commuted to prison terms. On 
this basis, I specifically appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that Oba Denis is not 
executed. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the disproportionate representation of foreigners among those sentenced to 
death, including Mr. Ona Denis and the two Nigerian citizens executed on 27 June 2008, 
Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Anthoni Nwolisa, your Excellency&#8217;s Government writes 
in its communication of 17 October 2008 that: 
</p>
<p>the provisions of national legislation are not discriminatory in relation to foreigners as all 
are judged equally before the law. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, I would recall that there was no allegation in my communication of 
31 July 2008, that the legislation regarding the death penalty discriminated against foreigners. 
The concern I raised on the basis of the statistical information available (i.e. four out of five 
prisoners awaiting execution on drugs trafficking charges are foreigners) is that the concrete 
application of the legislation, the way in which drug trafficking cases are prosecuted, appears to 
lead to the imposition of the death penalty primarily against foreigners.  
</p>
<p>As I wrote in my previous communication:  
</p>
<p>While it seems clear that foreigners play a significant role in smuggling drugs into 
Indonesia, the fact that four out of five prisoners awaiting execution on drugs trafficking 
charges are foreigners raises certain questions in terms of possible discrimination in 
relation to both criminal enforcement and sentencing in drug-related cases. It would be 
important to know if there are four times more foreigners than locals involved in the drug 
trade, if the police use the same approach in investigating and charging both locals and 
foreigners, and if the sentences handed down are equally harsh in relation to both 
foreigners and locals. In addition, foreigners in conflict with the law are particularly 
vulnerable and require special measures to ensure the fairness of the proceedings against 
them, including interpretation and consular assistance. These needs are protected by 
international law, in particular Article 14(3)(a) and (f) of the Covenant and the Vienna 
Convention on Consular Relations.  
</p>
<p> I would therefore like to renew the request for information in question no. 3 of my 
communication of 31 July 2008. Please indicate the basis upon which your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government considers that the use of the death penalty for drug traffickers is not - in practice - 
discriminatory in relation to foreigners, considering that four out of five persons sentenced to 
death on drugs trafficking charges are said to be foreigners.  
</p>
<p> I undertake to ensure that your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s response with regard to the 
specific case of Mr. Ona Denis, as well as its response to the general question regarding the 
disproportionate number of foreigners sentenced to death on drug trafficking charges, are 
accurately reflected in the report I will submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration.  </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of Indonesia dated 20 April 2009 
</b></p>
<p> The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Indonesia presents its compliments to the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and with reference to the 
note of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, under 
reference No. AL G/SO 214(33-24) IDN 14/2008 has the honour of providing the following 
information on the case concerning Ona Denis. 
</p>
<p> In 2001, Mr Ona Denis, a man of Nigerian origin travelled to Indonesia on a Malawian 
passport. He was detained after her was found to be travelling with one kilogram of heroin in his 
possession, He was arrested and tried in the national courts. He was thereafter convicted of 
smuggling illegal Class A drugs into Indonesia. As is commonly the case, this charge carries a 
serious penalty and Mr Denis was sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial court. 
</p>
<p> Since that time, he has appealed the courts decision but the High court upheld the verdict 
of the trial court and handed down a death sentence to Mr Denis. Failing to successfully repeal 
the decision of the judiciary, Mr Ona Denis, who remained in police custody, is bound to the 
sentence that was handed down by the court. 
</p>
<p> However, according to the national judicial procedure, any defendant may still submit an 
appeal for clemency to the President who may upon review decide to give a pardon to the 
accused (Law. No. 3 of 1950 and Law No. 22 of 2002 on Clemency). This is generally the final 
option in the appeals process in Indonesia. It is also only the President, upon request, who has 
the power to commute the sentence. Mr Ona Denis was accordingly informed of this right and it 
was reported that he appealed to the President for clemency. 
</p>
<p> His request was not granted. According to the Deputy-Attorney for General Crimes, as 
Mr Denis was unable to obtain presidential clemency, the judicial decision of the Appeals court 
would stand. 
</p>
<p> Mr Ona Denis is currently being held in a Nusakambangen jail in Cilacap, Central Java 
where he has remained after exhausting all channels of appeal. The decision concerning the date 
of execution will be determined by the Banten and Uouth Sumatra high prosecution offices. 
</p>
<p> At this juncture, it should be clearly noted that the court ruling is in accordance with the 
stipulations of Law No. 22 of 1997 on Narcotics and Law No. E of 1997 on Psychotropic 
substances, which clearly state that the importation, exportation, production, cultivation, storage, 
distribution and use of narcotics without strict control and supervision are considered as a crime, 
and against the prevailing laws and regulations of the country. As they are considered as acts that 
are harmful and can endanger human life, the community and the nation, strict norms apply to 
the supply and use of narcotics. In addition, Article 80 Paragraph (1) sub-paragraph (a) of the 
Narcotics Law, it reads, &#8220;Whosoever without any right or illegally, produces, processes, extracts, 
converts, prepares or provides Narcotics Category l shall be punished with a capital 
punishment...&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 190 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In recent years, the validity of the narcotics law and the penalty for its violation have been 
challenged and thoroughly discussed in the Constitutional Court in 2007 under case reference 
No. 2/PUU-V/2007. This case came before the. court when two Indonesian citizens 
(Edith Yunita Sianturi and Rani Andriani) and two foreigners (Myuran Sukumaran and 
Andrew Chan) were charged with narcotics trafficking, and sought to petition for a judicial 
review of Law. No. 22 of 1997 because they felt it was unconstitutional and violated their right 
to life. 
</p>
<p> As regards the argument that the death penalty violates the right to life, the Supreme Court 
judges argued that the articles of the Constitution are in specific circumstances subject to 
limitations In effect, the Attorney General offered the clarification that Article 28 J sub-section 
(2) states that an individual's rights are subject to restrictions If they must protect the rights of 
others or more simply, &#8220;every person shall be subject to limitations stipulated by Law&#8221;. In 
addition, the judges argued in their summation that in Indonesian law, there is no substantive 
difference between, on the one hand, particularly serious narcotics crimes and on the other, 
genocide or crimes against humanity. Each it was said, posed `a danger of incalculable gravity 
and could undermine the `economic, cultural and political foundations of society&#8217;. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, reading from the principles established in Indonesian criminal law, this crime 
also falls within the scope of a capital offense and thus carries a death penalty. In Article 80 of 
Law No. 22 of 1997, it clearly states that it is against the law to produce, process, extract, 
convert and make available narcotics in Indonesia, while Article 82 applies a death penalty for 
those involved in the horrendous crime of drug smuggling. 
</p>
<p> In accordance with Article 6 of the ICCPR, drug trafficking is indeed considered as a 
&#8220;most serious crime&#8221; in Indonesia and thus justifies the imposition of the death penalty. From the 
principles clearly outlined in Article 6 paragraph (2) of the ICCPR, a State party which has not 
abolished the death penalty, may in fact impose it. This is subject only to the laws in force in the 
country as well as the laws applicable at the time of the commission of the crime. And on a more 
general note, the ICCPR does not in fact prohibit countries from applying and enforcing the 
death penalty should they choose to respect the dictates of their national norms. 
</p>
<p> Thus, while Indonesia has ratified the ICCPR through Law Number 12 of 2005, it should 
be noted that the provisions of the national law allows for the imposition of the death penalty in 
specific cases of serious or heinous crimes. Moreover, this principle is in accordance to 
Article 15 alinea 2 of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p> In Indonesia, the death penalty is only applicable once all the legal avenues for reversal 
and a case review have been exhausted. This process in its entirety often takes several years, It is 
also only applied in special instances and not as an alternative penalty. The rigorous and strict 
application of the law as regards the death row, led to strong pressure by certain members of 
society on the government to expedite the execution procedure for those who were sentenced to 
death for drugs related offences. They felt this would act as a greater deterrent to potential drugs 
traffickers. It should be noted that between 1950 and 2009, only 5 people were executed for 
drugs related offences, namely, Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey, Saelow Prasert and Namsong Srilak 
(all in 2004) and Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye, Hansen Anthony Nwolisa (all in 2008). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 191 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In spite of the pressure from certain quarters, the government has been consistent in its 
approach to all procedures that which must be carried out or exhausted before the execution is 
conducted. For example, in the case of Ayodya Prasad, Saelow Prasert and Namsong Srilak, it 
took ten years before the execution order was final. While in the case of Mr. Okoye and 
Mr Nwolisa, the legal procedure from the time of indictment until the execution took eight 
years (2001-2008). 
</p>
<p> On the allegation concerning a disproportionate representation of foreigners among those 
that are sentenced to death, Indonesia considers this to be incorrect. Any individual who is 
arrested, tried and sentenced for such crimes will be treated equally before the law. There is no 
discrimination in the judicial process. Indonesia applies and respects the stipulations of 
Article 14, of the I-WCPR, namely that &#8220;all persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals 
and everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and 
impartial tribunal established by law&#8221;. The right of equal treatment before the law is guaranteed 
in the 1945 Constitution and its subsequent amendments (in particular, Articles 26 and 27 of the 
Constitution). 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, it is not the Indonesian government that determines the fact that in Indonesia, 
it is the foreigners that are, in the majority, involved in drugs trafficking. Therefore, the 
allegation that during the prosecution for such crimes, it i&#8222; the foreigners who receive a death 
penalty sentence is false, especially when the representation of Indonesians who were indicted 
for drug trafficking offences is small when compared to the number of foreigners. From this, we 
can also assume that the narcotics law has indeed been a deterrent to potential national drug 
traffickers who are Indonesian of origin. Besides, the exact number, nationality and proportion of 
those convicted and executed is not the determining factor that should be the focus, it is the 
crime committed, and as determined by the judicial court, the severity of punishment it merits. 
 In this regard, it should be noted that Indonesians as much as foreigners are subject to 
national norms relating to narcotics. In this vein, in the abovementioned case No. 2/PUU 
V/2007, the Supreme Court further ruled that foreign citizens have legal protection &#8220;based on 
the principle of due process of law, in case and they would still have the right to legal remedies 
in the form of appeal, &#8220;cassation, and judicial review. This also extends to the right to seek 
presidential pardon. In every case, strict legal procedures must be respected 'these procedures 
apply to one and all, and the government is unstinting in its efforts to abolish drug trafficking in 
Indonesia. 
</p>
<p> The Indonesian government is very committed to its war against the illegal use and sale of 
narcotics in the country. The government can not afford not to be. In the last five years, statistics 
have shown a 34.4% increase in drug related cases each year. An estimated fifteen-thousand 
people in Indonesia die from drugs per annum. It is believed there are about 41 deaths every day 
due to overdose or drug-related HIV/AIDS infection. The then Minister of Law and Human 
Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Hamid Awaludin, stated that there are about 3.2 million 
drug users in Indonesia. Approximately 30% of the total 111,000 inmates incarcerated nationally 
are implicated in drug-related cases. 
</p>
<p> There have since then been various instances when the reasoning behind and the use of the 
death penalty have been questioned in Indonesia. In 2007, there was a plenary hearing for the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 192 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>judicial review of Law Number 22 of 1997 on Narcotics. In particular, the provision regarding 
capital punishment was raised in the Constitutional Court where eminent experts were invited to 
discuss this issue. One argument was that the general function of the penal law is among others, 
to protect the interest of the state, the public, and individuals. Narcotics-related crimes could 
violate the legal interests of those parties. 
</p>
<p> In 2007, the Constitutional Court ruled 6 to 3 that the constitutional amendment of 2000 
upholding the right to life did not apply to capital punishment. It was further determined that the 
right to life had to be balanced against the rights of the victims of drug trafficking whose lives 
could potentially be lost as a result.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 27 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I 
have received regarding Mr. <b>Naser Qasemi</b>, Mr. <b>Reza Hejazi</b> and Mr. <b>Iman Hashem</b>, who are 
reportedly at risk of execution for a crime committed when they were still minors.  
</p>
<p>According to the information I have received: 
</p>
<p><b>Naser Qasemi</b> was sentenced to death for a murder he allegedly committed in 1999, when 
he was 15. He has been detained for eight years, during which he has faced a number of 
trials and retrials, as a result of which he was sentenced to death on three occasions. The 
victim's family has demanded diyeh (&#8220;blood money&#8221;), but Naser Qasemi's family has been 
unable to raise the requested amount. 
</p>
<p>On 14 November 2005 <b>Reza Hejazi</b> was sentenced to Qesas (retribution) by Branch 106 
of the Esfahan General Court for a murder he allegedly committed in 2004, when he 
was 15. The sentence was approved by Branch 28 of the Supreme Court on 6 June 2006, 
although under Iranian law he should have been tried in a juvenile court. The case was 
referred for mediation between Reza Hejazi and the victim's family, to try and arrange for 
the payment of diyeh, but no sum has yet been agreed. If no agreement is reached, 
Reza Hejazi will be executed.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 193 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Iman Hashemi</b> was 17 in June 2006 when his brother Majid was arrested for murder. 
Following his brother&#8217;s arrest, Iman Hashemi allegedly confessed to the murder, though 
he later implied in court that he had been coerced into confessing. On 13 January 2007, 
Iman Hashemi was sentenced to Qesas by a court in Esfahan. On 26 May 2007, Branch 42 
of the Supreme Court upheld the verdict; however it has not yet been approved by the 
Head of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding these specific 
cases, I would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that the execution of 
Naser Qasemi, Reza Hejazi and Iman Hashemi and any further executions of juvenile offenders 
would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
under various instruments which I have been mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. 
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Iran is a Party expressly 
provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below 
eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights to which Iran is a Party provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for 
crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> I would respectfully reiterate my appeal to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
to take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with accepted standards 
of international human rights law.  
</p>
<p> As your Excellency will be aware this is the fourteenth communication that I have had to 
send since the beginning of 2007 in relation to cases involving the juvenile death penalty in Iran. 
I have to date received only two responses to these many communications and both were in very 
similar terms. They concluded that &#8220;although there have been a few cases of murder under the 
age of 18, the pertinent authorities have been exerting their utmost effort to decrease carrying out 
verdicts to a level close to stop, with the hope of ultimate reconciliation.&#8221; Under the 
circumstances I would take this occasion to reiterate my request for a visit to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in the hope that a full and open exchange with the relevant authorities could 
only contribute to the efforts which your Excellency&#8217;s Government indicates it has initiated. 
Since the Government has already agreed in principle to a visit on my part I would like to 
request approval for a visit from 7-15 July, 2008. 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandates provided by the Commission on Human Rights 
and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. 
Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful 
for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please provide all information and 
documents proving their inaccuracy.  
</p>
<p> 2. I also recall my communications dated 5 January 2007, 31 January 2007 and 
29 February 2008 seeking confirmation of the current status of the Bill on Juvenile Courts. What 
provisions will that law, once it enters into force, contain with regard to capital punishment for 
juvenile offenders? </p>

<p> 3. Finally, I would be grateful if Your Excellency&#8217; Government could agree to the dates 
of 7-15 July 2008 proposed for a visit to enable a full and open discussion of the issues raised in 
this communication and arising under my mandate from the Human Rights Council.

<p><b>Islamic Republic of Iran:  Death sentence of Abdolwahed (Hiwa) Butimar  
Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male (journalist) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 24 April 2008</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the sentencing to death on appeal of <b>Abdolwahed (Hiwa) Butimar</b>, 
a Kurdish journalist and environmentalist, by Branch No. 1 of the Revolutionary Court in 
Marivan City in the Province of Kordestan. An urgent appeal was sent on 26 July 2007 on behalf 
of Hiwa Butimar and his cousin Adnan Hassanpour, a Kurdish journalist and cultural rights 
activist, by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
to which your Government replied on 23 August 2007. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Hiwa Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour were arrested on 23 December 2006 and 
25 January 2007 respectively, and reportedly held incommunicado in the Ministry of 
Intelligence facility in Marivan until 26 March 2007, when they were transferred to 
Marivan prison. They were tried on 12 June 2007 on charges of espionage and crime of 
&#8220;Moharebeh&#8221; (enemy of God) and sentenced to death on 17 July, although information 
received indicated that the charges were not supported by evidence. They appealed the 
sentence, and on 23 October 2007 the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence against 
Adnan Hassanpour, while it overturned the sentence against Hiwa Butimar for procedural 
irregularities and sent it back to the Marivan Revolutionary Court for re-examination. 
</p>
<p>According to information received, Hiwa Butimar's death sentence was recently upheld on 
appeal. It is reported that the case was referred to the same judge on appeal as the first 
instance judge. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 195 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted 
in the most restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which Iran is a party, provides that the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the 
most serious crimes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The charge of espionage is certainly a serious offence. In interpreting Article 6(2) of the 
Covenant, however, the Human Rights Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a 
death sentence for offences that do not result in the loss of life, finding only cases involving 
murder not to raise concerns under the most serious crimes provision. As observed in a recent 
report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic 
review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with 
interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in 
cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Moreover, when the Human Rights Committee last considered a report 
presented by your Excellency's Government, it expressly stated in its concluding observations 
that it &#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in loss of 
life, as being contrary to the Covenant&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9). According to the 
information we have received, the offences for which Abdolwahed Butimar has been convicted 
were not intended to result in any killings and did not result in loss of life. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, regarding the charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221;, we would like to draw attention to 
concerns already raised in correspondence with your Excellency&#8217;s Government as well as in 
general reports. In a communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 31 August 2006 sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions concerning the 
imposition of the death penalty against Ali Motirijejad and others (reproduced in 
A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, pages 165f) similar concerns were raised with regard to the charge of 
&#8220;mohareb&#8221;: &#8220;I am concerned that this charge, which according to my information in Iran is 
directed mainly against political dissidents, critics of the Government and persons accused of 
espionage, might not be sufficiently well defined to satisfy the very strict standards of legality set 
by Article 6(2) ICCPR for the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty. In order for the 
sentence of death to be imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law in question must be 
sufficiently precise to clearly allow distinction between conduct punishable with the capital 
sentence and conduct not so punishable. The concept of a &#8220;fair trial&#8221; similarly requires that the 
elements of the crime charged be known in sufficient detail to the defendant for him to be able to 
effectively address them.&#8221; The query to your Government to provide the definition of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; 
under Iranian law has unfortunately, to date, remained without a reply. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to the article 14 of the 
International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which has been ratified by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran on 24 June 1975, and which states: 5. Everyone convicted of a crime 
shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according 
to law.  
</p>
<p> We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the above mentioned person, in 
accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 196 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right 
shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of 
his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> We wish to reiterate the principle enunciated in Resolution 2005/38 of the Commission of 
Human Rights, which calls on States, while noting that article 19, paragraph 3, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that the exercise of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities, to refrain 
from imposing restrictions which are not consistent with paragraph 3 of that article, including on 
(i) discussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human rights, 
government activities and corruption in government; engaging in election campaigns, peaceful 
demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or democracy; and expression of 
opinion and dissent, religion or belief, including by persons belonging to minorities or vulnerable 
groups. 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the 
fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that 
&#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote 
and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as 
may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other 
fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, 
individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in 
practice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 6 points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate 
means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, 
de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, 
we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the aforementioned person are respected and accountability of any person guilty of 
the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopt effective 
measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-mentioned person 
in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to 
our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we 
would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when 
relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please indicate the legal basis of the sentencing of Abdolwahed Butimar, and how it 
is compatible with international norms and standards applicable as contained in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In particular, please provide details regarding the exact 
charges against him, as well as on access to legal counsel, public nature of hearings and 
judgments, the conviction and sentence, and the post-conviction proceedings. 
</p><p> 3. Please provide details of the remedies against the execution of the death sentence still 
available to him.

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 2 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I 
have received regarding Mr. <b>Hossein Haghhi</b>, who is reportedly at risk of execution for a crime 
committed when he was still a minor.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 198 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information I have received: 
</p>
<p>On 12 August 2004, Hossein Haghi, then aged 16, and his friend, known as Amrollah T, 
intervened to stop a fight between a friend of theirs and another boy, Mehdi Khalili. 
A number of others were also involved in the fight. According to his testimony, 
Hossein Haghi was held from behind, and Mehdi Khalili started hitting him. 
Hossein Haghi was able to free his hands, and retrieved a knife from his pocket to defend 
himself. Mehdi Khalili was killed by a knife wound to the chest. Upon his arrest, 
Hossein Haghi admitted to holding a knife and striking Mehdi Khalili to scare him away. 
However during his trial, Hossein Haghi denied stabbing Mehdi Khalili to death.  
</p>
<p>On 8 February 2004 Hossein Haghi was sentenced to qesas (retribution) by Branch 74 of 
the Criminal Court. Based on his initial confessions he was found guilty of premeditated 
murder under Article 206 (b) of Iran&#8217;s Criminal Code which states: &#8220;Murder is classed as 
premeditated in cases where the murderer intentionally makes an action which is inherently 
lethal, even if [the murderer] does not intend to kill the person.&#8221; On 25 June 2004, the 
Supreme Court upheld his sentence. Hossein Haghi&#8216;s defence lawyer lodged a petition 
demanding a review of the case. Though the petition was rejected, the case was 
re-examined, and has now been referred to Branch 33 of the Supreme Court by the Head of 
the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding this specific case, 
I would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that the execution of Hossein Haghi 
and any further executions of juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the international 
legal obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under various instruments which I have been 
mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child to which Iran is a Party expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be 
imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, 
Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a Party 
provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below 
eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> I would respectfully reiterate my appeal to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
to take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with accepted standards 
of international human rights law. With regard to the case at hand, and in particular in light of 
the referral of the case to the Supreme Court, this can only mean setting aside of the death 
sentence imposed against Hossein Haghi. 
</p>
<p> As your Excellency will be aware this is the fifteenth urgent communication that I have 
had to send since the beginning of 2007 in relation to cases involving the juvenile death penalty 
in Iran. I have to date received only two responses to these many communications and both were 
in very similar terms. They concluded that &#8220;although there have been a few cases of murder 
under the age of 18, the pertinent authorities have been exerting their utmost effort to decrease 
carrying out verdicts to a level close to stop, with the hope of ultimate reconciliation.&#8221; Under the 
circumstances I would take this occasion to reiterate my request for a visit to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in the hope that a full and open exchange with the relevant authorities could </p>

Since the Government has already agreed in principle to a visit on my part I would like to

regard to capital punishment for juvenile offenders? 
</p><p> 3. Finally, I would be grateful if Your Excellency&#8217; Government could agree to the dates

<p><b>Islamic Republic of Iran:  Death sentences of Farzad Kamangar,

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran regarding the death sentences of Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and 
Farhad Vakili. However, the Special Rapporteur would note that the information provided does 
not address the more general issue raised in this communication. The Special Rapporteur has 
consistently noted that membership in a rebel armed group (in this case a group classified as 
terrorist by the Government) is often considered a serious offence. Nevertheless, international 
law permits that death be imposed only for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, a requirement that is 
properly interpreted to limit the death penalty to crimes in which there is an intention to kill and 
a resulting loss of life. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to an explanation of why the 
Government&#8217;s domestic law imposes the death sentence for crimes that do not result in an 
intentional killing. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 18 July 2008</b>,<b> </b>sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the death sentences reportedly imposed on three ethnic Kurds and 
alleged members of the armed group Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), <b>Farzad Kamangar</b> (also 
known as Siamand), <b>Ali Heydariyan</b> and <b>Farhad Vakili</b>. The Supreme Court of Iran is reported 
to have recently confirmed the death sentences and the execution of Farzad Kamangar might be 
imminent.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili were arrested by Ministry of 
Intelligence officials in Tehran in July or August 2006. Farzad Kamangar was 
subsequently held incommunicado at a series of different locations, including in 
Kermanshah, Sanandaj and Tehran. In the course of his detention he was tortured, 
including by beating, flogging and electrocution. As a result of the treatment inflicted, he 
had to be transferred twice to prison clinics. 
</p>
<p>On 27 May 2007, the spokesperson of the Judiciary announced that Farzad Kamangar 
had been charged with membership in a terrorist organization and with holding explosives. 
In February 2008, the 36th Revolutionary Court in Tehran found Farzad Kamangar, 
Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili guilty on charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221;, apparently in 
connection with their alleged membership in the PKK, and sentenced them to death. 
Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili were also found guilty of forging documents and 
sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which they have to serve before any execution being 
undertaken. 
</p>
<p>Recently (the exact date has not been reported to us), the Supreme Court confirmed the 
death sentences. It would appear from the information received, that the head of the 
Judiciary may already have issued the execution order for Farzad Kamangar.  
</p>
<p> Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be applied in 
the most restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which Iran is a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Membership in a rebel armed group (classified as terrorist group by Your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government) is often considered a serious offence. In interpreting Article 6(2) of the Covenant, 
however, the Human Rights Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a death 
sentence for offences that do not result in the loss of life. As observed in a recent report to the 
Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the 
jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most 
serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be 
shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, 
para. 53). Moreover, when the Human Rights Committee last considered a report presented by </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 201 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>your Excellency's Government, it expressly stated in its concluding observations that it 
&#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in loss of life, 
as being contrary to the Covenant&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9).  
</p>
<p> The above considerations highlight one reason why the imposition of the death sentence on 
charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; is so problematic. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions explained in previous communications to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
(e.g. of 31 August 2006 concerning the imposition of the death penalty against Ali Motirijejad 
and others (reproduced in A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, pages 165f) and of 26 July 2007 concerning the 
imposition of the death penalty against Abdolwahed (Hiwa) Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour 
(reproduced in A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, pages 210f)): 
</p>
<p> &#8220;I am concerned that this charge, which according to my information in Iran is 
directed mainly against political dissidents, critics of the Government and persons accused 
of espionage, might not be sufficiently well defined to satisfy the very strict standards of 
legality set by Article 6(2) ICCPR for the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty. 
In order for the sentence of death to be imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law in 
question must be sufficiently precise to clearly allow distinction between conduct 
punishable with the capital sentence and conduct not so punishable.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Turning to the pre-trial detention of the three men, particularly Farzad Kamangar, while we 
do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, we would respectfully remind 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties 
to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the ICCPR admits 
of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to be assisted by 
a lawyer of one&#8217;s own choosing at all stages of the proceedings, to have adequate time and 
facilities to prepare one&#8217;s defence, and the right not to be compelled to confess guilt.  
</p>
<p> We also recall that paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 08/08 of 2008 urges 
States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked 
as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made&#8221;. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in 
Article 7 of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to paragraph 12 of 
General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, which &#8220;reminds all States 
that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the 
perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in 
itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person;&#8221; Prolonged incommunicado detention 
furthermore negates the above-mentioned guarantees of the right to a fair trial, such as being 
assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s defence.  
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that 
the rights under international law of Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili are 
respected. Considering the irreversible nature of capital punishment, this can only mean </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 202 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>suspension of the death sentence against the three men until the question whether the acts they 
were found guilty of satisfy international criteria for what constitutes &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; has 
been clarified, the allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this 
respect dispelled. 
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of Farzad Kamangar, 
Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili in compliance with your Government&#8217;s international legal 
obligations. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please indicate the specific conduct Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and 
Farhad Vakili have been found guilty of and the legal basis of the death sentences imposed 
against them. Please indicate how these are compatible with international norms, specifically 
with the requirement in article 6(2) of the ICCPR, to which Iran is a party, that the &#8220;sentence of 
death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law&#8221;. Your 
Government has in the case of Abdolwahed Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour provided 
information explaining the charges against them (which would tend to show that at least 
Mr. Hassanpour was not charged with an offence involving the intentional taking of life). To 
date, the query to provide the definition of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; under Iranian law, however, has 
unfortunately remained without a reply. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
Farzad Kamangar was subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. If no inquiries have taken 
place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details regarding access to legal counsel, public nature of hearings 
and judgments, the conviction and sentence, and the post-conviction proceedings in the cases of 
Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili. 
</p>
<p> 5. Is it correct that Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili will have to serve a ten year 
sentence and thereafter be executed? If so, we are concerned that this would constitute cruel, 
inhuman or degrading punishment. Please submit your Government&#8217;s views on this matter. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran dated 8 April 2009 
</b></p>
<p> Mr Farzad Kamangar, Mr. Ali Heydariyan and Mr. Farhad Vakili were charged and 
arrested for being members of the terrorist group of PEJAK, holding and carrying of 37 kg. of 
TNT, holding 2 war grenades and forging of identification cards. Their dossiers were brought 
up in Branch 30 of Tehran Court of Revolution in the presence of their defence lawyers. The </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>afore-mentioned individuals had prepared the munitions for their acts of terrorism and killing of 
innocent people. They were found as &#8220;Mohareb&#8221; and therefore sentenced to death. Pursuant to 
objection of the defence lawyers, their cases were referred to Branch 31 of the Supreme Court 
and following re-investigation of the cases, the verdict was reinstated on 9 May 2008. The issued 
verdict have been merely in connection with their terrorist activities. Any allegation on the 
judgments connection with their social activities is baseless and rejected. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Explanation of the verdict of the court and the reasons behind considering their offences 
as being &#8220;heavy&#8221; and the final death penalty: 
</p>
<p> Firstly, the PEJAK terrorist group continues to remain as a terrorist group and it has been 
carrying out, repeatedly, armed terrorist acts resulting in loss of lives. 
</p>
<p> Secondly, finding a considerable amount of explosives (37 kg/74 pounds) together with 
27 detonators (for bomb explosions) indicated the serious intention for carrying out terrorist acts 
in which the role of Mr. Kamangar is well proven in the court. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, on the basis of the national laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran and due to 
the special situation in the neighbouring countries which have occasionally resulted in 
mischievous acts and disturbance of people&#8217;s lives and security in border areas, more strict 
legislations and regulations are enforced. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Explanation on the information received in relation with terrorist acts of the  
individuals: 
</p>
<p> Mr. Kamal Gholami and RM. Ali Heydariyan were suspected by police patrol on 
19 August 2006, when they were transferring explosives to a room, rented by MR. Kamangar, 
in Sepehr building, Razi square, in Tehran. They ignored warning of the police officers and 
clashed with them; as a result of which MR. Ali Heydariyan was arrested and RM. Gholami 
escaped the scene. According to the existing information, h has been seen in northern Iraq. 
Upon the confession of Mr. Ali Heydariyan, who is one of the cadre members of the terrorist 
group of PEJAK inside the country, his collaborators, particularly Mr. Farhad Vakili and 
Mr. Farzad Kamangar were arrested, further investigation also revealed that on 19 August 2006, 
Mr. Kamangar and Mr. Gholami had transferred the explosives from the headquarter of the 
PKK terrorist group, in northern Iraq, to Tehran (by MR. Gholami&#8217;s car and later hided it in the 
house of Mr. Farhad Vakili. 
</p>
<p> Upon search of MR. Farhad Valili&#8217;s residence, on 7 November 2006, there was found 
12 kg. of TNT together with 25 detonators and 2 war grenades. In a further search of the garden 
of the house, on 6 December 2006, another 5 kg. of TNT was found it was also later disclosed 
that, on the basis of duty distribution, Mr. Ali Heydariyan was assigned as the technical element 
for provision of bombs and reconnaissance of explosion targets and Mr. Kamangar was the 
element for preparing the team house for hiding and covering of the PKK cadre embers who 
were dispatched from Iraq to Iran for carrying out explosion plans. As it was described above, 
the individuals, who received death penalty, enjoyed their right of fair trial as well as enough 
time for review and examination of their cases through legal proceedings. Any allegation on their 
torture of incommunicado detention is categorically baseless and a fabrication of lies&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes the response of the Government if Iran. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that despite repeated requests, he has not been provided with the requested 
statistics on the number of people sentenced to death and executed for the offence of adultery, 
and the breakdown of those statistics in terms of gender. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 30 July 2008</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding eight women and a man who have been sentenced to death by 
stoning for adultery: Ms. <b>Kobra Najjar, </b>Ms. <b>Iran Eskandari</b>, Ms. <b>Malek (Shamameh) 
Ghorbani</b>, Ms. <b>Zohreh Kabiri</b> and Ms. <b>Azar Kabiri</b>, Ms. <b>Ashraf Kolhari</b>, 
Ms. <b>Khaeirieh Valania</b>, Ms. <b>Leila Qomi</b>, and Mr. <b>Abdollah Farivar Moqaddam</b>. 
Ms. Kobra Najjar already was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by us on 2 October 2006. 
Mr. Abdollah Farivar Moqaddam was the subject of an urgent appeal by the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture dated 31 January 2007. Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri were the subject of an 
urgent appeal by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture dated 13 February 2008. We regret not having 
received any response to these three communications yet.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Ms. Kobra Najjar was a victim of domestic violence who was forced into prostitution by 
her husband in order to support his heroine addiction. He was murdered in 1995 by one of 
Kobra&#8217;s clients who sympathized with her plight. Ms. Najjar has already served 8 years in 
prison as an accessory to her husband&#8217;s murder. The man who murdered her husband also 
served 8 years in prison and is now free after paying <i>diyeh </i>(blood money) and undergoing 
100 lashes.  
</p>
<p>Ms. Najjar wrote to the Judicial Commission for Amnesty to ask for her sentence of 
execution by stoning to be commuted. However, her appeal for amnesty has been rejected 
and she has exhausted all domestic remedies. It is feared that her execution by stoning 
could happen any time.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 205 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Ms. Iran Eskandari was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, nine years of 
imprisonment and seventy-four lashes for aiding murder, hiding the body, and destroying 
the evidence by Branch 1 of Lali General Court in 2005. In 2006 the Supreme Court 
confirmed the death sentence which is currently being reviewed by the Pardons 
Commission.  
</p>
<p>Ms. Malek (Shamameh) Ghorbani was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery by 
Branch 12 of the Criminal Court of East Azerbaijan Province in 2006. Branch 27 of the 
Supreme Court has overruled the verdict because of irregularities in the investigation 
phase. She remains under criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri were arrested on 5 February 2007 in connection 
with allegations of illegitimate relations other than adultery. On 17 March 2007, they were 
prosecuted in court, found guilty, and sentenced to 99 lashes. This sentence was executed. 
Thereafter, both women were returned to prison and another trial took place for the same 
charges and they were sentenced to death by stoning on 5 August 2007. Branch 27 of the 
Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence in 2007. The file is now with the Head of the 
Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Ashraf Kolhari was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and fifteen years of 
imprisonment for complicity in murder by Branch 1601 of Tehran General Court. In 2003 
Branch 2 of the Supreme Court confirmed the judgment. The Pardons Commission, 
however, has returned the file to the trial court. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Khaeirieh Valania was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and eight years of 
imprisonment for complicity in murder. Her case is currently before the Head of the 
Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Leila Qomi was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and fifteen years of 
imprisonment for complicity in murder by Branch 71 of the Criminal Court of Tehran. 
Branch 37 of the Supreme Court confirmed the judgment in 2007.  
Mr. Abdollah Farivar Moqaddam was arrested on 8 February 2005 and charged with 
committing adultery. He was convicted and sentenced to death on 21 December 2005 by 
the Second Branch of the Mazandaran penal court and the sentence was confirmed by 
Bureau 41 of the Supreme Court on 1 August 2006. The file is currently with the Pardons 
Commission. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to recall 
that Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a 
party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of 
death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. In interpreting Article 6(2) of the 
Covenant, however, the Human Rights Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a 
death sentence for offences that do not result in the loss of life, finding only cases involving 
murder not to raise concerns under the most serious crimes provision. As observed in a recent 
report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 206 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with 
interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in 
cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Already in 1993, the Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/79/Add.25) 
noted in its concluding observations on your Government&#8217;s periodic report under the Covenant 
that the imposition of the death penalty for adultery is incompatible with the Covenant. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that stoning constitutes an inhuman and degrading treatment. 
In this regard, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Resolution 2005/39 of the 
Commission on Human Rights, which reminded Governments that corporal punishment can 
amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture. We would also like to 
draw your Government&#8217;s attention to the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture to the 
60th session of the General Assembly, in which, with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty 
bodies, he concluded that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States 
cannot invoke provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations 
under international law, including the prohibition of corporal punishment, and called upon States 
to abolish all forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (A/60/316, 
para.28). Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have called for 
the abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 
(1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment must 
extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for a 
crime of as an educative or disciplinary measure.  
</p>
<p> We would moreover like to recall that, as a State Party to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, your Government has undertaken to ensure equality between men and 
women in the enjoyment of all civil and political rights, including the right to life and the right 
not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. While it would 
appear that, unfortunately, the abovementioned eight women and one man do not represent all 
persons sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, the imbalance between the number of men 
and women among the reported cases raises certain questions in terms of possible discrimination 
in relation to both criminal enforcement and sentencing in adultery cases. It would be important 
to know whether the men whom the above eight women were found to have committed adultery 
with were sentenced to death as well, and, if not so, on what grounds. It would also be important 
to have gender disaggregated data on the use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p> With regard particularly to the case of Ms. Kobra Najjar we would finally like to bring to 
Your Excellency&#8217;s attention Article 4 (c &amp; d) of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the responsibility of States to exercise due 
diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of 
violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons. 
To this end, States should develop penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in domestic 
legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to women who are subjected to violence. 
 We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights under international law of Ms. Kobra Najjar, Ms. Iran Eskandari, 
Ms. Malek (Shamameh) Ghorbani, Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri, Ms. Ashraf Kolhari, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 207 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Ms. Khaeirieh Valania, Ms. Leila Qomi, and Mr. Abdollah Farivar are respected. Considering 
the irremediable nature of capital punishment and the fact that the death sentence for adultery is 
incompatible with your Government&#8217;s obligations under international law, this can only mean 
suspension of the executions and eventually commutation of the death sentences.  
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following questions: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. If Ms. Kora Najjar, Ms. Iran Eskandari, Ms. Malek (Shamameh) Ghorbani, 
Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri, Ms. Ashraf Kolhari, Ms. Khaeirieh Valania, 
Ms. Leila Qomi, and Mr. Abdollah Farivar have in fact been sentenced to death for the offence 
of adultery, how does Your Excellency&#8217;s Government consider that to be consistent with the 
applicable international legal standards? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide statistics as to the number of persons sentenced to death and the 
number executed in the past three years for the offence of adultery. In particular, indicate how 
many men and how many women were sentenced to death and executed for the offence of 
adultery. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran dated 8 April 2009  
</b></p>
<p> The Holy religion of Islam attributes great importance to the issue of safeguarding the 
security and morality of the society and particularly to the fundamental institution of family. To 
that end and for securing the cleanliness and purity of the generation (which is amongst the 
strengthening elements for survival and permanence of family and society) it has prescribed the 
very heavy punishment of &#8220;Hadde Rajm&#8221; (Prescribed Punishment of Stoning), for married (and 
unmarried) individuals, so that its deterring aspect to contribute toward realization of the 
above-mentioned sacred goal. Meanwhile one should understand that Islam has defined highly 
difficult conditions, requirements and methods for proving perpetration of this group of offences. 
(Those requirements could be searched Islamic texts of Jurisprudence). All those required 
accuracies and attention as well as the difficulties for proving commission of this group of 
offences have been meant to, extremely, minimize the rate of oversight and error. Furthermore, 
this type of offenses could be investigated or brought to trial following its approval of hurting 
public conscience (presence of a large number of witnesses). 
</p>
<p> Therefore, as it was described, although a heavy punishment is prescribed, provision f the 
required evidences, on the basis of the Jurisprudent principal of &#8220;al-hodoud tadra be-shobahaat&#8221; 
(punishment lapses or/gets aborted in presence of element of ambiguity/doubt), is very difficult 
to the same extent. Consequently, proving commission of offences deserving stoning gets 
extremely minimized. Introduction of a mechanism for prevention and discontinuation of such 
offences has been the main objective of Islamic Laws. In practical terms, one could easily 
recognize that the rate of family disloyalty Muslim societies is considerably lower than that in 
western unreligious countries. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 208 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In the view of Islamic jurisprudents, the punishment of stoning, in its nature and 
enforcement is substantially different from execution. 
</p>
<p> In consideration of all the above mentioned points, and with reference to the raised 
allegation in the communication, due investigations and legal procedure have been going on and 
according to parts of the results, the stoning punishment of Ms. Malek (Shamameh) Ghorbani, 
Ms. Azar Kabiri and Ms. Zohreh Kabiri is ruled out&#8221;.

<p><b>Islamic Republic of Iran:  Death sentences on six juvenile offenders 
Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 5 males and 1 female (minors) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 13 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding six persons allegedly at risk of execution of death sentences imposed 
for offences they committed as children: <b>Soghra Najafpoor</b> (f), <b>Behnood Shojaee</b> (m), 
<b>Mohammad Feda&#8217;i</b> (m), <b>Salah Taseb</b> (m), <b>Sa&#8217;eed Jazee</b> (m), and <b>Abu Moslem Sohrabi</b> (m). 
The case of Soghra Najafpoor has already been the subject matter of an exchange of 
communications between this mandate and your Excellency&#8217;s Government (5 November 2007 
and 12 February 2008 respectively), while a previous communication we sent regarding the case 
of Behnood Shojaee (on 27 December 2007) remained without reply. We would also like to 
draw your attention to reports regarding executions of juvenile offenders which already took 
place in Iran during the first half of this year. <b>Javad Shoja&#8217;i</b> and <b>Mohammad Hassanzadeh 
</b>were reportedly aged 16 at the time of their offence. It is possible that also <b>Hasan Mozaffari</b> and 
<b>Rahman Shahidi</b>, reportedly executed on 22 July 2008, were below age 18 at the time of the 
rape they were sentenced to death for. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Soghra Najafpour was sentenced to death as qisas (retribution) on 9 November 1990 for a 
killing which took place when she was only 13 years old. She spent most of the following 
17 years in prison. On two occasions, when she was 17 and 21, she was taken to be 
executed but the family of the victim changed their minds at the last minute. On 
1 October 2007, Soghra Najafpour was released on bail of 600 million Iranian rials. She 
returned to prison later that month to comply with a summons which followed a new </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 209 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>demand by the family of the murder victim for her execution. On 23 October 2007, 
Soghra Najafpour's lawyer petitioned the Office of the Head of the Judiciary to 
reinvestigate her case. After renewed judicial proceedings she was again found guilty and 
sentenced to death as qisas. The guardian of the victim continues to reject all attempts to 
accept blood money (diyah) instead of execution. 
</p>
<p>Behnood Shoojaee, now 20, was convicted by a court in Tehran of murdering another boy 
during a street fight when he was 17 years old. The death sentence was confirmed by the 
Supreme Court. He was scheduled to be executed on 11 June 2008, but was granted a one 
month reprieve on 10 June 2008. On or around 11 July 2008, the Head of Judiciary again 
postponed the execution to give the families more time to negotiate the payment of diyah.  
</p>
<p>Mohammad Feda&#8217;i was found guilty of murder by Branch 71 of the Tehran Criminal Court 
on 12 March 2005 and was sentenced to death as qisas. Reportedly, the judges in his case 
found Mohammad Feda&#8217;i guilty, but stated in their written verdict that he had killed in 
self-defence and that he had not been adequately represented at his trial, as his first legal 
representative was not an accredited lawyer, and two lawyers hired later had only 
submitted one written defence statement to the court during his trial. The death sentence 
against Mohammad Feda&#8217;i was upheld by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court and confirmed 
by the Head of the Judiciary. Mohammad Feda&#8217;i was due to be executed a first time on 
18 April 2007, but the execution was stayed on the basis of the inadequate legal 
representation during his trial. A subsequent request to the Attorney General for a retrial 
was rejected, and a new execution date was set for 11 June 2008. On 10 June 2008, the 
Head of Judiciary granted a one-month reprieve to give Mohammad Feda&#8217;i&#8217;s family 
additional time to negotiate with the victim&#8217;s family on the payment of diyah. On or 
around 11 July 2008, the Head of Judiciary granted a further one month stay of execution. 
In a letter made public on 7 June 2008, Mohammad Feda&#8217;i alleges that, during his 
detention before trial, official &#8220;beat and flogged him repeatedly &#8230; hanged him from the 
ceiling [and] left him with no hope of living&#8221;. As a result of that treatment, he signed (by 
way of a fingerprint) a confession statement. 
</p>
<p>Salah Taseb, from Sanandaj, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for a killing 
committed when he was aged 15. He recently turned 18 and was transferred from the 
juvenile prison to the adult prison in Sanandaj.  
Sa&#8217;eed Jazee was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for a killing committed in 
2003 when he was aged 17. His execution was scheduled for 25 June 2008 but postponed 
for a month. 
</p>
<p>Abu Moslem Sohrabi, was convicted and sentenced to death by Branch 3 of the Firoozabad 
Court in Fars Province for a killing he committed in December 2001 at the age of 17. The 
death sentence was affirmed by Supreme Court Branch 33. Reportedly local authorities in 
Fars province intend to proceed with the execution although authorities in Tehran have 
ordered a renewed investigation of the case. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 210 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We have also received reports concerning two executions of juvenile offenders which 
already took place during the first half of the year 2008: 
</p>
<p>Javad Shoja&#8217;i was executed in Esfahan on 26 February 2008. He had been sentenced to 
death as qisas for a murder committed when he was 16.  
</p>
<p>Mohammad Hassanzadeh was executed in Sanandaj prison on 10 June 2008. Reports 
indicate that at a press conference on 17 June 2008, a spokesperson for the Judiciary 
disputed that he had been under age 18 at the time of the offence. Mohammad 
Hassanzadeh&#8217;s lawyer, however, researched his identity papers and determined that on the 
day of the killing he was aged 16 years, 11 months and 20 days.  
</p>
<p>Finally, Hasan Mozaffari and Rahman Shahidi, as well as a third man identified as H.R., 
were executed in Bushehr on 22 July 2008. They had been found guilty of rape. They 
possibly were under age 18 at the time of the offence. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding these specific 
cases, we would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that any further executions of 
juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran under various instruments which we have been mandated to bring to the 
attention of Governments. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which 
Iran is a Party, expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences 
committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a Party, provides that the death penalty 
shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> We take note of the assurances by your Excellency&#8217;s Government in its letter dated 
12 February 2008 in the case of Soghra Najafpour that &#8220;the state judicial system has been trying 
for resolution of the dispute through conciliation&#8221; in the face of &#8220;the insistence of guardians of 
the murder victim for carrying out the verdict&#8221;, and that &#8220;the case is in the conciliation procedure 
and enforcement of death penalty is not in the programme of work.&#8221; Your Government also 
wrote that &#8220;although there have been a few cases of murder under the age of 18, the pertinent 
authorities have been exerting their utmost effort to decrease carrying out verdicts to a level 
close to stop, with the hope of ultimate conciliation.&#8221; To this end, &#8220;the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran strives to apply mechanisms, such as provision of financial assistance to 
the guardians, which might end in receiving the required consent from them.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> We can only reiterate, however, that &#8220;merely taking gradual measures to decrease the 
carrying out of sentences to a level &#8220;close to a stop&#8221; is an utterly inadequate approach. Inasmuch 
as laws permitting the death sentence to be imposed on juvenile offenders are inherently 
inconsistent with the international legal obligations assumed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
they should be promptly repealed.&#8221; (see the observations of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in relation to your Government&#8217;s reply to the 
communication in the case of Behnam Zare, A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, page 221).  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 211 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We have also taken note of your Government&#8217;s explanation with regard to the private 
(qisas) and public aspects of the punishment of persons found guilty of murder. Your 
Government writes that &#8220;enforcement of Qisas depends upon the request to be made by 
guardians of the murder victim; and the Government is solely delegated to carry out the verdict, 
on behalf of the former&#8221;; and that therefore the &#8220;sentence of Qisas is not open to pardon or 
amnesty by the state, in absence of consent from guardians of the murder victim.&#8221; 
(A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, page 225). 
</p>
<p> In this regard, we must stress that for the purposes of your Government&#8217;s obligation under 
international law to end the imposition of capital punishment for offences committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age, the distinction between the qisas claim of the victim&#8217;s family and 
the public interest to punish murder is immaterial. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights apply - 
and bind your Government - irrespective of this distinction in the law of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. To comply with these obligations it is insufficient to abolish the death penalty for offences 
committed by juveniles as a matter of the State&#8217;s interest in punishing murder. The abolition 
must extend to the qisas aspect. 
</p>
<p> While the imposition of the death penalty for killings committed by minors is thus in all 
cases and indisputably a blatant and serious violation of your Government&#8217;s obligations under 
international treaties it has entered into, we would further like to draw your Government&#8217;s 
attention to the general concerns the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions has expressed in a report to the General Assembly with regard to the way the qisas 
system is applied in some countries (A/61/311, paras. 55-64). We acknowledge that your 
Government is taking significant measures to address some of the concerns set forth in that 
Report: governmental financial support to victims&#8217; families can contribute to lessen the 
discrimination against poor offenders who are unable to pay the diyah, which is implicit in the 
system. Similarly, the law providing that murderers who have been pardoned by the victim&#8217;s 
guardian after paying diyah will still have to serve five to fifteen years of imprisonment (as your 
Government explained in its communication of 14 February 2008 (A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, page 
223)), would contribute to reducing the risk that wealthy offenders buy their freedom in a way 
not open to the poor. 
</p>
<p> In other respects, however, your Government&#8217;s explanation of the way Islamic law is 
applied in the Islamic Republic of Iran confirms the concerns expressed in the Report. Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government states that the &#8220;sentence of Qisas is not open to pardon or amnesty by 
the state, in absence of consent from guardians of the murder victim&#8221;. As stated in the report to 
the General Assembly, &#8220;where the private diyah pardon stands alone and when it relates to the 
death penalty, it is almost certain to lead to significant violations of the right to due process in 
situations where a pardon is not granted.&#8221; (A/61/311, para. 62). Article 6(4) of the Covenant 
provides that &#8220;[a]nyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of 
the sentence. Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all 
cases.&#8221; As a consequence, &#8220;[t]o the extent that the procedure does not provide [&#8230;] for the right 
to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence from the State authorities, the requirements of 
international law will be violated. Where the diyah pardon is available it must be 
supplemented by a separate, public system for seeking an official pardon or commutation.&#8221; 
(A/61/311, para. 62).  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 212 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Many countries with significant Islamic populations have provided for means of 
commutation additional to or in lieu of diyah. Their practice helps to illustrate that a system of 
commutation by a public official may not in practice be incompatible with Islamic law, and may 
exist alongside or in place of the private diyah pardon. (see (A/61/311, para. 63). 
</p>
<p> With regard to the cases of Hasan Mozaffari and Rahman Shahidi, who were reportedly 
sentenced to death (and executed) for rape, we would like to recall that Article 6(2) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that &#8220;in countries which have not 
abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious 
crimes&#8221;. A thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal 
United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a 
death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to 
kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). This is consistent with the 
conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in interpreting Article 6(2) of the Covenant. The 
Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a death sentence for offences that do not 
result in the loss of life, finding only cases involving murder not to raise concerns under the most 
serious crimes provision. Accordingly, when it last considered a report presented by your 
Excellency's Government, the Committee expressly stated in its concluding observations that it 
&#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in loss of life, as 
being contrary to the Covenant&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9). According to the 
information we have received, the offences for which Hasan Mozaffari and Rahman Shahidi 
have been convicted were not intended to result in any killings and did not result in loss of life. 
</p>
<p> We would respectfully reiterate our appeal to the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with accepted 
standards of international human rights law and to take steps to bring its legislation in 
compliance with Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 6 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political, to which it is a party. In particular, we urge 
your Government to expeditiously lift or commute the death sentences imposed against 
Soghra Najafpoor, Behnood Shojaee, Mohammad Feda&#8217;i, Salah Taseb, Sa&#8217;eed Jazee, and 
Abu Moslem Sohrabi, as well as all other persons awaiting executions for offences committed 
before they reached age 18. All other efforts undertaken by your Government to prevent these 
executions are insufficient to meet its obligations under international treaties it is a Party to. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters:  
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please provide all information and 
documents proving their inaccuracy. Clarification of: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The accuracy of the information regarding assistance by counsel in the case of 
Mohammed Feda&#8217;i; 
</p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The accuracy of reports that local authorities in Fars province intend to proceed 
with the execution of Abu Moslem Sohrabi although authorities in Tehran have 
ordered a renewed investigation of the case; and 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The age of Hasan Mozaffari and Rahman Shahidi at the time of the rape they were 
found guilty of are particularly important in this respect. 
</p>
<p> 2. We also recall our communications dated 5 January 2007, 31 January 2007, 
29 February 2008, 27 March 2008 and 2 May 2008 seeking confirmation of the current status of 
the Bill on Juvenile Courts. What provisions will that law, once it enters into force, contain with 
regard to capital punishment for juvenile offenders? 
</p><p> 3. Please indicate any steps your Government intends to take or has taken to comply 
with article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a 
party, that the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance 
with the law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate any steps your Government intends to take or has taken to 
supplement the system of pardons based on the payment of diyah with a separate, public system 
for seeking an official pardon or commutation, so as to comply with article 6(4) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 18 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding <b>Amir Amrollahi</b>,<b> Reza Hejazi</b> and <b>Kamal</b>, three young men 
allegedly at risk of execution for offences committed when they were minors. The case of 
Reza Hejazi was already the object of a communication to your Government by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on 27 March 2008, which 
unfortunately has remained without reply. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 214 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Amir Amrollahi fatally injured another boy in Shiraz province during a fight in 
November 2006, when he was aged 16. On 6 August 2007, Branch 5 of Fars province 
criminal court sentenced him to death. The sentence was upheld by Branch 27 of 
Supreme Court on 11 October 2007. Recently (beginning of August 2008), the Head of the 
Judiciary approved the death sentence and judicial officials in Shiraz province have been 
asked to prepare to carry out Amir Amrollahi&#8217;s execution. 
</p>
<p>Reza Hejazi fatally injured another boy in Esfahan during a fight in 2004 (on 28/6/1382, 
according to the Iranian calendar). At the time of the offence he was aged 15, as he was 
born on 30/4/1367. On 14 November 2005, he was sentenced to death as qesas (retribution) 
by Branch 106 of the Esfahan General Court. The sentence was approved by Branch 28 of 
the Supreme Court on 6 June 2006, although under Iranian law he should have been tried 
in a juvenile court. The case was referred for mediation between Reza Hejazi and the 
victim's family, to try and arrange for the payment of diyeh, but it would appear that the 
negotiations have yielded no result. His execution was scheduled for this morning 
(19 August 2008), but appears to have been postponed.  
</p>
<p>Kamal (further names not reported), a then sixteen years old barber&#8217;s assistant in Tehran, 
killed a man in the course of a fight on 10 April 2007. He was found guilty of murder and 
sentenced to death by a court in Tehran on 12 April 2008. The death sentence was 
approved by the Supreme Court at the beginning of August 2008, and the case is now 
before the Head of the Judiciary for final approval of the death sentence.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding these specific 
cases, we would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that any further executions of 
juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran under various instruments which we have been mandated to bring to the 
attention of Governments. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which 
Iran is a Party, expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences 
committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a Party, provides that the death penalty 
shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> We would further like to reiterate that: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Merely taking gradual measures to decrease the carrying out of death sentences against 
offenders who were juveniles is an utterly inadequate approach to complying with your 
Government&#8217;s obligations under international law, which can only be fulfilled by 
immediately stopping all executions for crimes committed by persons who were not 
aged 18 at the time of the offence. Laws permitting the death sentence to be imposed on 
juvenile offenders are inherently inconsistent with the international legal obligations 
assumed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and should be promptly repealed. </p>

years of age, the distinction between the qisas claim of the victim&#8217;s family and the

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 19 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning <b>Mahdi Hanafi</b>, student, Gohardasht, Karaj. 
 According to the allegations received: 
</p>
<p>On 4 April 2007 around 2 p.m., he was arrested on his way to a party and taken by police 
to No. 17 Mehrvilla Police Station. His family was not informed of his arrest, and he was 
allegedly beaten during his detention by a police officer (whose name is on record with us). 
At 5 p.m., he was taken to the Prosecutor, who ordered his release at 7.30 p.m. He was 
again taken to the police station, told that the keys to his handcuffs and shackles were left 
there. After he returned home he reportedly felt dizzy and went to bed. Mr. Hanafi's family 
was unable to rouse him in the morning and he was taken to the hospital, where the doctor 
reported that he had suffered injuries to his brain. After 13 days, he was transferred to 
Shahid Madani Hospital. The doctors there confirmed the diagnosis. Mr. Hanafi died two 
months later without regaining consciousness. 
</p>
<p>The Prosecutor of No. 31 Police Station came and photographed the body. However, no 
further action or investigations were carried out. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to draw 
your Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to 
this case. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that &#8220;[n]o 
one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When 
the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries 
sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 217 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from 
injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all 
suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where 
complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above 
circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human 
Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have 
&#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> We understand that Mr. Hanafi was taken to hospital and diagnosed and that the competent 
prosecutor took the first steps of an investigation. We urge your Government to complete the 
inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Hanafi expeditiously, impartially 
and transparently, also with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action 
and ensuring accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations, as well as to 
compensate Mr. Hanafi&#8217;s family.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your

</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation 
to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken 
against any police officers responsible for Mr. Hanafi&#8217;s death. Have disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on them? 
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to Mr. Hanafi&#8217;s family. </p>

</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Bahman Soleimani was born in 1981. He killed his grandmother, allegedly 
unintentionally, 12 years ago when he was 15. He was initially sentenced to 5 years

the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 17 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I would like to draw the attention of your Government to recent information I have 
received regarding two young men sentenced to death for offences they committed as minors, 
Mr. <b>Abbas Hosseini</b>, an Afghani refugee, and Mr. <b>Rahim Ahmadi</b>.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Abbas Hosseini was sentenced to death on 3 June 2004 by verdict No.13/277 of Branch 43 
of the Mashhad Special Court for a killing committed in July 2003, when he was 17 years 
old. The sentence was upheld by Branch 41 of the Supreme Court on 28 October 2004 and 
subsequently by the Head of the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic or Iran.  
</p>
<p>I addressed an urgent appeal to your Government on 21 April 2005, when 
Abbas Hosseini&#8217;s execution was reportedly scheduled for 1 May 2005 (regrettably, your 
Government never answered that communication). Abbas Hosseini was not executed on 
1 May, apparently to give the family of the perpetrator another chance to convince the 
family of the victim to accept payment of compensation (diyeh) in return for the 
commutation of the death sentence. On 7 May 2005, the Head of the Judiciary reportedly 
ordered the judiciary in Mashhad not to proceed with the execution while the file was 
being reviewed by the central Judiciary in Tehran. More than three years later, the 
negotiations between the two families appear to have come to a dead end, with the family 
of the victim refusing to accept payment of compensation (diyeh) and insisting on the 
death sentence being carried out. On 5 August 2008, the Juvenile Court in Mashhad 
allegedly confirmed the death verdict (No. 8709975115800339). 
</p>
<p>Rahim Ahmadi, now aged 20, is convicted of a killing he committed when he was 15 years 
old. His death sentence has been confirmed by the Supreme Court. The Head of the 
Judiciary has sent the execution order to Adelabad prison in Shiraz, where Rahim Ahmadi 
is detained. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding these specific 
cases, I would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that any further executions of 
juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran under various instruments which I have been mandated to bring to the attention 
of Governments. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Iran is a 
Party expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by 
persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a Party provides that the death penalty shall not be 
imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> I appreciate that your Excellency&#8217;s Government appears to have taken steps to avoid the 
execution of the death sentence in the case of Abbas Hosseini, by asking the courts to review the 
case and by repeatedly postponing the execution in order to provide additional time for 
agreement between the families on payment of compensation. I can only reiterate, however, that 
the obligations your Government has entered into under the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are not fulfilled by such 
efforts. International law requires that the Islamic Republic of Iran abolish the death sentence for 
all offences committed by persons under the age of 18 at the time of the crime, and that all death 
sentences already imposed be vacated or commuted. 
</p>
<p> I would further like to reiterate that: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; For the purposes of your Government&#8217;s obligation under international law to end the 
imposition of capital punishment for offences committed by persons below eighteen 
years of age, the distinction between the qisas claim of the victim&#8217;s family and the 
public interest to punish murder is immaterial. International law bans the imposition of 
the death penalty for offences committed by children in both cases. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; International law, in particular Article 6(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, guarantees the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence 
from the State authorities. Where the diyah pardon is available, it must be supplemented 
by a separate, public system for seeking an official pardon or commutation. 
</p>
<p> I have set forth the arguments underlying these rules of international law on a number of 
occasions, most recently in my communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 
13 August 2008 regarding the cases of juvenile offenders Soghra Najafpoor, Behnood Shojaee, 
Mohammad Feda&#8217;i and seven others, to which I would like to refer. 
</p>
<p> To conclude, I would respectfully reiterate my appeal to the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with 
accepted standards of international human rights law and to take steps to bring its legislation in 
compliance with Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 6 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political, to which it is a party. In particular, I urge your 
Government to expeditiously lift or commute the death sentences imposed against 
Abbas Hosseini and Rahim Ahmadi, as well as all other persons awaiting executions for offences 
committed before they reached age 18. As already stated above, all other efforts undertaken by 
your Government to prevent these executions are insufficient to meet its obligations under 
international treaties it is a Party to. </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 26 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to draw the attention of your Government to recent information we have 
received regarding a young man sentenced to death for an offence committed as a minor, 
Mr. <b>Mahyar Haghgoo</b>, his mother, Ms. <b>Maryam</b>, and another woman sentenced to death, 
known as &#8220;<b>Zahra</b>&#8221;. They might be at imminent risk of execution. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>In 2004, Mahyar Haghgoo, at the time aged 17, killed his father, who was allegedly 
addicted to alcohol and beating his wife Maryam (Mahyar Haghgoo&#8217;s mother). The court 
in Rasht found Mahyar Haghgoo guilty of murder, convicted also his mother Maryam as 
an accomplice in the murder, and sentenced both to death. This death sentence was 
recently confirmed by the Supreme Court. It is not clear whether the Head of the Judiciary 
has already confirmed the death sentences. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 223 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 30 November 2001, a woman known as &#8220;Zahra&#8221; (full name not known) killed her 
husband. Zahra is reported to have confessed to killing her husband and to have stated that 
her husband often drank large quantities of alcohol, struck her when she disagreed with 
him, and sexually abused her. Branch 1601 Penal court in Tehran sentenced her to death as 
qesas (retribution). This sentence was subsequently confirmed by Branch 34 of the 
Supreme Court in Tehran. On 14 September 2008, the death sentence was sent to the 
Office for Implementation of Sentences in Tehran. The family of the victim has requested 
the execution of the death sentence to take place as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding these specific 
cases, we would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that any further executions of 
juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran under various instruments which we have been mandated to bring to the 
attention of Governments. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which 
Iran is a Party expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences 
committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a Party provides that the death penalty 
shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> We would further like to reiterate that merely taking gradual measures to decrease the 
carrying out of death sentences against offenders who were juveniles is an utterly inadequate 
approach to complying with your Government&#8217;s obligations under international law, which can 
only be fulfilled by immediately stopping all executions for crimes committed by persons who 
were not aged 18 at the time of the offence. Laws permitting the death sentence to be imposed on 
juvenile offenders are inherently inconsistent with the international legal obligations assumed by 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and should be promptly repealed. 
</p>
<p> With regard to Ms. Maryam and to &#8220;Zahra&#8221;, we would like to recall that, although the 
death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be applied in the most restrictive 
manner. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is 
a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of 
death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. This means on the one hand, that 
offences which do not involve intentional killing may not be punished with the death penalty (in 
this respect, we refer to the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions to the General assembly, A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). It also means, on the other 
hand, that also with regard to offences involving intentional killing, the personal circumstances 
of each case - particularly potential mitigating circumstances - must be taken into account. We 
would submit that in most countries, the situation of a woman subjected to repeated severe 
ill-treatment by her husband would be considered as a possibly mitigating circumstance. 
</p>
<p> We would further like to stress that, both for the purposes of your Government&#8217;s obligation 
to end the imposition of capital punishment for offences committed by persons below eighteen 
years of age and of the requirement that the death penalty be imposed only for the &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221;, the distinction between the qisas claim of the victim&#8217;s family and the public interest to 
punish murder is immaterial. International law bans the imposition of the death penalty for 
offences committed by children in both cases. International law also bans the imposition of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 224 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>death penalty for killings which were not intentional, or which took place under circumstances 
that amount to weighty mitigating factors, whether or not a qisas claim of the victim&#8217;s family 
accrues under the domestic law of a State. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, it is particularly important to stress that Article 6(4) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a Party, guarantees the right to seek 
pardon or commutation of the sentence from the State authorities. Where the diyah pardon is 
available, it must be supplemented by a separate, public system for seeking an official pardon or 
commutation. Under international law binding Iran, the insistence of the victim&#8217;s family on 
execution cannot relieve the Government from its obligation to provide an avenue for the 
convicted killer to seek pardon or commutation from the authorities.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has set forth the 
arguments underlying these rules of international law on a number of occasions, most recently in 
the communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 13 August 2008 regarding the cases of 
juvenile offenders Soghra Najafpoor, Behnood Shojaee, Mohammad Feda&#8217;i and seven others, to 
which we would like to refer. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the cases of Ms. Maryam and &#8220;Zahra&#8221;, we would further like to bring to the 
attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government Article 4 (c &amp; d) of the United Nations Declaration 
on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the responsibility of States to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish 
acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private 
persons. To this end, States should develop penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in 
domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to women who are subjected to 
violence. 
</p>
<p> To conclude, we would respectfully reiterate the appeals of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
to take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with accepted standards 
of international human rights law and to take steps to bring its legislation in compliance with 
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 6 of the International

domestic violence at the hands of their husbands (the murder victims) was considered by the trial

</b></p>
<p> I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received 
regarding the execution, in August 2008, of two juvenile offenders whose situation I had 
previously raised in communications to your Government. In this respect, I would also like to 
seek clarification of reports regarding recent announcements made by a high ranking official of 
your Government concerning the execution of juvenile offenders. 
</p>
<p><b>Reza Hejazi</b> killed another boy in Esfahan during a fight in 2004. At the time he was 
reportedly aged 15. On 14 November 2005, he was sentenced to death as qesas 
(retribution) by Branch 106 of the Esfahan General Court. The sentence was approved by 
Branch 28 of the Supreme Court on 6 June 2006. The case was referred for mediation 
between Reza Hejazi and the victim's family, to try and arrange for the payment of diyeh, 
but the negotiations yielded no result.  
</p>
<p>Reza Hejazi&#8217;s lawyer reportedly learned that the execution might be imminent in the 
evening of 18 August 2008. According to one source he was informed by the father (who 
had been informed that same day), according to another by a journalist. In any event, the 
lawyer was not notified 48 hours prior to the execution, as required by Iranian law. The 
lawyer immediately left Tehran for Esfahan and arrived at the prison before the scheduled 
execution at 4 a.m. However, prison authorities reportedly did not permit him to see his 
client, and he left the prison at 10 a.m. after prison officials assured him that the execution 
had been stayed. In spite of these assurances, Reza Hejazi was in fact executed at 11 a.m. 
on 19 August 2008. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 226 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>I sent a first urgent appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government in the case of Reza Hejazi on 
27 March 2008. No reply was received. I again sent an urgent appeal on 18 August 2008, 
the day before the execution. Again, I did not receive a reply.  
</p>
<p><b>Behnam Zare</b> killed a man on 21 April 2005 when he was aged 16, according to your 
Government&#8217;s communication to me dated 14 February 2008. In that communication, your 
Government also indicated that &#8220;the judicial system, on the basis of human considerations, 
has entered the case into conciliation process and is seriously following the case with the 
hope for final settlement.&#8221; Your Government assured me that &#8220;therefore, carrying out the 
penalty is not in the programme of work.&#8221; Behnam Zare was reportedly executed in Shiraz 
on 26 August 2008. 
</p>
<p>Reports indicate that these were two of at least six executions of juvenile offenders carried 
out by your Government in 2008. <b>Javad Shoja&#8217;i</b> was reportedly executed in Esfahan on 
26 February 2008. He had been sentenced to death as <i>qesas </i>for a murder committed when 
he was 16. <b>Mohammad Hassanzadeh</b> was allegedly sentenced to death for a killing 
committed when he was aged 16 years, 11 months and 20 days, and was executed in 
Sanandaj prison on 10 June 2008. <b>Hasan Mozaffari</b> and <b>Rahman Shahidi</b>, who were 
reportedly executed in Bushehr on 22 July 2008, had allegedly been found guilty of rape 
and possibly were under age 18 at the time of the offence. I drew your Government&#8217;s 
attention to these cases in a communication of 13 August 2008, which regrettably has 
remained without a reply. 
</p>
<p> Recently, I received reports that on 15 October 2008 the Deputy Attorney General of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Mr. Hossein Zabhi, had stated that a new decree had been issued to the 
effect that death sentences imposed against juvenile offenders would be commuted to prison 
terms. Subsequently, however, the Deputy Attorney General explained that this decree did not 
apply to juvenile offenders sentenced to death as qesas on murder charges, but only for juvenile 
offenders convicted of offences such as drugs trafficking. Reports also indicated that this decree 
is not binding for judges. 
 While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to draw your 
attention once again to the fact that any further executions of juvenile offenders would be 
incompatible with the international legal obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under 
various instruments which I have been mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. 
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Iran is a Party expressly 
provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below 
eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights to which Iran is a Party provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for 
crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> I can only reiterate that &#8220;merely taking gradual measures to decrease the carrying out of 
sentences to a level &#8220;close to a stop&#8221; is an utterly inadequate approach. Inasmuch as laws 
permitting the death sentence to be imposed on juvenile offenders are inherently inconsistent 
with the international legal obligations assumed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, they should be 
promptly repealed.&#8221; (see my observations in relation to your Government&#8217;s reply to the 
communication in the case of Behnam Zare, A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, page 221).  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 227 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> I have also taken note of your Government&#8217;s explanation with regard to the private (<i>qesas</i>) 
and public aspects of the punishment of persons found guilty of murder. Your Government 
writes that &#8220;enforcement of Qesas depends upon the request to be made by guardians of the 
murder victim; and the Government is solely delegated to carry out the verdict, on behalf of the 
former&#8221;; and that therefore the &#8220;sentence of Qesas is not open to pardon or amnesty by the state, 
in absence of consent from guardians of the murder victim.&#8221; (A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, page 225). 
</p>
<p> In this regard, I must stress that for the purposes of your Government&#8217;s obligation under 
international law to end the imposition of capital punishment for offences committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age, the distinction between the <i>qesas</i> claim of the victim&#8217;s family and 
the public interest to punish murder is immaterial. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights apply - 
and bind your Government - irrespective of this distinction in the law of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. To comply with these obligations it is insufficient to abolish the death penalty for offences 
committed by juveniles as a matter of the State&#8217;s interest in punishing murder. The abolition 
must extend to the <i>qesas </i>aspect. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, I would note that your Government&#8217;s explanation that the &#8220;sentence of Qesas 
is not open to pardon or amnesty by the state, in absence of consent from guardians of the 
murder victim&#8221; is difficult to reconcile with Article 6(4) of the Covenant. This provision reads 
&#8220;anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence. 
Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all cases.&#8221; The right 
to seek pardon or commutation cannot be made dependant on the consent of the victim&#8217;s family, 
as the provision that &#8220;pardon or commutation &#8230; may be granted in all cases&#8221; makes clear. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the reported announcement by the Deputy Attorney General that juvenile 
offenders convicted of drugs trafficking would no longer be sentenced to death, I would like to 
recall that Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that 
&#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. The Human Rights Committee has consistently 
rejected the imposition of a death sentence for offences that do not result in the loss of life, 
including drugs trafficking. When the Human Rights Committee last considered a report 
presented by your Excellency's Government, it expressly stated in its concluding observations 
that it &#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in loss of 
life, as being contrary to the Covenant&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9). To sum up, your 
Government is obliged under international law to stop imposing the death sentence and 
executions for drug trafficking offences - as well as for rape - not only when the offender was a 
minor at the time of the crime, but also where he is an adult. 
</p>
<p> I reiterate my appeal to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to take all 
necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with accepted standards of 
international human rights law and to take steps to bring its legislation in compliance with 
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political, to which it is a party.  </p>

Reza Alinejad reportedly killed a man in a fight. He was sentenced to death as qisas (retribution). 
The Supreme Court quashed the judgment on the grounds that the trial court had not sufficiently 
considered the question whether the killing had occurred in self defence, but in the re-trial 
Reza Alinejad was again sentenced to death as qisas. A few days ago, Reza Alinejad and his 
family were reportedly granted one month to raise the one billion Iranian rials demanded by the 
victim&#8217;s family as blood money.  
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding this specific case, 
I would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that any executions of juvenile 
offenders would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran under various instruments which we have been mandated to bring to the attention of 
Governments. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Iran is a 
Party, expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed 
by persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a Party, provides that the death penalty shall not be 
imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> I would further like to reiterate that: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Merely taking gradual measures to decrease the carrying out of death sentences against 
offenders who were juveniles is an utterly inadequate approach to complying with your 
Government&#8217;s obligations under international law, which can only be fulfilled by 
immediately stopping all executions for crimes committed by persons who were not 
aged 18 at the time of the offence. Laws permitting the death sentence to be imposed on 
juvenile offenders are inherently inconsistent with the international legal obligations 
assumed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and should be promptly repealed. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; For the purposes of your Government&#8217;s obligation under international law to end the 
imposition of capital punishment for offences committed by persons below eighteen 
years of age, the distinction between the qisas claim of the victim&#8217;s family and the 
public interest to punish murder is immaterial. International law bans the imposition of 
the death penalty for offences committed by children in both cases. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; International law, in particular Article 6(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, guarantees the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence 
from the State authorities. Where the diyah pardon is available, it must be supplemented 
by a separate, public system for seeking an official pardon or commutation. 
</p>
<p> I would therefore again urge your Government to expeditiously lift or commute the death 
sentence imposed against Reza Alinejad. </p>

<p><b>Islamic Republic of Iran:  Death sentences on charges of adultery 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 9 females; 3 males 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 21 January 2009</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to information we have received regarding several cases of persons sentenced to death by stoning 
on charges of adultery.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 26 December 2008, Mr. <b>Houshang Khodadadeh</b> <b>and another man whose name has 
not been reported to us</b> were executed by stoning in Mashhad. These executions were 
confirmed on 13 January 2009 by Mr. Ali Reza Jamshidi, spokesman of the judiciary. A 
third man, identified as a citizen of Afghanistan named Mahmoud Gh., reportedly managed 
to free himself of the pit where he was to be stoned. He is again in custody. 
</p>
<p>Ms. <b>Gilan Mohammadi</b> and Mr. <b>Gholamali Eskandari</b> were arrested, possibly in 2003, 
on charges of adultery. In 2005 or 2006, they were tried and sentenced to death by stoning. 
The death sentences were possibly confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008.  
</p>
<p>On 14 January 2009, two lawyers, Mr. Mohammad Mostafaie and Ms. Shadi Sadr, 
travelled to Esfahan Central Prison, where Ms. Gilan Mohammadi and 
Mr. Gholamali Eskandari are detained, to offer their services as lawyers. The prison 
authorities denied the two lawyers access to the detainees. Mr. Mostafaie and 
Ms. Sadr appealed to the judicial authorities in Esfahan, which ruled that the lawyers could 
contact the two convicts only if the detainees first asked to meet with lawyers.  
</p>
<p>The cases of Ms. <b>Zohreh Kabiri</b> and Ms. <b>Azar Kabiri</b> were the subject of two urgent 
appeals dated 13 February 2008 and 30 July 2008, to which we have not received any 
response from your Excellency&#8217;s Government. As stated in our previous communications, 
Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri were arrested on 5 February 2007 in connection 
with allegations of illegitimate relations other than adultery. On 17 March 2007, they were </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 231 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>prosecuted in court, found guilty, and sentenced to 99 lashes. This sentence was executed. 
Thereafter, both women were returned to prison and another trial took place for the same 
charges and they were sentenced to death by stoning on 5 August 2007. Branch 27 of the 
Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence in 2007.  
</p>
<p>According to information received since then, the Head of the Judiciary subsequently 
quashed the death sentence imposed against Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri and 
sent their case back to Branch 77 of the General Court in Karaj. This court reportedly again 
imposed the death sentence by stoning and, in the first half of January 2009, Branch 27 of 
the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence.  
</p>
<p>The charges against Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri are primarily based, as 
evidence, on video footage from a camera Zohreh Kabiri&#8217;s husband allegedly had secretly 
installed in his house, which allegedly shows the two women with another man. It would 
appear that the lawyer defending the two women has never been able to view the video 
footage which was used as evidence by the court.  
</p>
<p>In our communication of 30 July 2008, we further brought to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government&#8217;s attention reports we had received regarding the following other persons 
allegedly sentenced to death by stoning on charges of adultery: Ms. <b>Kobra Najjar</b>, 
Ms. <b>Iran Eskandari</b>, Ms. <b>Malek (Shamameh) Ghorbani</b>, Ms. <b>Ashraf</b> <b>Kolhari</b>, 
Ms. <b>Khaeirieh Valania</b>, Ms. <b>Leila Qomi</b>, and Mr. <b>Abdollah Farivar Moqaddam</b>. 
Regrettably, we have not received a reply from your Excellency&#8217;s Government on these 
cases. 
</p>
<p>Reportedly, in 2002, the Head of the Judiciary issued a directive purporting to introduce a 
moratorium on executions by stoning. However, it is reported that at least four men and 
one woman have been stoned to death since 2002, including the two men stoned to death in 
Mashhad on 26 December 2008. On 13 January 2009, the spokesman of the judiciary, 
Mr. Ali Reza Jamshidi, reportedly stated that the directive on the moratorium had no legal 
weight and judges were therefore free to ignore it. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to recall 
that the imposition of the death sentence by stoning and its execution in any case violate the 
obligations your Excellency&#8217;s Government has entered into under the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p> Article 6(2) of Covenant provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. As observed 
in a recent report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with 
interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in 
cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Already in 1993, the Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/79/Add.25) 
noted in its concluding observations on your Government&#8217;s periodic report under the Covenant 
that the imposition of the death penalty for adultery is incompatible with the Covenant. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 232 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that stoning constitutes an inhuman and degrading treatment. 
In this regard, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Resolution 2005/39 of the 
Commission on Human Rights, which reminded Governments that corporal punishment can 
amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture. We would also like to 
draw your Government&#8217;s attention to the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture to the 
60th session of the General Assembly, in which, with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty 
bodies, he concluded that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States 
cannot invoke provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations 
under international law, including the prohibition of corporal punishment, and called upon States 
to abolish all forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (A/60/316, 
para.28). Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have called for 
the abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 
(1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment must 
extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for a 
crime of as an educative or disciplinary measure.  
</p>
<p> With specific regard to the cases of Ms. Gilan Mohammadi and Mr. Gholamali Eskandari 
and the cases of Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri, we also remind your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government that in capital punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe 
rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the Covenant admits of no 
exception. The Human Rights Committee has observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving capital 
punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages 
of the proceedings&#8221; (General Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). The restrictions 
allegedly placed by the prison and judicial authorities in Esfahan on access by lawyers to 
Ms. Gilan Mohammadi and Mr. Gholamali Eskandari raise serious concerns in this respect.  
</p>
<p> Article 14(3) of the Covenant also guarantees the right to &#8220;adequate facilities&#8221; for the 
preparation of one&#8217;s defence. &#8220;Adequate facilities&#8221; include access by the accused and their 
defence lawyers to all evidence used against the accused as well as to all potentially exculpatory 
evidence (General Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 33). This fundamental guarantee 
would be violated if it was true that the defence lawyer in the case of Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and 
Ms. Azar Kabiri was denied access to the video on which the charges against them appear to be 
based. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to suspend all executions by stoning and lift or 
commute all death sentences imposed for adultery.  
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following questions, which reiterate those asked in our communication of 30 July 2008: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. If Ms. Kora Najjar, Ms. Iran Eskandari, Ms. Malek (Shamameh) Ghorbani,

many men and how many women were sentenced to death and executed for the offence of

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 17 November 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief and the Independent Expert on minority issues<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning the <b>recent increase of the number of targeted attacks against 
members of the Christian minority in the city of Mosul</b>.  
</p>
<p>According to the allegations: 
</p>
<p>On 7 October 2008, members of the Christian minority living in east Mosul, namely 
Mr. Amjad Hadi Putres and his son Hussam, Mr. Zeyad Kamal, as well as a pharmacist&#8217;s 
assistant in al-Tahrir neighbourhood, were killed. On 8 October 2008, Mr. Hazim Toma 
was killed when unknown gunmen shot at him in Bab Ul Sarai market, in west Mosul. On 
11 October 2008, two people were killed after the perpetrator had requested to see the 
victims&#8217; identity cards, which state the religious affiliation of the bearer. On 
12 October 2008, three vacated Christian homes with furniture and belongings still inside 
were firebombed in al-Sukr neighbourhood of Mosul. Since late September, the total 
number of Christians killed is estimated at twenty and more than 200 Christian families 
have reportedly fled certain neighborhoods of Mosul to find shelter with host families. The 
main destination of these internally displaced persons would be in the al-Hamdaniya and 
Tilkaif districts (southeast and north of Mosul).  
</p>
<p>In addition to the above, in early October, some members of the Christian community were 
threatened in anonymous leaflets to either convert to Islam, pay a &#8220;tribute&#8221; or be killed. 
11 October was specified as the deadline to comply.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
appeal to Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, the security of 
members of the Christian minority. In this respect we would like to recall the relevant human 
rights standards. Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 6 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide that every individual has the right to 
life and security, that this right shall be protected by law and that no-one shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life. Although State authorities might not be directly responsible for the 
above-mentioned killings, your Excellency&#8217;s Government has a due diligence obligation to 
protect the lives of all persons within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction from attacks by 
other persons within its territory (Jim&#233;nez Vaca v.s. Colombia, United Nations Human Rights 
Committee, 25 March 2002, paragraph 7.3). We would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s 
attention the duty to thoroughly, promptly and impartially investigate killings, and to prosecute 
and punish all violations of the right to life. As reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human 
Rights in Resolution 2005/34, all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and 
impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221;, and &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible&#8221;.  
 In addition, we call upon your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure the right to freedom of 
religion or belief of all individuals within Iraq&#8217;s territory and subject to its jurisdiction in

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iraq is a State party, as well as with the 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. 
</p>
<p> While State authorities might not be directly responsible for the allegations of violations 
above, we would like to stress that according to article 4 of the Declaration on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief, all States shall take 
effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in 
the recognition, exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields 
of civil, economic, political, social and cultural life. Similarly, we would like to recall your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that Human Rights Council resolution 6/37 urges States to take all 
necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international human rights standards, to 
combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by 
intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to hostility and violence, with 
particular regard to religious minorities.  
</p>
<p> We equally recall your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the provisions of the Declaration on 
the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, and 
article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights relating to the rights of 
persons belonging to minorities to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own 
religion, or to use their own language, and to enjoy all their human rights and fundamental 
freedoms without discrimination.  
</p>
<p> We also would like to recall that in paragraph 3 of its general comment No. 22 (1993), the 
Human Rights Committee underlined that no one can be compelled to reveal his thoughts or 
adherence to a religion or belief. As stated by the Special Rapporteur on freedom or religion or 
belief in her report (see A/63/161, paragraph 77), indicating a person&#8217;s religious affiliation on 
official documents carries a serious risk of abuse or subsequent discrimination based on religion 
or belief, which has to be weighed against the possible reasons for disclosing the holder&#8217;s 
religion. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged on behalf of the alleged victims of the incidents 
mentioned above? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details and where available, the results, of any judicial 
investigation, or any criminal charges and other inquiries carried out in relation to the killings of 
members of the Christian minority in Mosul and other targeted attacks against them.  
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate the reasons for which the Government of Iraq has decided to include 
the religious affiliation of the bearer on identity cards?  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 5. What measures are being taken by the authorities to protect members of the Christian 
minority against targeted attacks? What steps are being taken for the safe return to their homes of 
the people who have fled the city of Mosul? 
</p>
<p> In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, 
we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of members of the Christian minority are respected and accountability of any person 
guilty of the alleged violations ensured. We also request that your Government adopts effective 
measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. 
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by Your Excellency&#8217;s Government in this matter, in compliance with the above 
international instruments.

<p><b>Iraq:  Imminent executions of Majeed Ibrahim Hamo and Saeed Khalil 
Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 2 males 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 23 December 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding two persons, <b>Majeed Ibrahim Hamo</b> and <b>Saeed Khalil</b>, both of 
whom we understand to be at imminent risk of execution. 
</p>
<p>According to information received Mr. Hamo and Mr. Khalil were sentenced to death in 
May 2007 by a criminal court in Dohuk, for the murder of two people in March 2006. In 
January 2008 the Cassation Court in Dohuk upheld the sentences and sent them to be 
ratified by President of the Kurdistan Regional Government Mas&#8217;ud Barzani.  
</p>
<p>After his arrest in 2006, Majeed Ibrahim Hamo is reported to have been subjected to 
torture by <i>Asayish</i> (Security) personnel as a result of which he sustained a broken shoulder 
and was burnt all over his body with cigarettes. The allegations of torture were raised by 
his lawyer during the trial. The doctor who carried out a medical examination on him two 
to three months after his arrest wrote a letter to the court stating that the results of the 
examination were inconclusive. 
</p>
<p>Concern has been expressed that confessions to the murder charges may have been made 
under torture.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 240 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> International law does not prohibit the death penalty, but it mandates that it must be 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted 
in the most restrictive manner. Capital punishment cases must thoroughly respect all due process 
guarantees and the rule of law with a sentence being pronounced only following a regular 
judicial process. Relevant to the case at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the right not to be 
compelled to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to reiterate my concerns raised with your Excellency&#8217;s Government in 
a previous communication dated 21 May 2007, in another case, in relation to general concerns 
with regards to the right to a fair trial in capital punishment cases. As we have received no 
response from your Excellency&#8217;s Government we have no reason to conclude that these concerns 
are no longer valid. We do not have any detailed accounts of the procedures followed in relation 
to the trials of these two individuals. Our understanding, however, is that they did not differ in 
any significant respect from those generally followed in the relevant courts. Based on what we 
consider to be reliable reports on the pre-trial and trial procedures currently followed before the 
Central Criminal Court of Iraq and other criminal courts of Iraq as well as appeals before the 
Court of Cassation, we are very concerned that the various fair trial standards required, 
especially in relation to capital offences, have not been met.  
</p>
<p> (1) It is reported that the authorities routinely fail to promptly advise detainees of the 
reasons for their arrest and subsequently of the details of the charges and evidence against them, 
thus violating the requirements of Article 9(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. (&#8220;the ICCPR&#8221;). 
</p>
<p> (2) The authorities routinely fail to bring defendants promptly before an investigative 
judge within 24 hours of arrest as required by Article 123 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
thus raising concerns as to compliance with Article 9(3) of the ICCPR. It is investigating judges 
who are required to carry out initial investigations into offences, although in practice it is 
reported that many defendants charged with capital offences confess while at police stations 
under the control of the Ministry of Interior. It is also reported that police frequently escort the 
accused to their first interrogation before an investigating judge. Confessions made before 
investigating judges are often given substantial weight at trials and confessions obtained under 
coercion are not specifically prohibited by the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p> (3) Defendants are frequently denied the right to an adequate defence. They are denied 
access to evidence against them, as well as to their counsel within a reasonable period of time 
that would enable them to mount an effective defense. These procedural defects amount to a 
violation of Article 14(3)(b) of the ICCPR. In practice there is a lack of adequate access to 
court-appointed counsel prior to the initial investigative hearing and subsequently. The vast 
majority of defendants are represented by counsel appointed by the court, whom they have never 
met and who have little or no knowledge of the charges or evidence against their clients. Access 
to defense counsel is routinely denied during the first sixty days of detention, and subsequently 
access to privately employed defence counsel is not facilitated, notwithstanding Article 123 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides for the right to be represented by legal counsel 
when being questioned during the pre-trial period. In a great many cases the system allocating 
court appointed counsel works against defendants, since they are not represented by the same 
counsel at the investigative or trial stage, eroding further their chances of securing an effective 
defense.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 241 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> (4) Trial proceedings are usually brief, with sessions often lasting no more than fifteen to 
thirty minutes, during which the entire trial is concluded. Deliberations also typically do not last 
more than several minutes for each trial, including in complex cases involving serious crimes 
resulting in sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty. It is not possible, in relation to 
complex cases, and especially instances in which the death penalty is a consideration, to dispose 
of the proceedings in such summary fashion without violating Article 14(1) ICCPR providing 
&#8220;Everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent, impartial 
tribunal established by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We also recall that paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 08/08 of 2008 urges 
States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked 
as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made&#8221;. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in 
Article 7 of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p> Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
permitted under international law from a summary execution, which violates human rights 
standards. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure 
that the rights under international law of Majeed Ibrahim Hamo and Saeed Khalil are fully 
respected. Unless your Excellency&#8217;s Government is able to demonstrate respect for these 
essential procedural and substantive protections, which flow from the international obligations 
accepted by Iraq, in the cases involving Majeed Ibrahim Hamo and Saeed Khalil, the death 
sentences imposed must be commuted. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details regarding the four issues raised above in relation to 
procedural guarantees afforded in criminal proceedings and more specifically in the trials of 
Majeed Ibrahim Hamo and Saeed Khalil? 
 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
after his arrest in 2006, Majeed Ibrahim Hamo was subjected to torture by <i>Asayish</i> (Security) 
personnel. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why. What steps did the court take in response to the allegations of torture raised by 
Majeed Ibrahim Hamo&#8217;s lawyer during the trial? </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 12 March 2009</b>, sent with<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning the death of Mr <b>Bashir Muzhar Adbullah Al Joorani</b>. 
</p>
<p>According to the allegations received: 
</p>
<p>Mr Bashir Muzhar Adbullah Al Joorani, aged 34, was a teacher living in Baaqouba, Diyala 
province, and a leader of the &#8220;Sahwa&#8221; (&#8220;Awakening Councils&#8221;) movement in that city.  
</p>
<p>In the afternoon of 21 November 2008, a group of police agents from the Jadidat Al Chatt 
offices of the Diyala Department of Criminal Cases under the command of Commander 
Hisham Al Tamimi, arrested him at a road block set up in the outskirts of Diyala on the 
road leading to Baghdad. Mr. Al Joorani was taken to the headquarters of the department 
of Criminal Cases of Diyala. His family was not informed of his arrest. 
</p>
<p>Mr Al Joorani&#8217;s family began looking for him on the day of his disappearance. On 
1 December 2008, they learned that he had been admitted to the general hospital of 
Baaqouba, to which he had been brought by the agents of the Ministry of the Interior. They 
visited him in hospital that same day and noted that he had several fractured limbs and 
holes in his body created by the use of a piercing instrument. The family members took 
pictures of Mr Al Joorani, which confirm these claims (the pictures are on record with the 
Special Rapporteurs). Mr Al Joorani reportedly was only able to say &#8220;they killed me&#8221;. He 
passed away the following night, on 2 December 2008 at 4.30 a.m.  
</p>
<p>The family requested an autopsy, which was carried out notwithstanding death threats 
issued against doctors of the legal medical services by Commander Al Tamimi. However, 
the family has not obtained a copy of the autopsy report to this day.  
</p>
<p>In spite of serious concerns for their security, family members of Mr Al Joorani have filed 
a complaint against the Diyala Department of Criminal Cases. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the report summarized above, we would 
like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to this case. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 243 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rights provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life.  
</p>
<p> These two fundamental rights imply that all States have the obligation &#8220;to conduct 
exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221;, as stated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in 
Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4). The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify 
and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable 
time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice 
arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> In the context of the cases summarized above, we would particularly like to draw your 
Government&#8217;s attention to Principle 15 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which is equally relevant to 
cases of torture:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Complainants, witnesses, those conducting the investigation and their families shall be 
protected from violence, threats of violence or any other form of intimidation. Those 
potentially implicated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be removed 
from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over complainants, 
witnesses and their families, as well as over those conducting investigations.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> We therefore urge your Government to remove those potentially implicated in the death of 
Mr Al Joorani from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over witnesses, 
victims and their families; and to complete the inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the 
death of Mr Al Joorani expeditiously, impartially and transparently, also with a view to taking all 
appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and to ensure accountability of any person 
guilty of the alleged violations, as well as to compensate their families.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters:

<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case.

</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a substantive response concerning the 
deaths of Muhamad Shahade, Issa Marzuk, Imad Kamil, and Ahmed al-Balbul and the deaths of 
over 120 Palestinian civilians in the Gaza strip between 25 February and 4 March 2008. The 
Special Rapporteur would note, however, that the Government has already taken longer than the 
customary 90 days to respond. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 3 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have 
received concerning a number of Palestinian civilians killed during recent military operations in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received:  
</p>
<p>Between 25 February and 4 March 2008 over 120 Palestinian civilians, including 
29 children and 6 women were killed as a result of Israeli military operations in the 
Gaza strip.  
</p>
<p>On 12 March 2008 Israeli security forces conducted an operation in Bethlehem resulting in 
the death of 4 Palestinians: <b>Muhamad Shahade, Issa Marzuk, Imad Kamil</b>, members of 
the Islamic Jihad and <b>Ahmed al-Balbul</b>, a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. It is 
alleged that Muhamad Shahade feared that Israeli forces would not try to arrest him but 
would rather seek to kill him.  
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental legal rules applicable to all armed conflicts under 
international humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</p>
<p> In particular, I would like to refer to the customary rules of international humanitarian law 
governing the conduct of hostilities, including inter alia the prohibition on directing attacks 
against the civilian population and the need to respect the principles of proportionality and 
precautions in attack. Civilians are all persons who are not members of the armed forces of a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 245 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>party to the conflict. Civilians are protected against attack unless and for such time as they take 
a direct part in hostilities. (Rules 1, 5 and 6 of the Customary Rules of International 
Humanitarian Law identified in the study of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(&#8220;Customary Rules&#8221;).) 
</p>
<p> The principle of proportionality prohibits any attack which can be expected to cause 
incidental loss of civilian life or injury to the civilians which would be excessive in relation to 
the concrete and direct military advantage expected (Rule 14 of the Customary Rules). 
Compliance with this rule should be assessed for each attack taken individually and not for an 
overall military operation. I would note that this approach is also reflected in the Judgment of 
the Israeli Supreme Court of 14 December 2006 (The Public Committee against Torture in 
Israel et al. v. The Government of Israel et al.; HCJ 769/02) which observed that &#8220;when the 
damage to innocent civilians is not proportionate to the benefit of the attacking army, the attack 
is disproportionate and forbidden.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> The obligation to take all necessary precautions to spare the civilian population or in any 
case to limit to the maximum extent any incidental civilian loss of life, includes taking all 
appropriate measures to examine that the target of the attack is indeed a military objective, a 
choice of means and methods of warfare which will seek to avoid civilian loss of life or limit 
incidental civilian loss of life and a careful assessment of the conformity of the attack with the 
principle of proportionality. (Rules 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the Customary Rules). 
</p>
<p> I would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to its obligations under human 
rights law. These are in particular applicable in areas which are under its jurisdiction, including 
territories subject to belligerent occupation. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Israel is a party, provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his or her life. In its General Comment on Article 6, the Human Rights Committee has observed 
&#8220;that States parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life by 
criminal acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The deprivation of 
life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. Therefore, the law must 
strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by such 
authorities. A civilian taking a direct part in hostilities may be the object an attack, for such time, 
only if no less harmful means, such as arrest, can be used. This has been the interpretation 
adopted by the Israeli Supreme Court (The Public Committee against Torture in Israel et al. v. 
The Government of Israel et al). In the latter case the High Court stated that &#8220;a civilian taking a 
direct part in hostilities cannot be attacked at such time as he is doing so, if a less harmful means 
can be employed [&#8230;.]. Indeed, among the military means, one must choose the means whose 
harm to the human rights of the harmed person is smallest. Thus, if a terrorist taking a direct part 
in hostilities can be arrested, interrogated, and tried, those are the means which should be 
employed.&#8221; Examining the right to life in the context of an anti-terrorist operation the European 
Court for Human Rights reached a similar conclusion, in the McCaan v. United Kingdom case 
of 1995.  
</p>
<p> I also take this opportunity to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of it&#8217;s obligation to 
conduct a thorough investigations of all alleged violations of the right to life. (E/CN.4/2006/53, 
paras. 33-43, 60.) In this regard I would again observe that the approach adopted by the 
Israeli Supreme in The Public Committee against Torture in Israel et al. v. The Government of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 246 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Israel et al, confirmed that cases of attacks on civilians suspected of taking an active part in 
hostilities, at the time of the attack, must be the object of thorough investigations regarding the 
precision of the identification of the target and the circumstances of the attack.  
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human 
Rights and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my 
attention. Since I am expected to report on this case to the Human Rights Council, I would be 
grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the allegations in the above summary of the events accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Exactly how many people were killed in Gaza during the above mentioned 
operations by the army? How many of those killed were civilians not directly taking part in 
hostilities? With respect to these, please provide factual details as to the respect of the principle 
of proportionality. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please explain how the principle of precaution was applied in the course of the recent 
military operations in Gaza, namely the choice of means and methods of warfare used and the 
assessment of conformity of an attack with the principles of distinction and proportionality.  
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details on the circumstances surrounding the killings of 
Muhamad Shahade, Issa Marzuk, Imad Kamil, members and Ahmed al-Balbul? In particular, 
what measures were taken by the security forces before the use of lethal force and whether any

<p> The SR notes the concern of the Government as to the possible mental distress of the 
prisoner once informed of the date of the execution. However, the Government&#8217;s stated practice 
of informing the prisoner of an impending execution on the day of that execution is not 
consistent with international law. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur refers to the views of the 
Human Right Committee, which in two cases concluded that lack of transparency with regards to

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 7 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received 
regarding <b>Makino Tadashi</b>, a man allegedly at imminent risk of execution.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, Makino Tadashi was sentenced to death for murder 
in 1990. Over the following 18 years, a number of appeals against the sentence, motions 
for retrial and petitions for clemency were rejected. With his most recent petition for 
clemency having reportedly been rejected on 30 September 2008, he would appear to be 
now at imminent risk of execution.  
</p>
<p>Reports indicate that in Japan, as a matter of policy, death row prisoners are generally 
informed of their execution only a few hours before it is carried out. Often no advance 
notice at all is given to their families and lawyers, who might learn of the execution after it 
took place. This pattern is allegedly likely to be followed in the case of Makino Tadashi. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received regarding this 
specific case, I would like to recall that such secrecy in post-conviction proceedings in capital 
cases has been found to violate international legal obligations of Japan, in particular Articles 6(2) 
and 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Japan is a party. 
Article 6(2) enshrines the principle that, &#8220;[i]n countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty&#8221;, the death sentence may only be imposed &#8220;not contrary to the [other] provisions of 
the &#8230; Covenant&#8221;, which include the due process guarantees of Article 14(1) of the Covenant. 
Article 7 provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> As I argued in detail in a report to the Human Rights Council on <i>Transparency and the 
imposition of the death penalty</i> (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3), &#8220;[r]efusing to provide convicted 
persons and family members advance notice of the date and time of execution is a clear human 
rights violation.&#8221; The practice of informing prisoners of their impending execution only 
moments before they die, and families only later, is &#8220;inhuman and degrading and undermine[s] 
the procedural safeguards surrounding the right to life.&#8221; (para. 32). 
</p>
<p> I am aware that your Excellency&#8217;s Government takes the stance that executions must be 
kept secret in order to protect the privacy of the prisoner as well as that of his or her family. This 
argument does not, however, withstand close scrutiny. As explained in the report on 
Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty (paras. 46 and 47): </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 248 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Two logical limits to the privacy argument against transparency are apparent. The 
first such logical limit is that ensuring the right to privacy does not justify the denial of 
information to the very person whose privacy rights are being invoked. Thus, the argument 
that secrecy protects the privacy of death-row prisoners cannot explain or justify a refusal 
to reveal the timing and other details of executions to death-row prisoners themselves or to 
their families. Indeed, privacy protections would, if anything, support the claim that a 
death-row prisoner and his or her family should be fully informed of the prisoner&#8217;s fate. It 
undermines rather than promotes privacy to forbid families and prisoners the most basic 
information about the prisoner&#8217;s own death.  
</p>
<p> The second such logical limit is that respect for privacy cannot offset transparency 
obligations when the prisoner does not desire his experience on death row or the fact of his 
execution to be private. &#8220;Privacy&#8221;, in this context, is merely a by-product of enforced 
secrecy. Because prisoners are not aware of when they will die, they have no opportunity 
to make this fact public (or alternatively maintain their privacy). Moreover, while on death 
row they are prohibited from contacting the media or politicians and any contact they do 
have with permitted visitors is strictly controlled and monitored. By stripping death-row 
inmates of control over their communications and knowledge of the most crucial aspect of 
their lives, i.e. the timing of their own death, the Japanese system undermines rather than 
protects the privacy of death-row prisoners.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> I would therefore respectfully call on your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure Makino Tadashi&#8217;s right to due process in post-conviction proceedings, his right 
not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, as well as his and his family&#8217;s privacy 
rights are fully respected. A refusal to provide Makino Tadashi, his family and lawyer with 
timely and reliable information on the timing of any planned execution is highly likely to lead to 
violations of due process rights and to inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to 
the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters:  
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please provide all information and 
documents proving their inaccuracy.  
</p>
<p> 2. Please explain the steps taken by your Government to ensure that the due process 
rights of Makino Tadashi and his right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment 
continue to be protected also after the rejection of his most recent clemency petition. 
 3. Please explain the measures taken or planned by the Government of Japan to bring 
its practice of the death penalty, insofar as it chooses to retain capital punishment, into line with 
the principles set forth in my report on <i>Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty</i> 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3). </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government of Japan dated 20 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>1. Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please provide all information and 
documents proving their inaccuracy.  
</i></b></p>
<p> The Government of Japan refrains from referring to any individual inmate sentence to 
death, but the problems referred to in this request are not relevant to the individual results of 
requests for retrial or applications of pardon made by inmates sentenced to death. They are not 
problems specific to each inmate sentenced to death, either. Each person who applies for a 
pardon or submits an appeal for retrial, under the laws and regulations of our country, is to be 
informed of the results by he authorities that make the decision. 
</p>
<p><b><i>2. Please explain the steps taken by your Government to ensure that the due process rights 
of Makino Tadashi and his right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading 
treatment continue to be protected also after the rejection of his most recent clemency 
petition. 
</i></b></p>
<p> In general terms, the death penalty is mandated as a statutory penalty only for the most 
serious crimes, and sentences of death are handed down only in extremely heinous cases and 
after courts have conducted meticulous trials in Japan. The Government of Japan, as part of a 
nation ruled by law, considers that the use of the death sentence should be handled cautiously 
and gravely, while respecting the decisions of the court. 
</p>
<p><b><i>3. Please explain the measures taken or planned by the Government of Japan to bring its 
practice of the death penalty, insofar as it chooses to retain capital punishment, into line 
with the principles set forth in my report on Transparency and the imposition of the 
death penalty (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3). 
</i></b></p>
<p> An inmate sentenced to death is notified of his/her execution on the day it is due to take 
place, this is because the Government of Japan in concerned that he/she could become 
emotionally unstable and suffer from serious emotional distress if he/she is notified in advance. 
In addition, if his/her family members were to be notified in advance of the execution date, the 
Government of Japan in concerned that they could suffer from unnecessary mental distress. If an 
inmate were to learn of his/her execution date though a visit between the inmate and his/her 
family members who have been notified of the date, the Government of Japan is concerned that 
he/she could become emotionally unstable and suffer from serious emotional distress through 
this means as well. For this reason, the Government of Japan believes that the current practice is 
unavoidable. Furthermore, the Government of Japan considers that the above practice does not 
violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur seems to understand that the situation is handled in this manner in 
order to protect the privacy of inmates sentenced to death, but the actual reason is as explained 
above and not for privacy protection. 
</p>
<p> Concerning the treatment of inmates sentenced to death, the Government of Japan treats 
them appropriately under the Act of Penal Detention Facilities and Treatment of Inmates and 
Detainees. Furthermore the Government of Japan will continue to make efforts to enhance their 
treatment. </p>

<p><b>Kenya:  Killing of Francis Nyaruri 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Death due to the attack or killing by security forces of the State, or by 
paramilitary groups, death squads, or other private forces cooperating with or tolerated by the 
State 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male (journalist)

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a response concerning these allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 18 February 2009</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning the killing of Mr. <b>Francis Nyaruri</b>, a reporter for the 
<i>Weekly Citizen</i> paper.  
</p>
<p>According to information received: 
</p>
<p>Francis Nyaruri was a reporter for the <i>Weekly Citizen</i>, writing under the pen name 
Mong'are Mokua. He had recently written a series of articles exposing alleged financial 
malpractice by the police department in Nyanza province and had received threats by 
police officers as a consequence.  
</p>
<p>Francis Nyaruri travelled to Kisii, Nyanza province, on the morning of 15 January 2009. 
He last spoke to his wife on the phone at 11 a.m. on that day and was not heard of again. 
On 29 January 2009, his body was found in Kodera Forest, Nyanza Province, decapitated 
with hands tied behind his back and marks on his body.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we urge your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take effective measures to rapidly identify, arrest and bring to 
justice the persons responsible for the killing, both as material perpetrators and as instigators. 
 Taking effective measures to protect journalists and to prosecute those responsible of 
killings or death threats against them is a precondition to ensuring the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provide that: &#8220;Everyone 
shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive 
and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or 
in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; We are concerned that 
killings of journalists, particularly if they remain unpunished, could create a climate of impunity 
and result in preventing independent reporting and stifling freedom of expression. These 
concerns are further aggravated by information in this case pointing towards police as possible 
perpetrators of the killing. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 251 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would also like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 6 of 
the Covenant. It provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, 
that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or 
her life. As reiterated in Human Rights Council resolution 8/3 on &#8220;The Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have &#8220;the 
obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigation into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to justice those 
responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in 
order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Those potentially implicated in summary executions shall be removed from any position of 
control or power, whether direct or indirect, over complainants, witnesses and their families, as 
well as over those conducting investigations (Principle 15 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). Families of 
the deceased should be kept abreast of information relevant to the investigation, and the findings 
of the investigation should be made public (Principles 16 and 17). 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the summary of the cases accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the killing of 
Francis Nyaruri. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full 
details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. If no inquiries have taken place or if 
they have been inconclusive please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please describe the measures adopted to ensure in this case that &#8220;those potentially 
implicated in summary executions shall be removed from any position of control or power, 
whether direct or indirect, over complainants, witnesses and their families, as well as over those 
conducting investigations&#8221; as required by Principle 15 of the Principles on the Effective

<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 13 March 2009</b>,<b> </b>sent with the<b> </b>Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention 
two separate incidents related to human rights defenders in Kenya. 
</p>
<p> We have received information concerning the killing of Mr. <b>Oscar Kamau King&#8217;ara</b>, the 
founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Oscar Foundation Free Legal Aid Clinic, and 
Mr. <b>John Paul Oulu</b>, its Communications and Advocacy Director. The Oscar Foundation is a 
human rights organisation providing free legal aid services to the poor. It has carried out 
research on police brutality in urban areas of Kenya, on corruption in the police force and in 
prisons, as well as on the alleged enforced disappearance and killing by the police of hundreds of 
youths alleged to belong to the Mungiki sect. In 2007, the Oscar Foundation had published a 
report titled &#8220;License to kill. Extrajudicial execution and police brutality in Kenya&#8221;. On 
18 February 2009, the Oscar Foundation presented its findings on ongoing disappearances and 
extrajudicial killings in Kenya to a Member of Parliament for use in a parliamentary debate. The 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Mr. Philip Alston, met 
Mr. Kamau Kingara during his visit to Kenya from 16 to 25 February 2009. 
</p>
<p> The information received regarding the killing of Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul 
Oulu is: 
</p>
<p>On 5 March 2009, at approximately 6.00 pm, Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul Oulu 
were driving in heavy traffic on Mamlaka Road near the University of Nairobi. They were 
on their way to a meeting with a senior staffer of the Kenya National Commission on 
Human Rights. Their vehicle was blocked by a minibus and a Mitsubishi Pajero vehicle, 
both of which had been following them. Two men got out of the vehicles, approached the 
vehicle of Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul Oulu and shot them both through the 
windows from close range. The closest eyewitness to the incident was shot in the leg and 
later taken away by policemen.  
</p>
<p>On the same evening, following the killings, several hundred University of Nairobi 
students held a demonstration protesting the killings. Students took the bullet-riddled car 
and the body of Kingara onto campus, refusing to surrender the body to police. A standoff 
ensued between a large contingent of police who demanded that the body be handed over 
and the angry, but largely peaceful, demonstrators. After negotiations broke down, police 
officers stormed the campus using tear gas and firing live ammunition, some into the air, 
others apparently at students, while students threw stones at the police. One student was 
killed by the police, and a number were injured. 
On the day preceding the killing, Mr Alfred Mutua, the Government Spokesman, had 
publicly denounced the Oscar Foundation as a funder of the illegal Mungiki sect, while a 
attributed to the Police Spokesman, Mr Eric Kiraithe, stated that a major security operation 
was &#8220;definitely going to get&#8221; those responsible for recent demonstrations attributable to the 
Mungiki. In a briefing to the Special Rapporteur on 16 February 2009, the Chief of Police 
had stated that Mungiki was funding the Oscar Foundation. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 253 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Since this incident, numerous human rights defenders in Kenya have received threats, and 
a number have been forced to go into hiding. 
</p>
<p> In addition, we would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to threats against 
human rights defenders in Kenya&#8217;s Western Province who have been in contact with the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in the course of his recent visit to 
Kenya, namely Mr. <b>Job Bwonya Wahdalia</b>, Mr. <b>Eric Wambasi</b>, and Mr. <b>Eliu Siyoi Tendet</b> of 
the Western Kenya Human Rights Watch and Mr. <b>Taiga Wanyanja</b> of the Muratikho Torture 
Survivor&#8217;s Organisation. Both organizations have been monitoring and reporting on human 
rights abuses in the Mt Elgon region, and providing assistance to victims and families.  
</p>
<p>On 18 and 19 February 2009, in the course of his visit to Kenya upon invitation from the 
Government of Kenya, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, arbitrary or summary 
executions visited Bungoma and Kapsokwonyi in Western Province to investigate reports 
of killings and enforced disappearances by the armed group Sabaot Land Defence Force 
(SLDF), as well as by the Kenya Police and armed forces in their operation against the 
SLDF. In the days preceding the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s arrival in the region, representatives 
of the authorities told individuals not to speak with the Special Rapporteur about police 
and military abuses, and only to mention abuses by the SLDF. On 17 February, officials 
told residents at one IDP camp that the food aid upon which they depended would be 
jeopardized if they were critical of the military in their testimony to the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>On 18 February 2009, staff of the Western Kenya Human Rights Watch noticed the 
presence of intelligence officers outside their offices in Bungoma, where the Special 
Rapporteur was interviewing victims and witnesses of violence in Mount Elgon. On the 
following day, intelligence officers were outside the hotel where further interviews were 
being conducted.  
</p>
<p>On 19 February 2009, officials visited the home of Eliu Siyoi Tendet, who had organised 
interviews with witnesses for the Special Rapporteur, and asked him for the list of people 
who had testified before the Special Rapporteur. The military subsequently came to his 
home, but Eliu Siyoi Tendet managed to escape. Job Wahdalia also received calls from 
officials asking for the names of those who testified. Job Wahdalia, Eliu Siyoi Tendet, Eric 
Wambasi, and Taiga Wanyanja have now all been forced to flee the area to ensure their 
safety. Subsequently, the families and colleagues of each of them have been harassed as to 
their whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>On 19 February 2009, and in the following days, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
arbitrary or summary executions brought these threats repeatedly to the attention of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Provincial Administration and Internal 
Security. He asked for explanations and assurances from the Government. On 
25 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur received a letter from the Permanent Secretary 
in the Ministry of Provincial Administration and Internal Security. It states that &#8220;nobody 
has threatened them&#8221; [Job Bwonya [Wahdalia], Eric Wambasi, Eliu Siyoi Tendet and 
Taiga Wanyanja] and alleges that &#8220;there are reports from the mainstream NGOs that some 
witnesses illegally collected money from the Mt. Elgon SLDF victims so as to forward </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 254 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>their cases for compensation and thereafter disappeared&#8221;. The Permanent Secretary 
concludes that he &#8220;[has] ordered that these allegations be thoroughly investigated and in 
any case the mainstream NGOs be encouraged to talk to you and give more light to the 
matter&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>On 1, 2 and 4 March 2009, Kenya Police officers entered the offices of Western Kenya 
Human Rights Watch. They demanded from the remaining staff a list of the victims and 
witnesses who had spoken to the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions claiming that relatives had been killed or had disappeared at the time of the 
military operation in Mount Elgon.  
</p>
<p> With regard to these developments, we would like to refer Your Excellency's Government 
to the fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In particular, articles 1 and 2 of the Declaration state 
that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive 
for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels&#8221;. Article 5 points b) and c) provide that for the purpose of promoting and 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right to form, join and 
participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups, and to communicate with 
non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations. 
</p>
<p> Of special relevance to the cases at hand, article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration 
provide that the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent 
authorities of everyone against any violence, threats, retaliation, pressure or any other arbitrary 
action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
Declaration.  
</p>
<p> These principles have also been spelled out with specific regard to human rights defenders 
dealing with the question of enforced or involuntary disappearances, such as the members of 
Western Kenya Human Rights Watch and Oscar Foundation. The United Nations Declaration on 
the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance, adopted by General Assembly 
resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, states that States must take steps to ensure that persons 
involved in investigations of cases of disappearance, including the complainant, shall be 
protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal, and any cases of such treatment shall be 
appropriately punished. In its resolution 7/12, adopted without a vote, the Human Rights Council 
urged governments to take steps to protect witnesses of disappearances and the lawyers and 
families of disappeared persons against any intimidation or ill-treatment to which they might be 
subjected.  
 We would also like to recall the relevant provision of the Terms of Reference for 
Fact-Finding Missions by Special Rapporteurs/Representatives of the Commission on Human 
Rights (E/CN.4/1998/45, Appendix 5): 
</p>
<p> &#8220;During fact-finding missions, special rapporteurs or representatives of the 
Commission on Human Rights [&#8230;] should be given the following guarantees and facilities 
by the Government that invited them to visit its country: </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 255 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Assurance by the Government that no persons, official or private 
individuals who have been in contact with the special rapporteur/representative in 
relation to the mandate will for this reason suffer threats, harassment or punishment 
or be subjected to judicial proceedings&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Similarly, in its resolution 2005/9, the Commission on Human Rights urged governments 
to refrain from all acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who avail or have availed 
themselves of procedures established under United Nations auspices for the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take, without any further delay, all necessary 
measures to guarantee that all forms of violence, threats, retaliation, pressure or any other 
arbitrary action against the persons who have been in contact with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, as well as against all other human rights 
defenders in Kenya, cease immediately. We would suggest that this requires both clear 
instructions to all security forces and other relevant authorities and vigorous public statements of 
condemnation for such violence and intimidation by the highest levels of Government.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to expeditiously carry out an 
independent investigation into the killing of Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul Oulu. While 
we do not in any way prejudge the question of the responsibility for this assassination, it is 
inevitable under the circumstances that suspicion should fall upon the Kenya Police. As there is, 
according inter alia to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Post-Election Violence 
(CIPEV, pages 420-421), no existing independent unit capable of effectively and credibly 
investigating possible police misconduct in Kenya, we consider it imperative that an independent 
investigation be carried out with support from a foreign police force. In our view, only an 
independent, expeditious and effective investigation into the killing of Oscar Kamau Kingara and 
John Paul Oulu can re-establish faith in the commitment of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
right of every member of society &#8220;to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;, as enshrined in the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide information on the steps taken to ensure that all forms of violence, 
intimidation and harassment against human rights defenders, particularly those who have 
cooperated with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, arbitrary or summary executions, are 
brought to an end. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information on the investigations and criminal proceedings regarding 
the killings of Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul Oulu. </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Kuwait has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent action letter dated 23 July 2008  
</b></p>
<p> I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received 
regarding the capital punishment imposed on drug trafficking charges against <b>Sheikh Talal bin 
Nasser al-Sabah</b> and his possibly imminent execution.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Sheikh Talal bin Nasser al-Sabah was convicted on drug-trafficking charges in December 
2007 and sentenced to death. On 24 June 2008, the Supreme Court confirmed the death 
sentence. The sentence has been submitted to the Head of State, the Amir, for 
confirmation.  
</p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to recall that, although the death penalty is not prohibited 
under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental 
right to life, and must as such be applied in the most restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Kuwait is a party, provides that 
&#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> In interpreting Article 6(2) of the Covenant, the Human Rights Committee has consistently 
rejected the imposition of a death sentence for offences that do not result in the loss of life. As 
observed in a recent report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a 
thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies 
charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be 
imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the 
loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).  
</p>
<p> I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that 
Sheikh Talal bin Nasser al-Sabah&#8217;s rights under international law are respected. Considering the 
irremediable nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the death sentence 
or its commutation. In view of the urgency of the matter, I would appreciate a response on the 
initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard his rights in compliance with 
your Government&#8217;s international legal obligations. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please indicate which offences carry the death penalty in Kuwait.  
</p>
<p> 3. How many persons are awaiting execution on convictions for drug-related offences 
in Kuwait? How many executions of persons convicted of drug-related offences were carried out 
since 2003?

<p><b> </b>Dans ce contexte, nous souhaiterions attirer l&#8217;attention de votre Gouvernement sur des

</p>
<p> Selon les informations re&#231;ues, les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; malgaches auraient tu&#233; au moins 
28 personnes le samedi 7 f&#233;vrier 2009 &#224; Antananarivo, lors d&#8217;une manifestation

tuant 28 d&#8217;entre eux.  
</p>
<p> Selon les all&#233;gations, la r&#233;action des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; aurait &#233;t&#233; clairement

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Dans ce contexte, nous aimerions rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence les 
principes fondamentaux &#233;nonc&#233;s par l&#8217;article 3 de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de 
l&#8217;Homme et r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;s par l&#8217;article 6 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, o&#249; 
il est stipul&#233; que tout individu a le droit &#224; la vie et &#224; la s&#251;ret&#233; de sa personne, que ce droit doit 
&#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233; par la loi, et que nul ne peut &#234;tre arbitrairement priv&#233; de la vie. 
</p>
<p> Nous voudrions &#233;galement rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence l&#8217;applicabilit&#233; 
dans de telles situations des Principes de base sur le recours &#224; la force et l'utilisation des armes &#224; 
feu par les responsables de l'application des lois, r&#233;solution 1989/65 du 24 mai 1989 du Conseil 
&#233;conomique et social. Ceux-ci pr&#233;voient que les responsables de l'application des lois, dans 
l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions, auront recours autant que possible &#224; des moyens non-
violents, en d&#233;limitant le recours &#224; la force &#224; certains cas exceptionnels comme la l&#233;gitime 
d&#233;fense ou pour d&#233;fendre des tiers contre une menace imminente de mort ou de blessure grave. 
Je souhaite &#233;galement attirer votre attention sur le Code de conduite pour les responsables de 
l'application des lois, r&#233;solution 34/169 du 17 d&#233;cembre 1979 de l'Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale qui stipule 
que les responsables de l'application des lois peuvent recourir &#224; la force seulement lorsque cela 
est strictement n&#233;cessaire et dans la mesure exig&#233;e par l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions.  
</p>
<p> Par ailleurs nous prions votre Gouvernement de diligenter une enqu&#234;te sur les morts qui 
auraient eu lieu lors de la manifestation du 7 f&#233;vrier 2009, de traduire les responsables en justice, 
s&#8217;il est d&#233;termin&#233; que les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; ont eu recours &#224; un usage excessif de la force, 
conform&#233;ment aux principes relatifs &#224; la pr&#233;vention efficace des ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, 
r&#233;solution 1989/65 du 24 mai 1989 du Conseil &#233;conomique et social. En particulier les 
principes 9 &#224; 19 obligent les Gouvernements &#224; mener des enqu&#234;tes approfondies et impartiales 
dans tous les cas o&#249; l&#8217;on soup&#231;onnera des ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, arbitraires ou sommaires ; 
&#224; rendre publiques les conclusions d&#8217;enqu&#234;tes; et &#224; veiller &#224; ce que les personnes dont l&#8217;enqu&#234;te 
aura r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; qu&#8217;elles ont particip&#233; &#224; de telles ex&#233;cutions sur tout le territoire tombant sous leur 
juridiction soient traduites en justice. Des proc&#233;dures et des services officiels d&#8217;enqu&#234;te doivent 
&#234;tre maintenus, alors que les plaignants, les t&#233;moins, les personnes charg&#233;s de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te et leurs 
familles doivent &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233;s contre les violences ou tout autre forme d&#8217;intimidation. 
</p>
<p> Nous voudrions par ailleurs rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence les normes et 
principes fondamentaux pertinents &#233;nonc&#233;s &#224; l'article 19 de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits 
de l'homme, et r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;s &#224; l'article 19 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, 
qui pr&#233;cisent que: &#8220;Toute personne a droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;expression; ce droit comprend la libert&#233; 
de rechercher, de recevoir et de r&#233;pandre des informations et des id&#233;es de toute esp&#232;ce, sans 
consid&#233;ration de fronti&#232;res, sous une forme orale, &#233;crite, imprim&#233;e ou artistique, ou par tout autre 
moyen de son choix.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Nous souhaiterions appeler le Gouvernement de son Excellence &#224; prendre toutes les 
mesures n&#233;cessaires pour s'assurer que le droit de r&#233;union pacifique tel qu'&#233;nonc&#233; &#224; l'article 21 du 
Pacte International sur les droits civils et politiques, qui pr&#233;voit que &#8220;Le droit de r&#233;union 
pacifique est reconnu. L'exercice de ce droit ne peut faire l'objet que des seules restrictions 
impos&#233;es conform&#233;ment &#224; la loi et qui sont n&#233;cessaires dans une soci&#233;t&#233; d&#233;mocratique, dans 
l'int&#233;r&#234;t de la s&#233;curit&#233; nationale, de la s&#251;ret&#233; publique, de l'ordre public ou pour prot&#233;ger la sant&#233;

</b></p>
<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de Su Gobierno la informaci&#243;n 
que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con el Sr. <b>Miguel &#193;ngel Guti&#233;rrez &#193;vila</b>, antrop&#243;logo, profesor

<p>El 26 de julio de 2008, hacia la 1.00 a.m., el Sr. Miguel &#193;ngel Guti&#233;rrez &#193;vila habr&#237;a sido

<p> 
</p>
<p>orillas de la carretera federal Acapulco-Ometepec, cerca de la comunidad La Caridad en el 
municipio de San Marcos, Guerrero. Seg&#250;n se informa su cuerpo fue cubierto de 
moretones y cortadas. El veh&#237;culo en el cual el Sr. Guti&#233;rrez viajaba estaba intacto y solo 
su equipo de grabaci&#243;n fue robado.  
</p>
<p>Entre el 23 y 25 de julio de 2008, el Sr. Guti&#233;rrez habr&#237;a visitado las comunidades de 
Suljaa&#8217; y Cozoyoapan en Costa Chica, Guerrero, en relaci&#243;n con un documentario

por parte de las autoridades contra el personal de una estaci&#243;n de radio de la comunidad, 
Radio Nomndaa o La Palabra del Agua.  
</p>
<p> Se teme que el asesinato del Sr. Miguel &#193;ngel Guti&#233;rrez &#193;vila podr&#237;a estar directamente 
relacionado con su trabajo en defensa de los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas en M&#233;xico.  
 Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos hacer un 
llamamiento urgente al gobierno de su Excelencia para que tome las medidas necesarias para 
asegurar que el derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de acuerdo con los 
principios enunciados en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y 
reiterados en el art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Nadie podr&#225; 
ser molestado a causa de sus opiniones. Toda persona tiene derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n; 
este derecho comprende la libertad de buscar, recibir y difundir informaciones e ideas de toda

art&#237;stica, o por cualquier otro procedimiento de su elecci&#243;n&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Quisi&#233;ramos tambi&#233;n hacer referencia a la resoluci&#243;n 2005/38 de la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos 
Humanos, la cual insta a los estados a que garanticen que las v&#237;ctimas de violaciones al derecho 
a la libertad de expresi&#243;n puedan interponer recursos eficaces para investigar efectivamente las 
amenazas y actos de violencia dirigidos contra los periodistas y llevar ante la justicia a los 
responsables de esos actos, para luchar contra la impunidad.

ejecuci&#243;n extralegal, arbitraria o sumaria, en particular a aquellos que reciban amenazas de 
muerte. Los Gobiernos deben proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de 
todos los casos en que haya sospecha de tales ejecuciones o amenazas; publicar en un informe 
las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la

<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su Excelencia

</p>
<p>En la ma&#241;ana del d&#237;a 9 de enero en las inmediaciones de la comunidad El Carmen Arcotete 
del Municipio de San Crist&#243;bal de Las Casas, Chiapas, la Polic&#237;a Estatal Preventiva (PEP) 
dispar&#243; contra una camioneta que transportaba alrededor de 45 migrantes indocumentados, 
originarios de El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador y China. El conductor de la 
camioneta desatendi&#243; un llamado de las autoridades locales para que detuviese el vehiculo, 
que recibi&#243; como consecuencia numerosos impactos de bala y choc&#243; contra un &#225;rbol. La

<p>Los migrantes procedentes de Centroam&#233;rica fueron presuntamente expulsados de M&#233;xico. 
Los migrantes procedentes de Sudam&#233;rica y China se hayan presuntamente recluidos en la 
Estaci&#243;n Migratoria de Iztapalapa, en Ciudad de M&#233;xico y temen por su seguridad a causa 
de sus presuntos testimonios con respecto al tratamiento dado por sus captores. 
</p>
<p>Los representantes de la Procuradur&#237;a General de Justicia del Estado denegaron el permiso 
para ver los migrantes detenidos al Centro de Derechos Humanos Fray Bartolom&#233; de Las 
Casas, una organizaci&#243;n local de derechos humanos que quiso prestarles asistencia letrada. 
Seg&#250;n dicha organizaci&#243;n, a los migrantes se les neg&#243; tambi&#233;n el acceso a sus 
representantes consulares. 
</p>
<p> Sin que de alguna manera constituya prejuzgamiento sobre los hechos o el fondo del 
asunto, nos permitimos hacer un llamamiento al Gobierno de su Excelencia para buscar una 
clarificaci&#243;n de los hechos con miras a garantizar el respeto de los derechos humanos de los 
migrantes, de conformidad, entre otros a la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y al 
Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, inter alia, art&#237;culos 2, 6, 7 y 10. Frente a este 
&#250;ltimo instrumento jur&#237;dico, vale la pena destacar, que en su observaci&#243;n general No.31 sobre 
&#8220;La &#237;ndole de la obligaci&#243;n jur&#237;dica general impuesta a los Estados Partes en el Pacto&#8221;, el Comit&#233; 
de Derechos Humanos recuerda en su p&#225;rrafo tercero, entre otros, que &#8220;[a] los Estados Partes se 
les impone una obligaci&#243;n general de respetar los derechos del Pacto y de asegurar su aplicaci&#243;n 
a todos los individuos en su territorio y sometidos a su jurisdicci&#243;n&#8221;. As&#237; mismo, tanto la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos como el Pacto Internacional de Derechos 
Humanos, establecen garant&#237;as en relaci&#243;n con el debido proceso. 
</p>
<p> Perm&#237;tanos, Excelencia, solicitar igualmente una clarificaci&#243;n de los hechos en relaci&#243;n 
con el C&#243;digo de conducta para funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley adoptado por la 
Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas en su resoluci&#243;n 34/169, del 17 de diciembre de 1979. En 
particular, sus art&#237;culos 2 y 3 se&#241;alan respectivamente que &#8220;en el desempe&#241;o de sus tareas, los 
funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley respetar&#225;n y proteger&#225;n la dignidad humana y 
mantendr&#225;n y defender&#225;n los derechos humanos de las personas&#8221; y que &#8220;podr&#225;n usar la fuerza 
s&#243;lo cuando sea estrictamente necesario y en la medida en que lo requiera el desempe&#241;o de sus 
tareas&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Nos gustar&#237;a referirnos tambi&#233;n a los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e 
investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 24 de 
mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, los principios 9 a 19 obligan a los 
Gobiernos a proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en 
que haya sospecha de ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias; a publicar en un informe 
las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y a velar por que sean juzgadas las personas que la 
investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio 
bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
 En este sentido, recibimos con agrado la noticia de que las autoridades judiciales han 
abierto una investigaci&#243;n preliminar por cargos de homicidio y lesiones, y tres agentes de la 
polic&#237;a estatal de Chiapas han sido detenidos. La Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Derechos Humanos 
tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a abierto una investigaci&#243;n sobre los abusos contra los migrantes. Exhortamos 
respetuosamente a las autoridades de su Gobierno a que investiguen de forma completa y </p>

<p> Adicionalmente, la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos inici&#243; una queja de 
oficio en este asunto por considerarlo de especial gravedad e importancia.

<p> Despu&#233;s de realizadas las investigaciones por las Fiscal&#237;a de Distritos Altos de 
San Crist&#243;bal de las Casas, el 17 de enero de 2009 ejercit&#243; acci&#243;n penal en contra de

</i></b></p>
<p> La pol&#237;tica de M&#233;xico en materia de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos de 
los migrantes tiene como fundamento la universalidad de estos derechos, independientemente de 
la situaci&#243;n migratoria, el principio de la responsabilidad compartida, el fortalecimiento de la 
cooperaci&#243;n internacional y la no criminalizaci&#243;n de la migraci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p> En ese esp&#237;ritu, en julio de 2008 entr&#243; en vigor la reforma a la Ley General de Poblaci&#243;n 
que despenaliza la migraci&#243;n indocumentada, armoniza el orden jur&#237;dico con los tratados 
internacionales en la materia y contribuye a eliminar abusos contra migrantes indocumentados.  
</p>
<p> El Instituto Nacional de Migraci&#243;n (INM) es la instituci&#243;n federal especializada para 
atender la pol&#237;tica migratoria. El INM coordina el &#8220;Programa de Reordenamiento de la Frontera 
Sur&#8221; que facilita la documentaci&#243;n y vigilancia de los flujos migratorios.  
 En el mes de marzo 2008 el Instituto Nacional de Migraci&#243;n (INM) introdujo la Forma 
Migratoria para Trabajadores Fronterizos que permite el ingreso documentado de trabajadores de 
Guatemala y Belice para laborar en los estados de Chiapas, Campeche, Tabasco y Quintana Roo. 
Bajo este Programa se ampli&#243; la Forma Migratoria de Visitantes Locales, que otorga facilidades 
a los visitantes locales guatemaltecos, a fin de que la poblaci&#243;n transfronteriza pueda ingresar en 
tr&#225;nsito local en los estados de Chiapas, Tabasco y Campeche, lo que brinda mayor protecci&#243;n a 
los migrantes frente a posibles abusos. 
</p>
<p> Se realizan esfuerzos para asegurar que la repatriaci&#243;n de nacionales centroamericanos v&#237;a 
terrestre se lleve a cabo de manera ordenada, digna, &#225;gil y segura, con base en acuerdos con 
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras y Nicaragua.  
</p>
<p> Desde 2003, el INM opera un &#8220;Programa de Dignificaci&#243;n de Estaciones Migratorias&#8221;, que 
tiene por objeto mejorar las condiciones f&#237;sicas y servicios de las instalaciones destinadas al 
aseguramiento de migrantes indocumentados. Actualmente, el INM cuenta con 48 estaciones 
migratorias ubicadas en 23 estados con capacidad total de alojamiento de 3, 958 personas. Bajo 
esta Programa, entre 2003 y 2007 se han construido 10 y se han dignificado 84 estaciones </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>migratorias. Se busca garantizar mejores condiciones en las estaciones migratorias, incluidas la 
atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica y los problemas sanitarios, as&#237; como la atenci&#243;n especial a mujeres, ni&#241;as y 
ni&#241;os migrantes.  
</p>
<p> A fin de proteger los derechos humanos de los migrantes, existen los &#8220;Grupos Beta de 
Protecci&#243;n a los Migrantes&#8221; que operan en las rutas de migrantes en las fronteras norte y sur. 
Estos grupos brindan asistencia a migrantes lesionados o heridos; realizan actividades de 
localizaci&#243;n y asistencia jur&#237;dica, entre otras. Actualmente operan 20 oficinas en todo el pa&#237;s. 
 Existen tambi&#233;n programas para brindar atenci&#243;n integral especializada a mujeres, ni&#241;as, 
ni&#241;os y adolescentes migrantes y repatriados, incluyendo los no acompa&#241;ados, entre otros 
mediante esfuerzos interinstitucionales y con la sociedad civil, proporcionando servicios 
integrales de recepci&#243;n, valoraci&#243;n m&#233;dica, social y psicol&#243;gica, alojamiento, alimentaci&#243;n y 
vestido a trav&#233;s de la Red de Albergues de Tr&#225;nsito p&#250;blicos y privados.

<p> En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su Excelencia 
la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con la desaparici&#243;n forzada y asesinato de los 
Sres. <b>Manuel Ponce Rosas</b> y <b>Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a</b> y las amenazas recibidas por parte de las

sus hijos y su hermana la Sra. <b>Carmen Lucas Luc&#237;a</b>.  
 Manuel Ponce Rosas y Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a ocupaban los cargos de Secretario y Presidente, 
respectivamente, de la <i>Organizaci&#243;n para el Futuro del Pueblo Mixteco</i> (OFPM). Esta 
organizaci&#243;n se cre&#243; a partir de la <i>Organizaci&#243;n del Pueblo Ind&#237;gena Me Phaa</i> (OPIM), otra 
organizaci&#243;n ind&#237;gena en la zona de la Costa Chica. Ambas organizaciones, las cuales est&#225;n 
constituidas por comunidades ind&#237;genas de la zona (Tlapanecos y Mixtecos), se dedican a la 
defensa del territorio y recursos naturales y han denunciado presuntas violaciones de derechos 
humanos por parte del Ej&#233;rcito Mexicano en la zona. La OFPM tiene su base en la capital 
municipal de Ayutla de los Libres y defiende los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas de la regi&#243;n a 
trav&#233;s de la denuncia de violaciones de derechos humanos, as&#237; como creando y gestionando 
proyectos para mejorar la calidad de vida de los grupos ind&#237;genas. La OPIM fue fundada en 2002 </p>

humanos cometidas por parte del Ej&#233;rcito Mexicano contra la comunidad.  
 El 19 de febrero de 2009, el Grupo de Trabajo sobre desapariciones forzadas o 
involuntarias, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de M&#233;xico en torno a la desaparici&#243;n de 
los Sres. Manuel Ponce Rosas y Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a. Aunque el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la 
comunicaci&#243;n del Grupo el 26 de febrero de 2009, dicha comunicaci&#243;n no se recibi&#243; hasta el 
5 de marzo de 2009. En su respuesta, el Gobierno inform&#243; de la causa de la muerte de ambos 
se&#241;ores y de las circunstancias en que los cad&#225;veres fueron encontrados. Tambi&#233;n se les 
inform&#243; sobre las investigaciones judiciales llevadas a cabo sobre la desaparici&#243;n de los 
Sres. Manuel Ponce Rosas y Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a. 
</p>
<p> La OPIM ya fue objeto de varias comunicaciones de la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n 
de los defensores de derechos humanos que env&#237;o una carta el 22 de julio de 2008 y de su 
predecesora, que envi&#243; una carta el 28 de febrero de 2008. La Relatora Especial lamenta no 
haber recibido respuesta a estas comunicaciones en el momento de finalizaci&#243;n de la presente 
comunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida:  
</p>
<p>El 13 de febrero de 2009, aproximadamente a la 13h35, los Sres. Manuel Ponce Rosas y 
Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a habr&#237;an sido detenidos por tres hombres armados que se identificaron 
como polic&#237;as. En el momento del incidente, Manuel Ponce Rosas y Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a se 
hallar&#237;an en la inauguraci&#243;n de unas oficinas en Plan de Ayutla, una escuela secundaria 
federal ubicada en el Boulevard, carretera Ayutla-Tecoanapa, Ayutla de los Libres, Estado 
de Guerrero. Los se&#241;ores habr&#237;an sido invitados por la esposa de Ra&#250;l, Guadalupe, quien es 
regidora del Municipio en asuntos ind&#237;genas.  
</p>
<p>Entre las 35 personas que asistieron al acto, se encontraban algunos representantes de las 
autoridades municipales. El Director de Seguridad P&#250;blica de Ayutla y aproximadamente 
25 agentes de la Polic&#237;a Preventiva Federal, vigilaban la zona. Sin embargo, 
aproximadamente a la 13h00, el Capit&#225;n de la polic&#237;a habr&#237;a recibido una llamada a su 
tel&#233;fono m&#243;vil y &#233;l y sus hombres habr&#237;an abandonado el lugar en direcci&#243;n al centro de 
Ayutla. Aproximadamente a la 13h15 habr&#237;an llegado tres individuos que, seg&#250;n algunos 
testigos, se habr&#237;an presentado como miembros de la polic&#237;a ministerial del Estado de 
Guerrero. Las tres personas habr&#237;an estado vestidas de civiles, llevar&#237;an un corte de cabello 
al estilo militar y habr&#237;an portado armas de corto alcance. Un hombre habr&#237;a amenazado a 
Manuel Ponce Rosas con un arma de fuego y al intervenir Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a, le habr&#237;a 
golpeado en la cabeza con el arma. Otros dos hombres armados habr&#237;an obligado a Manuel 
Ponce Rosas y Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a a salir del lugar de los hechos. Un cuarto hombre les 
habr&#237;a esperado a la salida donde se habr&#237;a obligado a Manuel Ponce Rosas y Ra&#250;l Lucas 
Luc&#237;a a subir a un veh&#237;culo Domsan negro con vidrios polarizados y sin placas de 
matriculaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>Aproximadamente a las 14h30, la Sra. Guadalupe Castro Morales, la esposa de Ra&#250;l Lucas 
Luc&#237;a, habr&#237;a recibido una llamada telef&#243;nica desde el n&#250;mero de tel&#233;fono m&#243;vil de </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 268 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Manuel Ponce Rosas. Al contestar, una voz masculina le habr&#237;a amenazado diciendo: 
&#8220;[&#8230;] esto les pasa por defender indios&#8221;. El interlocutor habr&#237;a colgado cuando la 
Sra. Castro Morales le hubiese pedido que pusiera a los hombres en libertad y que no les 
hiciese da&#241;o. 
</p>
<p>El mismo d&#237;a Guadalupe Castro Morales habr&#237;a acudido a la Oficina del Fiscal del 
Departamento de Justicia del Estado de Guerrero en Ayutla para denunciar las 
desapariciones. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el personal presente se habr&#237;a negado a 
abrir investigaciones y s&#243;lo habr&#237;a establecido un antecedente legal a trav&#233;s del acto 
ministerial n&#250;mero ALLE/SC/03/A/W015/2009. Junto con Margarita Mart&#237;n de las Nieves, 
la esposa de Manuel Ponce Rosas, Guadalupe Castro Morales tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a registrado 
una denuncia por arrestos incomunicados en la S&#233;ptima Corte del Distrito en Chilpancingo, 
Guerrero y habr&#237;a pedido que se buscara a los desaparecidos en las instalaciones de la 
polic&#237;a y de las fuerzas armadas.  
</p>
<p>Entre la tarde del 13 de febrero y el 14 de febrero de 2009, la Sra. Castro Morales habr&#237;a 
visto a varios hombres desconocidos pararse en la esquina frente a su casa en dos 
ocasiones. Debido al temor a que sus movimientos fuesen vigilados, habr&#237;a tenido que 
abandonar su casa temporalmente. 
</p>
<p>En la madrugada del jueves 19 de febrero de 2009, Margarita Mart&#237;n de las Nieves y 
Guadalupe Castro Morales habr&#237;an recibido una llamada donde al parecer se escuchaba la 
voz de Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a siendo torturado. Las personas que habr&#237;an llamado habr&#237;an 
informado que estaban vigilando a la familia y les habr&#237;an amenazado con llevarse 
tambi&#233;n a la hija de Ra&#250;l de 15 a&#241;os, si continuaban activos en la b&#250;squeda de los 
Sres. Manuel Ponce Rosas y Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a.  
</p>
<p>El viernes, 20 de febrero se habr&#237;a realizado un operativo de b&#250;squeda de las personas. Se 
habr&#237;an encontrado los cuerpos enterrados a un metro de profundidad y en bolsas de 
pl&#225;stico. Se habr&#237;an podido identificar los cuerpos en los que se habr&#237;an encontrado huellas 
de tortura a pesar de su estado de descomposici&#243;n. En el caso del Sr. Ra&#250;l Lucas, el 
cad&#225;ver habr&#237;a presentado un orificio de bala en la cabeza, mientras que en el caso del 
Sr. Manuel Ponce, su muerte podr&#237;a haber sido por traumatismo craneoencef&#225;lico. El 
Procurador General de Justicia del Estado de Guerrero, el Sr. Eduardo Murueta Urrutia, 
habr&#237;a declarado que los Sres. Ra&#250;l Lucas Lucia y Manuel Ponce Rosas hab&#237;an sido 
&#8220;levantados&#8221;, lo que podr&#237;a distraer la investigaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Anteriormente, Ra&#250;l Lucas Luc&#237;a habr&#237;a sido v&#237;ctima de diversas formas de acoso a causa 
de su trabajo de denuncia de violaciones de los derechos humanos por parte de miembros

<p> Sin que de manera alguna constituya prejuzgamiento sobre los hechos o el fondo del 
asunto, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas 
fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el Derecho y el Deber de 
los Individuos, los Grupos y las Instituciones de Promover y Proteger los Derechos Humanos y 
las Libertades Fundamentales Universalmente Reconocidos. Quisi&#233;ramos llamar la atenci&#243;n del 
Gobierno de su Excelencia en particular, sobre los art&#237;culos 1 y 2 que establecen, 
respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a promover y 
procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en 
los planos nacional e internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el deber de todos los 
Estados de proteger, promover y hacer efectivos todos los derechos humanos, adoptando las 
medidas necesarias para crear las condiciones sociales, econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; 
como las garant&#237;as jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que toda persona sometida a su jurisdicci&#243;n, 
individual o colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y libertades.  
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos al art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, que estipula que el Estado 
garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o 
colectivamente, frente a toda violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o 
de derecho, presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los 
derechos mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes nacionales al reaccionar u 
oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con inclusi&#243;n de las omisiones, imputables 
a los Estados que causen violaciones de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; 
como a actos de violencia perpetrados por grupos o particulares que afecten el disfrute de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>
<p> El Grupo de Trabajo sobre Desapariciones Forzadas o Involuntarias desear&#237;a llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre la resoluci&#243;n 2005/27, en la cual la Comisi&#243;n de 
Derechos Humanos inst&#243; a los Estados a que adopten medidas para proteger a los testigos de 
desapariciones forzadas o involuntarias, a los defensores de los derechos humanos que luchan 
contra las desapariciones forzadas y a los abogados y a las familias de las personas desaparecidas 
contra todo acto de intimidaci&#243;n o contra los malos tratos de que pudieran ser objeto. 
 Adem&#225;s, la Declaraci&#243;n sobre la protecci&#243;n de todas las personas contra las desapariciones 
forzadas, aprobada por la Asamblea General en su resoluci&#243;n 47/133, de 18 de diciembre de 
1992, establece que se tomar&#225;n disposiciones para garantizar que todo maltrato, todo acto de 
intimidaci&#243;n o de represalia, as&#237; como toda forma de injerencias, en ocasi&#243;n de la presentaci&#243;n 
de una denuncia o durante el procedimiento de investigaci&#243;n, sean castigados como corresponda. 
Asimismo, el Grupo de Trabajo desear&#237;a recordar a su Gobierno el art&#237;culo 3 (obligaci&#243;n de

<p><b>Mongolia:  Death of Enkhbat Damiran

</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of 
Mongolia with respect to the case of Enkhbat Damiran.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 271 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 4 February 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b>  
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to information we have received regarding <b>Enkhbat Damiran</b>. The Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment visited him on 
8 June 2005 at Prison No. 413 (Zuunkharaa) (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.4, Appendix, para.1). He 
regrets that, in spite of numerous requests for follow-up information, the Government of 
Mongolia has not provided any follow-up information since the report on the visit was published 
(see also A/HRC/7/3/Add.2, para. 3).  
</p>
<p>According to recent allegations brought to our attention: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Enkhbat Damiran, who was serving a three-year sentence at Prison No. 413 
(Zuunkharaa), died two days after his release from prison in 2006. He may have been 
released because of his imminent death due to his poor health, which appears to have been 
a result of the ill-treatment to which he was subjected during arrest, transfer and detention. 
No investigation into the cause of death has been conducted, nobody has been prosecuted 
in relation to the allegations of torture raised by the Special Rapporteur on Torture, and no 
compensation has been granted to his relatives.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we wish to remind 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that, following the personal meeting of the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment with Mr. Damiran, he 
recommended that the latter should be immediately released and that criminal investigations 
should be initiated in respect of the alleged perpetrators of torture.  
</p>
<p> In this context, we would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the 
fundamental principles applicable under international law to this case. Articles 6, 7 and 10 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide for the rights to life, physical and 
mental integrity and human treatment respecting the dignity inherent in the human person. When 
the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies in custody or very soon after 
release from custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this respect, we would 
like to recall the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case  
(<i>Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay</i>, communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraph 9.2): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo Dermit 
committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; yet, the 
inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either by 
act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, as 
required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death occurring very 
shortly after release from custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human 
Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 272 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have 
&#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to inform us about the results of the inquiries into 
the circumstances surrounding his death. In particular: 
</p>
<p> 1. Please indicate the steps adopted by your Excellency&#8217;s Government after the 
Special Rapporteur on torture expressed concerns regarding the state of Mr. Damiran&#8217;s health 
and appealed, on humanitarian grounds, for his release from custody. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of investigations, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which have been carried out in relation to this case. 
If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. Please 
describe the measures taken to ensure that the inquiries were conducted in an impartial and 
transparent manner. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please inform us about any disciplinary and prosecutorial action that was taken in 
relation to the case of Mr. Damiran and how accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations was ensured. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate whether compensation has been paid to the family of Mr. Damiran. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of Mongolia dated 19 March 2009  
</b></p>
<p> Prior to this moment, Mr. Damiran Enkhbat has been sentenced for six times in 2004, on a 
basis of Article 87.1 of a Special part of the Criminal Code of Mongolia he was also sentenced 
for three years in prison. 
</p>
<p> On August 25, 2005, during the medical meeting of a Central hospital of the Judicial 
Decision Enforcement Authority, doctors carefully discussed on Mr. Damiran&#8217;s health condition 
and after with the double diagnosis check from the group of experts of State Central Clinic, have, 
unanimously decided to submit release-from-prison proposal to the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the 
Capital city and Court of Khan-Uul district. 
</p>
<p> Within the frame of the above decision, on February 6, 2006, in accordance with Review 
Prosecutor Mr. Choijilsuren&#8217;s January 18, 2006 Resolution, Dr. B. Undarmaa, Dr. S. Ayurbaatar 
and R. T. Amartuvshin of the Forensic Unit of the National Center for the Forensic Examination, 
and a medical examination of the health condition of Mr. Damiran Enkhbat and did Expert Act 
No. 971. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to Mr. Damiran&#8217;s application, which was addressed to the Minister for Justice 
and Home Affairs and to the Head of the Judicial Decision Enforcement Authority, the Judicial 
Decision Enforcing Authority, in June 2006, submitted some materials of his release to the 
prosecutors and judiciaries. 
 During the trial with the presence of General Judge MR. B. Baatar, Court Secretary 
Mr. S. Tuvshin, Captain Bayaraa, Dorctor, Captain Ya. Oyunchimeg of Prison No. 401, 
Ms. B. Undarmaa of the Forensic Unit of the National Center for the Forensic Examination, the 
panel of judges discussed proposal of the Prison No. 401 that regarding the release issue of 
Mr. Damiran Enkhbat and as stated in the Article of 75.3 of the General Part of the Criminal 
Code of Mongolia and in accordance with February 17, 2006 Resolution 38 of the Court of the 
Khan-Uul district, has decided, from the health condition, to free Mr. Damiran Enkhbat 
immediately of his 11 year, 8 month and 22 days of unfinished sentence. 
</p>
<p> Starting from May 20, 2003, Mr. Damiran Enkhbat, under the case no. 822746, had been 
convicted on June 25, 1998, by giving a bribe to doctors in order to be issued a false medical 
report stating that he can not physically be in prison, because of health condition. Moreover, 
some doctors of First Central Clinic, on a basis of Article 241 of the Criminal Code of Mongolia, 
had been detained of committing bribery crime and after they were found guilty, the police 
confiscated bribe articles. In connection with the above case, sentence-release resolution of the 
Court of Beganuur district was revoked and on Many 28, 2003, after considering of his asthma, 
Mr. Damiran Enkhbat was removed to Conic of the Prison No. 401 at Zaisan in order to be under 
some medical treatment. 
</p>
<p> During the ongoing investigation process of Case No. 822746, which was related to the 
above-mentioned doctors, in accordance with the Article 208.1.1 and 24.1.2 of the Criminal 
Procedural Code of Mongolia, authorities made a decision to close the case, due to termination 
of period of limitation in Criminal Code of Mongolia. 
</p>
<p> From June 2006, resulting from the same diagnosis, Mr. Damiran Enkhbat paid 9 time visit 
at the Central hospital of the Judicial Decision Enforcement Authority and had a 360 days of 
medical treatment.

<p><b>Mozambique:  Killing of 18 persons by the police 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Death in custody; Death due to the use of force by law enforcement officials 
or persons acting in direct or indirect compliance with the State, when the use of force is 
inconsistent with the criteria of absolute necessity and proportionality; Impunity 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 18 persons (15 males; 3 demonstrators) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Mozambique has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 12 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have received 
concerning <b>nine incidents, involving 18 victims, of allegedly arbitrary killings by the police</b> 
in Mozambique. While the circumstances under which the killings occurred differ, from 
summary executions of supposed criminals, to the use of lethal force allegedly to prevent 
detainees from escaping, to the use of excessive force in policing protests, the information 
received indicates that in none of these cases, which span over the past five years, have the 
police officers involved been held accountable. In the Annex to this letter, I have reproduced 
detailed information on each of the nine cases. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer your 
Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Mozambique is a party, provides that every individual 
has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that 
no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). In particular, Article 6 of the 
ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement officials only when strictly necessary, and 
that force must be in proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 275 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (General Assembly resolution 34/169 
of 17 December 1979) and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials (adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 27 August to 7 September 1990), though not in 
themselves binding law, provide an authoritative and convincing interpretation of the limits on 
the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of life places on the conduct of law enforcement forces.  
</p>
<p> Crucially, these instruments put forward the twin safeguards of necessity and 
proportionality in the use of force. Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement 
Officials states: &#8220;Law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to 
the extent required for the performance of their duty.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> The reports I have received, see for example the cases of <b>J&#250;lio Naftal Macule, 
Abrantes Penicela, and Geraldo Celestino Jo&#227;o</b> in the Annex to this letter, suggest that in 
many instances the use of firearms by the police might have been entirely unwarranted. I would 
like to stress, however, that even when the use of firearms has become unavoidable: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; law enforcement officials shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved; 
 (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life; 
 (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected 
persons at the earliest possible moment; 
</p>
<p> (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person are 
notified at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(Principle 5 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials). 
</p>
<p> Of particular relevance in the context of policing of assemblies and demonstrations, such 
as the protests in Maputo and Gaza in February 2008 (see Annex), are principles 12 to 14 of the 
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. In the 
dispersal of assemblies that are unlawful but non-violent, law enforcement officials shall avoid 
the use of force or, where that is not practicable, shall restrict such force to the minimum extent 
necessary. In the dispersal of violent assemblies, law enforcement officials may use firearms 
only when less dangerous means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent necessary.  
</p>
<p> In the light of the reports suggesting pervasive impunity for arbitrary killings by law 
enforcement officials, I would like to recall that your Government has a duty to investigate, 
prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life, and particularly those by state agents. The 
UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions (Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/65 of 24 May 1989) set 
forth the obligations descending from the right to life and Article 6 ICCPR in particular. 
Governments shall prohibit by law all extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions and shall </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 276 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ensure that any such executions are recognized as offences under their criminal laws, and are 
punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account the seriousness of such offences 
(Principle 1). This means that suspension from duty or other &#8220;corrective measures&#8221; (see the 
case of Carlos Cossa, Mustafa Assane Momede and Francisco Nhantumbo, and the case of 
Jul&#234;ncio Gove) are insufficient measures to address arbitrary killings, which require severe penal 
sanctions. 
</p>
<p> There shall be thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of 
extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions (Principle 9). Several of the cases reported to me 
raise concerns with regard to your Government meeting these requirements. As for promptness, 
most dramatically is the case of Geraldo Celestino Jo&#227;o, who was killed in March 2004. 
Four-and-a-half years later, the results of the investigation into this case are reportedly still not 
known and no trial date has been set. Impartiality of the investigation is also a major concern. In 
the case of Pedro Mulaudzi, for example, the police investigation reportedly concluded that the 
police officers involved had used their gun to immobilize the victim, not to kill, although the 
autopsy allegedly showed that Pedro Mulaudzi had been shot from the front in the heart.  
</p>
<p> In light of the reports received, I find it appropriate to stress that while an investigation into 
every killing by police forces must be promptly initiated by the authorities on their own motion 
(Principle 9), families of the deceased and their legal representatives shall be informed of, and 
have access to, any hearing as well as to all information relevant to the investigation 
(Principles 16). In the case of J&#250;lio Naftal Macule, reports suggest that the police failed to inform 
the family of the killing and then tried to prevent an autopsy being performed. A case was 
allegedly opened by the Procurator&#8217;s office eight months after the killing and only after lawyers 
of a human rights organization started to work on the issue. Most recently, the family has 
reportedly been asked to pay court fees before the case can proceed to trial. 
</p>
<p> Principle 15 of the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions provides that &#8220;[t]hose potentially implicated in 
extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be removed from any position of control or 
power, whether direct or indirect over complainants, witnesses and their families, as well as over 
those conducting investigations.&#8221; As a minimum, police officers implicated in suspected 
arbitrary killings should be suspended from duty or transferred to prevent them from influencing 
the investigation. This appears to be only rarely applied in Mozambique. Moreover, while it is 
true that &#8220;it shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody&#8221; 
(Article 9 ICCPR), given their particular capability to influence proceedings, pre-trial detention 
of police officers charged with arbitrary killing might often be appropriate. 
</p>
<p> Finally, I would like to recall that it is part and parcel of the right to life as protected in 
Article 6 ICCPR that the families and dependents of victims of extra-legal, arbitrary or summary 
executions shall be entitled to fair and adequate compensation within a reasonable period of time 
(Principle 20). 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to 
the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: </p>

<p><i>Killing of Geraldo Celestino Jo&#227;o 
</i> On 3 March 2004, Geraldo Celestino Jo&#227;o and two other men were arrested without a 
warrant by police officers from the 4th Police Station in the Manica province. When 
Geraldo Jo&#227;o asked why they were being arrested, one of the officers reportedly opened fire in 
his direction, but hit another officer in the right tibia. The other two officers then reportedly 
threw Geraldo Jo&#227;o face-down on the floor and shot him twice with a pistol. One shot entered 
the outside of his right thigh and exited through the groin. The other entered the inside of his left 
thigh and exited through the other side. The injured officer was taken to hospital, but 
Geraldo Jo&#227;o was reportedly left on the ground for 30 minutes during which time a police officer 
beat and kicked him. He was then taken to hospital where he died. An autopsy was carried out 
on 10 March 2004 at the request of a human rights organization. The results of the investigation 
are not yet known and no trial has been held to date.  
</p>
<p><i>Killing of Pedro Mulaudzi, 2005 
</i> Pedro Mulaudzi was shot dead by police in a police detention centre in the Niassa Province 
in 2005. The police alleged that he had attempted to escape, that they first shot in the air to warn 
him, and then at him to immobilize him as he did not stop running. An autopsy, however, 
showed that he had been shot from the front in the heart. A criminal process was instituted 
against the police officer who reportedly gave the order to shoot and the two officers who fired 
the shots. The Provincial Prosecutor requested that the police carry out an investigation. In spite </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 278 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>of the autopsy result, the police investigation concluded that the officers involved were not 
culpable as they had shot to immobilize, not to kill. No further action is known to have been 
taken. 
</p>
<p><i>Killing of Jul&#234;ncio Gove 
(This case was already the subject of a communication to your Government on 22 August 2006, 
which has regrettably remained without a reply) 
</i></p>
<p> On the morning of 8 January 2006, Jul&#234;ncio Gove witnessed six police officers from the 
7th Police station, in Matola, Maputo Province beating a young woman. He tried to intervene to 
help her but was warned not to interfere and threatened with a gun by one of the officers. He 
stepped back, but continued urging the police to stop beating the woman. One of the officers 
fired a shot at him. When he fell to the ground, the police officers began kicking him until they 
realized he was dead. The killing prompted demonstrations by hundreds of locals over the next 
week protesting against repeated police violence. The officer who had shot Jul&#234;ncio Gove was 
eventually arrested and charged with murder. The Station Commander said that the six members 
in question would be the target of &#8220;corrective measures&#8221;. However, the other police officers 
involved were not charged and the police officer who was arrested has not been tried to date. 
</p>
<p><i>Shootout killing of four men in Maxaquene, March 2006 
</i> On 17 March 2006, Samuel Nhambe, Aquilas Nguila, Candido Chirindza and 
Francisco Chirindza, four men who had escaped from Maputo security prison two days earlier, 
reportedly hijacked a minibus with a driver and three passengers in the vehicle. According to 
police statements, when the police found the minibus in the neighbourhood of Marracuene and 
apprehended the four men, they searched the bus for weapons, finding none, and then allowed 
the men to drive the minibus to Maputo under police escort. In Maxaquene, Maputo province, 
however, the men allegedly opened fire on the police with weapons they had hidden in the 
minibus and tried to escape. The four men were killed in the alleged shoot-out that ensued. No 
investigation is known to have been carried out into this incident to confirm that there was a 
shootout or establish what actually happened.  
</p>
<p><i>Killings in connection with attempted break-out at Maputo Central Prison, May 2006 
</i></p>
<p> In May 2006, there was an attempted prison break at Maputo Central Prison. According to 
the Minister of Justice, the police shot and killed two prisoners as they tried to escape by 
climbing over the prison walls and wounded eight others. Other reports, however, allegedly 
based on eye-witnesses, state that at least three prisoners were killed, some after they had been 
recaptured. No investigation was carried out into the killings to establish whether the force used 
was justified.  
<i>Carlos Cossa, Mustafa Assane Momede and Francisco Nhantumbo, April 2007 
</i> On the evening of 4 April 2007, three police officers took three detainees, Sousa Carlos 
Cossa, Mustafa Assane Momede and Francisco Nhantumbo, from a police station in Laulane, 
Maputo, to a sports field in the Costa do Sol neighbourhood, outside Maputo. At the sports field 
the police officers shot and killed the men. A human rights organization received information </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 279 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>about these killings from residents of the neighbourhood and informed the media. The police 
carried out an investigation. According to its findings, the three men had been taken into police 
custody after having been apprehended during an attempted break-in. They later agreed to show 
the police the location of other criminals in the Costa do Sol area, but tried to escape once there 
and were shot in the process.  
</p>
<p> An inquiry by the Procurator General, however, found that Carlos Cossa, Mustafa Assane 
Momede and Francisco Nhantumbo had been &#8220;summarily executed&#8221; by the police. Based on 
autopsy results it found that the three had been shot in the back of the neck at close range, which 
was incompatible with the account of events given by the police. The police officers were 
suspended from duty but, initially, the police refused to arrest them, despite an arrest warrant 
issued by the office of the Procurator of Maputo city. On 15 May 2007 the Commander General 
of Police finally confirmed that the three police officers had been arrested. Their trial was set for 
the end of 2007, but was later postponed. As of to date, the trial has not started. 
</p>
<p><i>Killing of Abrantes Afonso Penicela, August 2007 
</i> On 14 August 2007 at about 3 p.m., Abrantes Afonso Penicela was unexpectedly grabbed 
and pushed into a police car as he went to meet an acquaintance (the police had called him from 
that acquaintance&#8217;s mobile phone). In the car, the police officers then gave him an injection and 
drove him to a secluded area in the district of Xhinavane in Maputo province, where they beat 
him until he fainted. The police officers then shot him in the back of the neck and set fire to him 
before leaving the area thinking that he was dead. However, he survived and managed to crawl 
to a nearby road where he was found by people from the Xhinavane area. He was able to give 
details of his family to those who found him and was taken to Xhinavane Hospital.  
</p>
<p> The family reported the case to the police and an officer went to the Maputo Central 
Hospital to take a statement from Abrantes Penicela. His family recorded this testimony in the 
presence of the police. Abrantes Penicela died of his injuries on 15 August 2007. Police officials 
have stated that the case is being investigated, but the investigation appears not to have 
concluded yet and no police officer has so far been arrested for the killing. 
</p>
<p><i>Killing of J&#250;lio Naftal Macule, November 2007 
</i> In the early morning hours of 8 November 2007, J&#250;lio Naftal Macule was asleep in a hotel 
room in Massinga in Inhambane province, when members of the police For&#231;a da Interven&#231;&#227;o 
Rapida (Rapid Intervention Force, FIR) pushed open the door of his hotel room and shot him. He 
was hit by a bullet in the left thigh which caused a hemorrhage of which he died. It would appear 
that the FIR had mistaken him for one Agostinho Chauque. Soon after J&#250;lio Naftal Macule&#8217;s 
death, police authorities announced that they had captured and killed &#8220;the most wanted criminal 
in the country&#8221;, Agostinho Chauque. When journalists insisted to see the body, the police 
changed their statement and admitted that they had not caught Agostinho Chauque, but claimed 
that they had nonetheless caught and killed a dangerous criminal. 
</p>
<p> On the same day, the police took the body of J&#250;lio Naftal Macule to the morgue in 
Inhambane city. The following day, inhabitants of Massinga (and not the police) informed </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 280 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>J&#250;lio Naftal Macule&#8217;s family of his death. The family went to the police and asked for his body, 
but also insisted that an autopsy be carried out. Initially the police refused, claiming that there 
were no facilities in Inhambane, but eventually they agreed. The report of the autopsy states that 
death was caused by blood loss due to a bullet having perforated the femoral artery and vein. 
</p>
<p> On 26 June 2008, after a lawyer of a human rights organization started to assist them in 
seeking justice, J&#250;lio Naftal Macule&#8217;s family was informed that a case had opened in the office 
of the Inhambane Provincial Prosecutor (case number 255/07). The family was also told to pay 
procedural costs to the Massinga District Court, where the case would eventually be held. It 
appears that three police officers have been charged with murder, but have not been detained 
pending trial. Neither the police nor the Ministry of Interior have at any stage contacted the 
family to provide explanations on, or apologies for, the killing of J&#250;lio Naftal Macule. 
</p>
<p><i>Deaths at demonstration in Maputo on 5 February 2008 
</i></p>
<p> On 5 February 2008, demonstrators protesting against an increase in transport fares took to 
the streets of Maputo, blocking traffic and causing damage to property, including police vehicles. 
The police reportedly fired bullets into the air in a bid to disperse the crowds, but were not 
successful. They then started firing what they claimed were rubber bullets at the crowd. 
However, at least three people were killed and 30 were injured by stray, live ammunition. 
Related demonstrations occurred in the provinces of Inhambane and Gaza on 11 February 2008. 
In Gaza, live ammunition was once again used against demonstrators. The police spokesperson 
stated that live ammunition was used because some officers were caught by surprise by the 
rioters.

extrajudiciaires, arbitraires et sommaires et aux moyens d'enqu&#234;ter efficacement sur ces 
ex&#233;cutions) 
</p>
<p> Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial demande &#233;galement au Gouvernement de le tenir inform&#233; des 
progr&#232;s de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te sur le d&#233;c&#232;s de 7 personnes survenu le 9 d&#233;cembre 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation envoy&#233;e le 13 ao&#251;t 2008 
</b></p>
<p> Depuis juin 2007, au moins 78 personnes (voir la liste des victimes all&#233;gu&#233;es en annexe), 
la majeure partie d&#8217;entre elles appartenant &#224; la communaut&#233; Touareg, auraient &#233;t&#233; abattues de 
mani&#232;re extrajudiciaire dans les r&#233;gions du nord du pays. La plupart des victimes auraient &#233;t&#233; 
retrouv&#233;es enterr&#233;es, quelques-unes auraient aussi &#233;t&#233; tortur&#233;es. Les rapports indiquent la 
responsabilit&#233; directe des Forces Arm&#233;es Nig&#233;riennes (FAN) dans ces actes.  
</p>
<p> Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que ces ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires pourraient avoir eu lieu en repr&#233;sailles aux 
attaques lanc&#233;es par le mouvement d&#8217;opposition arm&#233; Touareg Mouvement des Nig&#233;riens pour la 
Justice (MNJ), dans le contexte de la reprise des activit&#233;s arm&#233;es en f&#233;vrier 2007. Plus 
pr&#233;cis&#233;ment, la plupart des attaques contre les civils auraient eu lieu &#224; la suite d&#8217;explosions de 
mines contre des militaires des FAN et leurs v&#233;hicules.  
</p>
<p> Sans vouloir &#224; ce stade me prononcer sur les faits qui m&#8217;ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, je voudrais faire 
r&#233;f&#233;rence aux r&#232;gles coutumi&#232;res du droit international humanitaire r&#233;gissant les conflits arm&#233;s, y 
compris la prohibition de diriger des attaques contre la population civile. Les civils sont toutes 
les personnes qui ne sont pas membres des forces arm&#233;es d&#8217;une partie au conflit. Les personnes 
civiles sont prot&#233;g&#233;es contre les attaques, sauf si elles participent directement aux hostilit&#233;s et 
pendant la dur&#233;e de cette participation. (R&#232;gles 1,5 et 6 de r&#232;gles coutumi&#232;res du droit 
international humanitaire, identifi&#233;s par le Comit&#233; Internationale de la Croix Rouge (&#171; R&#232;gles 
Coutumi&#232;res &#187;)). 
</p>
<p> Par ailleurs, il n&#8217;est jamais permis de tuer une personne qui a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;j&#224; d&#233;tenue ou autrement 
mise hors de combat. Une telle atteinte &#224; la vie constitue un meurtre en vertu du droit 
international humanitaire, peu importe que la personne ait &#233;t&#233; un civil ou un combattant. 
(Article 3 commun aux quatre Conventions de Gen&#232;ve de 1949, R&#232;gles 87 et 89 des R&#232;gles 
Coutumi&#232;res). 
</p>
<p> De plus, les parties &#224; des conflits arm&#233;s non internationaux n&#8217;ont pas le droit de recourir &#224; 
des mesures de repr&#233;sailles. Les autres contre-mesures contre des personnes qui ne participent 
pas ou qui ont cess&#233; de participer directement aux hostilit&#233;s sont interdites. (R&#232;gle 148 des 
R&#232;gles Coutumi&#232;res). 
</p>
<p> Je voudrais aussi rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence ses obligations en vertu 
du droit international des droits de l&#8217;homme. En particulier, je voudrais r&#233;f&#233;rer aux principes 
fondamentaux &#233;nonc&#233;s par l&#8217;article 3 de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de l&#8217;Homme et 
r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;s par l&#8217;article 6 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, o&#249; il est stipul&#233; 
que tout individu a le droit &#224; la vie et &#224; la s&#251;ret&#233; de sa personne, que ce droit doit &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233; par 
la loi, et que nul ne peut &#234;tre arbitrairement priv&#233; de la vie. </p>

</p>
<p> Par ailleurs je voudrais attirer l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de votre Excellence sur les 
principes relatifs &#224; la pr&#233;vention efficace des ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, r&#233;solution 1989/65 du 
24 mai 1989 du Conseil &#233;conomique et social. En particulier les principes 9 &#224; 19 obligent les 
Gouvernements &#224; mener des enqu&#234;tes approfondies et impartiales dans tous les cas o&#249; l&#8217;on 
soup&#231;onnera des ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, arbitraires ou sommaires, comme il a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;it&#233;r&#233; par 
la 61&#232;me session de la Commission des Droits de l&#8217;Homme dans la R&#233;solution 2005/34 relative 
aux ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, sommaires ou arbitraires. La Commission a ajout&#233; que cette 
obligation comprend une obligation d&#8217;identifier et de traduire en justice les responsables, de 
fournir une compensation ad&#233;quate dans un d&#233;lai raisonnable pour les victimes ou leurs familles 
et d&#8217;adopter toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires, y compris des mesures l&#233;gales et judiciaires, afin 
d&#8217;&#233;viter la r&#233;currence de telles ex&#233;cutions. De plus, les plaignants, les t&#233;moins, les personnes 
charg&#233;es de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te et leurs familles doivent &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233;s contre les violences ou toute autre 
forme d&#8217;intimidation. 
</p>
<p> Tel qu&#8217;indiqu&#233; pr&#233;c&#233;demment dans un rapport pr&#233;sent&#233; au Conseil des Droits de l&#8217;Homme 
(E/CN.4/2006/53), l&#8217;obligation d&#8217;enqu&#234;te et de poursuite ne cesse pas en situation de conflit 
arm&#233;, comme c&#8217;est le cas concernant le conflit opposant le MNJ et les FAN.  
</p>
<p> Dans le cas o&#249; vos enqu&#234;tes appuient ou sugg&#232;rent l&#8217;exactitude des all&#233;gations ci-jointes, je 
prie le Gouvernement de votre Excellence de prendre toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour assurer 
la protection des droits et des libert&#233;s des individus mentionn&#233;s, de diligenter des enqu&#234;tes sur 
les violations perp&#233;tr&#233;es et de traduire les responsables en justice. Je prie aussi le Gouvernement 
de votre Excellence d&#8217;adopter toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour pr&#233;venir la r&#233;p&#233;tition des faits 
mentionn&#233;s. 
</p>
<p> Il est de ma responsabilit&#233;, en vertu du mandat qui m&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; confi&#233; par le Conseil des droits 
de l&#8217;homme de solliciter votre coop&#233;ration pour tirer au clair les cas qui ont &#233;t&#233; port&#233;s &#224; notre 
attention. Etant dans l&#8217;obligation de faire rapport de ces cas au Conseil des Droits de l&#8217;Homme, 
je serais reconnaissant au Gouvernement de Votre Excellence de ses observations sur les points 
suivants : 
</p>
<p> 1. Les faits tels que relat&#233;s dans le r&#233;sum&#233; du cas sont-ils exacts? Si tel n&#8217;est pas le cas, 
quelles enqu&#234;tes ont &#233;t&#233; men&#233;es pour conclure &#224; leur r&#233;futation ?  
</p>
<p> 2. Au cas o&#249; une plainte a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e, quelles suites lui ont &#233;t&#233; donn&#233;es ?  
</p>
<p> 3. Veuillez fournir toute information, et &#233;ventuellement tout r&#233;sultat des enqu&#234;tes 
men&#233;es, autopsies, investigations judiciaires et autres men&#233;es en relation avec les faits. 
</p><p> 4. Si les all&#233;gations sont av&#233;r&#233;es, veuillez fournir toute information sur les poursuites et 
proc&#233;dures engag&#233;es contre les auteurs de la violence. 
</p>
<p> 5. Le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, veuillez indiquer si les familles des victimes ont &#233;t&#233; indemnis&#233;es. 
</p>
<p> 6. Les membres des FAN ont-ils re&#231;u des ordres sp&#233;cifiques concernant l&#8217;interdiction 
d&#8217;attaquer la population civile? Si non, pourquoi ? </p>

M. <b>Bikim ag Ilyas</b>, M. <b>Akloua ag Hama</b>, M. <b>Oumra Lahcen</b>. Parmi les 12 victimes, 
2 sont de nationalit&#233; alg&#233;rienne. M. Mohamed ag Akarfa aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; aussi mais 
aurait pu s&#8217;&#233;chapper et t&#233;moigner par la suite.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Le 1 octobre 2007, les FAN auraient arr&#234;t&#233; un convoi de cinq v&#233;hicules pr&#232;s de la 
fronti&#232;re avec l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie. Les passagers auraient &#233;t&#233; oblig&#233;s d&#8217;abandonner leurs 
v&#233;hicules, et s&#233;par&#233;s selon leur couleur de peau. <b>12 personnes </b>de peau plus claire, ne 
portant pas d&#8217;armes et suppos&#233;s Touaregs, auraient &#233;t&#233; s&#233;par&#233;es du groupe par les 
militaires, qui les auraient abattus. Les faits auraient &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233;s aux autorit&#233;s dans les 
villes de Tamanrasset (Alg&#233;rie) et Arlit par les t&#233;moins des ex&#233;cutions.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Le 19 novembre 2007, les FAN auraient abattus <b>Adam Abarchi</b> et 
<b>Ghoumour Assaleh</b>, aux environs de la localit&#233; d&#8217;Atri, dans la r&#233;gion d&#8217;Agadez. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Le 22 novembre 2007, quatre personnes, M. <b>Bachir Mouhamad</b>, M. <b>Mariko Kan&#233;</b>, 
M.<b> Oukhoudane Algha</b>, M. <b>Hamad Ibrahim</b>, &#233;leveurs et jardiniers auraient &#233;t&#233;

&#224; la suite de l&#8217;explosion d&#8217;une mine. Alors que les gendarmes voulaient interroger ces 
suspects, des &#233;l&#233;ments des FAN se sont empar&#233;s de ces quatre personnes. Leurs corps 
auraient &#233;t&#233; retrouv&#233;s cinq jours plus tard dans une fosse commune. Selon les rapports, 
les corps portaient des traces de balles au c&#339;ur, au front et &#224; l&#8217;oreille.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Le 9 d&#233;cembre 2007, <b>sept personnes</b>, y compris deux commer&#231;ants arabes, <b>Ibrahim

ont &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;es sur la route par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; nig&#233;riennes. Les familles des 
victimes qui les attendaient &#224; Agadez auraient vu arriver leurs v&#233;hicules conduits par 
des militaires. Ils auraient alors tent&#233; d&#8217;obtenir des informations concernant les </p>

confirm&#233; le 10 d&#233;cembre les d&#233;c&#232;s des 7 personnes, et les auraient conduits &#224; l&#8217;endroit

nombreuses marques de br&#251;lures de cigarettes et de coups de ceintures ainsi que de 
multiples impacts de balles au visage et &#224; la poitrine. Les familles auraient obtenu une 
autopsie. Cependant, aucune enqu&#234;te n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; faite &#224; ce jour.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Le 12 d&#233;cembre 2007, M. <b>Balla Hadaba et ses 3 fils, Akidima, Ahmad et

<p>&#8722; Le 20 mars 2008, M. <b>Abdoussalam Amadou Zamanka</b>, Imam de la mosqu&#233;e de 
Boughoul, qui avait &#233;t&#233; enlev&#233; par les FAN auparavant, aurait &#233;t&#233; tortur&#233; et ensuite 
ex&#233;cut&#233; par celles-ci. Deux autres personnes ayant subi &#233;galement des tortures par les 
FAN, et ensuite lib&#233;r&#233;s, auraient &#233;t&#233; t&#233;moins &#224; ces actes. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Entre le 21 et le 25 mars 2008, suite &#224; des affrontements violents entre le MNJ et les 
FAN &#224; Tamazlakh, ces derniers s&#8217;en seraient pris &#224; des civils et leurs biens dans 
plusieurs endroits. A Tamazlakh, les FAN auraient ex&#233;cut&#233;s <b>au moins 3 personnes</b>,

Les jambes de M. Imolane auraient &#233;t&#233; fractur&#233;es. Au campement de Tabouhait, les 
FAN auraient tu&#233; M. <b>Mohamed El Moctar,</b> un jardinier. Avant de l&#8217;ex&#233;cuter, les FAN 
auraient frapp&#233; M. El Moctar avec leurs fusils. A Ghabda, &#224; 10 km de Dabaga, l&#8217;&#233;leveur

sa t&#234;te. Les FAN auraient aussi enlev&#233; deux autres personnes, et pill&#233; et d&#233;truit des 
maisons et autres biens de la communaut&#233;, y compris 60 animaux. Selon les rapports, 
l&#8217;axe qui m&#232;ne &#224; cette localit&#233; est actuellement occup&#233; par les Forces de d&#233;fense et de 
s&#233;curit&#233; rendant impossibles les d&#233;placements de la population. Plusieurs personnes la 
communaut&#233; se sont enfuies dans la montagne.  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Le 10 avril 2008, M. <b>Gousmane Bilal</b>, chef du village de la commune de Dabaga, aurait

<p><b>R&#233;ponse du gouvernement nig&#233;rien du 21 avril 2009 
</b></p>
<p> Le Gouvernement du Niger a fourni les informations suivantes :  
</p>
<p> Dans sa ferme d&#233;termination &#224; &#233;lucider cette affaire, le Gouvernement de la R&#233;publique du 
Niger a instruit la gendarmerie pour sillonner la r&#233;gion d&#8217;Agadez, aller &#224; la rencontre de la 
population pour investiguer et recueillir des plaintes &#233;ventuelles, a l&#8217;issue de cette mission, 
aucune plainte relative aux actes d&#8217;abus, de tortures, de traitements, d&#233;gradants ou d&#8217;ex&#233;cutions 
extrajudiciaires par les forces de d&#233;fenses et de s&#233;curit&#233; n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; enregistr&#233;e. 
 Depuis f&#233;vrier 2007, d&#233;but de l&#8217;affaire en objet, une seule plainte &#233;manant d&#8217;une famille de 
sept individus et une d&#233;claration de disparition ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;es &#224; la Gendarmerie nationale. Tout 
le reste n&#8217;est que rumeur et sp&#233;culation v&#233;hicul&#233;es par des individus cupides qui veulent 
transformer les questions de droit de l&#8217;homme en fonds de commerce. 
</p>
<p> Aussi, pour r&#233;tablir la v&#233;rit&#233;, soumettons-nous &#224; votre attention, les donn&#233;es ci-apr&#232;s qui 
constituent le film des &#233;v&#232;nements tels qu&#8217;ils s&#8217;&#233;taient produits. 
</p>
<p>(1) le 10 juin 2007, selon l&#8217;information re&#231;ue par les services de Gendarmerie, il y eut 
trois v&#233;hicules de l&#8217;Arm&#233;e qui ont saut&#233; sur des mines. Premi&#232;rement, tr&#232;s t&#244;t le 
matin, le v&#233;hicule militaire a saut&#233; sur une mine faisant des morts et des bless&#233;s. Un 
second v&#233;hicule de l&#8217;arm&#233;e portant secours aux bless&#233;s a &#233;galement saut&#233; sur une 
autre mine. Juste apr&#232;s ce dernier, fait, les militaires ont aper&#231;u des hommes courir, 
sortante de la vall&#233;e. Ils les rattrapent et les fouillent. Ils trouvaient sur eux des 
allumeurs et d&#233;tonateurs, ainsi qu&#8217;une lettre provenant d&#8217;un Chef de bandits. A vu de 
ces indices graves, le Chef de mission les a embarqu&#233;s dans un v&#233;hicule avec les 
bless&#233;s pour &#234;tre conduits &#224; If&#233;rouane o&#249; ils seront remis &#224; la Gendarmerie pour 
enqu&#234;te. A peine le v&#233;hicule a-t-il d&#233;marr&#233; qu&#8217;il sauta sur un mine faisant cinq morts 
dont les trois vieillards qui y ont pris place et dont les noms ont &#233;t&#233; cit&#233;s dans le 
rapport. Le Docteur DANGANA, peu avant son d&#233;part pour le MNJ, a confirm&#233; &#224; la 
Gendarmerie que les tris vieillards ont pris place dans un v&#233;hicule de l&#8217;Arm&#233;e, lequel 
a pris la direction d&#8217;If&#233;rouane. Aucune plainte n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e &#224; la Gendarmerie. 
</p>
<p>(2) La Gendarmerie n&#8217;a re&#231;u aucune information sur les pr&#233;tendues ex&#233;cutions du 
26 ao&#251;t 2007, des nomades voyageant entre Iff&#233;rouane et Gougaram et aucune 
plainte n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e. Il s&#8217;agit donc des all&#233;gations sans fondements. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(3) Concernant les douze civils qui seraient ex&#233;cut&#233;s le 27 septembre 2007 par une 
patrouille de l&#8217;Arm&#233;e venant d&#8217;Assamaka, aucun renseignement n&#8217;est parvenu &#224; la 
Gendarmerie et aucune plainte n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; enregistr&#233;e. Les Forces Arm&#233;es Nig&#233;riennes 
ne reconnaissent pas avoir pos&#233; de tels actes. Il ne s&#8217;agit que de rumeurs d&#233;nu&#233;es de 
tout fondement. 
</p>
<p>(4) La Gendarmerie n&#8217;a pas eu connaissance des ces &#233;v&#233;nements qui se seraient d&#233;roul&#233;s 
le 10 octobre 2007 &#224; la fronti&#232;re avec l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie o&#249; douze touaregs auraient &#233;t&#233; 
massacr&#233;s par l&#8217;Arm&#233;e. La Gendarmerie Nationale n&#8217;a jamais &#233;t&#233; saisie desdits faits. 
</p>
<p>(5) Apr&#232;s le 19 novembre 2007, les familles d&#8217;ADAM ABARCH et de 
GHOUMOU ASSALEK n&#8217;ont ni port&#233; l&#8217;affaire &#224; la connaissance de la Gendarmerie 
ni port&#233; plainte. Pourtant Atri, o&#249; ils habitent, est tr&#232;s proche d&#8217;Agadez. 
</p>
<p>(6) Le 22 novembre 2007, la Gendarmerie n&#8217;&#233;tait pas en patrouille &#224; Tchinta bizguine, et 
il n&#8217;y pas eu de patrouille mixte FAN-Gendarmerie dans la dite zone, &#224; la date 
pr&#233;cit&#233;e. Mais le 21 novembre, un v&#233;hicule avec &#224; son bord, huit bandit arm&#233;s a &#233;t&#233; 
signal&#233;. Ces malfrats &#233;taient &#224; la recherche de l&#8217;informateur de l&#8217;arm&#233;e d&#233;tenant un 
t&#233;l&#233;phone Thuraya. Le 24 novembre, le m&#234;me v&#233;hicule a &#233;t&#233; signal&#233; de nouveau dans 
la m&#234;me zone et les bandits &#233;taient accompagn&#233;s d&#8217;un journaliste muni d&#8217;une 
cam&#233;ra. Concernant cette affaire, aucun &#233;l&#233;ment objectif ne permet d&#8217;&#233;tablir la 
v&#233;racit&#233; des griefs articul&#233;s contre les FAN. A ce jour, aucune plainte n&#8217;&#224; &#233;t&#233; 
enregistr&#233;e &#224; ce sujet par les unit&#233;s d&#8217;enqu&#234;te. 
</p>
<p>(7) L&#8217;affaire du 9 d&#233;cembre 2007 est en cours de traitement. Toutes les parties 
concern&#233;es ont &#233;t&#233; entendues. Le proc&#232;s-verbal a &#233;t&#233; transmis au procureur de la 
R&#233;publique. Aucune autopsie n&#8217;a pu &#234;tre effectu&#233;e sur les corps, parce que la saisine 
avait &#233;t&#233; effectu&#233;e un mois plus tard &#224; un moment o&#249; les corps &#233;taient donc en &#233;tat de 
d&#233;composition avanc&#233;e. Toutes les remarques rapport&#233;es sur les corps ne reposent 
sur aucune preuve. Et la proc&#233;dure suit son cours, conform&#233;ment aux lois de la 
R&#233;publique en vigueur, en vue de situer les responsabilit&#233;s. 
</p>
<p>(8) Le pr&#233;tendu d&#233;c&#232;s de MOUSSA BALLA HADABA et de ses trois fils, le 
12 d&#233;cembre 2007, n&#8217;a pas fait l&#8217;objet de d&#233;claration et de plainte &#224; la Gendarmerie. 
Il s&#8217;agit des faits qui ne reposent sur aucune preuve. 
</p>
<p>(9) Le 1er mars 2008, trois chameliers auraient &#233;t&#233; ex&#233;cut&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;entr&#233;e de Gougram par 
l&#8217;arm&#233;e. Cette information n&#8217;est jamais parvenue aux unit&#233;s d&#8217;enqu&#234;te, comp&#233;tentes 
et aucune plainte n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e &#224; ce jour. 
</p>
<p>(10) La pr&#233;tendue ex&#233;cution, le 20 mars 2008, de Monsieur ABDOULSALAM AMADOU 
ZAMANKA, iman de la mosqu&#233;e de Bougoul par les FAN, repose sur une 
information aussi fausse que toutes les autres. D&#232;s le 21 mars, la Gendarmerie a re&#231;u 
une d&#233;claration de disparition de personne. Une enqu&#234;te a &#233;t&#233; ouverte et des 
recherches ont &#233;t&#233; engag&#233;es. Un mois plus tard, ABDOULSALAM a &#233;t&#233; retrouv&#233; et 
pr&#233;sent&#233; aux autorit&#233;s civiles et militaires.  </p>

</p>
<p>ABOULSALAM a &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; le 19 mars, veille du mouloud 2007 par un peloton en 
patrouille. Il a &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233; apr&#232;s avoir &#233;t&#233; entendu. 
</p>
<p>(11) Le 21 et 25 mars 2008, des violents combats ont oppos&#233; les forces r&#233;guli&#232;res aux 
bandits arm&#233;s &#224; Tamzalak et &#224; Ti&#232;ne. Monsieur AMOUMANE KALAKOUA, Chef 
d&#8217;Etat Major des bandits arm&#233;s, surpris &#224; Tid&#232;ne, a subitement ouvert le feu sur les 
FAN pour se d&#233;gager et se couvrir. Il &#233;tait lourdement arm&#233;. Les &#233;tincelles de ses 
balles ont pu atteindre des cases et provoqu&#233; la mort des populations civiles. 
</p>
<p>(12) Le 26 mars 2008, les bandits arm&#233;s ont occasionn&#233; le d&#233;c&#232;s de plusieurs civils et 
brul&#233; un case. La Gendarmerie n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; saisie d&#8217;aucune plainte &#224; ce sujet. Toutefois, le 
gouvernement comme &#224; l&#8217;accoutum&#233;e, a pris des dispositions pur garantir la s&#233;curit&#233; 
des populations et de leurs biens. 
</p>
<p>(13) Le 10 avril 2008, MOUSSA GOUSMANE BILAL a &#233;t&#233; ex&#233;cut&#233;. Son corps a &#233;t&#233; 
retrouv&#233; cribl&#233; de balles derri&#232;re le village. Il n&#8217;est pas le Chef du village de Dabaga 
mais d&#8217;Elm&#233;ki o&#249; il a trouv&#233; la mort. Le 10 avril, l&#8217;Arm&#233;e n&#8217;&#233;tait pas encore arriv&#233;e 
&#224; Elm&#233;ki. Il a &#233;t&#233; nultamment enlev&#233; par deux individus en pr&#233;sence de sa femme qui 
les a formellement identifies. Il s&#8217;agit de ISSA et HAMOU DODO. Le premier a 
perdu la vie au cours d&#8217;un accrochage entre l&#8217;Arm&#233;e et les bandits &#224; Tid&#232;ne. Le 
deuxi&#232;me qui est un cadre MNJ, activement recherch&#233; pour atrocit&#233;s commises sur 
les populations civiles, court toujours. La femme du d&#233;funt a bien suivi leurs 
conversations. Les discussions ont commenc&#233; dans la case, lorsque HAMOU 
demandait au Chef du village la lettre qu&#8217;il avait l&#8217;intention d&#8217;adresser au 
Gouverneur, sollicitant une base militaire a Elm&#233;ki. Devant son ent&#234;tement &#224; ne pas 
reconna&#238;tre ladite lettre, ils l&#8217;ont conduit derri&#232;re le village ou son corps a &#233;t&#233; 
retrouv&#233; cribl&#233; de balles, la femme a &#233;t&#233; intimid&#233;e et menac&#233;e par ceux-l&#224; m&#234;me qui 
ont tu&#233; son &#233;poux, en vue de la dissuader &#224; porter plainte. 
</p>
<p>(14) Le 22 mai 2008, a vu de la destruction d&#8217;une des plus grandes bases des bandits 
arm&#233;s, cella la m&#234;me qui leur servait de lieu de campement. Ce jour l&#224;, AGALY et

<p><b>Nigeria:  Killing of Paul Abayomi Ogundeji and Godwin Agbroko 
Violation alleged</b>: Deaths due to the use of force by law enforcement officials or persons acting 
in direct or indirect compliance with the State, when the use of force is inconsistent with the 
criteria of absolute necessity and proportionality 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 2 males (journalists)

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Nigeria has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 3 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning the killing of Mr <b>Paul Abayomi Ogundeji</b>, a member of the editorial 
board of the Lagos-based private daily newspaper <i>Thisday</i>. Mr Ogundeji was a former Features 
Editor of the <i>Punch Newspapers</i>, one time Editor of <i>The Sunday Comet</i> and Chief Press 
Secretary to former Lagos state deputy governor Mr Femi Pedro. We would also like to seek 
information regarding the killing of another journalist, Mr <b>Godwin Agbroko</b>, in 2007, as the 
investigation into the case reportedly remains inconclusive.  
</p>
<p>According to information received: 
</p>
<p>On 17 August 2008 at approximately 11 p.m., Mr Paul Abayomi Ogundeji was shot dead 
near the Dopemu bridge, in a suburb of Lagos. Police reports claim that Mr Ogundeji 
was ambushed by armed robbers who had earlier stolen a car. The police allege that 
Mr Ogundeji was on his way home when he was stopped by the armed men and ordered </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 289 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>to get out of his car. When Mr Ogundeji refused to comply with these demands he was shot 
by the assailants and died at the scene. No items were reportedly removed from the Kia 
Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) which Mr Ogundeji was driving. 
According to other reports, however, eye witness accounts from local residents in the 
Dopemu area claim that Mr Paul Abayomi Ogundeji was shot at close range by men in 
police uniforms who were manning a police checkpoint at the time. It is believed that an 
argument ensued between Mr Paul Abayomi Ogundeji and one of the police officers when 
Mr Ogundeji refused to step out of his car. The police officer then reportedly shot 
Mr Ogundeji in the head before boarding the police vehicle with colleagues and leaving the 
scene. Mr Ogundeji&#8217;s body was later taken to the Lagos State University Teaching 
Hospital (LASUTH), by policemen from Idimu Division. 
</p>
<p>An official police investigation has been opened by the Special Investigation Unit of the 
Police Force in Abuja in relation to the killing of Mr, Paul Abayomi Ogundeji. The 
investigation is reportedly being led headed by Commissioner M. Ali Amadu.  
</p>
<p> The reports received regarding the killing of Mr Ogundeji bear a preoccupying 
resemblance to reports regarding the killing of another journalist of the same publication 
20 months earlier: 
</p>
<p>Mr <b>Godwin Agbroko</b>, chairman of the editorial board of <i>Thisday</i>, was killed 
on 22 December 2006, in similar circumstances. He was found dead at the wheel of his car, 
by a roadside in the Isolo district in Lagos, just after he had left his office. A police 
investigation was opened into the killing of Mr Godwin Agbroko, and police initially 
pursued the theory of a botched robbery. However, apparently none of his personal 
belongings had been stolen, including a mobile phone worth several thousand Nairas. No 
further evidence of an attempted robbery was made public, and on 15 January 2007 the 
police announced that he may have been killed by &#8220;unknown assassins.&#8221; As of today, 
police investigations remain inconclusive and no arrests have been made in connection 
with Mr Godwin Agbroko&#8217;s case. Mr Agbroko had edited several newspapers during the 
military rule of 1993 to 1999 and was reportedly detained at least twice during those years.  
</p>
<p> While the reported police investigation into the killing of Mr Ogundeji is welcomed, 
concern is expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to prevent 
independent reporting in Nigeria.  
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, in particular whether 
Mr Ogundeji was shot by armed robbers or policemen, we would like to refer your Government 
to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, 
that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or 
her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p> Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement officials only when 
strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved. 
As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
(&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement officials shall, as far as possible, apply </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 290 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>non-violent means before resorting to the use of force (Basic Principles, Principle 4). Further, 
whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise 
restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, minimize injury, and respect 
human life (Basic Principles, Principle 5). Intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made 
when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life (Basic Principles, Principle 9).  
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that your Government has a 
duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. To fulfill this legal 
obligation, there must be thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all suspected cases of 
extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions. Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention 
and Investigation Principles&#8221;) provides guidelines for investigations, which includes conducting 
an adequate autopsy, and the collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence. 
Families of the deceased should be informed of information relevant to the investigation, and the 
findings of the investigation should be made public (Prevention and Investigation Principles, 
Principles 16 and 17). 
</p>
<p> We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the above mentioned person, in 
accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right 
shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of 
his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> We also deem it appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of the Commission 
on Human Rights, which calls upon states to ensure that victims of violations of the right to 
freedom of expression have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and acts of 
violence against journalists, and to bring to justice those responsible to combat impunity. We are 
concerned that killings of journalists, particularly if they remain unpunished, could create a 
climate of impunity and result in preventing independent reporting and stifling freedom of 
expression. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the summary of the cases accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the killing of 
Mr Paul Abayomi Ogundeji. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please 
provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. If no inquiries have 
taken place or if they have been inconclusive please explain why.  </p>

<p><b>Nigeria:  Forced evictions and lethal use of force by the police

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Nigeria has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 8 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to 
non-discrimination in this context 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s government to 
allegations I have received regarding <b>forced evictions and demolitions of houses in 
Gosa Sariki and Toge between May and June 2008, as well as threats of further evictions 
and demolitions in Abuja</b>. We would also like to draw the attention of your Government to 
allegations we have received regarding <b>lethal use of force by the police</b> in confronting protests 
related to these forced evictions. 
</p>
<p> Reports indicate that in May 2008, a number of homes in the Gosa Sariki village alongside 
the Nnamdi Azikiwe airport road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Abuja were 
demolished by bulldozers and residents were made homeless. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, forced evictions and demolitions were conducted 
with inappropriate or no prior notice. It is alleged that officials from the Department of 
Development Control and the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) visited residents 
of the Gosa Sariki village on 5 May 2008. They informed them that homes up to 150 metres 
from the airport road in the village were to be demolished the next day. However, it is further 
alleged that on 6 May 2008, bulldozers demolished homes in the Gosa Sariki village up to 
300 metres from the airport road, thus a significant proportion of residents who had received no 
information were faced with the destruction of their homes. It is also alleged that many residents 
in the Gosa Sariki village lost their personal belongings as they were not given adequate time by 
FCDA officials to recover their possessions before their houses were bulldozed.  
</p>
<p> Reportedly the same situation occurred in Toge in June 2008, where houses and personal 
belongings were destroyed by bulldozers with insufficient or no prior notice. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 292 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Reports indicate that, as a consequence of these forced evictions, many families and 
individuals are now homeless, without shelter and living in the open air. 
</p>
<p> In both cases, no adequate consultations had previously taken place with the affected 
communities and individuals. The absence of adequate relocation, accommodation or 
compensation has allegedly further impoverished inhabitants of these areas that were already 
living in poverty. The majority of the constructions that were demolished in Gosa and Toge were 
reportedly housing structures of 1 to 3 rooms, stalls and shops where some community members 
sold their wares. It is alleged that many residents consequently lost their livelihoods, including 
those who operated small businesses from houses or in shops that were demolished.  
</p>
<p> In the case of Toge, residents allegedly obtained a court injunction in early June 2008 
preventing the demolition of their homes, which was served on the FCDA. A hearing was 
allegedly scheduled at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory to decide on the issue of 
the demolitions. However, the information states that this injunction was ignored by the FCDA, 
which carried out the demolition of homes on 13 June 2008 regardless of the court injunction.  
 In addition, the information received alleges that the forced evictions and demolitions were 
carried out with disproportionate use of force, including the use of violence. The allegations state 
that a large police presence was brought into the community during the demolition process 
which targeted protestors against the demolitions with violence. It is alleged that four protestors 
(Issa Buruku, Kabiru Abubakar, Dan Asebe and Ismaila Abdullahi) were shot, with three being 
injured and one killed. Two of the injured are still allegedly in a critical condition. According to 
the reports received, the police allegedly denied culpability during a police investigation.  
</p>
<p> Reportedly, these evictions are justified by the FCDA as being part of the belated 
implementation of the 1979 Abuja Master Plan. Allegedly, the implementation of this plan has 
led to a pattern of forced evictions and demolitions of informal settlements without consultation 
or compensation since 2003. Evictions and demolitions in Abuja communities and other 
informal settlements, including in the Municipality of Gwagwalada, have reportedly taken place 
since 2003/2004, by the Federal Capital Development Authority. Excluding the most recent 
wave of evictions and demolitions, it is alleged that the total number of dispossessed and 
homeless people amounts to an estimated 800,000 persons.  
</p>
<p> We wish to remind your Excellency that this situation was already the subject of a 
communication by the previous Special Rapporteur on adequate housing on 9 June 2006. 
Regretfully, no response to this communication has been received to date. 
</p>
<p> Further reports state that additional evictions and demolitions are scheduled for the Abuja 
area. In this context, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
provisions contained in the international legal instruments that Nigeria has ratified, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (article 11.1). In 1991, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted General Comment No. 4 on the 
right to adequate housing, which defines seven basic dimensions of the right, which Government 
must ensure. These include guaranteeing: (a) legal security of tenure; (b) availability of services, 
materials, facilities and infrastructure; (c) affordability; (d) habitability; (e) accessibility; 
(f) location; and (g) cultural adequacy. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 293 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In General Comment No. 7 on forced evictions, adopted by the Committee in 1997, it is 
recognized that &#8220;forced evictions are prima facie incompatible with the requirements of the 
Covenant&#8221; and explicit guidance is provided on how Governments can pursue enduring 
solutions. The Committee further stated that:   
</p>
<p>&#8220;15. Appropriate procedural protection and due process are essential aspects of all human 
rights but are especially pertinent in relation to a matter such as forced evictions which 
directly invokes a large number of the rights recognized in both the International 
Covenants on Human Rights. The Committee considers that the procedural protections 
which should be applied in relation to forced evictions include: (a) an opportunity for 
genuine consultation with those affected; (b) adequate and reasonable notice for all 
affected persons prior to the scheduled date of eviction; (c) information on the proposed 
evictions, and, where applicable, on the alternative purpose for which the land or housing 
is to be used, to be made available in reasonable time to all those affected; (d) especially 
where groups of people are involved, government officials or their representatives to be 
present during an eviction; (e) all persons carrying out the eviction to be properly 
identified; (f) evictions not to take place in particularly bad weather or at night unless the 
affected persons consent otherwise; (g) provision of legal remedies; and (h) provision, 
where possible, of legal aid to persons who are in need of it to seek redress from the courts. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;16. Evictions should not result in individuals being rendered homeless or vulnerable to 
the violation of other human rights. Where those affected are unable to provide for 
themselves, the State party must take all appropriate measures, to the maximum of its 
available resources, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement or access to 
productive land, as the case may be, is available.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We should also like to draw to your attention the importance in international law of the 
protection of the right to adequate housing for communities, in particular women and children, in 
operative paragraph 11, (a) of resolution 2003/27 under which the Commission on Human 
Rights reaffirmed, including with respect to forced evictions: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;To give full effect to housing rights, including through domestic development 
policies at the appropriate level of government and with international assistance and 
cooperation, giving particular attention to the individuals, most often women and children, 
and communities living in extreme poverty, and to security of tenure; [&#8230;]&#8221; 
</p>
<p> It has been alleged that a number of the residents in Gosa Sariki and Toge forfeited their 
rights to alternative measures such as compensation because they were squatting in houses that 
were not built legally. Regardless of the truth of the allegation, in General Comment No.7 it is 
recognised that &#8220;where eviction is considered to be justified, it should be carried out in strict 
compliance with the relevant provisions of international human rights law and in accordance 
with general principles of reasonableness and proportionality&#8221; (Paragraph 14). General Comment 
No.7 also indicates that &#8220;state parties shall ensure, prior to carrying out any evictions, and 
particularly those involving large groups, that all feasible alternatives are explored in 
consultation with the affected persons, with a view to avoiding, or at least minimizing, the need 
to use force. Legal remedies or procedures should be provided to those who are affected by 
eviction orders&#8221; (Paragraph 13). </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 294 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> With particular concern for the rights of all residents of Abuja, it is of utmost importance 
that your Excellency&#8217;s Government take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected at the present and in the future. We also 
request that your Government, upon consideration of the legality of these actions, adopts 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of acts found to be in contradictions of obligations 
under international human rights law to which Nigeria is a party. This includes taking all 
necessary measures to guarantee that rights and freedoms are protected and accountability of any 
persons guilty of any alleged violations are ensured.  
</p>
<p> With regard to the alleged use of lethal force by the police when faced with protests against 
evictions, we would like to refer your Government to the principles of international law 
governing the use of force when policing rallies and protests. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Nigeria is a party, provides that every individual 
has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that 
no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p> The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (General Assembly resolution 34/169 
of 17 December 1979) and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials (adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 27 August to 7 September 1990), though not in 
themselves binding law, provide an authoritative and convincing interpretation of the limits the 
prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of life places on the conduct of law enforcement forces 
facing allegedly violent crowds, namely by putting forward the twin safeguards of necessity and 
proportionality in the use of force. In particular, Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law 
Enforcement Officials states: &#8220;Law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly 
necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case under cooperation:  
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide information relating to any notice provided to residents of the alleged 
evictions and demolitions of houses in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities. Additionally, 
please provide information on the proposed notice provided or to be given to residents in regards 
to the alleged evictions and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in August and September 2008. 
</p><p> 3. Please provide information relating to any consultation of residents in relation to the 
alleged evictions and demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities. Additionally, please 
provide information on the proposed consultation of residents in relation to the alleged evictions 
and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in August and September 2008.

<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information. 
I have received regarding Mr. <b>Jawed Khan</b> who is at imminent risk of execution for the

in 1996 together with two others and convicted before the anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad

alongside Khan, was sentenced to death and executed on 9 January 2007. Jawed Khan&#8217;s appeals 
against conviction were rejected by the Lahore High Court and then the Supreme Court on 
March 20, 2001 and November 8, 2001 respectively. His mercy petition was subsequently </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 296 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>rejected by the President. It is my understanding that the issue of age was not raised before the 
trial court or the appellate courts by his counsel, and that a session judge dismissed Jawed 
Khan&#8217;s application on 11 March 2004 apparently on the basis that photocopies of school leaving 
and birth certificates giving his date of birth as 3 April 1982, appeared to be fictitious. It is my 
understanding that he filed an appeal before the Lahore High Court, due to be heard in late 
February 2007. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding this specific case, 
I would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that the execution of Mr. Jawed Khan 
would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of Pakistan. Article 37(a) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be 
imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. General Comment 
No. 10 (2007) of the Committee on the Rights of the Child provides in paragraph 22 &#8220;If there is 
no proof of age, the child is entitled to a reliable medical or social investigation that may 
establish his/her age and, in the case of conflict or inconclusive evidence, the child shall have the 
right to the rule of the benefit of the doubt&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> I would respectfully appeal to the Government of Pakistan to take all necessary measures 
to comply with international human rights law and to prevent executions of offenders who were 
under the age of 18 at the time of the offense. This includes, most urgently, the suspension of the 
execution of Mr. Jawed Khan. 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Commission on Human 
Rights and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my 
attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be 
grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged above accurate? If not so, please share all information and 
documents proving their inaccuracy. Please confirm whether a medical or social investigation 
has been carried out to establish Mr. Jawed Khan&#8217;s age, given that documents pertaining to his 
age were disputed. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details of the appeal proceedings in Mr. Jawed Khan&#8217;s case before the 
Lahore High Court scheduled for February 2007.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of Pakistan dated 7 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p> Mr Khan was tried by the Special Judge Anti Terrorism, Faisalabad and sentenced to 
death. The death sentence was upheld by the Honourable Lahore High Court and was maintained 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
</p>
<p> As stated in your letter the issue of Mr. Khan&#8217;s age was not raised by his council before the 
trial by the appellate courts. His claim of being juvenile at the time of committing the crime was 
considered and dismissed by the District and Sessions Judge Faisalabad. 
</p>
<p> After exhausting all legal remedies available to him under the law, Mr. Khan&#8217;s mercy 
petition was forwarded to the President. The appeal was rejected on 6 June 2007. The accused 
was executed on 13 February 2008 at the Central Jail Faisalabad. </p>

<p><b>Pakistan:  Honour killing of two women 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Impunity for honour killings 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 2 females 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Receipt acknowledged 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving a substantive response concerning the 
alleged honour killings of two women, Ms. Husna and her daughter Samia. The Special 
Rapporteur would note, however, that the Government has already taken longer than the 
customary 90 days to respond.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 8 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have received 
concerning a continuing pattern of <b>honour killings</b> in Pakistan in which women are killed, 
usually by a family member because of suspicions of sexual impropriety or because they have 
married outside their religion. On 4 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences drew your Government&#8217;s attention to ten reported cases of 
honour killings, all alleged to have occurred during the month of April 2008. Today, in addition 
to the present communication, we are bringing to your Government&#8217;s attention by separate 
communication another case of so-called &#8220;honour killing&#8221; of five women in Balochistan 
province. We would also like to raise concerns about a report we have received of a <b>tribal jirga 
imposing the death sentence</b>. 
</p>
<p> Recently, we have received information regarding the killing of Ms. <b>Husna</b>, late wife of 
Mr. Kaloo Jamali, and their daughter <b>Saima</b>, all residents of Khairpur Nathan Shah. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 28 January 2008, Kaloo Jamali beat his wife Husna, as he allegedly often did, accusing 
her of a relationship with another man. During the quarrel, Kaloo Jamali ordered his son, 
Mujeeb Ur Rehman Jamali, to kill Husna. Kaloo Jamali&#8217;s cousin, Hanif, loaded the rifle 
and gave it to Mujeeb, telling him that his mother was &#8220;kari&#8221; (a black character). Mujeeb 
fired at his mother and killed her. Husna&#8217;s daughter Saima rushed into the room and 
Mujeeb shot her as well. Kaloo Jamali told his neighbors that his wife was &#8220;kari,&#8221; that 
Saima had been supporting her, and that mother and daughter were killed in order to 
protect the honour and dignity of the Jamali family.  
</p>
<p>On 30 January 2008, Kaloo Jamali went to Karimdad Lund Police Station, 
Khaipur Nathan, and reported the matter to the police. Mubeen Jamali, another son of 
Kaloo Jamali, lodged a First Investigation Report (FIR) against his brother Mujeeb for the 
murder of his mother and sister. The police arrested Mujeeb Jamali and Hanif, but not 
Kaloo Jamali. Hanif was subsequently released on bail, while Mujeeb remains in detention.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 298 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In a related development, Kaloo Jamali as the head of the Jamali family in the area called a 
tribal assembly of elders (jirga) to obtain approval for sanctions against his brother-in-law, 
Anwar Jamali, whom he accused of having sold his daughter Hakima in Karachi (these 
accusations might also have contributed to the conflict between Kaloo Jamali and his 
wife). The jirga decided that Anwar Jamali should be killed and all his business 
confiscated. Anwar escaped from an attack on his house and went into hiding, while 
Kaloo Jamali took over his two shops and his house. Anwar Jamali has written several 
letters to the police and various authorities, including the Sindh provincial ministry of 
human rights, regarding protection for his family members and the &#8220;confiscation&#8221; of his 
business, but to date no action has been taken. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, there would be ground 
for serious concerns if they were correct. To the extent that honour killings are not met with 
stringent punishments, the State acquiesces in the practice. Under international law, Pakistan has 
the legal obligation to ensure the right to life by effectively punishing those who commit murder. 
Article 6(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Pakistan signed 
on 17 April 2008, recognizes that every human being has the right not to be arbitrarily deprived 
of his or her life. Article 2(1) requires the State to ensure to all individuals within its territory the 
rights recognized in ICCPR, without distinction as to sex. Article 2(2) elaborates that each State 
Party must undertake all necessary steps to adopt such laws or other measures as may be 
necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the ICCPR. These obligations are not mere 
formalities: The punishments imposed may not be so lenient as to invite future violations. As the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted in his report to the 
Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give rise to State 
responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate measures to deter, 
prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) 
</p>
<p> We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to prevent and punish honour 
killings. In this context, we would like to recall the Concluding Observations of the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child on Pakistan&#8217;s report of 27 October 2003 (CRC/C/15/Add.217, 
paras 34 and 35), in which the Committee expressed its concerns &#8220;about the widespread and 
increasing problem of so-called honour killings&#8221; and recommended that Pakistan &#8220;take all 
necessary measures to ensure that there is no discriminatory treatment for crimes of honour, and 
that they are promptly, fairly and thoroughly investigated and prosecuted&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to Your Excellency&#8217;s attention Article 4 (c &amp; d) of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the 
responsibility of States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with 
national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by 
the State or by private persons. To this end, States should develop penal, civil, labour and 
administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to 
women who are subjected to violence.  
 We would further like to bring to Your Excellency&#8217;s attention Article 4 of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women which underlines the 
responsibility of States to condemn violence against women and which calls on States not to 
invoke any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 299 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>its elimination. We would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Convention on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women according to which States Parties agree to take 
all appropriate measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and 
women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other 
practices which are based on the idea of inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on 
stereotyped roles for men and women (Article 5 (a)). 
</p>
<p> As for the &#8220;death sentence&#8221; reportedly imposed by the tribal jirga against Anwar Jamali, 
we understand that the courts of Pakistan, including the Supreme Court and the Sindh High 
Court, have declared criminal sanctions imposed by jirgas as illegal and unconstitutional. It 
therefore is not necessary for us to highlight how the imposition of the death sentence by a tribal 
court which does not have a sufficient legal basis and does not observe fair trial guarantees is 
utterly incompatible with the right to life.  
</p>
<p> According to our information, however, jirgas continue to operate in so-called &#8220;feudal and 
tribal based areas&#8221; of Pakistan, imposing severe penal sanctions, including the death penalty. As 
with regard to honour killings, international law as reflected in Article 2(2) of the ICCPR 
requires the State to undertake all necessary steps to adopt such laws or other measures as may 
be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the ICCPR, and to deter, prevent and 
punish those breaking such laws. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this case to 
the Council, we would grateful for your responses to the following questions: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the full details and results of any investigation, prosecution, judicial 
or other inquiries carried out since the end of January 2008 in relation to the killing of Ms. Husna 
and her daughter Samia. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please explain what legal, social or other types of measures and programmes have 
been adopted by Your Government to address the widespread practices of honor killings. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please explain the steps taken to protect Mr. Anwar Jamali from execution of the 
&#8220;death sentence&#8221; allegedly imposed against him by the tribal jirga. 
</p><p> 5. Please provide full details and results of any investigation, prosecution, judicial or 
other inquiries carried out in relation to the tribal jirga which allegedly sentenced 
Mr. Anwar Jamali to death.

<p><b>Pakistan:  Honour killing of five women of the Umrani Tribe 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Impunity for honour killings 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 5 females (3 minors) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has failed to cooperate 
with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 8 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture <b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to allegations 
we have received concerning <b>the killing of five women belonging to the Umrani tribe</b> by 
burying them while still alive in Baba Kot, a village located 80 kilometers from Usta 
Mohammad City, Jafferabad district, Balochistan province.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, on 14 July 2008 Ms. <b>Fatima</b>, 45 years old, wife of 
Umeed Ali Umrani; <b>Jannat Bibi</b>, 38 years old, wife of Qaiser Khan; and three minors, 
aged between 16 and 18 years old, named Fauzia, Hameeda and Raheema, were in the 
house of Mr. Chandio, at Baba Kot village, with the intention to leave for a civil court at 
Usta Mohammad, district Jafarabad, so that the three girls could marry the men of their 
choice. Their decision to be married in court was the result of several days of discussions 
with the elders of the tribe, who refused them permission to marry.  
</p>
<p>As the news of their plans leaked out, Mr. Abdul Sattar Umrani, a brother of provincial 
minister for housing and construction Mr. Sadiq Umrani, accompanied by six men, 
abducted the five women at gun point. In a Land Cruiser jeep, bearing a registration 
number plate of the Balochistan government, they were taken to another area, Nau Abadi, 
in the vicinity of Baba Kot. After reaching the deserted area of Nau Abadi, 
Abdul Sattar Umrani and the six men took the three minors out of the jeep and beat them 
before allegedly opening fire with their guns, leaving them with very serious injuries. 
Sattar Umrani and his accomplices hurled them into a wide ditch and covered them with 
earth and stones. When the two older women tried to stop the burial of the minors, the 
attackers pushed them into the ditch as well and buried them all alive.  
</p>
<p>The matter was debated in the Senate, the National Assembly of Pakistan and the 
provincial Assembly of Sindh. In the Senate, Senator Israrullah Zehri tried to defend the 
burials stating that the killings were part of tribal traditions and that the incident should not 
be mentioned in the Upper House.  
</p>
<p>According to information received, no action has been taken to conduct criminal 
investigations into the matter.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 301 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances regarding this 
case. We would like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to 
physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  
</p>
<p> To the extent that honour killings are not met with stringent punishments, the State 
acquiesces in the practice. Under international law, Pakistan has the legal obligation to ensure 
the right to life by effectively punishing those who commit murder. Article 6(1) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Pakistan signed on 17 April 2008, 
recognizes that every human being has the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. 
Article 2(1) requires the State to ensure to all individuals within its territory the rights recognized 
in ICCPR, without distinction as to sex. Article 2(2) elaborates that each State Party must 
undertake all necessary steps to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to give 
effect to the rights recognized in the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p> In this context, we would like to draw your attention to the latest report of the Special 
Rapporteur on Torture to the Human Rights Council, A/HRC/7/3, in which he stated that &#8220;the 
concept of &#8220;acquiescence&#8221;, aside from the protection obligations, entails a duty for the State to 
prevent acts of torture in the private sphere and [&#8230;] the concept of due diligence should be 
applied to examine whether States have lived up to their obligations&#8221; (para. 64). Similarly, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, arbitrary ad summary executions noted in a report to the 
Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;Crimes, including murder, can also give rise to State 
responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate measures to deter, 
prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) 
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to Your Excellency&#8217;s attention Article 4 (c &amp; d) of the

its elimination. We would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Convention on

<p> Finally, we would like to recall the Committee on the Rights of the Child&#8217;s Concluding 
Observations to Pakistan on 27 October 2003, in which the Committee expressed its concerns 
&#8220;about the widespread and increasing problem of so-called &#8220;honour killings&#8221; and recommended 
that Pakistan take all necessary measures to ensure that there is no discriminatory treatment for 
crimes of honour, and that they are promptly, fairly and thoroughly investigated and prosecuted&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, 
we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee accountability of any 
person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopt 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p> Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be 
grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to 
the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or 
if they have been inconclusive, please explain why.

<p><b>Pakistan:  Death sentence of Zulfiqar Ali 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has failed to cooperate 
with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 7 October 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers 
 We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding the execution of Mr. <b>Zulfiqar Ali</b>, which is reportedly scheduled for 8 October 2008. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zulfiqar Ali was arrested on a murder charge on 14 April 1998, imprisoned at Adiala 
prison, Rawalpindi, Punjab Province, tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The dates of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 303 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>trial, sentencing and appeals proceedings have not been reported to us. In September 2008, 
the President of Pakistan rejected an appeal to commute the sentence and on 
29 September 2008 the red warrant to execute Mr. Zulfiqar Ali, who is still detained at 
Adiala prison, was issued. The execution is scheduled for 8 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zulfiqar Ali&#8217;s family is very poor and could not hire a lawyer to defend him. Neither 
the courts nor any other institution provided him with legal counsel at any stage of the 
ten years his case has been pending, so that he had to defend himself. Moreover, 
Mr. Zulfiqar Ali does not speak English, the language of court proceedings in Pakistan. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the principles 
applicable to this case under international law. In capital punishment cases the obligation to 
provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial 
tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) admits of no exception. 
Relevant to the case at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the right to be assisted by legal 
counsel. Persons accused of offences carrying severe penalties are entitled to be assigned a 
defense lawyer without payment by them if they do not have sufficient means to pay themselves. 
In this respect, the Human Rights Committee states in its General Comment on Article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (signed by Pakistan on 17 April 2008), that 
&#8220;[i]n cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively 
assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings.&#8221; (CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Basic Principles on the 
Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990. Principle 1 
reads: &#8220;All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their choice to protect 
and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of criminal proceedings&#8221;. Principle 7 
reads: &#8220;Governments shall further ensure that all persons arrested or detained, with or without 
criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and in any case not later than 
forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or detention.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which violates the most 
fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Mr. Zulfiqar Ali are fully respected. 
Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty 
is not executed until all concerns regarding the fairness of his trial are dispelled in their entirety. 
If it is correct that Mr. Zulfiqar Ali was not assisted by a lawyer, and that there is no evidence to 
show that he voluntarily opted to conduct his own defence without one, a re-trial would be 
necessary. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations

undertaken to determine whether he was able to afford a lawyer, and the steps undertaken to

<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Cooperative but incomplete response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response of the Government of Pakistan with 
respect to the case of Umer Khan and notes that the grant of a stay of Mr. Khan&#8217;s execution by 
the President is a positive development. However, the Government&#8217;s response does not address 
whether the Government&#8217;s warrant of execution was withdrawn after the acceptance of diyah 
money by the victim&#8217;s family and, if not, whether any judicial process, with appropriate due 
process protections, exists that would override the agreement of the victim&#8217;s family to pardon 
Mr. Khan and the subsequent withdrawal of the death penalty under Islamic law. The Special 
Rapporteur also looks forward to receiving from the Government information about further 
developments in Mr. Khan&#8217;s case.

Mumtaz Ullah Khan and sentenced to death. In accordance with Islamic Law Umer Khan 
paid more than one million Rupees ($16,500) of diyah (blood money) to the mother, wife 
and children of the murdered man. This payment was made before the District and Session 
Court as well as before the Anti-terrorism Court of Sargodha district. The family 
subsequently pardoned Umer Khan in writing before the court on 9 May 2007, and the 
judge has also made a note of this in his decision. However, the government has not 
withdrawn the case and a warrant authorizing his execution for 29 October 2008 has been 
issued. </p>

</p>
<p> International law does not prohibit the death penalty, but it mandates that it must be 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted 
in the most restrictive manner. Capital punishment cases must thoroughly respect all due process 
guarantees and the rule of law with a sentence being pronounced only following a regular 
judicial process. According to my understanding of Islamic law, as applied to this case, an 
agreement reached between the accused and the family of the victim, followed by the acceptance 
of the payment of diyah, would normally lead to the family of the victim agreeing to pardon the 
accused and the subsequent withdrawal of the death penalty. Where the applicable domestic law 
explicitly provides for the system of diyah, and it is granted, there would presumably need to be 
another legal process in order to override that arrangement and the status accorded to it by the 
law. The information I have received has not drawn my attention to any other legal process in 
which the convicted person was provided the opportunity to put his case to a relevant court with 
the assistance of counsel and with measures being taken to ensure that the various other 
appropriate due process protections are ensured. 
</p>
<p> In view of the irrevocable nature of the death penalty, I urge your Government not to 
proceed with the execution. This question requires a thorough re-examination in order to ensure 
that the relevant laws have been complied with. In view of the urgency of the matter, I would 
appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has failed to cooperate 
with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 6 November 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
concerning a recent case of <b>honour killing</b> in Chack, Lucky Ghulam Shah, Jahnian, Shikarpur 
district, Sindh province. In this respect, we would like to refer to previous communications sent 
on 4 July and 8 September 2008 pertaining to honour killings and to the imposition of sentences 
by tribal Jirgas. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 306 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Sher Dil Jatoi, a 62 year-old resident of Goth Allah Wasayo, Chack, Shikarpur district, 
Sindh province, killed his second wife in August 2008 on the ground that she allegedly had 
an illicit relationship with a man named Sharoo Jatoi. Mr. Sher Dil Jatoi had already killed 
his first wife for similar reasons in 2001, but was never punished for the act.  
</p>
<p>During the same month of August, as a result of public protests following the killing of the 
wife of Mr. Sher Dil Jatoi, the police took him into custody, but released him after 15 days 
without charges.  
</p>
<p>On 20 October 2008, a local Jirga led by Mr. Hassan Jatoi was held by the chiefs of the 
Jatoi tribe, at Lucky Ghulam Shah, Shikarpur district, Sindh province. The Jirga decided 
that Sher Dil Jatoi was a victim of honour, and therefore absolved him in the killing of his 
second wife. The Jirga also ordered Mr. Shatoo Jatoi to hand over 20 buffaloes, costing 
more than 100,000 rupees (around USD 1,400) each, as a fine for having an illicit 
relationship with Sher Dil Jatoi&#8217;s second wife. Shatoo Jatoi was also ordered to 
compensate Sher Dil by handing over three daughters to him to be at his service. Since 
Mr. Shahoo&#8217;s daughters are grown up and married, the Jirga decided that he should give 
his 10 years-old grand daughter, Ameeran daughter of Rasoolo Jatoi, as well as the two 
grand daughters of his brothers Mr. Miro Jatoi and Mr. Khanan Jatoi, Gul Bano daughter 
of Ali Sher Jatoi, and Benazir daughter of Bux Ali Jatoi, aged 13 and 11 year-old. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, there would be ground 
for serious concerns if they were correct. To the extent that honour killings are not met with 
stringent punishments, the State acquiesces in the practice. Under international law, Pakistan has 
the legal obligation to ensure the right to life by effectively punishing those who commit murder. 
Article 6(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Pakistan signed 
on 17 April 2008, recognizes that every human being has the right not to be arbitrarily deprived 
of his or her life. Article 2(1) requires the State to ensure to all individuals within its territory the 
rights recognized in ICCPR, without distinction as to sex. Article 2(2) elaborates that each State 
Party must undertake all necessary steps to adopt such laws or other measures as may be 
necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the ICCPR. These obligations are not mere 
formalities: The punishments imposed may not be so lenient as to invite future violations. As the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted in his report to the 
Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give rise to State 
responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate measures to deter, 
prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) 
</p>
<p> We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to prevent and punish honour 
killings. In this context, we would like to recall the Concluding Observations of the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child on Pakistan&#8217;s report of 27 October 2003 (CRC/C/15/Add.217, 
paras 34 and 35), in which the Committee expressed its concerns &#8220;about the widespread and 
increasing problem of so-called honour killings&#8221; and recommended that Pakistan &#8220;take all 
necessary measures to ensure that there is no discriminatory treatment for crimes of honour, and 
that they are promptly, fairly and thoroughly investigated and prosecuted&#8221;.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 307 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to Your Excellency&#8217;s attention Article 4 (c &amp; d) of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the 
responsibility of States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with 
national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by 
the State or by private persons. To this end, states should develop penal, civil, labour and 
administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to 
women who are subjected to violence. Women who are subjected to violence should be provided 
with access to the mechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national legislation, to just and 
effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered. States should, moreover, also inform 
women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> We would finally like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Convention on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, to which Pakistan is a Party. States Parties to this 
instrument agree to take all appropriate measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of 
conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and 
customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of inferiority or the superiority of 
either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women (Article 5 (a)). 
</p>
<p> We are concerned about the physical and emotional safety of the three girls who have 
reportedly been handed over to Sher Dil Jatoi as compensation, Ameeran daughter of Rasoolo 
Jatoi, Gul Bano daughter of Ali Sher Jatoi, and Benazir daughter of Bux Ali Jatoi. We urge your 
Government to take without delay all necessary measures to guarantee that their physical and 
emotional integrity is respected and that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopt effective measures to prevent 
the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the three girls. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the full details, and where available the results, of any investigation 
and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the murder of Mr. Sher Dil Jatoi&#8217;s wife 
since August 2008. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please 
explain why. Please explain the reasons why Sher Dil Jatoi was released without charges. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have 
criminal or other sanctions been imposed against Mr. Sher Dil Jatoi and the members of the 
tribal jirga? </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 4. Please provide full details and results of any social or other types of measures or 
programmes adopted by your Government, as well as of any investigation, prosecution, judicial 
and other inquiries carried out in relation to addressing the practice of honour killings. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide the legal basis for the handing over of minor girls as part of a 
compensation for a wrong committed. Please explain whether such cases are relatively common, 
and if so, what types of measures have been taken by the Government to ensure the physical and 
emotional well-being of minor girls being handed over in such way. 
</p>

accurately reflected in the report we will submit to the Human Rights Council for its 
consideration.

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 8 January 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning <b>three reported attacks on journalists during November 2008</b>, 
resulting in the killing of two journalists and the attempted killing of two others. 
 According to information received: 
</p>
<p>On 3 November 2008, Mr <b>Abdul Razzak Johra</b>, investigative reporter with the Royal TV 
network, was dragged from his home in Mianwali district, in Punjab province, by a group 
of six armed and masked men. Mr Johra was then shot six times and died as a result of his 
injuries. A report written by Mr Johra on drug trafficking was broadcast the day before his 
murder. Mr Johra had previously worked on cases involving drug trafficking in his region 
and had received death threats on a number of occasions. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 309 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 8 November 2008, Mr <b>Qari Muhammad Shoaib</b>, a journalist with the daily 
newspapers Khabar Kar and Azadi, was shot dead at the wheel of his car by soldiers in 
Mingora in the Swat Valley. Mr Shoaib was returning home with a family member when 
soldiers reportedly opened fire without warning. The passenger travelling with Mr Shoaib 
indicated that they had received no signal to stop the car. A statement issued by the 
military after the incident claimed that Mr Shoaib had received several warnings to pull his 
car over before the security forces opened fire on the vehicle. Soldiers were reportedly 
patrolling the area after receiving information of a threatened suicide attack. 
</p>
<p>On 14 November 2008, Afghan national Mr <b>Sami Yousafzai,</b> a special correspondent for 
U.S. magazine Newsweek in Peshawar, and Ms <b>Motoki Yatsukura</b>, Pakistan Bureau 
Chief of Japanese daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun, were shot while resisting an attempted 
abduction in Hayatabad near Peshawar. Reports claim that the abduction attempt was 
carried out by three men in a car who followed the journalists and opened fire on them. 
Mr Yousafzai and Ms Yatsukura were seriously injured in the attack and were taken to a 
hospital in Islamabad where they were treated for their injuries. The journalists were 
reportedly on their way to the Khyber tribal region to interview members of an armed 
group, before the attack took place. Previously, in 2004, Mr Yousafzai was purportedly 
held in incommunicado detention by Pakistani intelligence officials for over a month after 
accompanying an American journalist to the Tribal Areas in Pakistan&#8217;s North-West 
Frontier Province (NWFP). 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we urge your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take effective measures to take measures to prevent further killings 
of journalists. In this respect, it is very important that the persons responsible for the killings and 
the attempted abduction, both as material perpetrators and as instigators, are rapidly identified, 
arrested and brought to justice. We are particularly concerned about the safety of journalists 
working in the border area of Pakistan and Afghanistan, in Pakistan&#8217;s North-West Frontier 
Province (NWFP).  
</p>
<p> We would also like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the relevant principles of 
international law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which 
Pakistan is a party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, 
that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or 
her life (Article 6). In this respect, we would like to recall that, as reiterated in Human Rights 
Council resolution 8/3 on &#8220;The Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and 
impartial investigation into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, 
including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the 
recurrence of such executions&#8221;. Families of the deceased should be informed of information 
relevant to the investigation, and the findings of the investigation should be made public 
(Principles 16 and 17 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 310 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that taking effective measures to protect journalists and to 
prosecute those responsible of killings or death threats against them is a precondition to ensuring 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression as set forth in article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR, which provides that: &#8220;Everyone shall have the 
right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; We are concerned that killings of 
journalists, particularly if they remain unpunished, could create a climate of impunity and result 
in preventing independent reporting and stifling freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p> In this context, we deem it appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of the 
Commission on Human Rights which calls upon states to ensure that victims of violations of the 
right to freedom of expression have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and 
acts of violence, including terrorist acts, against journalists, including in situations of armed 
conflict, and to bring to justice those responsible to combat impunity. 
 With specific regard to the killing of Qari Muhammad Shoaib by military personnel, we 
would like to recall that Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement 
officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate 
objective to be achieved. As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement officials 
shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force (Basic 
Principles, Principle 4). Further, whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law 
enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic Principles, Principle 5). Intentional 
lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life (Basic 
Principles, Principle 9). 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the summary of the cases accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the killing of 
Mr Abdul Razzak Johra and the attempted killing of Mr Sami Yousafzai and Ms Motoki 
Yatsukura. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details 
of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have 
been inconclusive please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the inquiries carried out 
in relation to the killing of Mr Qari Muhammad Shoaib by military personnel. Please include 
details of measures adopted to secure the exhaustiveness and impartiality of the inquiry and to 
keep the victim&#8217;s family appraised of the process. </p>

<p><b>Papua New Guinea:  Death sentence on juvenile Fred Abenko 
Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment

<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male (minor) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Papua New Guinea has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 29 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
information I have received regarding <b>Fred Abenko</b>, a juvenile who has been sentenced to 
death. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, Fred Abenko was convicted of murder on 
15 May 2007 (National Court case no 1236/06). On 1 October 2007, he was given a death 
sentence by the National Court. His file reportedly indicates that an appeal has been lodged by 
Public Solicitor in the Supreme Court (SCRA 31/07). It would appear that Fred Abenko was 
aged 15 at the time of the trial. In the same case, a second defendant, Sedoki Lota, was sentenced 
to death. I have no information regarding his age at the time of the offence. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding this case, I would 
like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 37(a) of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, to which Papua New Guinea is a Party. This provision expressly 
provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below 
eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Papua New Guinea acceded on 21 July 2008, provides that the death 
penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> I understand that Section 78 of the draft Juvenile Justice Act, which has not yet been 
approved by the legislature, would exclude the imposition of the death penalty for juvenile 
offenders. I welcome this legislative initiative and encourage your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
proceed with incorporating into domestic law the absolute ban against capital punishment for 
offences committed by minors. 
</p>
<p> Pending these legislative changes, however, international law requires your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to expeditiously lift or commute the death sentence imposed against Fred Abenko, 
as well as any other death sentence imposed for offences committed by persons below the age of 
eighteen. </p>

<p><b>Papua New Guinea:  Sorcery-related killings 
</b></p>

<b>Character of reply</b>: No response (recent communication) 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a response from the Government of Papua New 
Guinea in relation to this communication.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 11 February 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning recent reports of sorcery-related killings of women in 
the highlands provinces of Papua New Guinea.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>A woman was stripped naked, gagged, tightly strapped and burned alive by a group of men 
at Kerebug Dump in Mount Hagen on 6 January 2009. As of 27 January 2009, the identity 
of the victim was still unknown, and the Provincial police authorities were still 
investigating. The body was reportedly too badly burnt for identification purposes. 
</p>
<p>In addition, at least four similar cases in the highlands area (two resulting in deaths of 
women, one in which a female victim was tortured but survived, and the killing and 
burning of a father and son in Ban village on 8 February 2009) were reported to us after the 
killing in Mount Hagen on 6 January 2009. Provincial police commanders in two highlands 
provinces, Eastern Highlands and Chimbu, reportedly told journalists that there were more </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 313 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>than 50 sorcery-related killings in their provinces in 2008. Other independent sources 
estimate that there have been up to 500 of attacks against women accused of practicing 
witchcraft that have resulted in torture and murder. 
</p>
<p>The police are often unable to enforce the law and stop mob killings. In the case of the 
killing and burning of a father and son suspected of sorcery in Ban village on 
8 February 2009, the police were able to visit the crime scene and confirm their deaths, but 
heavily armed locals prevented them from removing the bodies to hospital for autopsies. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, there would be ground 
for serious concerns if they were correct. We recall that, to the extent that mob killings of 
persons suspected of sorcery are not effectively prevented, investigated and met with stringent 
punishments, the State does not live up to its due diligence obligations in this respect. Under 
international law, Papua New Guinea has the legal obligation to ensure the right to physical and 
mental integrity and the right to life by effectively punishing those who commit murder, torture 
or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. Article 6(1) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Papua New Guinea is a Party, recognizes that 
every human being has the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. Article 2(1) 
requires the State to ensure to all individuals within its territory the rights recognized in ICCPR, 
without distinction as to sex. Article 2(2) elaborates that each State Party must undertake all 
necessary steps to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the 
rights recognized in the ICCPR. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions noted in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including 
murder, can also give rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take 
all appropriate measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, 
para. 71.) 
</p>
<p> The same principle was set forth by the Human Rights Committee with regard to torture: 
&#8220;It is the duty of the State party to afford everyone protection through legislative and other 
measures as may be necessary against the acts prohibited by article 7 [of the Covenant, i.e. 
torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment], whether inflicted by 
people acting in their official capacity, outside their official capacity or in a private capacity.&#8221; 
(paragraph 2 of General Comment 20, adopted at the 44th session of the Human Rights 
Committee, 1992). 
</p>
<p> While it would appear that some of the persons killed on suspicions of sorcery were men, 
these mob killings appear to target primarily women. In this respect, we would like to draw the 
attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 4 (c &amp; d) of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the responsibility of 
states to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national 
legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the 
State or by private persons. Article 4 further calls on States not to invoke any custom, tradition or 
religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination. 
</p>
<p> As the Special Rapporteur on Torture recommended in a report to the Human Rights 
Council, &#8220;&#8230; torture and ill-treatment [should] be understood in a gender-inclusive way and that 
States [should] extend their prevention efforts to fully include torture and ill-treatment of 
women, even if it occurs in the &#8220;private&#8221; sphere&#8221; (A/HRC/7/3, para. 73). </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Philippines has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 29 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding threats against Fr <b>Romeo Tagud</b>, a priest in the Iglesia Filipina 
Independiente (IFI - Philippine Independent Church); and the harassment of members of 
<b>Karapatan-Central Visayas</b>, namely<b> </b>Mr <b>Dennis</b> <b>Michael</b> <b>J</b> <b>Abarrientos</b>, Secretary-General; 
Ms <b>Vimarie Arcilla</b>, Public Information Officer; Mr <b>Jean H Suarez</b>, Research-documentation </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>Officer; and Ms <b>Concordia Oyoa</b>, Direct-services Officer. Karapatan-Central Visayas is a 
member organization of the KARAPATAN Alliance for the Advancement of People&#8217;s Rights. 
</p>
<p> Previous threats against Fr Romeo Tagud were mentioned in an urgent appeal sent by the 
then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
to your Government on 13 October 2006. We acknowledge your Government&#8217;s responses on 
23 October 2006 and 27 November 2006. 
</p>
<p> According to new information received: 
</p>
<p>Fr Romeo Tagud reportedly joined a delegation of Filipino Americans from the 
California-Nevada Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church, based in the 
United States of America, which visited the Philippines from 30 June to 2 July 2008. After 
Fr Romeo Tagud exposed human rights abuses allegedly committed by the military in 
certain villages, and the deterioration of respect for human rights on the island of Negros, 
particularly in areas of heavy military presence, the delegation decided to support a 
campaign against extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations in Negros. This 
raised the profile of human rights issues in Negros and attracted international attention. 
The military subsequently criticized the delegation in the local press for having supposedly 
violated the human rights of the residents of Linantuyan. 
</p>
<p>On 1 August 2008, Fr Romeo Tagud took part in a press conference in Bacolod City. There 
he expressed the views of the IFI on poverty, corruption, extrajudicial killings, the 
implications of mining in Guihulngan City and Hinobaan, and other alleged human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p>On 3 August 2008, at approximately 6:30 a.m., Fr Romeo Tagud was given an envelope 
containing a bullet from an M16 armalite rifle by a girl of approximately five or six years 
of age whose identity is unknown. Fr Romeo Tagud had just participated in Sunday mass 
and was walking towards the parish house at the time. The girl told him that the envelope 
was an offering for the church. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since 18 June 2008, members of Karapatan-Central Visayas have been 
investigating the disappearance of a man who was allegedly abducted by members of the 
military in Negros on 11 June 2008. In response, the military reportedly publicly accused 
Ms <b>Vimarie Arcilla</b> of working for the Maoist New People&#8217;s Army rebels and declared 
that it planned to file charges against her for the kidnapping of a witness in the 
disappearance case. These charges are now lodged at the prosecutor&#8217;s office in 
Dumaguette Central, Negros Oriental. They are allegedly unfounded and have been filed as 
part of a smear campaign against those who speak out against them. The military had 
previously filed charges of multiple murders against Ms Vimarie Arcilla in April 2006 
after she had investigated other human rights violations supposedly committed by military 
members. These charges were dismissed by the Regional Trial Court 7, Branch 29 in 
Toledo City for &#8220;lack of probable cause&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Since then threats have been sent sporadically to members of Karapatan-Central Visayas. 
On 21 August 2008, threats were sent simultaneously to Mr <b>Dennis Michael J 
Abarrientos</b>, Mr <b>Jean H Suarez</b>, Ms <b>Concordia Oyoa, </b>and Ms <b>Vimarie Arcilla</b> while </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 316 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>they were in a meeting. On 24 August 2008, between 10.30 a.m. and 11.00 a.m., the four 
members of Karapatan-Central Visayas again received threats by text. Among the threats 
against the members of Karapatan-Central Visayas were the following messages: &#8220;I know 
what you are doing HR. Your time is up!!!&#8221; and &#8220;Stop your Fault-Finding Missions&#8230;or 
suffer the consequences!!!&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Serious concern is expressed that Fr Romeo Tagud may have been threatened for speaking 
out about human rights violations on the island of Negros. Serious concern is also expressed that 
the threats against members of Karapatan-Central Visayas and the accusations against 
Ms Vimarie Arcilla may have may be directly related to their investigation of alleged human 
rights violations in Negros. Further concern is expressed for the physical and psychological 
integrity of Fr Romeo Tagud, as well as that of all members of Karapatan-Central Visayas. It is 
feared that the threats against Fr Romeo Tagud and the members of Karapatan-Central Visayas 
may form part of an ongoing pattern of harassment against members of the IFI and other human 
rights defenders in the Philippines after the murders of Bishop Alberto Ramento and 
Fr Diniosio Ging-Ging, and the death threats against Fr Antonio Ablon, Fr Terry Revollido, 
Fr Sonny Teleron and Fr Marco Sulayao in 2006. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we urge your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take effective measures to protect Fr Romeo Tagud and the 
members of Karapatan-Central Visayas. 
</p>
<p> We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
resolution 2005/9, whereby the Commission on Human Rights urged governments to refrain 
from all acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who avail or have availed themselves of 
procedures established under United Nations auspices for the protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and all those who have provided legal assistance to them for this purpose. 
In this recommendation, the Commission requested representatives of United Nations Human 
Rights Bodies to continue to take urgent steps to help prevent the occurrence of intimidation and 
reprisals and to include in their respective reports allegations of intimidation or reprisal, as well 
as an account of action taken by them in this regard. 
</p>
<p> In its resolution 7/12, the Human Rights Council urged governments to take steps to 
provide adequate protection to witnesses of enforced or involuntary disappearances, human 
rights defenders acting against enforced disappearances and the lawyers and families of 
disappeared persons against any intimidation or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected. 
 Further, in the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, adopted by General Assembly resolution 47/133, of 18 December 1992, it is 
stated that States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations of cases of 
disappearance, including the complainant, shall be protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or 
reprisal, and any cases of such treatment shall be appropriately punished. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to refer your Government to the relevant principles of international 
law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which the 
Philippines is a party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the 
person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived 
of his or her life (Article 6). In this respect, we would like to recall that, as reiterated in Human </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 317 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 8/3 on &#8220;The Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct 
exhaustive and impartial investigation into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all 
necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity 
and to prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation, affirmed also in the 
jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee (see the Committee&#8217;s views in Arhuacos v. 
Colombia, Communication no. 612/1995, &#167; 8.8), is indeed part and parcel of the obligation to 
respect and protect the right to life enshrined in Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> We would further like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right 
individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; 
and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary 
to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other fields, as well as the 
legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in 
association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;. 
 Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
the following provisions of the Declaration: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 6 points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate 
means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de 
facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. 
In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in association with others, to 
be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing, through 
peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by omission, attributable to States 
that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of 
violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 318 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental 
principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have 
the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We would further like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure the right to freedom of association, as recognized in article 22 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to 
freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the 
protection of his interests&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, 
we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the aforementioned person are respected and accountability of any person guilty of 
the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopt effective 
measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. 
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-mentioned person 
in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Has any complaint been lodged by, or on behalf of, Fr Romeo Tagud or the members 
of Karapatan-Central Visayas? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to these cases. If no inquiries have taken place, 
or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have 
sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide information on how the charges against the members of 
Karapatan-Central Visayas are compatible with international human rights norms and standards. 
</p>
<p> 6. Please indicate what protective measures are to be taken to safeguard the physical 
and psychological integrity of Fr Romeo Tagud and, more generally, of members of the IFI, as 
well as of members of Karapatan-Central Visayas. </p>

<p><b>Russian Federation:  Killing of Magomed Yevloyev 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Deaths in custody owing to torture, neglect, or the use of force, or fear of 
death in custody due to life-threatening conditions of detention 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male (journalist) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response of the Government of Russia with respect 
to the killing of Magomed Yevloyev and looks forward to receiving detailed information about 
the investigation into Mr. Yevloyev&#8217;s death, the outcome of prosecution(s). The Special 
Rapporteur also looks forward to receiving information about the measures taken by the 
Government to ensure that complainants, witnesses and family members of Mr. Yevoloyev are 
not subject to any intimidation or retaliation, and information about any compensation provided 
to the victim&#8217;s family. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 4 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received in relation to Mr <b>Magomed Yevloyev</b>, a well known journalist and founder of the 
independent news website <i>ingushetiya.ru. </i>The website is known as the main non-governmental 
source of information in the Republic of Ingushetia, and reports on alleged governmental 
corruption and human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p>On 31 August 2008, at approximately 1.30 p.m., Mr Magomed Yevloyev was arrested as 
he disembarked from a plane at Nazran airport in Magas, Republic of Ingushetia. 
Mr Yevloyev was then escorted to a waiting police vehicle. A short time later, 
Mr Yevloyev sustained a gunshot wound to the head and was taken by police officers to 
hospital, where he died later that day. 
</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry of Ingushetia stated that Mr. Yevloyev was killed &#8220;accidentally&#8221; 
while resisting arrest. An Investigative Committee spokesman in Moscow also issued a 
statement which indicated that Mr Yevloyev was detained by police and died in an 
&#8220;incident&#8221; while being taken to police headquarters for interrogation. The office of the 
Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation has reportedly indicated that it will 
investigate the incident. 
</p>
<p>Prior to his death, Mr Yevloyev had been a vocal critic of the government, and particularly 
of the Regional President of Ingushetia, Murat Zyazikov. Mr Zyazikov had reportedly 
threatened to shut down the website <i>ingushetiya.ru</i> on a number of occasions. In early </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 320 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>August 2008, the Moscow City Court upheld a district court&#8217;s decision to shut down the 
website for allegedly &#8220;carrying extremist content&#8221;. Charges of &#8220;inciting ethnic hatred&#8221; 
were also being pursued by prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>In October 2007, Mr Yevloyev had accused the President of the Republic of Ingushetia, 
Mr. Zyazikov, on the <i>ingushetiya.ru</i> website of hiring hit-men to kill him. His family had 
also received threats from Ingush politicians. The current editor of <i>ingushetiya.ru,</i> 
Ms Roza Malsagova, recently left the Russian Federation and has sought political asylum 
in France, alleging severe pressure on her by authorities, including through a number of 
criminal cases brought against her, in connection with her editing of the website. 
</p>
<p> While the reported investigation by the Public Prosecutor into the killing of 
Mr Magomed Yevloyev is welcomed, concern is expressed that the aforementioned events may 
represent a direct attempt to prevent independent reporting in Russia. This concern is reinforced 
by the fact that the killing of Mr Yevloyev is one in a long series of murders of journalists in the 
Russian Federation, as reflected inter alia in the communication to your Government by the 
Special Rapporteur on summary executions of 30 October 2006. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would also like to 
refer your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which the Russian Federation is a party, provides 
that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be 
protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). 
</p>
<p> When the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence 
of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In 
order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries 
sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all 
suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where 
complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above 
circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human 
Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have 
&#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation 
&#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a 
reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including 
legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of 
such executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that taking effective measures to protect journalists and 
writers and to prosecute those responsible of killings or death threats against them is a 
precondition to ensuring the right to freedom of opinion and expression as set forth in article 19 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 321 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; 
this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, 
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We also deem it appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of the Commission 
on Human Rights which calls upon states to ensure that victims of violations of the right to 
freedom of expression have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and acts of 
violence against journalists, and to bring to justice those responsible to combat impunity. 
 We would further like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right 
individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; 
and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all

office, Mr. Evloev received a bullet wound to the head and, despite the medical treatment 
provided by one of the Republic&#8217;s hospitals, died. 
</p>
<p> The militia officer who fired the shot testified that he had accidently pulled the trigger of 
his pistol. He was looking out of the window of the vehicle, since he believed that the vehicle 
might be attacked. He held the pistol cocked, ready to fire. Suddenly he heard the other militia 
officer cry out and he turned in his direction. At this time, Mr. Evloev moved forward and his 
head came in contact with the pistol. It was at that moment that the pistol went off. 
</p>
<p> Proceedings were instituted under article 109, paragraph 2 (negligent homicide owing to 
the improper discharge by a person of his professional duties), of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation. The final classification of the offence will be provided at the concluding 
stage, once all the facts of the case have been investigated. 
</p>
<p> The investigators are also considering several other possibilities, including the possibility 
that Mr. Evloev&#8217;s death was connected with his public activities and that it occurred as a result of 
sudden personal animosity.* 
</p>
<p> The investigation is being conducted by the central investigative department of the 
investigative committee attached to the Office of the Procurator of the Russian Federation for the 
Southern Federal District. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Evloev was a staunch critic of M.M. Zyazikov, President of the Republic of 
Ingushetia, and in general of the federal centre policy being conducted in the Republic. He 
openly propagated his views on the Internet site www.ingushetia.ru, which he owned. The 
Internet resource made active use of various Russian and foreign opposition - and often openly 
extremist - organizations. 
</p>
<p> In connection with the repeated publication of extremist materials on the aforementioned 
website, on 6 June 2008 the Kuntsevo district court of Moscow decided to grant the request 
made by the procurator of Ingushetia for the closure of the website. 
</p>
<p> On 12 August 2008, the Moscow city court upheld the decision of the Kuntsevo district 
court of Moscow to close the website www.ingushetia.ru. 
</p>
<p> In August 2008, the Office of the Procurator for the Republic of Ingushetia instituted 
criminal proceedings against Mr. Evloev in connection with an explosion near the home of 
Zalimkhan Khautiev, the director of the monitoring department of the administration of the 
President of Ingushetia. It was precisely for the purpose of the initial inquiry into this criminal 
case that, on 31 August 2008, Mr. Evloev was being escorted by militia officers from the airport 
to the Nazran internal affairs office. </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Russia has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 16 September 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning the killing of Mr <b>Telman</b> <b>Abdulla Alishayev</b>, a prominent journalist 
in Dagestan, and the attack against Mr <b>Miloslav Bitokov</b>, editor-in-chief of the independent 
weekly <i>Gazeta Yuga</i> in Kabardino-Balkariya. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr Alishayev was the host of a popular religious television programme, <i>Peace to Your 
Home</i>, which is broadcast on Islamic television station, TV Chirkei. On 2 September 2008, 
at approximately 6.30 p.m., two unknown individuals attacked Mr Abdulla Alishayev 
while in his car in the village of Separatorny, near Makhachkala, the capital of the 
Republic of Dagestan. He sustained gunshot wounds to his shoulder and head. A short time 
later Mr Alishayev underwent emergency surgery at Makhachkala&#8217;s Central Hospital. He 
succumbed to his injuries the following day. The Dagestan Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has 
announced the launching of a criminal investigation and the identification of a suspect. 
</p>
<p>Mr Miloslav Bitokov is the editor-in-chief of the independent weekly <i>Gazeta Yuga</i> in 
Kabardino-Balkariya. <i>Gazeta Yuga</i> is one of the few news outlets in Kabardino-Balkariya 
to openly criticize local authorities. On 2 September 2008 at 7.30 p.m., Miloslav Bitokov 
was attacked by unknown aggressors at the entrance of his apartment building in Nalchik, 
the capital of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkariya. His son Artur Bitokov found his father 
lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Miloslav Bitokov was hospitalized with a 
concussion, broken nose and cheekbone, and lip lacerations. The attackers did not take 
their victim&#8217;s cash or mobile phone. Miloslav Bitokov had reportedly received threats 
previously. 
</p>
<p> We welcome the announced opening of an investigation by the Dagestani Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office into the killing of Mr Alishayev. We note with great concern, however, that this killing 
and the attack against Mr Bitokov come two days after the killing of another journalist </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>in Ingushetia, another North Caucasian Republic of the Russian Federation, 
Mr Magomed Yvevloyev (which is the subject matter of a letter of allegation we sent to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government on 4 September 2008). While there appears to be currently no 
evidence in the present cases that the perpetrators of the attacks were public officials (as in the 
case of Mr Yevloyev, who was reportedly killed in a police car), we are concerned that the 
frequency of the attacks against independent journalists in the Russian Federation, and the 
impunity such attacks enjoy, may represent a direct attempt to prevent independent reporting. 
The killings of Mr Yevloyev and Mr Alishayev are the most recent in a long series of murders of 
journalists in the Russian Federation, as reflected inter alia in the communication to your 
Government by the Special Rapporteur on summary executions of 30 October 2006. 
</p>
<p> As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted in a 
report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give rise to 
State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate measures to 
deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In Resolution 8/3 on the 
&#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), 
the Human Rights Council reiterates that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The 
Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those 
responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their 
families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to 
bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation on the 
State is all the more pressing when there is a pattern of attacks against a group, here independent 
journalists, which can be seen as being in a confrontational relationship with the authorities, and 
when some of the killings have reportedly been perpetrated by State agents, such as in the case 
of Mr Yevloyev. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that taking effective measures to protect journalists and to 
prosecute those responsible of killings or death threats against them is a precondition to ensuring 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression as set forth in article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his 
choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We also deem it appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of the Commission 
on Human Rights which calls upon states to ensure that victims of violations of the right to 
freedom of expression have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and acts of 
violence against journalists, and to bring to justice those responsible to combat impunity. 
 We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that accountability 
of any person responsible for the killing of Mr Alishayev and the attack against Mr Bitokov is 
ensured. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of these acts. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the killing of 
Mr Alishayev and the attack against Mr Bitokov. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have 
been inconclusive please explain why.   
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants, 
witnesses and family members of the victims are not subject to any intimidation or retaliation.

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Russia has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 22 January 2009</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
information we have received regarding Mr <b>Stanislav Markelov</b> and Ms. <b>Anastasia Baburova</b>. 
Mr. Stanislav Markelov was a lawyer dealing with various human rights related cases and 
active in defending victims of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations 
committed in Chechnya. Mr. Markelov was the lawyer of the family of Ms. Elsa Kungaeva, a 
Chechen woman abducted and murdered by an officer of the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation in the year 2000, Mr. Yuri Budanov, and was instrumental in the 2005 
conviction of a police officer, Sergei Lapin, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison for the 
torture and disappearance of a young Chechen man. Mr. Markelov previously also represented 
the journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Ms. Anatasia Baburova was a freelance investigative 
journalist working for the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 327 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Mr Stanislav Markelov was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 4 May 2004. No response has 
been received to that communication to date. 
</p>
<p> According to the information recently received: 
</p>
<p>On 19 January 2009, Mr Stanislaw Markelov was shot dead by a masked gunman near the 
building where he had previously held a press conference. He was shot in the back of the 
head at close range. Ms Anastasia Baburova, a journalist who also participated in the press 
conference and who tried to intervene when Mr Markelov was attacked, was also shot. She 
was taken to hospital in a critical condition where she died later of her injuries. 
The press conference held by Mr Markelov was entitled &#8220;Unlawful release of Budanov: 
neglect by the court and direct advantage for militants: who is next?&#8221; Mr. Budanov, 
who had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the abduction and murder of 
Ms. Elsa Kungaeva, including time served, in 2003, had been granted an early release on 
15 January 2009. Mr. Markelov stated at the press conference his intention to appeal the 
decision of the court of Dimitrovgrad to reject his appeal concerning Mr. Yuri Budanov&#8217;s 
early release from custody. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we do express concern 
that the killing of Mr. Stanislav Markelov and Ms. Anastasia Baburova may be directly related to 
Mr. Markelov&#8217;s work to defend victims of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right 
individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Lawyers play a particularly important role in this context, as recognized also in article 9 
para. 3 point c) of the Declaration, which provides that everyone has the right to offer and 
provide professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant advice and assistance in 
defending human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard, we would like to refer Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government also to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the 
Eight United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held 
at Havana, Cuba, from 27 August to 7 September 1990. In particular: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Principle 16. Governments shall ensure that lawyers (a) are able to perform all of their 
professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper 
interference. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Principle 17. Where the security of lawyers is threatened as a result of discharging their 
functions, they shall be adequately safeguarded by the authorities. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 328 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Principle 18. Lawyers shall not be identified with their clients or their clients&#8217; causes as 
a result of discharging their functions. 
</p>
<p> The murders of Mr Markelov and Ms Baburova are also of the greatest concern from the 
point of view of the right to freedom of expression. We have previously remarked in 
correspondence with your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the frequency of the attacks against 
independent journalists in the Russian Federation, and the impunity such attacks enjoy, may 
represent a direct attempt to prevent independent reporting. The killing of Ms Baburova is the 
most recent in a long series of murders of journalists in the Russian Federation, as reflected 
inter alia in the communications to your Government of concerning the killings of, respectively, 
the journalists Messrs Yevloyev and Alishayev. 
 We should once again like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in accordance with fundamental 
principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reiterated 
in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that 
&#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in 
writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted in a 
report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give rise to 
State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate measures to 
deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In Resolution 8/3 on the 
&#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), 
the Human Rights Council reiterates that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The 
Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those 
responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their 
families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to 
bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation on the 
State is all the more pressing when there is a pattern of attacks against a group, here independent 
journalists and human rights defenders, which can be seen as being in a confrontational 
relationship with the authorities. 
</p>
<p> These principles are echoed in article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders, which provide that the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection 
by the competent authorities of everyone against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de 
jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her 
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. Everyone is entitled to be 
protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, 
activities and acts attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
 In its resolution 2005/9, the Commission on Human Rights urged governments to refrain 
from all acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who avail or have availed themselves of 
procedures established under United Nations auspices for the protection of human rights and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 329 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms. In this recommendation, the Commission requested representatives of 
United Nations human rights bodies to continue to take urgent steps to help prevent the 
occurrence of intimidation and reprisals and to include in their respective reports allegations of 
intimidation or reprisal, as well as an account of action taken by them in this regard. 
</p>
<p> In its resolution 7/12, adopted without a vote, the Human Rights Council urged 
governments to take steps to protect witnesses of disappearances and the lawyers and families of 
disappeared persons against any intimidation or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected. 
 Further, in the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, adopted by General Assembly resolution 47/133, of 18 December 1992, it is 
stated that States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations of cases of 
disappearance, including the complainant, shall be protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or 
reprisal, and any cases of such treatment shall be appropriately punished. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters:

<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 28 January 2009</b>, sent with<b> </b>the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government information we 
have received concerning the recent death of Mr <b>Anton Stradymov</b>, a political activist involved 
with the banned National Bolshevik Party. We would in this context also like to bring to your 
Government&#8217;s attention reports regarding the alleged lack of progress in the investigation and 
prosecution of a similar case, the death of Mr. <b>Yura Chervochkin</b>, a Parliamentary candidate in 
the list of the opposition coalition &#8220;The Other Russia&#8221; and member of the banned National 
Bolshevik Party. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p>On 14 January 2009 Anton Stradymov was found in critical condition near the Vykhino 
metro station in Moscow. His body was covered with bruises. His face was smashed, 
impeding a prompt identification. His belongings had not been stolen. He was taken to 
hospital where he subsequently succumbed to his injuries. Anton Stradymov had taken part 
in a number of opposition demonstrations, including in the &#8220;Marches of Dissent&#8221; organised 
by &#8220;The Other Russia&#8221; coalition. 
</p>
<p>The violent death of Anton Stradymov bears resemblance to the death of another member 
of the banned National Bolshevik Party and of &#8220;The Other Russia&#8221; coalition, 
Yura Chervochkin. On 23 November 2007, in Serpukhov, Moscow oblast, 
Yura Chervochkin was found unconscious near the entrance of the building where he lived. 
He had been severely beaten and died on 10 December 2007, in the Burdenko Research 
Institute, the clinic where he was hospitalised in a comatose state. An hour before he was 
found, Yura Chervochkin had called the office of the Kasparov.ru web newspaper 
informing that four servicemen of UBOP, a special unit to combat organised crime, were 
following him and that he had recognised them from previous encounters. 
</p>
<p>Only after Yura Chervochkin died was an investigation launched into the assault. The 
investigation was suspended in April 2008 on the ground that &#8220;there were no suspects&#8221;. It 
was reopened in October 2008 and transferred, without any explanation being provided, to 
the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the town of Kashira (Moscow region). There, the investigation 
was again suspended in November 2008, apparently on the grounds of &#8220;lack of operative 
information&#8221;. Yura Chervochkin&#8217;s mother has repeatedly tried to obtain information on the 
progress of the investigation, but was told that no suspects had been apprehended and was 
turned away. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to refer 
your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which the Russian Federation is a party, provides that 
every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected 
by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). 
</p>
<p> Article 6 of the ICCPR requires the thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all 
violations of the right to life, particularly of suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary execution. Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 331 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;) 
provides guidelines for investigations, which include conducting an adequate autopsy, and the 
collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence. Families of the deceased 
should be notified of information relevant to the investigation, and the findings of the 
investigation should be made public (Prevention and Investigation Principles, Principles 16 
and 17). 
</p>
<p> We would like also to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental 
principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR. 
They provide that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall

seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the summary of the cases accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the criminal 
investigations or other inquiries which have been carried out in relation to the killings of 
Messrs Anton Stradymov and Yura Chervochkin. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are 
identified, please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. If no 
inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why.   
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information on the steps taken to comply with Principles 16 and 17 of

instituted criminal proceedings against an unidentified individual on the basis of evidence of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 332 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>an offence contrary to article 111, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (Wilful infliction of 
serious harm to health) in connection with the serious harm inflicted on the health of 
Mr. A.Y. Stradymov (born in 1988 and resident in Moscow). 
</p>
<p> In the course of the preliminary investigation, it was ascertained that on 14 January 2009, 
between midnight and 5 a.m., in an area adjacent to the property at 20 Krasny Kazanets Street, 
Moscow, an unidentified individual wounded Mr. Stradymov. He was subsequently taken to 
hospital in Moscow, where he died without regaining consciousness. 
</p>
<p> Enquiries into the character of the victim established that Mr. Stradymov was an active 
member of the unofficial National Bolshevik Party and had been arrested and prosecuted for 
administrative offences on several occasions. 
</p>
<p> Currently, investigations are being conducted to identify the persons involved in 
committing the offence. 
</p>
<p> On 22 November 2007, near 36 Vodoprovodnaya Street in the town of Serpukhov, 
Moscow province, at least four unidentified individuals assaulted Mr. Y.M. Chervochkin (born 
in 1984), who died of his injuries on 10 December 2007. 
 On 23 November 2007, the investigative department of the Internal Affairs Office for the 
town and district of Serpukhov, Moscow province, instituted criminal proceedings on the basis 
of evidence of an offence contrary to article 213, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code (Criminal 
mischief) in connection with the assault on Mr. Chervochkin. 
</p>
<p> The case was taken over by the chief of the investigation unit for the town of Serpukhov in 
the investigative department of the Investigative Committee attached to the Russian Federation 
Procurator&#8217;s Office for Moscow province on 13 December 2007, since the actions of the 
unidentified individuals were deemed to contain elements of the offence stipulated in article 111, 
paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (Infliction of serious harm to health resulting in the death of 
the victim). The criminal case was subsequently referred for investigation to the same 
investigative department&#8217;s investigation unit for the town of Kashira. The pretrial investigation 
into the case has been suspended several times, most recently on the basis of article 208, 
paragraph 1 (1), of the Code of Criminal Procedure (owing to the failure to identify persons 
against whom charges could be brought), although that decision was subsequently overturned. 
The necessary investigative and other procedural actions are being carried out in order to identify 
the persons involved in committing the offence. 
</p>
<p> With a view to shedding light on the offence, the victim&#8217;s close associates have been 
identified, and his activities in the National Bolshevik Party and Other Russia coalition, of which 
he was the coordinator for Moscow&#8217;s southern suburbs, are being studied. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Chervochkin&#8217;s mother, Ms. N.G. Chervochkina, has been recognized as a victim in the 
criminal case, and her rights under the Russian law on criminal procedure have been explained to 
her. Ms. Chervochkina has made no representations during the investigation. Following the post 
mortem, Mr. Chervochkin&#8217;s body was handed over to his mother for burial. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 333 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> To date, no one against whom charges can be brought for inflicting serious harm to health 
resulting in the deaths of Mr. Stradymov and Mr. Chervochkin has been identified. The pretrial 
investigations into these criminal cases are continuing; the progress made is being monitored by 
the procuratorial offices for Moscow and Moscow province, as well as by the Criminal 
Investigation Department of the Central Internal Affairs Administration for Moscow and 
Moscow province. In accordance with article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, details of a 
preliminary investigation may be made public only with the authorization of a procurator, 
investigator or person conducting a pretrial inquiry and only to the extent that he or she deems 
permissible.

<p><b>Saudi Arabia:  Death sentence of Suliamon Olyfemi 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Allegations rejected but without adequate substantiation 
<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of 
Saudi Arabia regarding the death sentence against Suliamon Olyfemi. The Special Rapporteur 
would note, however, that the information provided in no way refutes allegations that 
Mr. Olyfemi: was not assisted by lawyers at any stage of the legal proceedings; was asked to 
sign documents in Arabic without being provided a (written) translation; that Nigerian consular 
authorities were denied access to Olyfem; that he was sentenced to death in a closed trial; and, 
that he did not receive adequate translation during trial. That Mr. Olyfemi may not have 
requested a lawyer &#8220;during the investigative stage,&#8221; as the Government states, does not satisfy 
the requirement that he be informed of his right to counsel when charged with a criminal offence. 
The Government&#8217;s response also does not indicate whether and when Mr. Olyfemi received a 
copy of the judgment in his case and whether the judgment was translated into a language he 
could understand. 
</p>
<p> The SR would also note that he would continue to appreciate information that he has 
consistently requested regarding which offences carry the death penalty in the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, which courts can impose it, and what percentage of those sentenced to death and 
executed are foreigners.

<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 20 April 2007</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the case of Mr. <b>Suliamon Olyfemi</b>, a citizen of Nigeria, who is 
reportedly at imminent risk of execution. The case of Suliamon Olyfemi was previously brought 
to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government (together with the cases of 12 other Nigerian 
migrant workers) by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 334 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in a 
communication dated 30 November 2004. Regrettably, their communication has remained 
without reply. 
</p>
<p> According to the communication of 30 November 2004, Suliamon Olyfemi and 12 other 
Nigerian migrant workers resident in Jeddah: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;[&#8230;] were among hundreds detained in Jeddah on 29 September 2002 after a policeman 
was killed in a fight between local men and African nationals. All the other men arrested 
on that occasion have been deported, including 21 who served prison sentences ranging 
from six months to two years and flogging. 
</p>
<p>Subsequent to their arrest, the 13 Nigerian nationals were tortured and ill-treated, including 
being hung upside down and beaten and subjected to electric shocks to the genitals. Since 
their arrest over two years ago, the men have not had access to a lawyer or consular 
assistance. Moreover, translators were present on only two of the four previous court 
appearances, and all proceedings and court documents are in Arabic. 
</p>
<p>On 22 November 2004, a hearing in the case of the 13 men took place before three judges 
in a closed session, without the assistance of a lawyer, a consular representative or 
adequate translation facilities. They could not fully understand the proceedings, which 
were conducted in Arabic, and were not able to fully understand whether the hearing 
concerned the prolongation of their detention or constituted their trial.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> According to information received since then, Suliamon Olyfemi was sentenced to death at 
a closed trial in May 2005. The twelve other Nigerian men were sentenced to prison terms and 
corporal punishment. During the trial, Suliamon Olyfemi and his co-defendants neither had 
access to legal representation nor to consular assistance, nor did they benefit from adequate 
translation. During interrogation they had been told to put their fingerprints, which can act as a 
signature, on statements written in Arabic, which they do not read. It is possible that these 
statements were used as evidence against them during the trial proceedings. Staff from the 
Nigerian consulate in Jeddah attempted to visit the men in prison on 19 May 2005, but were not 
allowed to see them. The death sentence imposed on Suliamon Olyfemi has recently been upheld 
by the Court of Cassation and ratified by the Supreme Judicial Council. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we 
respectfully remind your Excellency that in capital punishment cases the obligation to provide 
criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; 
(Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) allows no derogation. A central 
element of the right to a fair hearing is the right to be assisted by legal counsel. In this respect, 
we would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in particular 
Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of 
their choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of criminal </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 335 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>proceedings&#8221; and principle 5; &#8220;Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately 
informed by the competent authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice 
upon arrest or detention or when charged with a criminal offence.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> The right to a fair hearing also requires that defendants be given information on the 
proceedings in which their culpability and sentence will be determined as further stated in the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers: &#8220;It is the duty of the competent authorities to ensure 
lawyers access to appropriate information, files and documents in their possession or control in 
sufficient time to enable lawyers to provide effective legal assistance to their clients. Such access 
should be provided at the earliest appropriate time.&#8221; (Principle 21). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to remind your Government that article 15 of the Convention against 
Torture provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to 
have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except 
against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; Furthermore, in 
paragraph 4 of Resolution 2005/39, the Commission on Human Rights urges States ensure that 
statements which are established to have been made as a result of torture are not admitted as 
evidence. 
</p>
<p> As for the right to a &#8220;public hearing&#8221;, while courts may exclude the public from all or part 
of a trial where publicity would imperil national security or other legitimate interests (e.g. the 
privacy rights of a minor), the judgment rendered in a criminal case must be made public, 
allowing only the narrowest of exceptions which clearly find no application in the case at issue. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, it should be noted that secrecy surrounding trial, sentence and 
post-conviction proceedings also makes the effective exercise of the right to appeal the sentence 
and to seek its commutation impossible. Considering the irrevocable nature of capital 
punishment, these rights are all the more fundamental. Only the full respect for stringent due 
process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as still allowed under international law from 
a summary execution, which violates the most fundamental human right. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that 
the rights under international law of Suliamon Olyfemi are respected. Considering the 
irremediable nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the execution until 
the complaints regarding his right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and 
impartial tribunal established by law have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this 
respect dispelled. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Commission on Human 
Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify 
all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human 
Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? In particular, is it 
accurate that Suliamon Olyfemi was not assisted by lawyers at any stage of the proceedings? Is it 
accurate that he was asked to sign documents in Arabic without being provided a (written) </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 336 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>translation? What use was made of these documents? Is it accurate that Nigerian consular 
authorities were denied access to Suliamon Olyfemi? At what stage did he receive a copy of the 
judgment in his case? Was the judgment translated into a language he can understand? 
</p><p> 2. Were the proceedings in this case in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia? 
</p>
<p> 3. We would finally like to reiterate the request by the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers in communications to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 24 January 2007 
and 5 April 2007 for clarification of which offences carry the death penalty in the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, which courts can impose it, and what percentage of those sentenced to death and 
executed are foreigners. We have received reports according to which in 2005 out of 
86 executions known to have taken place in Saudi Arabia 39 concerned foreigners, in the 
year 2006 27 out of 39, and in 2007 (to date) 15 out of 34 executions concerned foreigners. If 
these figures were correct, more than 50 percent of those executed would be foreigners. Can your 
Government confirm or correct these statistics? 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of Saudi Arabia 28 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> The Permanent Mission, of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations Office and 
other International Organizations at Geneva, presents its compliments to the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and. has the honour to refer to 
communication UA G/SO 214.(3-3143) G/SO 214 (106-7) G/SO 214 ( 33-24) G/SO 214 (53-21) 
of 20 April the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in which they requested 
information concerning the Nigerian prisoner Mr. Suliamon Alyfemi. 
</p>
<p> In this connection, the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have 
indicated as follows: 
</p>
<p>1. The assistance of a lawyer during the investigatory stage was not requested by any of the 
accused or by their country&#8217;s embassy. 
</p>
<p>2. The accused were assisted by accredited translators during, the stage of interrogation and 
subsequent signature by them of the record, of the interrogation proceedings. 
</p>
<p>3. The Nigerian authorities did not request access to the accused at any stage of the 
investigation. However, the Director of Prisons in the Governorate of Jedda indicated that the 
Consulate General of the Republic of Nigeria at Jeddah had requested permission for some 
persons to visit the Nigerian prisoners on Saturday 42/3/1428 AH (31 March 2007). 
</p>
<p>4. During the interrogation of the accused the competent authorities did not observe any signs 
of torture or other ill-treatment to which some of the accused claimed to have been subjected 
during their preliminary questioning. A physical examination conducted at the time by the 
investigating officer did not reveal any signs of assault and a report to this effect was duly drawn 
up. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 337 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. The attack by the accused on the police officers is attributable to the implementation, 
on 8/9/1423 AH (13 November 2002), of the first phase of the Diya&#8217; 90 campaign to arrest 
Nigerian nationals living in the Balad district of Jeddah in violation of the Kingdom&#8217;s residence 
regulations. When one of the Nigerians, Salswa al-Lami, nicknamed &#8220;al-Mutawwa&#8221;, was 
arrested, Suliamon and the other accused attacked the police officers, freed their friend, and then 
continued to pursue the officers, pelting them with empty bottles, sticks and skewers. When one 
of the police officers, senior patrolman Ali bin Tami Asiri, fell to the ground they assaulted him 
and beat him with the automatic weapon that he was carrying, thereby causing his death. 
Patrolman Essam bin Salim Al-Muwallad and private Fawaz bin Uweili Al-Muwallad were also 
injured during the assault and the window of a police patrol vehicle was broken so that one of the 
arrested persons could be taken out after the patrol commander was attacked. The accused 
person, Suliamon, confessed to taking the automatic weapon from the police officer&#8217;s hand when 
the latter fell to the ground, after which he struck him three times with the butt of the weapon; 
first on his right cheek, then on the right side of the back of his head, and finally on his shoulder, 
after which he threw the weapon on the victim&#8217;s body as he lay on the ground. He observed 
blood flowing from the dying man&#8217;s mouth before they fled. The accused also affirmed and 
legally testified that he and his associates had conspired in advance to attack the police officers. 
The case was investigated by a district police committee and examined by the Makkah branch of 
the Public Investigation and Prosecution Department, after which the accused were questioned 
again by the Department. The indictment was drawn up and reviewed by the Department&#8217;s 
governing body (Review Decision No. 470/M of 1423 AH).

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 13 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding three persons, <b>Ali Hassan &#8216;Issa al-Buri</b>, <b>Qassim Bin Rida Bin 
Sulayman al Mahdi</b> and <b>Khalid Bin Muhammad &#8216;Issa al-Qadih</b> who have reportedly been 
sentenced to death and are at imminent risk of execution. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 338 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Ali Hassan &#8216;Issa al-Buri, Qassim Bin Rida Bin Sulayman al Mahdi and Khalid Bin 
Muhammad &#8216;Issa al-Qadih, were arrested in 2004 on charges of drug smuggling. 
Qassim Bin Rida Bin Sulayman al Mahdi and Khalid Bin Muhammad &#8216;Issa al-Qadih were 
sentenced to death and Ali Hassan &#8216;Issa al-Buri was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment 
and 5000 lashes. However, it is reported that during their interrogation they were held 
incommunicado and that their confessions, on which their convictions are based, were 
extracted under torture. In addition, allegedly, they were convicted following a trial during 
which they were not legally represented. 
</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation reviewed the case and requested a reduction in the men&#8217;s sentence. 
Despite this ruling the Lower Court reportedly maintained the death penalty for Qassim 
Bin Rida Bin Sulayman al Mahdi and Khalid Bin Muhammad &#8216;Issa al-Qadih and increased 
Ali Hassan &#8216;Issa al-Buri&#8217;s sentence by sentencing him to death. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding this specific 
case, we would like to respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the 
death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive 
manner. A thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal 
United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, indicates that 
a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention 
to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). This is consistent with the 
conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in interpreting Article 6(2) of the Covenant. The 
Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a death sentence for offences that do not 
result in the loss of life, finding only cases involving murder not to raise concerns under the most 
serious crimes provision. According to the information we have received, the offences for which 
Ali Hassan &#8216;Issa al-Buri, Qassim Bin Rida Bin Sulayman al Mahdi and Khalid Bin Muhammad 
&#8216;Issa al-Qadih Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad have been convicted did not involve any intentional killing. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, we respectfully remind your Excellency that in capital punishment cases the 
obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent and 
impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) allows no 
derogation. This guarantee includes the right to be assisted by legal counsel and the right not to 
be compelled to confess guilt.  
</p>
<p> We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the 
circumstances regarding the cases of the persons named above. We would like to stress that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. 
This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We further recall 
that paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 urges States &#8220;to ensure that 
no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made&#8221;. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an essential aspect 
of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in Article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p>

</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights 
under international law of Ali Hassan &#8216;Issa al-Buri, Qassim Bin Rida Bin Sulayman al Mahdi 
and Khalid Bin Muhammad &#8216;Issa al-Qadih are fully respected. Considering the irreversible 
nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all 
concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on this case to 
the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on

</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation,

&#8216;Issa al-Qadih&#8217;s confessions were extorted by torture and that they were denied access to

</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the sentences imposed against seven Filipino men found guilty of a 
triple murder. Three of them were sentenced to death and four to eight years imprisonment and 
one thousand lashes each.  
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received:

<p><b>Edison Gonzales</b>, <b>Rolando Manaloto</b> <b>Gonzales</b>, <b>Eduardo Arcilla</b>, <b>Victoriano Alfonso</b>, 
<b>Efren Francisco Dimaun</b>, <b>Omar Basillo</b> and <b>Joel Sinamban</b>, seven Filipino migrant

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>July 2007. Eduardo Arcilla, Edison Gonzales and Rolando Manaloto Gonzales were 
sentenced to death. Victoriano Alfonso, Efren Francisco Dimaun, Omar Basillo, and 
Joel Sinamban were sentenced to eight years imprisonment and one thousand lashes each. 
</p>
<p>The seven men were held incommunicado and were not given access to lawyers until 
April 2008, i.e. eight months after their conviction and sentencing in first instance. 
Allegedly, they were also tortured during interrogation in order to force them to confess to 
the murders, including by being beaten on the soles of their feet. 
</p>
<p>The seven men are currently held at Briman Prison in Jeddah. It would appear that their 
appeals are still pending before the second instance court. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles 
applicable to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p> We would in the first place respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in 
capital punishment cases the obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing 
before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights) admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the 
right to be assisted by legal counsel at all stages of proceedings and the right not to be compelled 
to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> A central element of the right to a fair hearing is the right to be assisted by legal counsel. In 
this respect, we would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Basic Principles 
on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in 
particular Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a 
lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of 
criminal proceedings&#8221;. Principle 7 reads: &#8220;Governments shall further ensure that all persons 
arrested or detained, with or without criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and 
in any case not later than forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or detention.&#8221; If it was 
confirmed that the seven men were given access to lawyers only after two years of 
incommunicado detention and eight months after being sentenced in first instance, this would 
most radically negate the possibility of a fair trial. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would also like to draw the attention of your Government to 
paragraph 12 of General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, which 
&#8220;reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect 
the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person&#8221;. Prolonged 
incommunicado detention furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees of the right to a 
fair trial, such as being assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s 
defence. 
</p>
<p> We also recall that paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 urges 
States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 341 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made&#8221;. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in 
Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> To sum up, only the full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which violates 
the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take 
all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Eduardo Arcilla, 
Edison Gonzales and Rolando Manaloto Gonzales are fully respected. Considering the 
irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed 
until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety, or the above named men are 
given a new trial or released. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to express our concern regarding the apparently disproportionate 
number of foreigners among those sentenced to death in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As 
already noted in a previous communication to your Government, we have received reports 
according to which in 2005 out of 86 executions known to have taken place in Saudi Arabia 39 
concerned foreigners, in the year 2006 27 out of 39, and in 2007 (as of April of that year) 15 out 
of 34 executions concerned foreigners. Recent reports indicate that out of 66 persons executed so 
far in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the course of the current year, almost half were foreign 
nationals. If these figures were correct, approximately 50 percent of those executed would be 
foreigners. Similarly, among the 18 individual cases of persons sentenced to death reported to us 
and brought to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government by the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and other Special Procedures mandate holders 
since January 2007, ten concerned foreign nationals. While we are fully aware that the Kingdom 
hosts a significant number of migrant workers and other foreign nationals, these statistics raise 
certain questions in terms of possible discrimination in relation to both criminal enforcement and 
sentencing. It would be important to know if more than half of the capital offences are 
committed by foreigners, if the police use the same approach in investigating and charging both 
locals and foreigners, and if the sentences handed down are equally harsh in relation to both 
foreigners and locals. In addition, foreigners in conflict with the law are particularly vulnerable 
and require special measures to ensure the fairness of the proceedings against them, including 
interpretation and consular assistance. These needs are protected by international human rights 
law and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which Saudi Arabia is a party. In 
communications to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 24 January 2007, 5 April 2007 and 
20 April 2007 we sought clarification of what percentage of those sentenced to death and 
executed are foreigners. Regrettably, we never received a reply to this question, which we would 
like to reiterate. 
</p>
<p> As far as the sentence to thousand lashes imposed against Victoriano Alfonso, 
Efren Francisco Dimaun, Omar Basillo, and Joel Sinamban is concerned, we would like to draw 
your Government&#8217;s attention to the report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture to the 
60th session of the General Assembly, in which he, with reference to the jurisprudence of UN 
treaty bodies, concluded that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States 
cannot invoke provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 342 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>under international law, including the prohibition of corporal punishment and called upon States 
to abolish all forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (para.28 
A/60/316). Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have called 
for the abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 
(1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment must 
extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for a 
crime of as an educative or disciplinary measure. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
Edison Gonzales, Rolando Manaloto Gonzales, Eduardo Arcilla, Victoriano Alfonso, 
Efren Francisco Dimaun, Omar Basillo and Joel Sinamban were detained incommunicado for 
two years and subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. If no inquiries have taken place or 
if they have been inconclusive please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information as to how the principle that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, is 
implemented in Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details regarding the defendants&#8217; access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p> 5. We would finally like to reiterate our request in communications to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government of 24 January 2007, 5 April 2007 and 20 April 2007 for clarification 
of what percentage of those sentenced to death and executed are foreigners. 
</p>
<p><b>Saudi Arabia:  Death sentences, flogging and imprisonment for seven persons

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 15 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the sentences imposed against seven persons, including four who 
were children at the time of the offences, found guilty of theft, robbery and assault. Five of them 
were sentenced to death and two to flogging and imprisonment. 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p><b>Sultan Bin Khalid Mahmud al-Maskati, Yusef Bin Hassan Bin Salman al-Muwallad, 
Qassim Bin &#8216;Ali Bin Ibrahim Al-Nakhli, Sultan Bin Sulayman Bin Muslim 
al-Muwallad,&#8216;Issa bin Muhammad &#8216;Umar Muhammad, Bilal Bin Muslih Bin Jabir 
al-Muwallad </b>and<b> Ahmad Hamid Muhammad Sabir</b> were arrested in 2004 and charged 
with theft, robbery and assault. Bilal Bin Muslih Bin Jabir al-Muwallad and Ahmad Hamid 
Muhammad Sabir were aged 15 and 13 respectively at the time of the offences. Sultan Bin 
Sulayman Bin Muslim al-Muwallad and &#8216;Issa bin Muhammad &#8216;Umar Muhammad were 
both aged 17 when the offences were committed. &#8216;Issa bin Muhammad &#8216;Umar Muhammad 
and Ahmad Hamid Muhammad Sabir are citizens of Chad, the other five of the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>Following their arrest, they were held incommunicado at police stations in the city of 
Madina. There they were allegedly beaten in an attempt to make them confess. In 
February 2008 the General Court in Madina sentenced Sultan Bin Khalid Mahmud 
al-Maskati, Yusef Bin Hassan Bin Salman al-Muwallad, Qassim Bin &#8216;Ali Bin Ibrahim 
Al-Nakhli, Sultan Bin Sulayman Bin Muslim al-Muwallad and &#8216;Issa bin Muhammad 
&#8216;Umar Muhammad to death. The two youngest ones, Bilal Bin Muslih Bin Jabir 
al-Muwallad and Ahmad Hamid Muhammad Sabir, were sentenced to &#8220;severe flogging&#8221; 
and a term of imprisonment. In July 2008, the Court of Cassation in Mecca upheld the 
sentences. The cases are currently before the Supreme Judicial Council. 
</p>
<p>Allegedly, the seven convicts and their relatives might not be informed of the outcome of 
review by the Supreme Judicial Council and of the date set for the execution of the 
sentences until the day that the executions and floggings are to be carried out. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles 
applicable to these cases under international law. 
</p>
<p> We would in the first place respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that 
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia is a Party, expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for 
offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. We have taken note of the 
clarification provided by your Government to the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions with regard to another case of a juvenile offender sentenced to death 
(A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, p. 345) that &#8220;the regulations applied in the Kingdom stipulate that a person 
can be held criminally responsible for acts that he commits after reaching the age of majority, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 344 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>which differs from one individual to another and might exceed 18 years&#8221;. As already observed 
by the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, p. 343), the application of these regulations is 
inconsistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which clearly establishes in 
Article 37(a) that &#8220;[n]either capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of 
release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> In this respect we also note that the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its 
Concluding Observations regarding your Government&#8217;s Second Periodic Report under the 
Convention, &#8220;&#8230;urges the State party to take the necessary steps to immediately suspend the 
execution of all death penalties imposed on persons for having committed a crime before the age 
of 18, to take the appropriate legal measures to convert them into penalties in conformity with 
the provisions of the Convention and to abolish as a matter of the highest priority the death 
penalty as a sentence imposed on persons for having committed crimes before the age of 18, as 
required by article 37 of the Convention.&#8221; (CRC/C/SAU/CO/2, para. 33). 
</p>
<p> The death sentences imposed against Sultan Bin Sulayman Bin Muslim al-Muwallad and 
&#8216;Issa bin Muhammad &#8216;Umar Muhammad, who were reportedly aged 17 at the time of the 
offences, would appear to be incompatible with these obligations under international law of your 
Government. 
</p>
<p> As far as the three men who were young adults at the time of the offences are concerned 
(Sultan Bin Khalid Mahmud al-Maskati, Yusef Bin Hassan Bin Salman al-Muwallad, and 
Qassim Bin &#8216;Ali Bin Ibrahim Al-Nakhli), we would like to respectfully remind your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death penalty is not prohibited under international 
law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, 
it must be interpreted in the most restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most 
serious crimes. A thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal 
United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that 
a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention 
to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). According to the information we 
have received, the offences for which Sultan Bin Khalid Mahmud al-Maskati, Yusef Bin Hassan 
Bin Salman al-Muwallad and Qassim Bin &#8216;Ali Bin Ibrahim Al-Nakhli have been convicted were 
not intended to result in any killings and did not result in loss of life. 
</p>
<p> Thirdly, we remind your Excellency that in capital punishment cases the obligation to 
provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial 
tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) allows no derogation. This 
guarantee includes the right to be assisted by legal counsel and the right not to be compelled to 
confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> In the latter respect, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to Article 15 
of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, which provides that &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; This was reiterated in paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008. In </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 345 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an essential aspect of the 
non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a party. 
</p>
<p> We also recall paragraph 12 of General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 
of 14 February 2007, which &#8220;reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or 
detention in secret places may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and 
urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the 
person&#8221;. Prolonged incommunicado detention furthermore negates the abovementioned 
guarantees of the right to a fair trial, such as being assisted by a lawyer and having adequate 
facilities to prepare one&#8217;s defence. 
</p>
<p> In addition, with regard to reports that the seven convicts and their relatives might not be 
informed of the outcome of review by the Supreme Judicial Council and of the date set for the 
execution of the sentences until the day that the executions and floggings are to be carried out, 
we would like to recall that transparency is one of the fundamental due process safeguards 
contributing towards efforts to prevent the arbitrary deprivation of life (see the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on Transparency and the 
Imposition of the Death Penalty, E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3). As that report explains in greater 
detail (paras. 26 and ff.), &#8220;condemned persons, their families and their lawyers should be 
provided with timely and reliable information on the procedures and timing of appeals, clemency 
petitions, and executions. Experience demonstrates that to do otherwise is highly likely to lead to 
violations of due process rights and to inhuman and degrading treatment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> To sum up, only the full respect for the limitations placed by international law on the use 
of the death penalty and for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which violates the most 
fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Sultan Bin Khalid Mahmud al-Maskati, 
Yusef Bin Hassan Bin Salman al-Muwallad, Qassim Bin &#8216;Ali Bin Ibrahim Al-Nakhli, Sultan Bin 
Sulayman Bin Muslim al-Muwallad and &#8216;Issa bin Muhammad &#8216;Umar Muhammad are fully 
respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the 
death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety, or 
the above named are given a new trial or released. 
</p>
<p> As far as the sentence to flogging imposed against Bilal Bin Muslih Bin Jabir al-Muwallad 
and Ahmad Hamid Muhammad Sabir is concerned, who were allegedly aged 13 and 15 
respectively at the time of the offences, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to 
the report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture to the 60th session of the General Assembly, in 
which he, with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty bodies, concluded that any form of 
corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States cannot invoke provisions of 
domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations under international law, 
including the prohibition of corporal punishment, and called upon States to abolish all forms of 
judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (para.28 A/60/316). </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 346 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In considering your Government&#8217;s Second Periodic Report under the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the Committee noted your Government&#8217;s &#8220;reassurance that corporal 
punishment is not imposed upon minors&#8221;. However, it urged your Government &#8220;to take all 
necessary steps for the immediate abolition of extrajudicial and summary floggings of teenagers 
as well as other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments imposed on persons having 
committed a crime when under the age of 18 years&#8221; ((CRC/C/SAU/CO/2, paras. 42 and 43). 
Also the Committee against Torture, in considering your Government&#8217;s report, expressed its 
concern with regard to &#8220;[t]he sentencing to, and imposition of, corporal punishments by judicial 
and administrative authorities, including, in particular, flogging and amputation of limbs, that are 
not in conformity with the Convention&#8221; (CAT/C/CR/28/5, para. 4(c)). It therefore recommended 
that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia &#8220;[r]e-examine its imposition of corporal punishments, which 
are in breach of the Convention&#8221; (CAT/C/CR/28/5, para. 8(b)). 
</p>
<p> We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that 
the sentence to flogging imposed against Bilal Bin Muslih Bin Jabir al-Muwallad and 
Ahmad Hamid Muhammad Sabir is not carried out. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
the seven abovementioned persons were held incommunicado at police stations in the city of 
Madina and beaten in an attempt to make them confess. If no inquiries have taken place or if 
they have been inconclusive please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information as to how the principle that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, is 
implemented in Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details regarding the defendants&#8217; access to legal counsel. We take 
note of your Government&#8217;s general statement, made in reply to a previous communication, that 
&#8220;Article 140 of the Code [of Criminal Procedure] stipulates that a person accused of a major 
offence should appear in person before the court, without prejudice to his right to defence 
counsel&#8221; (see A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, p. 338). We would like to know how this right to defence 
counsel was ensured in the present cases. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please explain which offences carry the death penalty under the laws of the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia. We note that in its reply to our communication of 5 April 2007 in another 
capital punishment case your Excellency&#8217;s Government stated that &#8220;[d]eath sentences are handed </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 347 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>down by the general courts in cases entailing the fixed penalties prescribed in the Islamic Shari&#8217;a 
and in cases of lex talionis and crimes involving repeated offences of drug smuggling and 
trafficking.&#8221; The present cases, in which the charges reportedly were theft, robbery and assault 
would, however, not appear to fall into these categories. 
</p>
<p> 6. Please provide detailed information on the laws governing the imposition of capital 
punishment and corporal punishment for offences committed by minors, and on how your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government intends to bring those laws in line with its obligations under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b>Saudi Arabia:  Death for two foreign nationals, lashes and imprisonment sentence  
for one minor foreign national 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment

<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of 
Saudi Arabia. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8217;s statement that Sharia law 
prohibits torture and the extraction of evidence obtained through torture, but would note, 
however, that the Government&#8217;s response does not provide details of any investigation or other 
inquiries to refute allegations that Mohamed Kohail, Sultan Kohail and Mehanna Sa&#8217;d were 
subjected to torture. The Special Rapporteur would also note that the Government&#8217;s response 
acknowledges that two of the defendants were held incommunicado under a provision of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s criminal law that permits incommunicado detention for up to 
60 days. With respect to this incommunicado detention, the Special Rapporteur notes that states 
cannot invoke provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations 
under international law. In addition, the Special Rapporteur notes that the Government&#8217;s 
response in no way refutes allegations that Mohamed Kohail and Mehanna Sa&#8217;d were sentenced 
to death following a trial in which their lawyer was not permitted to participate (except for one or 
two sessions) and was not permitted to challenge the evidence against his clients. The Special 
Rapporteur remains concerned about the allegations that sentences against the three individuals, 
including the death penalty, were imposed by the Government based on coerced evidence and 
without due process, including effective assistance of counsel. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 21 August 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
 In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the sentences imposed against three foreign nationals, 
<b>Mohamed Kohail</b>, <b>Mehanna Sa&#8217;d</b> and <b>Sultan Kohail</b>. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 348 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p>Mohamed Kohail (now aged 23) and his brother Sultan Kohail (now aged 17) are citizens 
of Canada. Mehanna Sa&#8217;d (now aged 22) is a citizen of Jordan. The three were charged 
with the murder of a boy who died in a fight in January 2007. Following their arrest, they 
were held incommunicado for approximately one and a half months. They were allegedly 
beaten in an attempt to make them confess. 
</p>
<p>In March 2008, the General Court in Jeddah sentenced Mohamed Kohail and 
Mehanna Sa&#8217;d to death. Their trial before the General Court in Jeddah had taken place over 
nine sessions, but their lawyer was allowed to attend only the last one or two, and was 
allegedly not allowed to challenge the evidence brought against his clients. The Court of 
Cassation subsequently reviewed the case and sent it back to the General Court with 
recommendations to review the sentence. On 9 August 2008, the Jeddah General Court 
rejected the recommendations of the Court of Cassation and/or sentenced the two men to 
death again. The case is now again before the Court of Cassation. If upheld, the death 
sentences would be submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council for approval. 
</p>
<p>Sultan Kohail was sentenced to 200 lashes and one year&#8217;s imprisonment by the Jeddah 
Summary Court in April 2008. In his case, the Court of Cassation recommended that the 
case be re-tried by a General Court, which has the power to pass the death sentence against 
him. His case is now awaiting retrial at a General Court. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles 
applicable to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p> We would in the first place respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in 
capital punishment cases the obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing 
before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights) admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the 
right to be assisted by legal counsel at all stages of proceedings and the right not to be compelled 
to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> A central element of the right to a fair hearing is the right to be assisted by legal counsel. In 
this respect, we would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Basic Principles 
on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in 
particular Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a 
lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of 
criminal proceedings&#8221;. Principle 7 reads: &#8220;Governments shall further ensure that all persons 
arrested or detained, with or without criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and 
in any case not later than forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or detention.&#8221; If it was 
confirmed that they were detained incommunicado for a month and a half after their arrest and 
that the lawyer of Mohamed Kohail and Mehanna Sa&#8217;d was allowed only to attend the last one or 
two hearings of their trial, this would negate the possibility of a fair trial. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 349 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would also like to draw the attention of your Government to 
paragraph 12 of General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, which 
&#8220;reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect 
the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person&#8221;. Prolonged 
incommunicado detention furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees of the right to a 
fair trial, such as being assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s 
defence. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to draw the attention of your Government to Article 15 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
to which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a party, which provides that &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not 
be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as 
evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; This was reiterated in paragraph 6c of Human Rights 
Council resolution 8/8 of 2008. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is 
also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter 
alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> To sum up, only the full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which violates 
the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Mohamed Kohail and 
Mehanna Sa&#8217;d are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this 
can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have raised are 
dispelled in their entirety, or the two men are given a new trial or released. 
</p>
<p> As far as the sentence to 200 lashes imposed against Sultan Kohail, who appears to have 
been aged 16 at the time of the offence, are concerned, we would like to draw your 
Government&#8217;s attention to the report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture to the 60th session of 
the General Assembly, in which he, with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty bodies, 
concluded that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States cannot 
invoke provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations under 
international law, including the prohibition of corporal punishment, and called upon States to 
abolish all forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (para.28 
A/60/316). 
</p>
<p> The Committee on the Rights of the Child, in considering your Government&#8217;s Second 
Periodic Report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, noted your Government&#8217;s 
&#8220;reassurance that corporal punishment is not imposed upon minors&#8221;. However, it urged your 
Government &#8220;to take all necessary steps for the immediate abolition of extrajudicial and 
summary floggings of teenagers as well as other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
punishments imposed on persons having committed a crime when under the age of 18 years&#8221; 
((CRC/C/SAU/CO/2, paras. 42 and 43). Also the Committee against Torture, in considering your </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 350 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s report, expressed its concern with regard to &#8220;[t]he sentencing to, and imposition 
of, corporal punishments by judicial and administrative authorities, including, in particular, 
flogging and amputation of limbs, that are not in conformity with the Convention&#8221; 
(CAT/C/CR/28/5, para. 4(c)). It therefore recommended that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
&#8220;[r]e-examine its imposition of corporal punishments, which are in breach of the Convention&#8221; 
(CAT/C/CR/28/5, para. 8(b)). 
</p>
<p> Finally, we welcome the decision of the Court of Cassation to ask the lower courts to 
reconsider the sentence imposed in the case of Sultan Kohail, which provides an opportunity to 
vacate a sentence which, as argued above, is incompatible with your Government&#8217;s obligations 
under international law. We are concerned, however, that the referral of Sultan Kohail&#8217;s case to 
the General Court in Jeddah could result in the imposition of the death penalty against him. In 
this respect, we would remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that Article 37(a) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a Party, 
expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by 
persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
Mohamed Kohail, Sultan Kohail and Mehanna Sa&#8217;d were detained incommunicado for a month 
and a half and subjected to torture in order to compel them to confess. If no inquiries have taken 
place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information as to how the principle that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, is 
implemented in Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details regarding the three defendants&#8217; access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide information on the further developments in the cases of 
Mohamed Kohail, Mehanna Sa&#8217;d and Sultan Kohail.

</p>
<p>21 August 2008 from the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in which they 
requested clarification regarding the cases of Mohamed Kohail, Mehanna Sa&#8217;d and 
Sultan Kohail. 
</p>
<p> In this connection, the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have brought 
forward the following explanation on the above cases: 
</p>
<p> (1) Jeddah police has transmitted the suit of the above-mentioned persons to the 
Commission for Investigation and General Prosecution (Mecca Branch), regarding a mass 
quarrel resulted in the assassination of a man called Monzer Mo&#8217;in Al Haraki, a Syrian citizen. 
The inquiry and the interrogations made with these persons revealed the indictment of those 
involved in the incident namely Mohamed Kohail and Mehanna Sa&#8217;d of the assassination 
intentionally of Monzer Mo&#8217;in Al Haraki beating hire fatal strokes. Afterwards, Monzer Mo&#8217;in 
Al Haraki drops down dead. Likewise, &#8216; a charge has been raised against Sultan Kohail for 
taking part with them in beating the man assassinated and making improper advances to the girl 
called Raneem Al Haraki and uttered against her vulgar and dirty utterances, and for his 
complicity and incitement in the quarrel according to the evidence and indication set forth in the 
bill of indictment. The lawsuit has been transmitted to the General Court in Jeddah in order to be 
examined with regard to the public and private rights. A legal judgment N. 13/300/7 was issued 
on 26/2/1429 (4 March 2008) comprising the sentence of death penalty against Mohamed Kohail 
and Mehanna Sa&#8217;d. The case has been transmitted to the Court of Cassation. 
</p>
<p> The legal documents of the juvenile Sultan Kohail have been forwarded to the penal court 
in Jeddah to be&#8217; considered by the juvenile judge. A legal judgment has been issued comprising 
the imprisonment of the juvenile Sultan Koliail for one year and 200 lashes. 
 (2) The above two persons accused were held incommunicado, without any violation of 
their rights to contact their lawyers, in the interest of the investigation, for a period not exceeding 
60 days according to article (&#8216;119) of the law of criminal procedures. They were not subject to 
torture and their confessions and avowals were registered and checked up in the presence of their 
lawyers and-were legally endorsed by the General Court in Jeddah. 
</p>
<p> (3) The governing rules in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the Sharia which prohibits 
torture and the extraction of any confession under torture. The Sharia proscribes harming any 
person held in custody either physically or morally, and forbids to be subject to torture or 
degrading treatment for his dignity pursuant to article two of the law of criminal procedures 
which does not recognize any confession extracted under torture. 
</p>
<p> (4) During the first hearing of investigation with each of the persons accused and before 
starting the interrogation, a reading of the guarantees has taken place regarding their rights to call 
upon the assistance of a lawyer. Subsequently, they have appointed a lawyer and he was present 
in the interrogation hearing and was apprised of the legal proceedings documents and has 
examined the entire procedure. </p>

<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 24 October 2008</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers<b> 
</b> We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding the cases of two foreign men reportedly sentenced to death on charges of apostasy or 
witchcraft following trials in which they did not, allegedly, enjoy the fundamental fair trial 
guarantees. One of the men, <b>Sabri Bogday</b>, might soon be at risk of execution, while the other, 
<b>Mustafa Ibrahim</b>, was executed in 2007. 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p>Sabri Bogday, a Turkish citizen, owned a barber shop in Jeddah. He was arrested on 
11 March 2007 as he had been reported to the police to have insulted Islam and sworn at 
God in public. He was tried without the assistance of a lawyer or an interpreter, even 
though his knowledge of Arabic is apparently limited. On 31 March 2008 he was found 
guilty and sentenced to death on charges of apostasy. His case is reportedly currently at the 
review stage before the Court of Cassation. Sabri Bogday is detained in Briman Prison in 
Jeddah. 
</p>
<p>Mustafa Ibrahim, a citizen of Egypt, was arrested in May 2007 in Arar, where he worked 
as a pharmacist, and accused of apostasy for having degraded a copy of the Qur&#8217;an. It is 
not known when his trial took place, whether he was assisted by a lawyer, whether he 
appealed against his first instance sentence. On 2 November 2007, Mustafa Ibrahim was 
executed in Riyadh. According to announcement of the execution by the Ministry of the 
Interior, he was convicted of practicing sorcery and witchcraft. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles 
applicable to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the charges of apostasy, sorcery and witchcraft, we would like to 
respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death penalty is not 
prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 353 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most restrictive manner and can 
be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and systematic review of the 
jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most 
serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it 
can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, 
para. 53). According to the information we have received, the offences for which Sabri Bogday 
and Mustafa Ibrahim did not result in loss of life. 
</p>
<p> We would further remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment cases 
the obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent 
and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) admits of no 
exception. Relevant to the cases at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the right to be assisted 
by legal counsel at all stages of proceedings. In this respect, we would also like to refer Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth 
United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 
Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in particular Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are 
entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights 
and to defend them in all stages of criminal proceedings&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which violates the most 
fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Sabri Bogday are fully respected. 
Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty 
is not executed until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety.

</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details regarding the trial of Sabri Bogday: which provisions of 
criminal law was he found guilty of having violated; was he assisted by legal counsel, if so, at 
what stages of the proceedings; was he assisted by an interpreter; was his trial open to the public; 
is the sentence imposed public; what remedies against the death sentence imposed on 
31 March 2008 has he used, and which are still open to him? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide details regarding the trial of Mustafa Ibrahim: which provisions of 
criminal law was he found guilty of having violated; was he assisted by legal counsel, if so, at 
what stages of the proceedings; was his trial open to the public; is the sentence imposed public; 
what remedies against the death sentence did he use?

<p> 5. Sabri Bogday and Mustafa Ibrahim are foreigners. We would therefore like to 
reiterate our request in communications to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 24 January 2007, 
5 April 2007, 20 April 2007 and 14 August 2008 for clarification of what percentage of those 
sentenced to death and executed are foreigners.

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 27 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to the case of 
two persons, <b>Sheikh Mastan</b> alias <b>Mohammed Salim </b>and <b>Hamza Abu Bakir</b> who have been 
sentenced to death and who, according to reports I have received, are at imminent risk of 
execution. I addressed a communication to your Government regarding this case on 
20 November 2007. 
</p>
<p> I thank your Government for its reply of 20 February 2008, in which it confirmed that 
Mr. Mastan and Mr. Abu Bakir had been sentenced to death in relation to drug trafficking 
offences. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government also stated that the accused had benefited from the 
assistance of interpreters during the trial and that their sentences had been upheld by the Court of 
Cassation and the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. However, I remain concerned that 
information brought to my attention, indicates that Mr. Mastan and Mr. Abu Bakir were 
sentenced to death without having been assisted by legal counsel. 
</p>
<p> I would therefore, once again, like to draw the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to the obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent 
and impartial tribunal&#8221; as prescribed by Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights. A central element of the right to a fair hearing is the right to be assisted by legal counsel. 
I welcome the fact that the case was heard in the presence of sworn interpreters; however, 
translation of proceedings is no substitute for adequate legal representation as required by 
international standards. In this respect, I would like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on 
the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 
7 September 1990. Principle 6 is particularly pertinent to the present case: &#8220;Any such persons 
[charged with a criminal offence] who do not have a lawyer shall, in all cases in which the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 355 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>interests of justice so require, be entitled to have a lawyer of experience and competence 
commensurate with the nature of the offence assigned to them in order to provide effective legal 
assistance, without payment by them if they lack sufficient means to pay for such services.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> I would further like to reiterate that the death penalty as applied in this case does not fall 
within the category of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; for which international law countenances its 
possible application. Indeed, a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of the all 
principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision 
indicates that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there 
was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life. I note that in its reply to my 
communication of 5 April 2007 in another capital punishment case, your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government stated that &#8220;[d]eath sentences are handed down by the general courts in cases 
entailing the fixed penalties prescribed in the Islamic Shari&#8217;a and in cases of lex talionis and 
crimes involving repeated offences of drug smuggling and trafficking.&#8221; However, no information 
was provided as to how these different crimes fall within the category of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; 
as described above. 
</p>
<p> I also take this opportunity to reiterate my request made in several communications to your 
Government in other capital punishment cases, for information concerning the percentage of 
foreigners amongst those sentenced to death and executed. 
</p>
<p> To sum up, only the full respect for the limitations placed by international law on the use 
of the death penalty and for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which violates the most 
fundamental human right. I therefore again urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to expeditiously 
lift or commute the death sentence imposed against Sheikh Mastan and Hamza Abu Bakir, and to 
ensure that their rights under international law are fully respected. 
</p>
<p> Since I am expected to report on this case to the Human Rights Council, I would be 
grateful for information on the steps taken by your Government to lift or commute the death 
sentence imposed against Sheikh Mastan and Hamza Abu Bakir and for your observations on the 
issues raised in this communication.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 9 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I 
have received regarding Mr. <b>Abdallah Fandi Al Shammari</b>, a man sentenced to death whose 
execution is reportedly scheduled for 9 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, Abdallah Fandi Al Shammari was imprisoned on 
murder charges from 1983 to 1989 (the reports I have received are not clear as to whether 
he was detained on remand, or serving a sentence, or first on remand and then serving a 
sentence). In 1989 he was released after having paid 12,000 Saudi Riyals as blood money. 
</p>
<p>In 1990, however, the Supreme Court decided to overturn the decisions of both the first 
instance and appeals courts in Mr. Al Shammari&#8217;s case and ordered his renewed arrest. In 
this new case opened against him by the Supreme Court, Mr. Al Shammari was sentenced 
to death in 1992. His access to legal counsel during the Supreme Court proceedings was 
very limited. 
</p>
<p> International law does not prohibit the death penalty, but it mandates that it must be 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted 
in the most restrictive manner. Capital punishment cases must thoroughly respect all due process 
guarantees and the rule of law with a sentence being pronounced only following a regular 
judicial process. According to my understanding of Islamic law, as applied to this case, an 
agreement reached between the accused and the family of the victim, followed by the acceptance 
of the payment of diyah, would normally lead to the family of the victim agreeing to pardon the 
accused and the subsequent withdrawal of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p> The information I have received regarding the case of Mr. Al Shammari raises serious 
concerns as to whether due process guarantees were observed in bringing him again to trial 
before the Supreme Court in 1990. These concerns are compounded by the allegation that 
Mr. Al Shammari did not have unhindered access to his legal counsel during the Supreme Court 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p> In view of the irrevocable nature of the death penalty, I urge your Government not to 
proceed with the execution. This question requires a thorough re-examination in order to ensure 
that the relevant laws have been complied with. In view of the urgency of the matter, I would 
appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Without wishing to pre-judge the 
accuracy of the information received, I would respectfully request your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to provide me with details regarding the measures taken to safeguard the rights of 
Mr. Abdallah Fandi Al Shammari. I undertake to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response is 
accurately reflected in the report I will submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration. </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 11 December 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers 
 In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding the cases of <b>38 Syrian men allegedly at risk of execution</b>. They 
were reportedly sentenced to death on charges of narcotics trafficking following trials in which 
they did not, allegedly, enjoy the fundamental fair trial guarantees. 
 According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p>Thirty eight Syrian men, including one Mr. Bahjat Khalid Mas&#8217;ud, were sentenced to death 
on charges of drug trafficking in 2002. At no stage following their arrest were they given 
access to legal counsel. Their trial was secret and summary. The 38 Syrian prisoners 
appear to have exhausted all available appeals and their cases are now pending 
consideration by the King. 
</p>
<p>The Syrian men were reportedly detained in al-Qurayyat Prison, in the province of al-Jawf, 
north-western Saudi Arabia. Recently some of them were moved to other, unknown places 
of detention, which raised fears among their relatives and friends in the Syrian Arab 
Republic that executions might be imminent. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles 
applicable to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the charges of drugs trafficking, we would like to respectfully remind your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death penalty is not prohibited under international

it must be interpreted in the most restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most

a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention 
to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). This would exclude charges of 
drugs trafficking from those for which the death penalty can be imposed under international law. </p>

<p> Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights also specifically requires a 
summary or arbitrary executions stated in a report to the Human Rights Council on 
&#8220;Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 37): 
&#8220;There is no justification for post-conviction secrecy, and [&#8230;] a lack of transparency both 
undermines due process rights and constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. 
Persons sentenced to death, their families, and their lawyers should be provided with timely and 
reliable information on the procedures and timing of appeals, clemency petitions, and 
executions.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which violates the most 
fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Bahjat Khalid Mas&#8217;ud and the other 
37 Syrian men allegedly sentenced to death in 2002 are fully respected. Considering the 
irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed 
until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. Please also provide the full names 
of all 38 Syrian men sentenced to death on drugs trafficking charges in 2002. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details regarding the trial of Bahjat Khalid Mas&#8217;ud and the other 
37 Syrian men: how many hearings took place and on what dates; were the hearings open to the 
public; were the defendants assisted by legal counsel, and if so, at what stages of the 
proceedings? 
</p>
<p> 3. Where are Bahjat Khalid Mas&#8217;ud and the other 37 Syrian men currently detained? 
Have their families been informed of their current place of detention and of their current 
situation? Have members of their families visited the detainees since their trial in 2002? Have 
they had continuous access to the Syrian Arab Republic Consular Officials? </p>

<p> 4. We would like to reiterate our request in communications to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government of 24 January 2007, 5 April 2007, 20 April 2007, 14 August 2008 and 
23 October 2008 for clarification of what percentage of those sentenced to death and executed in 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are foreigners. 
</p>
<p><b>Saudi Arabia:  Death sentences of 16 Iraqi men 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 16 males (foreign nationals) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 28 January 2009</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
 In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to information we have received regarding the cases of <b>16 Iraqi men allegedly at risk of 
execution</b> in Saudi Arabia. They were reportedly sentenced to death following trials in which 
they did not enjoy the fundamental fair trial guarantees, such as access to a lawyer, and 
statements extorted under torture were allegedly used against them. Several of the men were 
reportedly sentenced to death on charges of drug trafficking and arms smuggling. 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Mohammad Abdul Amir</b>, aged 34, a citizen of Iraq, was arrested in Saudi Arabia in 
1995 and charged with murder. He confessed to the crime after three months of 
interrogation during which he was allegedly beaten and suspended by his feet. He 
sustained a broken rib as a result of the treatment he was subjected to while being 
interrogated and was hospitalized for a month. A criminal court in Arar sentenced him to 
death after a trial closed to the public. He has not been allowed any access to lawyers or 
other legal assistance at any stage of the proceedings in his case.  
</p>
<p>The death sentence has not yet been carried out as the children of the murder victim were 
too young to be consulted on whether Mohammad Abdul Amir was to be pardoned or 
executed. The children have now reached the age of majority and have informed the court 
that they want the execution.  
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Ayadh Mana&#8217; Wanas Matar</b>, aged 37, was arrested in November 2004 on charges 
related to drug trafficking. He was interrogated for three months during which he was 
allegedly tortured, including by being beaten on the soles of his feet and all over his body. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 360 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>He confessed to the charges as a consequence of the treatment. Ayadh Mana&#8217; Wanas Matar 
was sentenced to death in July 2008 by a criminal court in Rafha. He had no lawyer during 
his trial proceedings, which were not open to the public. 
</p>
<p>At least 14 other Iraqi men are held in Rafha prison on death row and might be at risk of 
imminent execution. They include Mr. <b>Hussein Baida Abud</b>, aged 23, Mr. <b>Adnan Jamil</b>, 
aged 25, Mr. <b>Mahmoud Shekar</b>, aged 42, <b>Khaled Mitan</b>, aged 25. The charges on which 
they were convicted and sentenced to death include drug trafficking, connection with 
armed groups in Iraq and smuggling of weapons into Saudi Arabia. None of them has been 
allowed access to lawyers since their arrests. They were all beaten until they confessed. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we would 
like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles 
applicable to these cases under international law. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the charges of drug trafficking and arms smuggling, we would like to 
remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death penalty is not prohibited by 
provisions of international law enshrining the right to life, such as Article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the 
fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most restrictive manner and can 
be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and systematic review of the 
jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most 
serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it 
can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, 
para. 53). This would exclude charges of drug trafficking and smuggling of weapons from those 
for which the death penalty can be imposed under international law. 
</p>
<p> We would further remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment cases 
the obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent 
and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) admits of no 
exception. Relevant to the cases at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the right to be assisted 
by legal counsel at all stages of proceedings. In this respect, we would also like to refer Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth 
United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 
Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in particular Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are 
entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights 
and to defend them in all stages of criminal proceedings&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights also specifically requires a 
&#8220;public hearing&#8221;. We would like to stress that the obligations of publicity and transparency do 
not end with the conclusion of the first instance trial. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions stated in a report to the Human Rights Council on Transparency 
and the imposition of the death penalty (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 37): &#8220;There is no 
justification for post-conviction secrecy, and [&#8230;] a lack of transparency both undermines due 
process rights and constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. Persons 
sentenced to death, their families, and their lawyers should be provided with timely and reliable 
information on the procedures and timing of appeals, clemency petitions, and executions.&#8221; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 361 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> The right to a fair trial also requires that no statement established to have been made as a 
result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of 
torture as evidence that the statement was made. This principle, set forth in Article 15 of the 
Convention Against Torture, to which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a Party, was recently 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council in paragraph 6c of resolution 08/08 of 2008. In addition 
to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, it is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to 
physical and mental integrity protected by the Convention Against Torture. 
</p>
<p> To make this right effective, the Convention Against Torture dictates in Article 13 that 
&#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture 
in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly 
and impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the 
complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a 
consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.&#8221; Where imprisoned defendants are denied 
access to their lawyers and their families and criminal trials do not take place in public, the right 
to complain about having been subjected to torture and to see statements compelled by torture 
excluded from the evidence is seriously undermined. 
</p>
<p> Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
still allowed under international law protecting the right to life from a summary execution, which 
violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Mohammad Abdul 
Amir, Ayadh Mana&#8217; Wanas Matar, Hussein Baida Abud, Adnan Jamil, Mahmoud Shekar, 
Khaled Mitan and the other Iraqi men allegedly awaiting execution in Rafha prison are fully 
respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the 
death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, without expressing at this stage an opinion on whether the detention of the 
abovementioned persons is arbitrary or not, we would like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary measures to protect their right not to be deprived arbitrarily of 
their liberty and to fair proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance 
with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details regarding the trials of Mohammad Abdul Amir, Ayadh Mana&#8217; 
Wanas Matar, Hussein Baida Abud, Adnan Jamil, Mahmoud Shekar, Khaled Mitan, and the 
other Iraqi men allegedly awaiting execution in Rafha prison: what are the offences charged; 
how many hearings took place and on what dates; were the hearings open to the public; were the 
defendants assisted by legal counsel, if so, at what stages of the proceedings? </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 362 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
Mohammad Abdul Amir, Ayadh Mana&#8217; Wanas Matar, Hussein Baida Abud, Adnan Jamil, 
Mahmoud Shekar, and Khaled Mitan were subjected to torture while in detention. If no inquiries 
have taken place or if they have been inconclusive please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 4. Have the families of Mohammad Abdul Amir, Ayadh Mana&#8217; Wanas Matar, 
Hussein Baida Abud, Adnan Jamil, Mahmoud Shekar, Khaled Mitan, and the other Iraqi men 
allegedly awaiting execution in Rafha prison been informed of their current place of detention 
and of their procedural position? Have family members been allowed to visit these prisoners? 
</p>
<p> 5. The present communication concerns 16 Iraqi citizens sentenced to death in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. On 11 December 2008 we sent an urgent communication to your 
Government regarding 38 Syrian men allegedly sentenced to death on charges of narcotics 
trafficking following trials in which they did not, allegedly, enjoy the fundamental fair trial 
guarantees (which, as of to date, has not received a response from your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government). We would therefore like to reiterate our request in communications to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government of 24 January 2007, 5 April 2007, 20 April 2007, 14 August 2008, 
24 October 2008 and 11 December 2008 for clarification of what percentage of those sentenced 
to death and executed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are foreigners.

<p><b>Somalia:  Stoning of Aisha Ibrahim Dhuhulow 
</b></p>

to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 female (minor) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Somalia has failed to cooperate 
with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 6 November 2008</b>, sent with the Independent Expert appointed by the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in Somalia, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning <b>Ms. Aisha Ibrahim Dhuhulow</b>, aged 13. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Ms Aisha Ibrahim Dhuhulow was found guilty of adultery, an act considered against 
Islamic law, by the Kismayo Sharia court, and sentenced to death by stoning. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 363 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 27 October 2008, on one of the main squares of Kismayo, she had her hands and feet 
tied together, was then buried up to her neck and stoned to death by around 50 men, while 
thousands of persons watched. She was pulled out three times to see whether she was dead. 
When a relative and others ran towards her, guards opened fire, killing a child. Since then, 
Islamist leaders have promised to punish the guard who had shot the child. 
</p>
<p>Allegedly, the accusation against Ms. Aisha Ibrahim Dhuhulow of adultery was only made 
as she attempted to report to the al-Shabab militia controlling Kismayo that she had been 
raped by three men. None of the men she accused of rape were arrested. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to recall 
the fundamental principles of international law applicable to this case. Article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights provide that every individual has the right to life, that this right shall be protected by law 
and that no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. Sentence of death may be imposed 
only for the most serious crimes, which do not include adultery. Furthermore, Article 6(5) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Somalia is a party, establishes that 
capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below the age of 
eighteen. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that stoning constitutes an inhuman and degrading punishment 
prohibited by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, States have recognized in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence 
against Women (Article 4) that they should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious 
consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to the elimination of violence against 
women. We would also like to note that stoning of women for adultery is inconsistent with the 
prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex, as recognized under the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In this regard we would like to refer 
to Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the CEDAW Convention according to which States Parties 
agree to take all appropriate measures with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and 
customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of inferiority or the superiority of 
either of the sexes (Article 5 (a)). 
 Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Can your Government confirm the accuracy of the reports summarized above? 
</p>
<p> 2. Does the above incident violate Somali law? What steps, if any, has your 
Government taken to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable? 
</p>
<p> We would appreciate a response within sixty days. We undertake to ensure that your 
Government&#8217;s response to each of these questions is accurately reflected in the reports we will 
submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration. </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the initial information provided by the Government of 
Sri Lanka concerning the death in custody of Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja and looks forward to 
receiving more detailed information on the progress of the investigations and possible criminal 
proceedings against the alleged perpetrators. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Department has yet to provide information on actions taken in the three years since the 
alleged perpetrators were released on bail. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 7 March 2006</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning <b>Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja</b>, aged 53, a physician. 
 According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 29 May 2005, he was arrested during the night at his home by two police officers 
wearing uniforms of the Weliweriya police and four other men in civilian clothing. They 
entered the house and beat him all over his body before dragging him naked from the 
house to their vehicle. On 30 May 2005, he was reportedly rushed to Gampaha District 
Government Hospital. He died of his injuries, although it is not clear whether he died 
before or after arriving at the hospital. According to the information received, it would 
appear that this is a case of mistaken identity. The police had been looking for a 
40 year old man named Lalewela Nandiraja on suspicion of theft and they mistakenly 
arrested Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja due to the similarities between his name and the name 
of the suspect. 
</p>
<p> Without prejudging the facts of the case, we should like to appeal to your Excellency to 
seek clarification regarding the ill-treatment and death of Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja. In this 
regard, we would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s attention to Article 12 of the Convention 
Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which 
requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed. I would also like to 
draw your attention to Article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires state parties 
to prosecute alleged offenders. With regard to the alleged killing of Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja, 
the same obligations arise under Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee the accountability 
of any person guilty of the alleged violations ensured. We also request that your Government 
adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the 
Commission, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged on behalf of Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja?

<p><b>Response from the Government of Sri Lanka dated 2 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p> Upon receipt of the joint communication from the Special Rapporteur on torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and upon consideration of 
the allegations contained therein, reports were called from the Police on the alleged death of 
Mr. Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja in Police custody. 
 According to available information, a complaint had been made to the Weliweriya Police 
on 29 May 2005 by Mr. J K Dharmaratne, saying that the office room of his timber mill was 
broke open and an electric saw worth of Rs. 82.000/- and a grinder were stolen. He had further 
stated that he suspects Mr. Lelwala Gamage Nandiraja, a worker of the mill. The reason for the 
suspicion is the fact that after his burglary, Nandiraja had fled the mill. 
 Weliweriya Police sent two police officers to arrest the suspect to the address supplied by 
the proprietor of the timber mill. On 29 May 2005 the suspect was arrested at the house of his 
sister. Lelawala Gamage Weerawathie in Kahaduwa. According to the Police, at the time of the 
arrest, the suspect was in a heavily intoxicated state and he had a bleeding wound on his 
forehead. After the arrest of the suspect and after recording his statement, the electric saw was 
recovered from the house of Mr. K. U. T. Gamini, a neighbour, while the grinder was recovered 
from under a bush. 
</p>
<p> The suspect was brought to Weliweriya Police and since he was in a critical condition, he 
was taken to the Base Hospital Gampaba, but the suspect had passed away before being admitted 
to the hospital. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> Facts regarding this incident were reported under Case No. B 2046/2005 to Magistrate 
Court Gampaha and on the orders of the Court, the body of the deceased was handed over to 
Ragama hospital for the post-mortem. The post-mortem was conducted on the 1 June 2005 by 
Judicial Medical Officer P. Paranitharan and the report was submitted to the Court. 
</p>
<p> After the relatives of the deceased made a complaint to the Criminal Investigations 
Department, the two Police officers who arrested the suspect, the driver of the vehicle in which 
the victim was taken to the Police and the complainant of the burglary were arrested and 
remanded and subsequently released on bail on 16 December 2005. The investigations conducted 
so far have been sent to the Attorney General&#8217;s Department for advice on further action.

</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of the 
Sri Lanka on the death of Thadallage Chamil Weerasena, and looks forward to information on 
the results of the disciplinary proceedings against the police officer in charge on the day of the 
death. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 20 September 2007 
</b></p>
<p> I am writing concerning the death of Mr. <b>Thadallage Chamil Weerasena</b> at Ratgama 
Police Station on 21 July, 2007. 
</p>
<p>According to information received, Mr. Thadallage Chamil Weerasena was arrested on the 
above date and taken to Ratgama Police Station, Galle District. The victim&#8217;s mother 
travelled to the police station the same morning and observed her son detained in a police 
cell but was reportedly prevented from approaching the cell by police officers. A friend of 
the victim who was able to visit him later the same day stated that the victim reported 
being assaulted by the police. The victim&#8217;s elder brother and mother returned to the police 
station later that day where they saw the victim&#8217;s dead body lying inside the police cell 
covered in a sarong. A relative observed injuries to the back, chest and face of the victim, 
including blood to his head. 
</p>
<p>It was reported that on 22 July, 2007 a doctor took photographs of the body and that a 
magistrate indicated later in a letter that Mr. Weerasena died of hanging. Three years 
previously the police had reportedly filed charges against Mr. Weerasena for possession of 
drugs and the case was still pending before court at the time of his death. 
</p>
<p> Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, I would like to 
recall that Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which 
Sri Lanka is a Party, enshrines the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one&#8217;s life. When the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 367 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies in State custody, there is a 
presumption of State responsibility. In this respect, I would like to recall the conclusion of the 
Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case (<i>Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay</i>, communication 
no. 84/1981 (1990)): &#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether 
Hugo Dermit committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; 
yet, the inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either 
by act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, as 
required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> I should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the 
circumstances regarding the death of the person named above. I would like to stress that each

<p><b>Response from the Government of Sri Lanka dated 20 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p> On a directive of Inspector General of Police the Criminal Investigation Department 
commenced investigations into the above noted subject on 23 July 2007. 
 Inquiries have revealed that on 21 July 2007 at 02.23hrs deceased Chamil Weerasena was 
arrested by the Officers of Ratgama Police in Ratgama Police area on the charges of physical 
abuse and robbery of a gold chain (Grave Crime Register No. 62/2007). On their way back to the 
Police station with the suspect Police arrested another suspect named Sujith Hemantha alias 
Rupiah, on an arrest warrant issued by the Magistrate court of Balapitiya and both suspects were 
produced at Ratgama Police Station at 05.45 and detained at two separate cells. No other 
suspects were in the custody of Ratgama Police on this day. 
</p>
<p> 21st July 2007 happened to be the funeral of the spouse of a Woman Police Inspector 
attached to Ratgama Police Station and the Officer in Charge and most of the Police Officers 
have gone to attend this funeral leaving a skeleton staff. 
</p>
<p> Suspects Chamil Weerasena and Sujith Hemantha have been served with breakfast and 
lunch by the Police on 21st July 2007 and entries have been made in the relevant information 
books. At around 18.50hrs the Reserve-In-Charge of Ratganma Police, Police Constable 58915 
Jayatissa had noticed suspect Chamil Weerasena hanging on the top iron bar of the door cell 
from the white coloured trouser he was wearing and found him dead. 
</p>
<p> Judicial Medical Officer Dr. Ajith Susantha Kumara, who held the post-mortem 
examination, opined that the cause of death as death by hanging as there was no medical 
evidence to establish that someone has strangled the deceased. Further the JMO has reported that 
there were no internal or external injuries on the body of the deceased. 
 Facts of this suicide have been reported in the Magistrate Court of Galle under Case 
No. B 92780/07. 
</p>
<p> The mother of the deceased Kande Garlishmay of #25, Pannilla, Ratgama was questioned 
and she stated that on 21st July 2007 around 05.00hrs she came to know that her son Chamil 
Weerasena has been arrested by Ratgama Police and in the afternoon she went to the Police 
Station and saw Chamil seated on the floor of the cell bear bodied wearing a white coloured 
trouser. However, she was not allowed to speak to him of go near the cell. She admitted the fact 
that Chamil Weerasena was a drug addict and was at the Unawatuna Rehabilitation centre about 
3 years ago. 
</p>
<p> Kosman Nandaseeli, the illegitimate wife of suspect Chamil Weerasena stated that she 
visited Ratgama Police in the afternoon of 21st July 2007 and was allowed to speak to Chamil 
and Chamil bear bodied, informed her that he was assaulted by the Police and wanted her to get 
him bailed out. However she did not notice any visible injuries on Chamil. 
 At around midnight she came to know that Chamil had died at the Police Station when she 
visited the police station she saw the body of Chamil lying face downwards in the cell covered </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>with a sarong and she did not see his face. She also noticed the white coloured trouser of Chamil 
tied to the upper iron bar of the cell door. She also corroborated the fact that Chamil was a drug 
addict and had gone under rehabilitation about 3 years ago. 
</p>
<p> Sujith Hemantha alias Rupiah of #123, Pannila, New colony, Ratgama, who was brought 
to Ratgama Police station along with Chamil Weerasena stated that he spoke with Chamil who 
was in adjoining cell and at no stage he saw Police assaulting Chamil nor Chamil informed him 
that he was assaulted. At around 17.00hrs he fell asleep and woke up when there was some sort 
of a commotion and saw Police officers opening the cell of Chamil. He further stated that in the 
afternoon he shared refreshments brought by his family with Chamil with the permission of 
Police. 
</p>
<p> The statements of all persons who visited Ratgama Police Station for various reasons on 
this particular day have been recorded and none had seen Police assaulting anyone. 
</p>
<p> Inquires have revealed that deceased Chamil Weerasena has not been assaulted by Police 
and he had committed suicide in the cell by hanging for reasons best know to him. 
</p>
<p> Ratgama Police station has been constructed recently and from the place where 
Reserve/Reception desk was positioned one cannot see the inside of the cells. Further due to the 
funeral of the spouse of Woman Police Inspector attached to Ratgama Police Station there was 
no sufficient staff to monitor the movements of the suspects on this ill fated day. Since this 
incident the Reception Desk has been shifted to an area where inside the cells are visible. 
</p>
<p> It is the responsibility of the Reserve-In-Charge of a Police Station to look after the safe 
custody of the suspects. After an preliminary internal investigation conducted by Assistant 
Superintendent of Police, Galle District (1), the services of Police Constable 58915 Jayatissa, 
who was the Reserve-In-Charge on this ill fated day, have been suspended pending Departmental 
disciplinary action for neglect of duty and failing to secure the safety of the suspects in custody.

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 6 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information I have received 
concerning reports of attacks on civilian targets by the Sri Lankan armed forces in August 2008 
resulting in the killing of civilians. 
</p>
<p> According to information I have received: 
</p>
<p>On 9 August 2008, at 1.00 am, approximately forty shells fired by the Sri Lanka armed 
forces exploded in the immediate surroundings of the Mullaithivu district hospital. One 
shell exploded 25 meters from the hospital electricity generator. Another shell exploded 
just seven meters from the residence of the hospital&#8217;s medical superintendant, 75 meters 
from the main hospital building. Another shell exploded 50 meters from the nurses&#8217; 
quarters and inside the hospital playground. 40 more shells exploded within a 150 meters 
surrounding of the hospital compound. In the houses surrounding the hospital a 
five-year-old, <b>Iyan Sankeerthanan</b>, was killed and four women were seriously injured. 
On 30 August 2008, the Sri Lanka Army launched an artillery attack on Puthumurippu 
village, 7 km southwest of Kilinochchi town, where numerous IDPs had converged. On the 
day before the attack, 29 August 2008, the Sri Lanka Air Force had dropped leaflets 
warning civilians of possible heavy casualties unless they moved from the LTTE 
administered Vanni. The artillery attack on 30 August killed at least five IDP civilians: 
Mr. <b>Karuppiah Anantharajah</b> (aged 28), his 2-year-old son <b>Anantharajah Gowtham</b>, 
Ms. <b>Thilakeshvari Visvanthan</b> (aged 27), her 1-month-old baby, and Ms. <b>Alahesan Luka 
Pathmalatha</b> (aged 28). The victims were recently displaced from Parapukadanthan in the 
Mannar district. Three civilians were taken to Kilinochchi hospital in critical condition, 
Kalyani Balasubram (aged 47), Rajeswary Balasubramaniyam (aged 17), and 
Iyalvili Alageswaran (a baby of ten months). 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental legal rules applicable to all armed conflicts under 
international humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</p>
<p> Specifically, your Government is under an obligation to distinguish between combatants 
and civilians and to direct attacks only against combatants (Rules 1, 6 and 7 of the Customary 
Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified in the study of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (&#8220;Customary Rules&#8221;)). Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited (Rule 11 of the 
Customary Rules). Further, launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss 
of civilian life, injury to civilians, or damage to civilian objects, which would be excessive in 
relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited (Rule 14 of the 
Customary Rules). All feasible precautions must be taken to avoid and minimize incidental loss 
of civilian life (Rule 15 of the Customary Rules). This explicitly requires that parties to a conflict 
must give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population 
(Rule 20 of the Customary Rules). Medical units exclusively assigned to medical purposes must 
be respected and protected in all circumstances. They lose their protection if they are being used, 
outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy (Rule 28). </p>

incident, I would be grateful for your cooperation and observations on the following four 
matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please refer to the results of 
any police or military investigation, or judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the 
alleged incident. 
</p>
<p> 2. What, if any, assessment was made to ensure that the attack complied with the rules

were employed to verify that only legitimate military targets were attacked? What methods were 
adopted to distinguish between military and civilian objects? What precautions were taken to 
minimize loss of civilian life? What means and methods of warfare were adopted to avoid 
incidental loss of civilian life, and to ensure that incidental loss of life was not excessive in 
relation to the anticipated military advantage? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, or criminal 
prosecutions against, members of the armed forces responsible for the alleged incident.

<p> 4. Please state whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to the

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of the 
Sri Lanka on these cases. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving from the Government information 
about developments in the criminal proceedings initiated in the cases of Seynool Miswar and 
Gerald Mervin Perera as well as information on the progress of the investigations into the killing 
of Siyaguna Kosgodage Anton Sugath Nishantha Fernando. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 30 October 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</p>
<p> We would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have recently 
received concerning a case of death in custody due to torture, the assassination of a torture 
victim, and threats to the life of another torture victim and a witness in a torture case. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 372 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the allegations received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Seynool Miswar</b> died in Negombo prison on 3 July 2008 shortly after 4 p.m.. Around 
3 p.m. on that day, Seynool Miswar had told his brother, Mr. Seynool Arbdeen Seynool 
Aswar, who was visiting him in prison, that prison officers had threatened to assault him 
unless he paid Rs. 25,000 (approximately USD 232). An hour later, Seynool Miswar was 
seen holding his chest and abdomen in pain and told another prisoner, Mr. Seyedu 
Mohmad Abhu Ubeyda, that he had been assaulted by three prison guards. Soon thereafter, 
Seynool Miswar fell dead on the floor. 
</p>
<p>In the subsequent investigation, <b>Abhu Ubeyda</b> testified to officers from the Crime Section 
of the Negombo Police Station. Two prison guards were taken into remand custody. Back 
in Negombo prison after he made his statement to the police, Abhu Ubeyda was 
approached by two inmates who pretended to hit him and pushed him to the floor. He was 
admitted to the prison hospital. When he was discharged from hospital, the Chief Jailor of 
the prison called him to his office, asked questions about the incident, and informed him 
that he had been released on bail. The Chief Jailor also told him &#8220;we will come and see you 
at home. I will give you Rs. 150,000 if you do not mention my name in the incident.&#8221; 
Abhu Ubeyda did not accept this offer. On 17 July 2008, at around 9:45 p.m., four men in 
helmets came to his house, tied him to the window grille and beat him with a pole for 
some time. They warned him not to testify before the court in the case of Seynool Miswar. 
Abhu Ubeyda recognized two of the aggressors as prison guards. 
</p>
<p>Mr.<b> Siyaguna Kosgodage Anton Sugath Nishantha Fernando</b> was the complainant in a 
fundamental rights case before the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka (Case No. SCFR. 446/07), 
in which he alleged that he had been tortured by policemen at Negombo Police Station, as 
well as in a bribery case in the High Court. He was killed by unidentified gunmen on 
20 September 2008. Nishantha Fernando had repeatedly complained to the Inspector 
General of Police, the Attorney General, the National Police Commission (NPC) and the 
Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, about the constant threats of assassination he and 
his family had been receiving. On 23 June 2008 four men, believed by him to be hired by 
the police, arrived at his house and told him to withdraw the case before the Supreme 
Court. They stated that if within 24 hours he did not do so, he and his family would be 
killed. Nishantha Fernando and his family went into hiding and informed the relevant 
authorities of the threat. He returned to his home after a period in hiding shortly before his 
death on 20 September 2008. The police officers named as perpetrators of torture in his 
fundamental rights case remain on patrol in the area. 
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Lalith Rajapakse</b>, a torture victim, is the complainant in a fundamental rights 
application before the Supreme Court (filed six years ago, in 2002) and the main witness in 
a torture case (Act No. 22 of 1994) against a Sub Inspector of Police from the Kandana 
Police Station filed by the Attorney General&#8217;s Department. On 7 January 2005, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment drew 
your Government&#8217;s attention to threats against Mr. Rajapakse and Mr. U.L.A. Joseph 
Perera, a human rights advocate assisting him in his case. Your Government replied on 
21 February 2005, stating that the homes of the two men were protected around the clock 
and that special security arrangements had been made for a court hearing involving 
Mr. Rajapakse. Notwithstanding these protective measures, Lalith Rajapakse stayed away </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 373 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>from his village in Kandana to avoid harassment by the police for five years. He recently 
returned to look after his grandfather. On 25 May 2008, around midnight, three persons, 
two of them armed with pistols, arrived near his house. Lalith Rajapakse saw them 
approaching and fled. When he thereafter made a complaint to the Human Rights 
Commission about this incident, he learnt that officers of Kandana police station had been 
spreading the rumor that he was a notorious criminal, although the Wattala magistrate&#8217;s 
court had already acquitted him in three criminal cases brought against him by the 
Kandana police after he complained of being tortured. This - allegedly completely 
unsubstantiated - labeling as &#8220;notorious criminal&#8221;, combined with the nightly visit by 
armed men, raises concerns that Lalith Rajapakse might be at risk of becoming the victim 
of a fabricated &#8220;shoot-out&#8221; with the police or killing while escaping arrest. 
</p>
<p>On 9 October 2008, the High Court trying the criminal case against the policeman accused 
of subjecting Lalith Rajapakse to torture acquitted the defendant. It would appear that the 
judge, who reportedly is the same judge who acquitted the defendant in the case regarding 
the torture of Gerald Mervin Perera (see below), found that the evidence was insufficient to 
establish that Mr. Lalith Rajapakse had been tortured. This conclusion was reached in spite 
of medical evidence allegedly indicating that Lalith Rajapakse (who spent 16 days in 
hospital at the time of the alleged torture incident in 1992) had injuries on the soles of his 
feet and a cerebral contusion which had caused edema to the brain. 
</p>
<p>In connection with these recent killings of and threats against victims and witnesses in 
torture cases, we would like to seek from your Excellency&#8217;s Government an update on 
the case against the murderers of Mr. <b>Gerald Mervin Perera</b>. As you will recall, 
Gerald Perera, a torture victim and the subject of an urgent appeal of the Special 
Rapporteur on torture dated 22 November 2004, was a successful plaintiff in a fundamental 
human rights case relating to torture. He was due to testify on 2 December 2004 in the 
criminal case against the policemen who tortured him, but was shot on 21 November 
and died of the wounds on 24 November 2004. On 25 March 2005, your Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur on torture that &#8220;the Criminal Investigations Department 
(CID) of Sri Lanka Police undertook the investigations into the killing of Mr. Perera and 
arrested five suspects including the assassin. The assassin Ajith Nishanta, arrested on 
04.02.2005, was produced before an identification parade at the magistrate&#8217;s Court, 
Wattala, where he was identified by two witnesses. Out of these five suspects, 
Sub Inspector Suresh Gunasena and Reserved Sub inspector Asela Kumara Herath have 
been indicted at the Negombo High Court (Case No: 326/2003) for the alleged torture of 
the deceased Gerald Mervin Perera.&#8221; More than three-and-a-half years have passed since 
this promising communication from your Government, and we would greatly appreciate 
information on the outcome of the criminal proceedings. We were in the meantime 
informed that the criminal proceedings against the policeman accused of committing 
torture against Gerald Perera have ended in an acquittal. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports summarized above, we would 
like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to this case. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 374 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> These two fundamental rights imply that all States have the obligation &#8220;to conduct 
exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221;, as stated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in 
Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4). The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify 
and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable 
time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice 
arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). 
</p>
<p> In the context of the cases summarized above, we would particularly like to draw your 
Government&#8217;s attention to Article 13 of CAT, which requires that &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure 
that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its 
jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined 
by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the complainant and witnesses 
are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of his complaint or any 
evidence given.&#8221; Also Principle 15 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which is equally relevant to 
cases of torture, holds: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Complainants, witnesses, those conducting the investigation and their families shall be 
protected from violence, threats of violence or any other form of intimidation. Those 
potentially implicated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be removed 
from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over complainants, 
witnesses and their families, as well as over those conducting investigations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> The reports we have received above regarding the cases of Seynool Miswar, Abhu Ubeyda, 
Nishantha Fernando, and Lalith Rajapakse all suggest that, contrary to the above provisions, 
police officers potentially implicated in torture and executions remain in a position of power 
over complainants and witnesses, free to intimidate, attack and even kill them. The excessive 
duration of criminal proceedings against perpetrators - in the case of Mr. Rajapakse, it would 
appear that the case took six years for a first instance judgment to be reached - of course 
increases the vulnerability of victims and witnesses to intimidation and violence. 
</p>
<p> We therefore urge your Government to: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Adopt effective protective measures for Abhu Ubeyda and Lalith Rajapakse, as well as 
for the families of Seynool Miswar and Nishantha Fernando. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To remove those potentially implicated in the cases of Seynool Miswar and 
Nishantha Fernando from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, 
over witnesses, victims and their families; and to complete the inquiries into the 
circumstances surrounding the deaths of Seynool Miswar and Nishantha Fernando and 
the torture of Lalith Rajapakse expeditiously, impartially and transparently, also with a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations, as well as to compensate 
their families. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your

</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the case summaries accurate? If not so, please share all

</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and

</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal

</p><p> 4. Please provide the details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants, 
witnesses and family members of the victims in these cases are not subject to any intimidation 
or retaliation, as provided in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide the details of any compensation payments made to the families or 
dependants of any of the victims in the cases described above. 
</p>
<p> 6. Please provide details of any successful prosecution of police officers charged with

No. A 8384/02 and this case is fixed for hearing on 01.12.2008.  
</p>
<p> However, as regards the allegation of Abu Ubeyda referred to in the UN communication, 
no complaint has been received to such effect by Police. Nevertheless, it is correct that Ubeyda 
and Nawfer who were inmates of Negombo. Prison at the time of the incident are the two 
principle witnesses in the case against the Jailor and the Prison guard. 
</p>
<p><b>(ii) Mr. Siyaguna Kosgodage Anton Sugath Nishantha Fernando 
</b> As regards this person, subject has been killed by unidentified, gunmen on 
20th September 2008 at Dalupotha in Negombo Police area. Police &#8216;have promptly visited the 
scene and initiated investigations. Inquiries conducted, so far, have not led to the identification of 
the culprit or culprits. According to SSP / Negombo the deceased had been a suspect in several 
criminal cases including offences of robbery, arson &amp; even in incidents of obstruction to Police 
Officers in the discharge of their duties. There had also been public complaints against him for 
his bad behaviour and for causing harassment to neighbours, where complaints have been lodged 
by residents, both at Negombo and Kochchikade Police Stations. The Police have also reported 
that whenever such a complaint against him was made and he found investigations are not made 
by the Police in a manner favourable to him he has been in the habit of making complaints of 
frivolous nature against the Investigators. 
</p>
<p> It is also reported that on 12..11.2007 a Police team headed by S.I. Abeynayake of 
Negombo Police who were on vehicle checking at Dalupotha junction had signaled a 
motorcyclist who was without a helmet traveling with a lady passenger on the pillion but the 
motor cyclist had gone without stopping, disregarding the Police signal. On suspicion the SI with 
a PC had given chase in their motorcycle and were able to locate him in front of a house in Jaya 
Mawatha off Dalupotha Junction. When the SI questioned the rider, who was later, identified to 
be the subject, he and the lady passenger who travelled in the pillion had abused the SI and 
assaulted him and for his uniform. A Police party arrived, at the scene, later arrested the subject, 
his wife and their daughter Kalpani Dilrukshy. The SI was treated at the Negombo Base Hospital 
and the subject and his wife too were subjected to medical examinations. Later the Police 
reported facts to Courts and produced the three suspects in Court under Case No. B 381/07. They 
were later released on bail by court. They have complained against the Police relevant to this 
incident before the Human Rights Commission and to the National Child Protection Authority. 
He had also filed a Fundamental Rights application in the Supreme Court. This refers to 
SCFR 446/07. The Inspector General of Police, SSP/Negombo &amp; two other Police officers have </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 377 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>been cited as respondents in this case. This case is yet under hearing. There is no basis to 
substantiate that the killing of Nishantha Fernando had been due to instances referred to in 
UN communication and there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of any Police Officer in 
the killing. 
</p>
<p><b>(iii) Mr. Lalith Rajapakse 
</b> Reference the communication concerning this person, it is correct that he was the main 
witness in a torture case against SI Prasanga Peiris who was attached to Kandana Police Station. 
This case was filed by the Hon. Attorney General in the High Court of Negombo subsequent to 
the conduct of a criminal investigation by the CID. This refers to Case No. 259/03. However, the 
accused officer has been exonerated and discharged from the proceedings by the High Court of 
Negombo at a latter date of hearing. The allegation of torture against the SI has been consequent 
to his arrest by the Sub Inspector on a complaint of causing grievous hurt by stabbing with a 
knife where he was prosecuted in M.C. Wattala in Case No. 92619, under Section 326 of the 
Penal Code for causing grievous hurt. 
</p>
<p> However, in view of the torture complaint against the SI the Hon. Attorney General 
directed to lay-by the criminal case against him until the conclusion of the torture case in the 
High Court of Negombo. Police now contemplates of re-opening the case as the torture case 
since been concluded. 
</p>
<p> On 24.05.2008 one Lakshman Jayalath Fernando, of 532/09, Kapuwatta, Ja-ela has 
complained to Police of a theft of a Peddle Cycle to the value of Rs. 5000/= accusing 
Lalith Rajapkse as the culprit. This refers to MC Kanuwana Case No. 1509/08. In the light of 
this complaint against the subject Police had gone looking for him. Ever since then Lalith 
Rajapakse is evading Police. It appears that Rajapakse is trying to take cover by making 
complaints to the Human Rights Commission and to the Special Rapporteur on Torture UNHRC 
with a view to finding ways and means of proving his innocence by bringing forth allegations 
against Police which are of frivolous nature. 
</p>
<p><b>(iv) Mr. Gerald Mervin Perera 
</b> In relation to the killing of this person it is true that he was a torture victim and in this 
respect a criminal investigation was conducted by CID. At the conclusion of these inquiries six 
suspects, all of whom who were Police officers, were prosecuted by the Hon. Attorney General 
in the High Court of Negombo in case No. 326/03. However, subsequent to a protracted hearing 
of this case the Court on 02.04.2008, discharged all of them due to inadequate evidence to 
sustain charges preferred against them. 
</p>
<p> However, in the subsequent investigation conducted by the CID relevant to the murder of 
Gerald Mervin Perera, the Hon. Attorney General indicted SI Makavitage Suresh Gunasena and 
another in the High Court of Negombo under Case No. 445/05. Further hearing of this case is 
fixed for 06.02.2009. 
</p>
<p> The first accused in the aforesaid murder case SI Makavitage Sures Gunasena, has 
ironically been also the 1st accused against whom charges were preferred under the Torture Act 
by the Hon. A.G. for a causing degrading and inhuman treatment to Gerald Mervin Perera. </p>

<p><b>Sri Lanka:  Killing of Lasantha Wickrematunga 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Death due to the attacks or killings by security forces of the State, or by 
paramilitary groups, death squads, or other private forces cooperating with or tolerated by the 
State 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male (journalist) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of the 
Sri Lanka on the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunga. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to 
receiving detailed information from the Government both on the progress of the police 
investigation into the killing and on any resulting prosecutions. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 9 January 2009</b>,<b> </b>sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received concerning the killing of Mr <b>Lasantha Wickrematunga</b>, chief editor of the 
English language weekly newspaper the <i>Sunday Leader</i>, an investigative newspaper which often 
reports on cases of alleged corruption and abuse of authority in Sri Lanka, and an attack on the 
premises of the independent television station, <i>Sirasa TV</i> (formerly know as Pannipitiya 
MTV/MBC) in Colombo.   
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p>On 8 January 2009, Mr Wickrematunga was driving to work in Colombo. Two 
unidentified gunmen, who were travelling by motorcycle, smashed the window of 
Mr Wickrematunga&#8217;s car with a steel bar before shooting him at close range in the head, 
chest and stomach. The attack occurred in rush-hour traffic about 100 metres from an air 
force checkpoint. Mr Wickrematunga was rushed to Colombo National Hospital where he 
died a few hours later from his injuries. A police investigation has been opened into the 
case. 
</p>
<p>Prior to his death, Mr Wickrematunga had been the target of numerous intimidation 
attempts and libel suits for his outspoken criticism of your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
The most recent libel case had been brought against him by the Defence Secretary, 
Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, over stories published in the Sunday Leader alleging corruption 
in defence procurement. Following the Court proceedings a ban was placed on the 
newspaper mentioning the Defence Secretary for several weeks. Previously, in 
November 2007, the printing press of the Sunday Leader media group (Leader 
Publications), located in a high security area near Colombo, was destroyed in an arson </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 379 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>attack by a group of unidentified gunmen. No arrests were made in relation to the attack 
and reports claim that a full investigation was not carried out. It is further reported that in 
October 2008 the President of Sri Lanka referred to Mr Wickrematunga as a &#8220;terrorist 
journalist&#8221; during an interview with the non governmental organization Reporters Without 
Borders. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the early hours of the morning of 6 January 2009, approximately 
20 unidentified individuals wielding assault rifles, pistols and armed bars raided the 
premises of Sirasa TV in Pannipitiya, Colombo. The assailants, who reportedly arrived at 
the premises in a white unmarked van, overpowered security personnel at the entrance 
before entering the main studio complex where they proceeded to assault staff who were 
working at the time. A few staff members, who were held at gunpoint, were forced to 
guide their attackers to the main control room. The assailants then destroyed the room with 
explosives, causing considerable damage to broadcasting equipment. An unexploded 
grenade was later recovered from the premises. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we urge your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take effective measures to take measures to prevent further killings 
of journalists and protect journalists and media organisations. In this respect, it is very important 
that the persons responsible for the assassination of Mr Wickrematunga and for the attacks 
against media premises, both as material perpetrators and as instigators, are rapidly identified, 
arrested and brought to justice. It would appear to be equally important that your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government unreservedly condemns these attacks. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to refer your Government to the relevant principles of international 
law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Sri Lanka is 
a party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this 
right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life 
(Article 6). In this respect, we would like to recall that, as reiterated in Human Rights Council 
resolution 8/3 on &#8220;The Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4), all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigation into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to 
identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including 
legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of 
such executions&#8221;. Families of the deceased should be informed of information relevant to the 
investigation, and the findings of the investigation should be made public (Principles 16 and 17 
of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that taking effective measures to protect journalists and to 
prosecute those responsible of killings or death threats against them is a precondition to ensuring 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression as set forth in article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR, which provides that: &#8220;Everyone shall have the 
right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 380 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In this context, we deem it further appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of 
the Commission on Human Rights which calls upon States to ensure that victims of violations of 
the right to freedom of expression have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and 
acts of violence, including terrorist acts, against journalists, including in situations of armed 
conflict, and to bring to justice those responsible to combat impunity. 
 These principles are reiterated with specific focus on the role of human rights defenders in 
the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to 
Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The 
Declaration highlights the importance of &#8220;the right, individually and in association with others as 
provided for in human rights and other applicable international instruments, freely to publish, 
impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms&#8221; (article 6 points b) and c)) for the effective enjoyment of &#8220;the right 
individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; 
(article 1). Article 12 paras 2) and 3) of the Declaration provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or 
de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or 
her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. This is an essential part of 
&#8220;each [State&#8217;s] prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms&#8221; (article 2). 
</p>
<p> We are concerned that killings of journalists and attacks on the premises of media 
organisations, particularly if they remain unpunished, could create a climate of impunity and 
result in preventing independent reporting and stifling freedom of expression. As stressed by the 
Declaration, freedom of expression and independent reporting are in their turn key safeguards for 
the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases, 
we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the summary of the cases accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the killing of 
Mr Lasantha Wickrematunga and the raid on the Sirasa TV station. In the event that the alleged 
perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been 
undertaken. If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why.

  page 381 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Mr. Wickramatunga, President of Sri Lanka His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa most 
vehemently and unequivocally condemned the assassination and directed the law enforcement 
authorities to conduct the most thorough investigation to bring to book any and all persons 
responsible for this act of brutality, with maximum speed. The full text of the statement made by 
the President of Sri Lanka in this regard is as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;My government and I most vehemently and unequivocally condemn the murder of 
Mr. Lasantha Wickramatunga, Editor of the Sunday Leader, which took place today. I am 
both grieved and shocked by his tragic death as Mr. Wickramatunga was a close friend of 
mine who I have known for many years as a courageous journalist. This heinous crime 
points to the grave dangers faced by the democratic social order of our country, and the 
existence of forces that will go to the furthest extremes in using terror and criminality to 
damage our social fabric and bring disrepute to the country. It is significant that such an 
attack was carried out at a time when the country is gaining repeated victories over the 
forces of terrorism, in our efforts to establish freedom and democracy throughout the 
country. I have directed the Police to conduct the most thorough investigation to bring to 
book any and all persons responsible for this act of brutality, with maximum speed. On this 
sad occasion, I extend my deepest sympathies to the members of the family of the late 
Mr. Wickramatunga, to all his colleagues in The Sunday Leader and associated 
newspapers, and in the profession of journalism. Despite grave threats of this nature, my 
government reiterates its commitment to upholding the principles of Media Freedom and 
Freedom of Expression, even under the most trying circumstances, as we have witnessed 
today.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of Sri Lanka dated 11 February 2009 
</b></p>
<p> The Government of Sri Lanka provided the following information:  
</p>
<p><b>Facts in brief 
</b></p>
<p> On 8th January 2009 at about 10:15hrs. Mr. Wickramatunga left in his car 
No. WP KC-1098 to go to his office in Attidiya in Templers Road, Mt. Lavinia. At 10:20 hrs. 
when he was passing Attidiya on his way to Templers Road opposite Attidiya Girls School, four 
Motorcyclists who came after the car blocked the road and Mr. Wickramatunga&#8217;s car came to a 
halt on seeing the motorcyclists who were blocking the road. The four motorcyclists had been 
wearing helmets covering their faces, black jackets and all of them came on black coloured 
motorcycles. The cyclists surrounded the car and left on their bikes after a few minutes. 
</p>
<p> After the motorcycles had left, the onlookers had approached the car and found 
Mr. Wickramatunga lying on the seat with bleeding injuries on his head and the windscreen 
damaged. Both side-glasses of the car also had been damaged. One Dinesh K. who was in the 
printing press opposite the place of incident, rushed Mr. Wickramatunga to Kalubowila Hospital 
in a passing vehicle. The onlookers also informed the Police regarding the incident. 
</p>
<p><b>Action taken 
</b></p>
<p> On receipt of this information, Officer-In-Charge/Crimes, Mt. Lavinia Inspector of Police 
(IP) Sugathapala along with a team of Officers visited the scene and conducted inquiries. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 382 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Thereafter, on the instructions of the Inspector-General of Police, Senior Superintendent of 
Police (SSP) for Mt. Lavinia directed inquiries along with Assistant Superintendent of Police 
(ASP) for Mt. Lavinia, (I) Mr. C. Gunawarena in this connection. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Wickramatunga succumbed to injuries at the Hospital and post-mortem inquiry was 
conducted by Dr. K. Sunil Kumara, Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) for Colombo South. He 
reported that the death was due to shock and haemorrhage following gun shot injuries in the 
head. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Harsha Sethunga, Magistrate for Mt. Lavinia, who held the inquest in connection with 
the death, returned a verdict of murder. 
</p>
<p> The Government Analyst was summoned to examine the scene as well as the victim&#8217;s car 
and his report is being awaited. No empty cartridges or used slugs have been traced from the 
scene of the dead body. 
</p>
<p> Statements have been recorded from 4 eye-witnesses, but none of them are in a position to 
identify the suspects or to disclose the registration numbers of the Motorcycles. One of them also 
had heard report of a gun from the scene of the incident. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p> The deceased had died of gun shot injuries in his head. The assailants had committed this 
murder at a lonely stretch of Attidiya Road when the victim was on his way to office.

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b> 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 3 April 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding <b>Al-Tayeb Abdel Aziz</b>, <b>Ishaq Mohammed Sanousi</b>, 
<b>Abdel Hay Omar</b>, <b>Mustafa Adam</b>, <b>Mohammed Birgid</b>, <b>Hassan Adam Fadel</b>, 
<b>Adam Ibrahim</b>, <b>Jamaleddin Isa</b>, <b>Abdel Magid Ali Abdel Magid </b>and <b>Saibr Hassan</b>, who 
reportedly have been sentenced to death by the Khartoum-North Court of Appeal for the murder 
of Mohammed Taha, Editor of Al-Wifaq newspaper, in September 2006. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 383 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Al-Tayeb Abdel Aziz was only 15 years old at the time of the murder. All those sentenced 
to death said they were tortured in order to confess to the crime and had been forced to sign 
confessions, which were later produced in court. They retracted their confessions in court, 
but the Appeal Court accepted the confessions as evidence against them. The case has been 
brought before the Supreme Court, where a panel of three judges will hear the appeal. A 
further appeal is possible to the Constitutional Court, whose final decision has to be 
ratified by the president. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations regarding this specific 
case, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that the execution of Al-Tayeb Abdel Aziz 
would violate Sudan&#8217;s international legal obligations. In particular, the execution would be 
explicitly contrary to Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which provides 
that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen 
years of age, and to Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
which provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age. Sudan is a party to each of these treaties and is thus bound by these 
provisions. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to respectfully remind your Excellency that in capital punishment 
cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set 
out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights admits of no 
exception. Relevant to the cases at issue, these guarantees include the right not to be compelled 
to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to 
ensure that any statement, which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not 
be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made. This principle is an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical 
and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of All 
Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. In this regard, we would further like to express our concern regarding Article 10(i) 
of the Law of Evidence of 1993, which states that &#8220;&#8230;evidence is not dismissed solely because it 
has been obtained through an improper procedure, if the court is satisfied that it is independent 
and admissible.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We would further like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 of 
Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights which, &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all Governments to implement fully the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights under 
international law of Al-Tayeb Abdel Aziz, Ishaq Mohammed Sanousi, Abdel Hay Omar, 
Mustafa Adam, Mohammed Birgid, Hassan Adam Fadel, Adam Ibrahim, Jamaleddin Isa, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 384 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Abdel Magid Ali Abdel Magid and Saibr Hassan are respected, in particular in light of the 
pending appeal of their case before the Supreme Court. This can only mean setting aside of the 
death sentence imposed against Al-Tayeb Abdel Aziz and suspension of the capital punishment 
against the other 9 persons until the allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and 
all doubts in this respect dispelled. Moreover, international law requires that the accountability of 
any person guilty of subjecting them to torture is ensured. 
 It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human 
Rights and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our 
attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would 
be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the above reports accurate? If not so, please share all information and documents 
proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details regarding the steps undertaken to investigate the reports of 
torture and any proceedings initiated against those suspected of having tortured these ten 
persons.

without access to the outside world for over one month and were not given access to 
lawyers until after the trial proceedings opened. 
</p>
<p> As of 18 June 2008, these 30 men and other defendants were presented before newly 
created counter-terrorism courts in greater Khartoum. Five special courts were created in early 
June in response to the attack on Omdurman and these 30 men and other defendants were 
brought before three of these special courts. Observers noticed that the defendants looked tired 
and appeared to be in pain. The defendants complained that they were subjected to torture or 
ill-treatment, but the court did not investigate these allegations and refused to grant requests by 
the defendants&#8217; lawyers for independent medical examinations. 
</p>
<p> On 29 and 31 July 2008, the courts announced their verdicts. They sentenced the 30 above 
named defendants to death, acquitted one, and ordered the transfer of four minors, to a detention 
facility where more than 90 children captured after the attacks are being held. One of those 
sentenced to death, Mahmood Adam Zariba, is reportedly a minor of 16 years of age, whose age 
was not determined by a medical examination. The 30 defendants were found guilty of a range of 
criminal charges defined in the 1991 Criminal Act, the 2001 Counter-Terrorism Act and the 
1986 Arms, Ammunitions and Explosives Act. The charges included terrorist acts, participation 
in a terrorist criminal organization (respectively sections 5 and 6 of the Counter-Terrorism Act), 
as well as criminal conspiracy, waging war against the state and sedition (respectively 
sections 24, 51 and 63 of the Criminal Act). 
</p>
<p> In reaching their verdicts, the courts relied as evidence primarily on confessions by the 
defendants which the defendants said they were forced to make under torture and ill-treatment 
and which they retracted in court. The court made reference to the Sudanese Evidence Act which 
permits the admission to judicial proceedings of statements obtained by unlawful means. The 
court also relied on the testimonies by children who have been detained since the attacks and 
who stated in court that they recognized the defendants as having been among the attackers. 
</p>
<p> We understand that judgments in respect of 28 further defendants are expected to be 
announced shortly, and that charges may be brought against others currently held without charge 
or trial. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports received, we would like to 
draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles applicable to this case 
under international law. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 386 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would in the first place respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in 
capital punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees 
for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which Sudan is a party and which (pursuant to article 27(3) of Sudan&#8217;s Interim National 
Constitution is &#8220;an integral part&#8221; of the constitutional Bill of Rights, admits of no exception. 
Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to &#8220;have adequate time and 
facilities for the preparation of [one&#8217;s] defence and to communicate with counsel of [one&#8217;s] own 
choosing&#8221; and the right not to be compelled to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to paragraph 12 of 
General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, which &#8220;reminds all States 
that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the 
perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in 
itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person&#8221;. Prolonged incommunicado detention 
furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees of the right to a fair trial, such as being 
assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s defence. 
</p>
<p> We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not 
be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in 
Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Reports that the court 
refused requests by the defence lawyers for medical examination of the defendants and then 
relied on their self-incriminating statements made during incommunicado detention and, 
allegedly, under torture would appear to suggest a particularly serious violation of these 
principles of international law. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the right to &#8220;have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his 
defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing&#8221; (Article 14(3)(b) of the 
Covenant), we would refer your Government to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, 
adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990. Principle 7 reads: &#8220;Governments 
shall further ensure that all persons arrested or detained, with or without criminal charge, shall 
have prompt access to a lawyer, and in any case not later than forty-eight hours from the time of 
arrest or detention.&#8221; The Human Rights Committee has observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving 
capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all 
stages of the proceedings.&#8221; (General Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). If it was 
confirmed that the thirty men sentenced to death were only able to speak to their lawyers when 
their trials began after more than a month of detention, this would negate the possibility of a fair 
trial. 
</p>
<p> We are also concerned by reports that the procedures of the special counter-terrorism 
courts are determined by the Chief Justice. We received information that the procedural rules of 
these courts may override existing laws, dispensing with certain guarantees contained in the 
Sudanese Criminal Procedure Code. For example, under the courts&#8217; rules of procedure 
defendants may only appeal the verdict once. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 387 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> It is our understanding that the 30 men were apprehended, charged and convicted in 
connection with the attack by hundreds of armed fighters of the Justice and Equality Movement 
on Omdurman, which could be seen as part of the ongoing armed conflict between your 
Government and this rebel armed group in Darfur. In this context, the question of the 
applicability of international humanitarian law to the proceedings against the thirty men arises. 
Indeed, we have received reports that in the weeks following the attacks, different official 
sources were quoted in the Sudanese media as stating that JEM combatants would be treated as 
Prisoners of War. In a briefing to the diplomatic community and UNMIS/UNAMID Human 
Rights on 10 June 2008, a military representative (Brigadier Dr. Mustafa Ibrahim) is reported to 
have announced that captured JEM combatants would be treated as Prisoners of War under the 
Third Geneva Convention of 1949 Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (Geneva 
Convention III). 
</p>
<p> In this respect we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that under Geneva 
Convention III and other international humanitarian law and international human rights norms 
applicable in all types of armed conflict all who are detained or tried are protected by certain 
fundamental guarantees. Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and 
Article 6 of Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, relating to the protection of 
victims of non-international armed conflicts (Additional Protocol II), which your Government 
acceded to in 2006, prohibit the passing of sentences and the carrying out of sentences without 
previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial 
guarantees. This prohibition is also reflected in a rule of customary law stating that &#8220;no one may 
be convicted or sentenced, except pursuant to a fair trial affording all essential judicial 
guarantees&#8221; (Rule 100 of the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified in 
the study of the International Committee of the Red Cross). In addition, Article 84 of Geneva 
Convention III states that &#8220;&#8230; [i]n no circumstances whatever shall a prisoner of war be tried by 
a court of any kind which does not offer the essential guarantees of independence and 
impartiality as generally recognized, and, in particular, the procedure of which does not afford 
the accused the rights and means of defence provided for in Article 105.&#8221; Article 105 in turn 
provides, inter alia, that &#8220;&#8230;[t]he advocate or counsel conducting the defence on behalf of the 
prisoner of war shall have at his disposal a period of two weeks at least before the opening of the 
trial, as well as the necessary facilities to prepare the defence of the accused. He may, in 
particular, freely visit the accused and interview him in private.&#8221; Also relevant to the case at 
hand, Article 99(2) of Geneva Convention III states &#8220;[n]o moral or physical coercion may be 
exerted on a prisoner of war in order to induce him to admit himself guilty of the act of which he 
is accused.&#8221; Similarly, Article 6(2) of Additional Protocol II, states that &#8220;no one shall be 
compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> To sum up, both in human rights law and under international humanitarian law, only the 
full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment, applied in 
conformity with international law, from a summary execution which violates the most 
fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Kamal Mohamed Sabun, 
Musa Hamid Osman Katar, Yunis Abdallah Al Nedif Bahar El Deen, Musa Adam Hassan Omar, 
Bahar El Deen Beshir Idriss, Bushara Abdullah Eissa, Ibrahim Al Nur Zakaria and 
Shumu Osman Ishaq Gibril are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death 
penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have 
raised are dispelled in their entirety, or the above named men are given a new trial or released. </p>

</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
Kamal Mohamed Sabun, Musa Hamid Osman Katar, Yunis Abdallah Al Nedif Bahar El Deen, 
Musa Adam Hassan Omar, Bahar El Deen Beshir Idriss, Bushara Abdullah Eissa, Ibrahim Al Nur 
Zakaria, Shumu Osman Ishaq Gibril, Fadul Hussain Rezeg Allah, Mohamed Arabi Ismail 
Ahmed, Mahmoud Abaker Mursal Yahia, Bushara Eissa Mohamed Salih, Mohamed Adam 
Abdallah Mohamed, Mohamed Hashim Ali Abdu, Haitham Adam Ali Adam, Awad Mohamed 
Hussein, Adam Abdallah, Haroun Abdelgadir, Mohamed Mansour Eissa, Osman Rabeh Mursal, 
Adam Mohamed Eissa Adam, Ibrahim Abaker Hashim, Mohamed Sharif Abdallah Suleiman, 
Mahmoud Adam, Adam Al Nour Abdelrahman Osman, Bashir Adam Mohamed Saleh, 
Abubaker Ibrahim Breima, Abdallah Adam Ibrahim Al Duma, Ibrahim Ali Rashid, Bashir Adam 
Sanusi Hashim and Mustafa Adam Sabun were subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. If 
no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information as to how the principle that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, is 
implemented in the Sudan? What steps should judges take under Sudanese law when confronted 
with allegations by defendants that they have been compelled to make confessions? 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details regarding the defendants&#8217; access to legal counsel before the 
trial and their possibility to communicate in private with counsel during the trial.  
</p>
<p> 5. Please explain what are the specific acts the defendants were found guilty of beyond 
participation in an armed uprising. Which acts the defendants engaged in were found by the 
court to constitute &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221; for the purposes of Articles 5 and 6 of the 2001 
Counter-Terrorism Act? Please provide the exact wording of the provisions that form the legal 
basis of the arrest, detention, conviction and sentencing of these defendants. 
</p>
<p> 6. Is it correct that your Government recognizes the persons arrested in connection with 
the 10 May 2008 JEM attack on Omdurman as prisoners of war? Please explain the legal 
consequences your Government draws from that qualification for the purposes of criminal 
proceedings against these persons. Does your Government see any conflict between recognizing 
the apprehended combatants as prisoners of war on the one hand and, on the other, the charges of 
criminal conspiracy, waging war against the state, sedition, and violations of the Arms, 
Ammunitions and Explosives Act raised against them, considering that these charges would 
appear to presuppose a duty of allegiance to your Government? 
</p>
<p> 7. Please explain the appeals and other challenges against the judgment and sentence 
open to the defendants, including ex gratia proceedings. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur

<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 24 September 2008</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, and the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture 
</p>
<p> We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have received 
regarding the death sentences imposed by counter-terrorism courts in greater Khartoum against 
20 men on 17 and 20 August 2008. The men were convicted on charges connected to the attack 
on Omdurman on 10 May 2008 led by the Justice and Equality Movement. 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p>On 17 August 2008, a counter-terrorism court in Khartoum found <b>Abdelaziz Al Nour 
Aousher Fedail, Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam, Al Taib Abdelkarim Idris 
Adam, Bashir Adam Aousher Fedail, Hamid Hassan Hamid Ahmed, Malik Adam 
Ahmed Mohamed, Mohamed Bahar Ali Hamadeen, </b>and<b> Tag Al Deen Mahmoud 
Abdurahman Ali </b>guilty on a range of offences under the 1991 Criminal Act, the 1986 
Arms, Ammunitions and Explosives Act an and the 2001 Counter-Terrorism Act and 
sentenced them to death. 
</p>
<p>On 20 August 2008, a counter-terrorism court sitting in Omdurman sentenced another 
twelve men to death on similar charges: <b>Azrag Daldoum Adam, Yahia Fadel Abaker 
Adam, Musa Abdallah Ali Shugar, Mohamed Abaker Naser Hussein, Ibrahim Saleh 
Ali, Idriss Omar Mohamed Ahmed, Mahjoub Suleiman Adam, Naser Jibreel Adam, 
Abdallah Mursal Tour, Adam Ibrahim Nur Mohamed, James Bol Francis, </b>and 
<b>Adam Suleiman Abaker</b>. The court also acquitted four defendants in this trial and 
referred four defendants to be tried by juvenile offender courts. 
</p>
<p> The allegations we have received with regard to the detention and trial of the persons 
named above are very similar to those we brought to your Government&#8217;s attention on 
11 August 2008 in relation to another 30 persons sentenced to death on 29 and 31 July 2008. 
They were arrested in the days following the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attack on 
Omdurman on 10 May 2008. Following their apprehension, they were held without access to the 
outside world by the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). It would appear that they </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 390 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>were not given access to lawyers until after the trial proceedings opened. In reaching their 
verdicts, the Khartoum and Omdurman counter-terrorism courts appear to have relied primarily 
on confessions by the defendants as evidence. Most of the defendants said they were forced to 
make these confessions under torture and ill-treatment and retracted them in court. No 
investigations were opened to investigate these allegations. 
</p>
<p> One of the defendants sentenced to death by the Khartoum counter-terrorism court on 
17 August 2008 is a minor. Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam is 17 years old and the court 
accepted his birth certificate as valid documentation of his age. It found, however, that since 
Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam was found guilty of hiraba, or brigandage (Article 167 of 
the Criminal Act), a hudud offence, he could nevertheless be sentenced to death. Article 27(2) of 
the Sudanese Criminal Act allows the death penalty to be applied for hudud crimes regardless of 
age. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports received, we would like to 
draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles applicable to this case 
under international law which we have already set forth in our communication of on 
11 August 2008. 
</p>
<p> We would in the first place respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in 
capital punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees 
for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which Sudan is a party and which (pursuant to article 27(3) of Sudan&#8217;s Interim National 
Constitution) is &#8220;an integral part&#8221; of the constitutional Bill of Rights, admits of no exception. 
Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to &#8220;have adequate time and 
facilities for the preparation of [one&#8217;s] defence and to communicate with counsel of [one&#8217;s] own 
choosing&#8221; and the right not to be compelled to confess guilt. 
</p>
<p> We recall that &#8220;prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment&#8221; (General Assembly Resolution 
A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, paragraph 12). Prolonged incommunicado detention 
furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees of the right to a fair trial, such as being 
assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s defence. 
</p>
<p> We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not 
be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in 
Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Reports that the courts 
relied on self-incriminating statements made by defendants during incommunicado detention in 
NISS facilities and, allegedly, under torture would appear to suggest a particularly serious 
violation of these principles of international law. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the right to &#8220;have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his 
defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing&#8221; (Article 14(3)(b) of the 
Covenant), we would refer your Government to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 391 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990. Principle 7 reads: &#8220;Governments 
shall further ensure that all persons arrested or detained, with or without criminal charge, shall 
have prompt access to a lawyer, and in any case not later than forty-eight hours from the time of 
arrest or detention.&#8221; The Human Rights Committee has observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving 
capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all 
stages of the proceedings.&#8221; (General Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). If it was 
confirmed that the 20 defendants sentenced to death were only able to speak to their lawyers 
when their trials began after more than a month of detention, this would negate the possibility of 
a fair trial. 
</p>
<p> We are also concerned by reports that the procedures of the special counter-terrorism 
courts are determined by the Chief Justice. We received information that the procedural rules of 
these courts may override existing laws, dispensing with certain guarantees contained in the 
Sudanese Criminal Procedure Code. For example, under the courts&#8217; rules of procedure 
defendants may only appeal the verdict once. 
</p>
<p> It is our understanding that the 20 prisoners sentenced to death were apprehended, charged 
and convicted in connection with the JEM attack on Omdurman, which could be seen as part of 
the ongoing armed conflict between your Government and this rebel armed group in Darfur. In 
this context, the question of the applicability of international humanitarian law to the 
proceedings arises. In our communication to your Government of 11 August 2008, to which we 
refer in this respect, we drew your Government&#8217;s attention to the norms of international 
humanitarian law protecting persons apprehended and detained in the course of an armed 
conflict. These norms provide that no such detainee may be convicted or sentenced, except 
pursuant to a fair trial affording all essential judicial guarantees, including assistance by counsel 
and the prohibition of moral or physical coercion exerted in order to induce him to admit guilt. 
</p>
<p> To sum up, both in human rights law and under international humanitarian law, only the 
full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment, applied in 
conformity with international law, from a summary execution which violates the most 
fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure that the rights under international law of the twenty prisoners named above are 
fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that 
the death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety, 
or the above named men are given a new trial or released. 
</p>
<p> Finally, we would like to express our particular concern with regard to reports that one of 
the defendants sentenced to death on 17 August 2008, Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam, is 
only 17 years old. 
</p>
<p> We would like to draw your attention to the fact that Article 37(a) of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, to which Sudan is a Party, expressly provides that capital punishment shall 
not be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, 
Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sudan is a 
Party as well, provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by 
persons below eighteen years of age. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 392 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received, the court accepted that Al Sadig Mohamed 
Jaber Al Dar Adam was a minor but sentenced him to death in spite of his age on the ground that 
the offences he was found guilty of included a hudud offence (brigandage). This would be in 
accordance with Article 36(2) of the Interim National Constitution and Article 27 of the 1991 
Criminal Act, which prohibit the death penalty for offences committed by minors when it would 
be imposed as ta&#8217;azir penalty, but allow it for qisas and hudud offences. In this regard, we must 
stress that, for the purposes of your Government&#8217;s obligation under international law, the 
distinction between hudud, ta&#8217;azir and qisas offences is immaterial. Article 37(a) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights apply - and bind your Government - irrespective of this distinction in the law 
of the Sudan. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, please 
share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the allegation that 
Abdelaziz Al Nour Aousher Fedail, Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam, Al Taib 
Abdelkarim Idris Adam, Bashir Adam Aousher Fedail, Hamid Hassan Hamid Ahmed, 
Malik Adam Ahmed Mohamed, Mohamed Bahar Ali Hamadeen, Tag Al Deen Mahmoud 
Abdurahman Ali, Azrag Daldoum Adam, Yahia Fadel Abaker Adam, Musa Abdallah Ali 
Shugar, Mohamed Abaker Naser Hussein, Ibrahim Saleh Ali, Idriss Omar Mohamed Ahmed, 
Mahjoub Suleiman Adam, Naser Jibreel Adam, Abdallah Mursal Tour, Adam Ibrahim Nur 
Mohamed, James Bol Francis, and Adam Suleiman Abaker may have been subjected to torture 
while in NISS detention. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, 
please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide details regarding the defendants&#8217; access to legal counsel before and 
during the trial and please indicate whether the defendants had the possibility to communicate in 
private with their counsels.  
</p>
<p> 4. Please explain the steps taken by your Government to lift or commute the death 
sentence imposed against Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please explain the current situation of the prisoners who were found to be minors by 
the counter-terrorism courts and whose re-trial by juvenile courts was ordered by the 
counter-terrorism courts. Where are they currently detained? Does your Government intend to 
bring them to trial? Do they have legal counsel defending them and does such legal counsel have 
access to them? Is it accurate that there are other children apprehended after the JEM attack and 
not charged who are still held at a detention facility near Al Jeili? 
</p>
<p> 6. Please explain the appeals and other challenges against the judgment and sentence 
open to the defendants sentenced by counter-terrorism courts on 17 and 20 August 2008, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 393 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>including ex gratia proceedings. What is the impact of Article 38(1) of the Criminal Act, 
providing that there shall be no pardon for hudud offences, in this respect? How is this provision 
compatible with Article 6(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
guarantees the right to seek pardon or commutation of any death sentence? We would further 
like to reiterate the following questions already asked in our communication of 11 August 2008, 
which has regrettably remained without a reply as of today. 
</p>
<p> 7. Please provide information as to how the principle that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, is 
implemented in the Sudan? What steps should judges take under Sudanese law when confronted 
with allegations by defendants that they have been compelled to make confessions? 
</p>
<p> 8. Please explain what are the specific acts the defendants were found guilty of beyond 
participation in an armed uprising. Which acts the defendants engaged in were found by the 
court to constitute &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221; for the purposes of Articles 5 and 6 of the 2001 
Counter-Terrorism Act?  
</p>
<p> 9. Is it correct that your Government recognizes the persons arrested in connection with 
the 10 May 2008 JEM attack on Omdurman as prisoners of war? Please explain the legal 
consequences your Government draws from that qualification for the purposes of criminal 
proceedings against these persons. Does your Government see any conflict between recognizing 
the apprehended combatants as prisoners of war on the one hand and, on the other, the charges of 
criminal conspiracy, waging war against the state, sedition, and violations of the Arms, 
Ammunitions and Explosives Act raised against them, considering that these charges would 
appear to presuppose a duty of allegiance to your Government?

<p> We would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we have received 
regarding attacks against the civilian population of the villages Logurony and Iloli in 
Eastern Equatoria State by the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army, which resulted in the <b>killing 
and beating of civilians, rape of women and destruction of dwellings and livelihoods </b>on 
4 June 2008 and in the following days. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>The villages of Logurony and Iloli are located near Hiyala, in Torit county, Eastern 
Equatoria State, Southern Sudan. The two villages have a history of occasionally tense 
relationships, due primarily to cattle raiding incidents. At the beginning of June 2008, the 
Governor of Eastern Equatoria State dispatched the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army 
(SPLA) to the two villages. 
</p>
<p>On 4 June 2008 at around 4 a.m., SPLA forces surrounded Logurony. While it was still 
completely dark, they started shooting, at first aiming in the air. The villagers, who were 
on high alert due to an expected attack from Iloli, returned fire. Only when it became light, 
they realized that they had killed SPLA soldiers. Fearing retaliation by the SPLA, they fled 
into the bush. SPLA soldiers shot at Logurony villagers, reportedly killing four: 
Tome Marcello, the headmaster of the primary school; Ogesa Orlando, a police officer; 
Oreste Ogubung; and Origo Agala. They also started burning down the village. Two 
elderly people, Ojeno Itak and his wife Amisia Itak, died in their dwelling during the fire. 
On 21 June 2008, another elderly woman, Anisa Anohira Oteng, succumbed, to the burn 
injuries sustained, at the hospital to which she had been taken by SPLA soldiers. 
Also on 4 June 2008, SPLA forces (reportedly counting 300 men) surrounded Iloli. When 
news of the SPLA members killed in Logurony reached Iloli, the soldiers took the 
inhabitants outside the village and then started burning down the village, killing one 
woman, Abung Elizabeth. The SPLA also arrested five men and tied their hands behind 
their backs. The SPLA Operational Commander came to Iloli and allegedly ordered the 
soldiers to execute those arrested. The five men were led back to Iloli. Three men, named 
Bertino Odiongo, Angelo Otuno Ogede and Francesco Asai Omudek, were executed on the 
spot in front of the remaining village community. One of those arrested was injured but 
managed to escape. The fifth man was beaten by the soldiers and chased away. The 
population started running towards the bush. The SPLA opened fire on them, injuring 
another man. On 9 June 2008, the bodies of two children, aged 5 and 6 (Ramonok Joseph 
and Omode Leone), were found in the bush surrounding the village. Iloli village was 
burned to the ground. 
</p>
<p>Soldiers gathered the remaining Iloli and Logurony villagers, approximately one thousand 
persons, and brought them to the SPLA barracks in Ramshel. There they spent the 
remainder of the day under the trees. Women were reportedly beaten with sticks. Many 
women were raped by SPLA soldiers at the SPLA barracks in Ramshel on 4 June, some of 
them in front of their children. The raped women include M.E. and A.T. (full names on 
record with the Special Rapporteurs), as well as Kelenga Obong. The mortal remains of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 395 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Kelenga Obong, who suffered from epilepsy, were later found in the bush. She did not 
survive the torture she underwent including the stress resulting from her flight. In the 
evening of 4 June 2008, the villagers held at the SPLA barracks were released, apparently 
on orders of the Torit County Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>Twelve male villagers, five from Logurony and seven from Iloli, however remained in 
SPLA detention until 7 June 2008 (one of them seven days longer). Some were allegedly 
held in a tukul, while others were kept in a hole in the ground. All were beaten on their 
head and stomach with gun barrels and other wooden and iron objects. Two Logurony 
detainees sustained severe head injuries, while another had whipping marks on his 
buttocks. These men did not report the ill-treatment to the police as they feared re-arrest by 
the SPLA. 
</p>
<p>On 10 June 2008, a young man from Hiyala was arrested on suspicion of involvement in 
the shooting that led to the death of SPLA soldiers. He was taken to the SPLA barracks and 
severely beaten. He was released following a meeting between the Hiyala Head Chief and 
the SPLA, and had to be taken to Hiyala Hospital for medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>SPLA retaliation against the civilian population of Logurony, Iloli and Hiyala continued in 
the days following 4 June 2008. On 6 June 2008, SPLA men shot at Hiyala villagers who 
were working in the field. A man and a woman were killed (Oronjo Safarino and 
Odiongo Salvatore), another woman injured. On 7 June 2008, Omudek Alajut, a man from 
Iloli who had returned to the village, was apprehended by SPLA soldiers, tied up and 
executed on the spot. On 10 June 2008, Omunong Ohisa Ernaldo and Oreste Ohuro, two 
Logurony villagers, were found shot dead near Hiyala village square.  
</p>
<p>These events resulted in major displacement from Iloli and Logurony villages. 
Approximately 2,800 inhabitants of Logurony and approximately 1,500 of Iloli were 
displaced. Their dwellings were destroyed and they lacked the materials to rebuild them. 
At the beginning of August 2008, the Eastern Equatoria State government distributed some 
bamboo building materials, but these were insufficient to cover the needs. People still 
remained in tents, which were leaking during the heavy rains characteristic of the season. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, on 4 June 2008, the SPLA seized the cattle belonging to the Iloli and Logurony 
villages, on which the population relied for their livelihood. The cattle was only partially 
returned over the coming two months. Additionally, SPLA soldiers destroyed or took away 
the solar panels operating the Iloli water boreholes. As of 25 August 2008, six of ten solar 
panels had been returned, not enough to operate the boreholes, forcing the population to 
collect water in the surrounding mountains. 
</p>
<p>Small children and elderly people have been dying since the attacks due to the lack of 
food, medicine, clean drinking water, adequate shelter and the cold at night. Some reports 
indicate that 24 children may have died, including Amuronyang Osuru, Hakim Odiongo, 
Orisa Akim Kisario, Omote Oduho, Kulang Oduho and Ewot Agara Obora. Four elderly 
people, Kwahina Ojafa and Tjirino Obwana (female), Avore Odiongo and Claudio Okura 
(male) died as a result of lacking resources as well. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Government representatives from Eastern Equatoria State have visited the area and 
submitted reports to both the President and Vice-President of the Government of 
Southern Sudan. In the immediate aftermath of the incidents, the Eastern Equatoria State 
authorities and the Ministry of SPLA Affairs announced that a high-level committee would 
be investigating the incidents, but four months later the members of the inquiry have not 
been appointed, nor any other steps taken. The Eastern Equatoria State Government and 
the Torit County Commissioner took part in peace and reconciliation efforts between the 
two villages. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to refer 
your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Sudan is a party, provides that every individual 
has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that 
no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). In particular, Article 6 of the 
ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement officials only when strictly necessary, and 
that force must be in proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved. As expressed in the 
UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), 
this requires that law enforcement officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means 
before resorting to the use of force (Basic Principles, Principle 4). Further, whenever the lawful 
use of force is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in 
proportion to the seriousness of the offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic 
Principles, Principle 5). Intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly 
unavoidable in order to protect life (Basic Principles, Principle 9). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that your Government has a 
duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. To fulfill this legal 
obligation, governments must ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force by law enforcement 
officials is punished as a criminal offence (Basic Principles, Principle 7). There must be 
thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions. While a commission of inquiry into the events may be a very appropriate 
measure in a case such as the reported events in Loguronyi and Iloli on 4 June 2008 and the 
following days, it is not sufficient. Principle 18 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention and Investigation 
Principles&#8221;) provides that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that persons identified by the investigation 
as having participated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions in any territory under their 
jurisdiction are brought to justice.&#8221; Superiors and other public officials may be held responsible 
for acts committed by officials under their authority if they had a reasonable opportunity to 
prevent such acts (Principle 19 of the Prevention and Investigation Principles, see also 
Principle 24 of the Basic Principles) - all the more so, if they ordered the executions. 
</p>
<p> With regard to witnesses and family members of victims, Principle 15 of the Prevention 
and Investigation Principles provides that complainants, witnesses, and their families shall be 
protected from violence and any other form of intimidation. Those potentially implicated in 
extra-legal executions shall be removed from any position of control or power, whether direct or 
indirect, over complainants, witnesses and their families, as well as over those conducting 
investigations. Families of the deceased should be informed about the investigation, and the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 397 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>findings of the investigation should be made public (Prevention and Investigation Principles, 
Principles 16 and 17). The families and dependents of victims of extra-legal, arbitrary or 
summary executions shall be entitled to fair and adequate compensation within a reasonable 
period of time (Prevention and Investigation Principles, Principle 20). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to 
physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> We would further like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 8/8 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any 
place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all Governments to implement 
fully the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall Article 4 (b) of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women, which stipulates that States should pursue by all 
appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating violence against women and, to this 
end, should refrain from engaging in violence against women. In addition, Article 4 (c &amp; d) of 
the Declaration notes the responsibility of States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate 
and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether 
those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons. To this end, States should develop 
penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the 
wrongs caused to women who are subjected to violence. 
 We are encouraged by the reports indicating that representatives of Eastern Equatoria State 
and of the Government of Southern Sudan intend to carry out an in depth investigation into the 
incidents summarized above. We are, however, concerned about reports indicating that, four 
months after the incident, the investigation has not started and the members of the high level 
committee might not even have been appointed. We would ask your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
keep us informed of the developments and outcomes of this investigation, as well as of 
disciplinary and criminal proceedings initiated against the perpetrators of extra-judicial 
executions. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Which authority decided to entrust the SPLA (instead of the Southern Sudan Police 
Service) with an operation aimed at ending cattle rustling and other disputes between two 
villages, and on what grounds? What were the orders of engagement of the SPLA units 
dispatched to Loguronyi and Iloli? </p>

</p>
<p> 3. Please provide details on the proceedings and results of the investigation by the 
high-level committee reportedly announced by the Ministry of SPLA Affairs. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the alleged extra-judicial executions and rapes of women. 
</p><p> 5. Please provide the details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants, 
witnesses and family members of the victims are not subject to any intimidation or retaliation. 
 6. Please provide information on measures adopted to ensure that law enforcement 
forces in Southern Sudan comply with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials. 
</p>
<p> 7. Please state whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to the rape 
victims and the families of the victims of killings by SPLA forces. 
</p>
<p> 8. Please explain the steps taken by your Government to restore adequate housing and 
access to adequate food and water to the populations of Logurony and Iloli. Please state whether 
any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to the families whose housing was 
destroyed by the SPLA forces and whose cattle has not been returned.

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 10 October 2008</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan and 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
</p>
<p> We are writing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government in relation to reports we have received 
regarding <b>the use of the death penalty in Southern Sudan</b>. 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to recall that, although the death penalty is not prohibited 
under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental 
right to life, and must as such be applied in the most restrictive manner. Based on the reports we 
have received, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention our concerns with regard 
to capital punishment in Southern Sudan in four regards: (1) the requirement that in capital </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 399 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>punishment cases all fair trial guarantees are rigorously observed, including particularly the right 
to assistance by a lawyer, (2) the prohibition of the imposition of the death penalty against 
offenders aged under 18 at the time of the crime, (3) limitations on judicial discretion to apply 
prison sentences instead of the death penalty in murder cases, and (4) conditions of detention of 
prisoners sentenced to death.  
</p>
<p><b><i>1. Fair trial guarantees, in particular the right to be assisted by legal counsel 
</i></b></p>
<p> We would in the first place to respectfully recall to your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in 
capital punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees 
for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), to which Sudan is a party, admits no exception.  
</p>
<p><b><i>(a) International law principles regarding the right to legal counsel in capital cases 
</i></b>  Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right of every person accused of 
a criminal offence &#8220;to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing&#8221; 
(Article 14(3)(d) ICCPR). The Human Rights Committee has observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving 
capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all 
stages of the proceedings&#8221; (General Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). According to 
article 27(3) of the Interim National Constitution and article 13(3) of the Interim Constitution of 
Southern Sudan (ICSS) these guarantees are &#8220;an integral part&#8221; of the constitutional Bill of 
Rights. 
</p>
<p> Where a defendant does not have legal assistance, he must be informed of this right. Where 
the interests of justice so require, the Government must provide a defendant with legal counsel 
without payment by him if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it (Article 14(3)(d) 
ICCPR). These guarantees are further spelled out in the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, 
adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders. Principle 5 reads: &#8220;Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately 
informed by the competent authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice 
upon arrest or detention or when charged with a criminal offence.&#8221; Principle 6 adds: &#8220;Any such 
persons who do not have a lawyer shall, in all cases in which the interests of justice so require, 
be entitled to have a lawyer of experience and competence commensurate with the nature of the 
offence assigned to them in order to provide effective legal assistance, without payment by them 
if they lack sufficient means to pay for such services.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We understand that the right to be assisted by legal counsel is reflected in Southern 
Sudanese law as well. The ICSS Bill of Rights (art. 23(6)), the 2003 New Sudan Code of 
Criminal Procedure and the 1991 Code of Criminal Procedure all provide, though in slightly 
different terms, that a person accused of an offence as serious as murder has the right to be 
assisted by an advocate. Where he does not have sufficient means to retain a lawyer, he has the 
right to have legal aid assigned to him by the government and at the government&#8217;s expenses. One 
important element that is clearly spelled out in the international standards cited above and might 
not be as clear in Southern Sudanese law is that, where a person accused of a crime carrying the 
death penalty is not assisted by a lawyer, the investigatory and judicial authorities are under an 
obligation to inform him of the availability of legal aid. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b><i> (b) Information received regarding the situation in Southern Sudan 
</i></b>  In practice, however, the information we have received suggests that most of the 
condemned prisoners do not have legal counsel, and even more did not have legal counsel during 
the trial in which they were sentenced to death. In Juba Central Prison, for instance, it would 
appear that the following prisoners sentenced to death are not assisted by legal counsel (and most 
probably were not assisted during their trial): Balla Kamal Tahir, Gabriel Nyara Pio, 
Moses Ohiti Lowa, Charles Lokudu Remeo, Mauro Ohisa Ogotow, Mario Oburau Okoloputa, 
Peter Jutti Budenga, Thiplious Tongun Wusang, Abdauraman Marino Lwarene, Sejeriwa Poni 
Tombe, Bol Makol Malual, Gabriel Sule Jada, Joseph Ladu Kamuka, Simplisio Ataka Adelio, 
Tadeo Lodu wani, Bulli Jelly Kewyi, Emanuel Gift Repent, Simon Mayuong Akoon, and 
Lojere Lorot Loseriko. It would also most regrettably appear that Joseph Jelly Morgo, who was 
reportedly executed in Juba Central Prison on 27 June 2008, did not have legal counsel. 
</p>
<p> Wilson Elisa Basangi, who was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by the 
Western Equatoria State High Court in Yambio on 30 November 2007, and is currently detained 
in Yambio Central Prison, was reportedly not assisted by legal counsel at his trial and was not 
informed on his constitutional right to obtain legal aid. He is currently, at the appeals stage, 
assisted <i>pro bono </i>by an advocate in private practice. 
</p>
<p> In Upper Nile State, Nig Mashar, Khamis Joseph Lugi, Mohamed Adeng, Wier Quench 
Kwangang, Abiel Otuang, Mohamed Saleh Hassan and Tut Dol Rut were all, allegedly, not 
assisted by legal counsel at the time of the trial in which they were sentenced to death. Two of 
them are reported to now have retained advocates against a fee, while the other five have been 
able to secure assistance <i>pro bono </i>by an advocate in private practice for the appeals stage 
through the intervention of the UNMIS Human Rights Section. 
</p>
<p> There are reportedly eight prisoners sentenced to death in Bentiu Central Prison in Unity 
State. Allegedly, none of them was represented by a lawyer at the time of trial. Two of them 
appear to have secured the assistance of an advocate for the appeals proceedings. In Bor, Jonglei 
State, there is one condemned prisoner. He was not assisted by a lawyer at the time of his trial. 
</p>
<p> In Wau, a prisoner named Jacob Makoi Majok was reportedly executed in Wau Central 
Prison on 24 July 2008. The nine remaining condemned prisoners include two women, 
Nyanthuoi Ater Matim and Akoi Bol Manding Lual and seven men: Guriguri Andrea Akot, 
James Nyon Koch (aged 72), Wol Akolino Akoi, Issaa Abdul Hamid, Alfred Share Guer, 
Lawrence Wol Mayen, and Marial Mol Kon. Issaa Abdul Hamid, who was sentenced to death in 
August 2007, was reportedly temporarily assisted by an advocate, but as he had no money to pay 
him, the advocate did not assist him throughout the trial. None of the other condemned prisoners 
was assisted by legal counsel at any time of the proceedings in their case. 
</p>
<p> Our information indicates that in Aweil Central Prison, three prisoners are sentenced to 
death: Malik Ayi, Dut Ahoey, and Makol Malong. Neither were they was assisted by legal 
counsel at any time of the proceedings in their case, nor were they informed or otherwise aware 
of their right to be assisted. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 401 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In Rumbek Central Prison as well, there are three condemned prisoners: Chagao Mwopor 
Akech, Majur Manyur Mayom, and Chol Kor Dit Majok. None of them was assisted by legal 
counsel at any time of the proceedings in their case. 
</p>
<p> The Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan provides in Article 138(3) that the Southern 
Sudan Ministry for Legal Affairs and Constitutional Development is mandated to &#8220;render legal 
aid&#8221;. According to our information, although the majority of the accused charged with a capital 
offence and of the prisoners already sentenced to death neither have a lawyer nor the means to 
retain one, not one of them has received legal aid from the Ministry for Legal Affairs and 
Constitutional Development. 
</p>
<p><b><i> (c) The right to appeal 
</i></b>  We further note that in Judicial Circular No. 3 of 21 August 2007, the Supreme Court of 
Southern Sudan has acknowledged the problem of numerous persons being tried on murder 
charges without the assistance of an advocate. 
</p>
<p> The Circular also observes that &#8220;[m]any accused persons who are not represented by 
advocates do not make appeals against the judicial decisions passed against them simply because 
they are ignorant of their right to appeal. This is their legal and constitutional right which they 
cannot lose because they are unaware of it.&#8221; We are very encouraged by this stance of the 
Supreme Court of Southern Sudan, which is in line with paragraph 5 of Article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, reading: &#8220;Everyone convicted of a crime 
shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according 
to law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We would, however, like to highlight two concerns we have in this respect. Both are based 
on the principle that the right to review of the sentence must not only be respected formally, but 
also be made effective. The first one, already amply discussed above, is that, in order for the 
right to seek review of a death sentence to be effective, the defendant must be assisted by legal 
counsel. As the Human Rights Committee stated in a case concerning a capital punishment case 
in Jamaica, &#8220;it is axiomatic that legal assistance must be made available to a convicted prisoner 
under sentence of death. This applies to the trial in the court of first instance as well as to 
appellate proceedings.&#8221; (Communication No. 250/1987, <i>Carlton Reid v. Jamaica</i>, para. 11.4). 
</p>
<p> Secondly, it would appear that according to Articles 251 and 255 of the 2003 New Sudan 
Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendant has only seven days from the date of the judgment to 
submit to the Court of Appeals (and thereafter, to the Supreme Court) a written statement setting 
forth reasons why the judgment should not be confirmed. This extremely short delay to submit 
the appeal could in many cases negate the effective exercise of the right to appeal against 
conviction. 
</p>
<p> Finally, we would like to stress that it is not sufficient for a person sentenced to death to be 
represented by legal counsel at the appeals stage, as seems to be the case of the Malakal 
condemned prisoners. Where someone was sentenced to death after a first instance trial in which 
he was not assisted by legal counsel, a full retrial must be ordered (or the death sentence 
commuted). Otherwise, not only the right to a fair trial, but also the right to life will be violated. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b><i>2. The prohibition of the death penalty for juvenile offenders 
</i></b>  We would also like to draw your attention to the fact that Article 37(a) of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, to which Sudan is a Party, expressly provides that capital punishment 
shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below the age of 18. In addition, 
Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that the death 
penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. We 
understand that also the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan provides in Article 25(2) that 
&#8220;no death penalty shall be imposed on a person under the age of eighteen&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Notwithstanding these unambiguous provisions, it would appear that there are four 
prisoners awaiting execution detained in Juba Central Prison who had not reached the age of 18 
at the time of the murder for which they have been sentenced. Their names are Joseph George 
Modi, Peter Stephen Wawi, Adil Osaman Gwagwe, and Peter Taban Angelo. We have also 
received information that Wier Quench Kwangang, who was sentenced to death in Malakal 
where he remains detained awaiting his appeal, may have been under 18 at the time of the 
offence he was found guilty of. Malik Ayi, who was reportedly sentenced to death by the 
High Court in Aweil at the beginning of 2008 and is held in Aweil Central Prison, was allegedly 
aged 16 at the time of the offence in June 2007. We were moreover informed that at the time of 
their trial there were no juvenile courts in Southern Sudan. 
<b><i>3. Limitations on judicial discretion to apply prison sentences instead of the death penalty 
</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>in murder cases 
</i></b></p>
<p> According to the information we have received, many of the prisoners awaiting execution 
in Southern Sudan were found guilty of murder under Article 130 of the 1991 Criminal Code. 
Under this provision, the death sentence is the only possible punishment for murder, unless the 
family of the victim forgoes retribution in kind and opts for the payment of compensation. This 
provision deprives the judge of the necessary discretion to tailor the sentence to the specific 
circumstances of the case and of the accused. Inevitably, some accused will be sentenced to 
death even though that sentence is disproportionate to the facts of their crimes. We would 
therefore urge your Government to review all death sentences imposed under Article 130 also on 
this ground. 
</p>
<p> We are aware that many other prisoners sentenced to death in Southern Sudan were found 
guilty and sentenced under Article 251 of the 2003 New Sudan Criminal Law. This provision 
allows the judge to impose the death sentence or life imprisonment for murder. We are, however, 
concerned about Article 244 of the 2003 Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that &#8220;[i]f the 
accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death and the Court sentences him to any 
punishment other than death, the Court shall in its judgement state the reasons why sentence of 
death was not passed.&#8221; This provision seems to suggest that for murder the death penalty is the 
rule and life imprisonment the exception, and that a judge must provide special reasons why he 
does not impose the death penalty. Such a rule would be incompatible with the principle that, 
under international law, the death sentence is an extreme exception to the fundamental right to 
life, and must as such be applied in the most restrictive manner. </p>

</p>
<p><b><i>4. Conditions of detention of condemned prisoners in Juba Prison 
</i></b>  Finally, we are very concerned about reports regarding the conditions of detention of 
prisoners sentenced to death. Reports we have received indicate that because the Prisons Service 
considers that the walls, roofs and security at Juba Prison are insufficient to effectively prevent 
escapes, condemned prisoners are shackled at their feet day and night, every day of the week and 
year. In Malakal, Aweil and Wau as well, all death row prisoners are shackled above the ankle. It 
would appear that many of the prisoners have been detained in these conditions for years. To cite 
two extreme cases reported to us: Mohamed Adeng has been imprisoned in Malakal since 1999, 
as has Enoka Poli Jacob in Juba. 
</p>
<p> In this regard, we would like to recall that Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights provides that &#8220;[a]ll persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with 
humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.&#8221; We also wish to stress 
that the Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee have consistently found 
that conditions of detention can amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. We would urge 
your Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that these prisoners are prevented from 
escaping without recourse to inhumane measures. 
</p>
<p> To conclude, only the full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still permissible under international law from a summary execution, which 
violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights of those sentenced to death in Southern Sudan 
and those facing charges for which the death penalty could be imposed are respected. 
Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty 
is not carried out until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. This would 
require, as a minimum, that: 
</p>
<p>(i) The death penalty is not carried out against anyone who has not been assisted by 
defence counsel during the first instance trial and all subsequent appeals proceedings; 
</p>
<p>(ii) That every one charged with murder is informed of the &#8220;right to have legal assistance 
assigned to him or her, [&#8230;], and without payment by him or her in any such case if 
he or she does not have sufficient means to pay for it&#8221;, as provided in 
Article 14(3)(d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
Article 23(6) of the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan; and 
</p>
<p>(iii) That all death sentences imposed under Article 130 of the 1991 Criminal Code, and 
possibly also those imposed under Article 251 of the 2003 Criminal Code in 
conjunction with Article 244 of the 2003 Code of Criminal Procedure, are reviewed 
to establish whether, on the facts of the individual case, there are no circumstances 
militating in favour of a lesser sentence. 
</p>
<p> Under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
to which Sudan is a Party and which it has incorporated into the constitutional Bill of Rights, 
States deciding to retain capital punishment must provide a legal aid system meeting the highest 
standards. Our understanding is that the legal aid system in Southern Sudan is currently not in 
operation, inter alia as a consequence of the decades long armed conflict which has ravaged the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 404 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>country until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement entered into force. If that was correct, we 
would suggest that international law requires that all executions in Southern Sudan be suspended 
until there is a functioning system for legal aid in capital cases. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the allegations above accurate? If not so, please share all information and 
documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide detailed information regarding access to legal counsel by all persons 
sentenced to death. Were they assisted by legal counsel during the first instance trial? Are they 
currently assisted by legal counsel? Were they informed at any stage of their right to be assisted 
by legal counsel, and of the right to be assigned legal counsel, at no cost if they cannot afford it? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information on the Southern Sudan legal aid system and on the steps 
the Government of Southern Sudan is taking to ensure that all persons charged with a capital 
offence are informed of their right to be assisted by legal counsel, and of the right to be assigned 
legal counsel, at no cost if they cannot afford it? 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide your Government&#8217;s views with regard to the concerns raised above in 
respect of Article 130 of the 1991 Criminal Code and Article 244 of the 2003 Code of Criminal 
Procedure. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide information on the steps taken by your Government to ensure that no 
one who was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence is sentenced to death or executed, and 
that all death sentences imposed against children in the past are commuted. Also please evaluate 
whether it will be possible to provide persons sentenced to death for offences committed as 
children a new trial before a juvenile court? 
</p><p> 6. Please provide information on the steps taken to ensure that the conditions for 
condemned prisoners in Juba, Wau, Aweil and Malakal Central Prisons, as well as all other 
prisons where prisoners sentenced to death are held, comply with minimum international 
standards.

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 12 March 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture 
</p>
<p> We would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to information we 
have received concerning the death in custody of <b>Mr. Mohamed Ahmed Osman Alkhair</b>, a 
businessman from Nyala, South Darfur.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 9 June 2008, officers of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) detained 
Mohamed Ahmed Osman Alkhair in Nyala and took him to a detention facility near the 
Nyala Railway Station. There he died as a result of torture. On 11 June 2008, NISS officers 
took his mortal remains to the family&#8217;s home in the Hay Alwadi area in the center of 
Nyala. His relatives refused to accept the body, which was taken to a police station. 
Thereafter, the security forces found Mohamed Ahmed Osman Alkhair&#8217;s 16-year old son, 
whom they forced to receive his father&#8217;s body. 
</p>
<p>The case has been brought before the competent prosecutor but, in spite of the efforts of a 
team of lawyers assisting the victim&#8217;s family, the case has made no progress in the nine 
months since the death of Mohamed Ahmed Osman Alkhair. Members of the security 
services have offered the wife 2000 Sudanese Pounds as compensation for dropping the 
case, which she has refused. 
</p>
<p>There are concerns that those responsible may be shielded from prosecution and 
punishment by Article 33 of the National Security Forces Act of 1999, which grants 
immunity to members of the security forces against ordinary civil or criminal proceedings 
for any act connected with official duties. Criminal cases may be prosecuted only with the 
approval of the Director-General of National Security. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to draw 
the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to these cases. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights provides, to which Sudan is a Party, that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one 
shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When the State detains an individual, it is held to a 
heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an 
individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a 
presumption of State responsibility. 
</p>
<p> In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death in custody, there 
must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, 
arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other 
reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 406 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 
8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive 
and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which Sudan is a Party. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to carry out an investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Mohamed Ahmed Osman Alkhair expeditiously, 
impartially and transparently, also with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and 
prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any person guilty of this alleged death under 
torture, both as immediate perpetrators and as responsible commanders, as well as to compensate 
the family. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to waive any immunity which under 
Sudanese law may shield those responsible for the death of Mohamed Ahmed Osman Alkhair. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your

<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and

</p><p> 3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the death in custody of Mohamed Ahmed Osman Alkhair. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please explain whether Article 33 of the National Security Forces Act of 1999 
applies to the investigation and prosecution of this case. If so, has the Director-General of 
National Security given his approval for prosecution? 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syria has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 6 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I would like to draw the attention of your Government to reports I have received regarding 
<b>the killing of up to 25 prisoners at Sednaya prison</b>, allegedly at the hands of military police, 
on 5 July 2008 and in the following days. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Sednaya prison near Damascus is a military prison used for pre-trial detention of suspects 
held by Military Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence and State Security and for convict 
prisoners sentenced by the State Security Court. In the morning of 5 July 2008, Military 
Police officers carrying out searches of prisoner cells got into a scuffle with a group of, 
allegedly unarmed, prisoners and lethally shot nine of them. Reports indicate that the 
confrontation was triggered by the military police throwing copies of the Qur&#8217;an on the 
floor and otherwise insulting the inmates.  
</p>
<p>Thereafter, detainees overpowered the security guards and took several hostages, including 
the prison director. Army troops and tanks were sent as reinforcements and the following 
four days security forces surrounded the prison. The prisoners, however, refused to 
surrender as long as the authorities refused to give them guarantees for their safety. 
Through cellular phones seized from the hostages, the prisoners remained in contact with 
outside world until 8 July 2008. 
</p>
<p>Finally, at a time and under circumstances not known, the prisoners appear to have 
released their hostages and the security forces regained control of Sednaya prison. Several 
more prisoners, possibly up to 16, were allegedly killed in the process. One prison guard 
was killed as well towards the beginning of the standoff.    
</p>
<p>Families of inmates have thus far not been able to obtain any information about their 
relatives. As soon as news of the confrontation leaked, relatives of some prisoners went to 
the Tishrin Military Hospital, where the wounded and killed were reported to have been 
transferred, but security forces prevented them from entering. Relatives of inmates also </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 408 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>addressed the Ministry of Justice seeking information about prisoners but did not receive 
any. The authorities have so far neither provided a list of names of the killed inmates nor 
an account of what happened at Sednaya prison. 
</p>
<p> While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer your 
Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the right to life and security of 
the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life (Article 6). In particular, Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be 
used by law enforcement officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in 
proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved. As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on 
the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law 
enforcement officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the 
use of force (Basic Principles, Principle 4). Further, whenever the lawful use of force is 
unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in proportion to the 
seriousness of the offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic Principles, 
Principle 5). Intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in 
order to protect life (Basic Principles, Principle 9). 
</p>
<p> I would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that your Government has a duty 
to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. To fulfill this legal 
obligation, governments must ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force by law enforcement 
officials is punished as a criminal offence (Basic Principles, Principle 7). There must be 
thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions. Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation 
of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;) 
provides guidelines for investigations, which includes conducting an adequate autopsy, and the 
collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence. Families of the deceased 
should be informed of information relevant to the investigation, and the findings of the 
investigation should be made public (Prevention and Investigation Principles, Principles 16 
and 17). 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandates provided to me by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to 
the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on 
the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please refer to the status or 
results of any police, medical, or military investigation, or judicial or other inquiries carried out 
in relation to the alleged incident. Please also indicate whether, and if so, when, your 
Government intends to make the results of investigations available to the families of the 
deceased victims. Has your Government informed the families of the deceased prisoners and 
made their names public? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, or criminal 
prosecutions against, military police or other members of the armed forces responsible for 
possible extrajudicial executions in connection with the alleged incidents at Sednaya prison. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 409 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 3. Please explain whether there are any provisions that effectively grant immunity from 
prosecution to employees of the security forces for offences committed while carrying out their 
duties (such as Article 16 of Legislative Decree no. 14 of 1969) which would preclude or 
otherwise affect criminal prosecutions in relation to this alleged incident. 
</p>
<p> 4. What measures are taken by your Government to ensure that police and the armed 
forces, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force in 
controlling prison riots, and that they respect and preserve life when the lawful use of force is 
unavoidable?   
</p>
<p> 5. Please state whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, provided to the 
families of the victims.

informations que j&#8217;ai re&#231;u concernant <b>le d&#233;c&#232;s de 68 personnes</b> le 29 juin &#224; Kouno, qui serait 
imputable aux forces de s&#233;curit&#233;s tchadiennes. 
</p>
<p> Selon les informations re&#231;ues : 
</p>
<p>Au moins 68 personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;es par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; tchadiennes le 
dimanche 29 juin 2008 &#224; Kouno, &#224; 300 kilom&#232;tres au sud-est de la capitale, N'Djamena. 
Les faits se seraient produits lors d&#8217;une tentative des forces tchadiennes d'arr&#234;ter un chef 
spirituel musulman qui a menac&#233; de lancer &#171; une guerre sainte du Tchad jusqu'au 
Danemark &#187;. Au moins 68 fid&#232;les du cheikh Ahmet Isma&#235;l Bichara et quatre membres des 
forces de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;s, et plus de 51 personnes gri&#232;vement bless&#233;es. Le cheikh 
et sept de ses lieutenants auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s et transf&#233;r&#233;s &#224; N'Djamena, o&#249; ils auraient &#233;t&#233; 
exhib&#233;s lors d'une conf&#233;rence de presse organis&#233;e par les autorit&#233;s tchadiennes le 2 juillet. 
Le ministre de l'Int&#233;rieur tchadien, Ahmat Mahamat Bachir, aurait annonc&#233; que quelque 
700 fid&#232;les du chef musulman avaient attaqu&#233; Kouno, mettant le feu &#224; 158 cases, deux 
&#233;glises, un dispensaire et la gendarmerie, avant de remplacer le drapeau national tchadien 
par un drapeau portant l'inscription &#171; Au nom d'Allah, Dieu est Grand &#187;. Le ministre aurait </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 410 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>affirm&#233; que le cheik Ahmet Isma&#235;l Bichara et ses fid&#232;les &#233;taient arm&#233;s de lances, d'&#233;p&#233;es et 
de fl&#232;ches empoisonn&#233;es. Il aurait ajout&#233; que le cheikh &#233;tait un homme dangereux, un 
extr&#233;miste et un terroriste. Il aurait aussi d&#233;clar&#233; que les forces gouvernementales &#233;taient 
parvenues &#224; lib&#233;rer 90 femmes et 121 enfants. 
</p>
<p>Selon les all&#233;gations, la r&#233;action des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; &#224; l'attaque contre Kouno aurait &#233;t&#233; 
clairement disproportionn&#233;e, ce qui serait illustr&#233; par le nombre &#233;lev&#233; de morts. Les forces 
de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient ouvert le feu sans discrimination et tu&#233; des personnes alors qu'elles 
auraient pu les arr&#234;ter. 
</p>
<p>Lorsque le cheikh Ahmet Isma&#235;l Bichara avait lanc&#233;, avant 2006, sa &#171; guerre sainte &#187;, 
soi-disant contre la corruption de la foi islamique et pour la restauration de la Justice au 
Tchad depuis la ville de Sarh, au sud-est du pays, avant de s'installer &#224; Kouno, les autorit&#233;s 
locales et nationales auraient &#233;t&#233; conscientes du danger que ses activit&#233;s et ses discours 
repr&#233;sentaient pour les autres communaut&#233;s religieuses. Son mouvement aurait cr&#233;&#233; dans 
ces r&#233;gions des tensions entre musulmans, chr&#233;tiens et animistes, mais rien n'aurait &#233;t&#233; fait 
pour l'arr&#234;ter.

Je souhaite &#233;galement attirer votre attention sur le Code de conduite pour les responsables de 
l'application des lois, r&#233;solution 34/169 du 17 d&#233;cembre 1979 de l'Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale qui stipule 
que les responsables de l'application des lois peuvent recourir &#224; la force seulement lorsque cela 
est strictement n&#233;cessaire et dans la mesure exig&#233;e par l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions. 
</p>
<p> Par ailleurs je prie votre Gouvernement de diligenter une enqu&#234;te sur les morts qui ont eu 
lieu lors de l&#8217;op&#233;ration par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; le 29 juin et, de traduire les responsables en

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of the 
United States in relation to the killing of Waleed Khaled. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 16 September 2005</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, we should like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention - as well as to 
the attention of the Government of Iraq, which we are addressing in this matter as well - 
information we have received concerning the fatal shooting of <b>Waleed Khaled</b>, a 24-year old 
TV soundman working for Reuters, based in Samawa. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 412 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> According to information received, on 28 August 2005 a Reuters TV crew consisting of 
Waleed Khaled and the cameraman Haider Khadem went to the site of a terrorist attack that had 
resulted in the death of two Iraqi policemen in the Hay-al-Adil district of West Baghdad. Upon 
arrival at the scene, a United States military sniper standing on the roof of a shopping centre 
opened fire on him, hitting him fatally once in the head and four times in the chest. Mr. Khadem 
was slightly wounded and immediately arrested by U.S. forces. A U.S. military statement said 
that &#8220;U.S. Task Force Baghdad units responded to a terrorist attack on an Iraqi Police 
convoy. (&#8230;) One civilian was killed and another was wounded by small-arms fire during the 
attack.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> Without in any way implying any determination on the facts and circumstances of this 
case, we would like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles 
applicable to such an incident under international law. Article 6 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. As 
the Human Rights Committee has clarified, &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; means in a manner &#8220;disproportionate to 
the requirements of law enforcement in the circumstances of the case&#8221; (Views of the Committee 
in the case <i>Su&#225;rez de Guerrero v. Colombia</i>, Communication no. 45/1979, &#167; 13.3). In order to 
assess whether the use of lethal force was proportionate to the requirements of law enforcement, 
there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions). This principle was recently reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights 
in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that 
all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. 
 In Resolution 2005/38 the Commission on Human Rights restated this principle with 
specific regard to acts of violence against journalists, calling on States to investigate such acts 
and to bring those responsible to justice, and adding explicitly that the principle applied also in 
situations of armed conflict. Respect of the outlined norms of international law is crucial not 
only in order to protect the right to life of journalists, but also to ensure respect for the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on Human 
Rights and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to clarify 
all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the 
Commission, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries that may have been carried out in relation 
to the shooting of Waleed Khaled. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been 
imposed in connection with this incident? If no inquiries have taken place or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

</p>
<p> 3. Please explain what rules of engagement or policies are in place to protect the right 
to life and physical integrity, as well as the right to freedom of expression and information, of 
journalists covering terrorist attacks in Iraq, in order to prevent incidents such as the one 
resulting in the death of Waleed Khaled. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the victim or the family

<p><b>Response from the Government of the United States of America dated 14 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p> This letter responds to Mr. Ligabo and Mr. Alston&#8217;s communication of  
September 16, 2005, concerning circumstances surrounding the death of Waleed Khaled. We 
sincerely apologize for the long delay in responding to your inquiry, due in part to unexpected 
delays in researching the facts of this case and the need for careful coordination among all 
government agencies with responsibility for the subject of the inquiry. As an initial comment, we 
note that your request for information cited the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The United States has long taken 
the position that the ICCPR does not apply extraterritorially. In Iraq, U.S. forces are operating as 
part of the Multi-National Forces under a UN Security Council Chapter VII mandate. 
Furthermore, the circumstances of this incident did not involve, as your letter suggests, a law 
enforcement operation. Nonetheless, the U.S. Government is pleased to provide this response as 
a courtesy. 
</p>
<p> On August 28, 2005, Waleed Khaled, a reporter from Reuters news agency, and his 
cameraman, Haider Khadem, were reporting on an attack against an Iraqi police envoy in. the 
Hay-al-Adil district of west Baghdad. U.S. military units were dispatched to Hay-al-Adil in 
response to the attacks against the Iraqi police, Emd, as described below, fired at the reporters 
car, killing Mr. Kahled and wounding the cameraman, Mr. Khadem. 
</p>
<p> The U.S. Government conducted a comprehensive investigation into the shooting of 
Mr. Khaled and concluded that no disciplinary action against military personnel was required. 
The U.S. Government (Army) investigation determined that the shooting followed. the 
applicable rules of engagement, under which military personnel are authorized to use force if 
they feel someone poses an immediate threat or threatens the integrity of the operation. The 
investigation indicated that Mr. Khaled failed to use appropriate precaution upon entering a 
hostile environment; the investigation found that Mr. Khadem was hanging out of the car 
window, holding what appeared to be a potential explosive device or a rocket-propelled grenade 
launcher. 
</p>
<p> The investigation later confirmed that this piece of equipment, which U.S. forces believed 
at the time to be a deadly weapon, was the video camera Mr. Khadem used to investigate the 
original attacks against the Iraqi police. The military officers perceived the failure of 
Misters Khaled and Khadem to slow their vehicle down as a potential threat, because of previous 
experiences by military personnel with suicide car bombers. Under these circumstances, U.S. 
military personnel used force against what appeared to be an immediate threat to their unit and 
civilian and military personnel nearby. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 414 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> The U.S. military rules of engagement promote the physical protection of journalists, as 
well as of other civilians. The U.S. Government strongly supports freedom of the press and 
freedom of opinion, and tries to equip journalists with the tools and protection that will allow 
them to conduct their jobs in a safe and effective manner. Specifically, the U.S. military 
guidelines and protocols detail how journalists should conduct themselves when reporting from a 
conflict area. The codes of conduct and procedures pertaining to the proper conduct and 
engagement by journalists operating in hostile areas are put in place for the safety of the 
journalists. The responsibility to abide by these rules, however, ultimately rests with the 
journalists, who must exercise discretion and caution in dangerous situations. 
 The U.S. Government deeply regrets the loss of life and fully recognizes the important role 
played by the news media in Iraq and other hostile environments.

<p><b>United States of America:  Execution of Earl Wesley Berry 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 21 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I 
have received regarding Mr. <b>Earl Wesley Berry</b>, who is reportedly scheduled to be executed in 
Mississippi at <b>6pm on 21 May 2008</b>. He was sentenced to death for the murder of Mary Bounds 
in 1987. To the extent that he can be classified, on the basis of the facts described below, as 
mentally retarded, his execution would be in violation of the international legal norms which I 
have been mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. It is reported that he has exhibited 
signs of mental retardation for most of his life. 
</p>
<p> According to the information I have received Mary Bounds was reported missing on 
29 November 1987. Her car was found on 1 December near the First Baptist Church she attended 
in Houston, Mississippi. Her body was found the next day in nearby woods. She had died of 
head injuries as a result of blows to the head. On 6 December, 28-year-old Earl Berry was 
arrested at his grandmother&#8217;s house, and confessed to the crime. He rejected an offer from the 
prosecution of a life sentence in return for a guilty plea. After a jury trial, he was sentenced to 
death on 28 October 1988. The death sentence was overturned by the state Supreme Court which 
found fault with the instructions given to the jury, and a resentencing was held in June 1992. At 
this hearing, the defense presented mitigating evidence, including testimony from a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 415 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>neuropsychologist about Earl Berry&#8217;s low intellectual functioning and possible brain damage. A 
psychologist also testified that, in his opinion, Berry suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. He 
was nonetheless sentenced once again to death. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, Earl Berry&#8217;s lawyers have challenged his death 
sentence with the claim that he has mental retardation. It has been reported that for reasons that 
are unclear, but possibly due to lack of funding for, and the sheer workload on, the understaffed 
public defender office representing Earl Berry at that time - Berry&#8217;s claim of retardation was not 
supplemented by the requisite expert affidavit which would have allowed the Court to determine 
whether the inmate should receive an evidentiary hearing on the claim of mental retardation. In 
August 2004, the state Supreme Court ruled that Berry had failed to comply with the criteria 
established by the Court in Chase v. State and denied him an evidentiary hearing. Under this test, 
the condemned prisoner must provide on appeal an affidavit from a qualified expert to the effect 
that the inmate has an IQ of 75 or below, and in the opinion of the expert. 
</p>
<p> It has been brought to my attention, that on 24 April 2008, a psychologist with expertise in 
mental retardation signed an affidavit stating that his review of the materials relating to 
Earl Berry had led him to the conclusion that Berry had an IQ of 75 or lower and/or 
&#8220;significantly sub-average intellectual functioning, and &#8220;to a reasonable degree of psychological 
certainty that further testing will demonstrate that Mr Berry meets the criteria established by the 
American Psychiatric Association and the American Association on Mental Retardation to be 
classified as mentally retarded&#8221;. Among other things, he noted that during Berry&#8217;s school years 
his IQ was assessed as low as 72, and when the 25-year-old Berry was discharged from a 
Mississippi Department of Corrections prison hospital on 24 April 1985 following an apparent 
suicide attempt, the final diagnosis was &#8220;suicidal gestures / mentally retarded&#8221;. Other affidavits - 
from Earl Berry&#8217;s mother, other relatives, and people who knew Berry - describe Berry&#8217;s slow 
development as a child, childhood head injuries he sustained as a boy, and the fact that even as 
an adult he never lived independently. His mother said that he attempted suicide six or seven 
times. 
</p>
<p> Finally, I have been informed that on 5 May 2008, despite this new Chase-compliant 
expert affidavit, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that Earl Berry&#8217;s claim of retardation was 
procedurally barred. The Presiding Justice of the Court dissented: &#8220;As an indigent defendant 
sentenced to the ultimate and final punishment, Berry is entitled to appointed competent and 
conscientious counsel to assist him with his pursuit of post-conviction relief. He has now 
presented this Court with substantial evidence that but for his post-conviction attorney&#8217;s 
deficient performance, he would have been granted an opportunity to pursue his claim that he is 
mentally incompetent pursuant to Atkins&#8230; Whatever the reasons for his prior counsel&#8217;s 
deficient performance, it is clear that Berry was not allowed a meaningful opportunity to present 
his mental retardation claim to this Court. When appointed counsel fails to provide the Court 
with the relevant facts, the system designed to ensure due process as well as a timely end to the 
appellate process, ceases to function. In the end, justice fails for all of those involved&#8221;. 
 In this connection, I would like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. Articles 3 and 6 of these instruments, respectively, provide that 
every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 416 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>by law and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. It is generally accepted that 
the execution of an individual who is mentally insane is incompatible with the prohibition of 
arbitrariness under these provisions. 
</p>
<p> I would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Safeguards Guaranteeing 
Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty, Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984. Of particular relevance is paragraph 3 which provides that 
the death penalty shall not be carried out on persons who have become insane. In addition 
resolution 1989/64 of the Economic and Social Council resolution of 24 May 1989 on the 
Implementation of the Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the 
Death Penalty, recommends in paragraph 1(d) that States further strengthen the protection of the 
rights of those facing the death penalty, eliminating the death penalty for persons suffering from 
mental retardation or extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or 
execution. Legal authorities have concluded that it has become a norm of customary law that the 
insane may not be executed. 
</p>
<p> I would greatly appreciate receiving, on an urgent basis, information from your 
Government concerning the steps taken by the competent authorities to comply with the State 
Party&#8217;s relevant obligations under international law.

to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 5 males (foreign nationals) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States has failed to 
cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 4 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I 
have received regarding Mr. <b>Jos&#233; Ernesto Medell&#237;n Rojas</b>, a Mexican national who is 
scheduled to be executed in Texas on 5 August 2008. I have also received information on four 
other Mexican nationals - Mr. C&#233;sar Roberto Fierro Reyna, Mr. Rub&#233;n Ram&#237;rez C&#225;rdenas, 
Mr. Humberto Leal Garc&#237;a, and Mr. Roberto Moreno Ramos - who have not yet been set 
execution dates, but who are all at risk of imminent execution. 
</p>
<p> Each of these men are part of a group of Mexican nationals currently on death row who 
were denied the right to consular access guaranteed by the Vienna Convention on Consular 
Relations (VCCR). Article 31 of the VCCR, a treaty to which the United States has been a party 
since 1969, provides that any foreign national who is arrested or detained must be informed of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 417 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>his or her consular rights. These include the right to have the consulate informed of the 
detention, and the right to communicate with the consulate. Because the Mexican nationals were 
denied these rights, Mexico brought a case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming 
that the United States violated the VCCR, and seeking reparations under the Convention. The 
ICJ ruled in 2004 that the US had in fact violated the VCCR because of its failure to inform the 
Mexican nationals of their consular rights, and ordered that the United States provide &#8220;review 
and reconsideration&#8221; of each of the cases: Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals 
(Mexico v US), 2004 ICJ No 128 (Judgment of 31 March 2004). This review is necessary to 
assess whether any of the trials of the Mexican nationals were prejudiced because of the 
violation of their consular rights. 
</p>
<p> However, it appears that none of the above-named persons has been provided the required 
review. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government has consistently acknowledged that it has an 
international legal obligation to provide review in accordance with the ICJ judgment: see 
International Court of Justice, Verbatim Record (20 June 2008), Closing statement of 
Mr John B Bellinger, III, pages 8, 13-16. I am also aware of the Memorandum issued by the 
President of the United States on February 28, 2005, directing US states to provide review, and 
of the ruling by the US Supreme Court in March 2008 that states were not constitutionally 
obligated to act in accordance with the Memorandum (Medell&#237;n v Texas, 522 US ___ (2008)). 
My understanding is that the US Attorney General and Secretary of State subsequently requested 
Texas to provide review, but that the Government of Texas has indicated that it is not prepared to 
provide such a review. 
</p>
<p> On 5 June 2008, Mexico filed a further request to the ICJ for an interpretation of the 
obligations of the US as required by the Avena case. On 16 July 2008, the ICJ ordered that the 
United States take all necessary measures to ensure that Medell&#237;n and the other foreign nationals 
are not executed - pending the final judgment of the ICJ on Mexico&#8217;s request for interpretation, 
and unless the Mexican nationals receive the required review and reconsideration (Request for 
Interpretation of the Judgment of 31 March 2004 in the Case Concerning Avena and Other 
Mexican Nationals (Mexico v United States of America); Request for the Indication of 
Provisional Measures (Order), 16 July 2008, p. 19, para. 80). 
</p>
<p> According to the information available to me, the Government of Texas has nevertheless 
confirmed its intention to execute Medell&#237;n on 5 August 2008 without providing review. 
Although a Bill (the Avena Case Implementation Act) was introduced into the US House of 
Representatives which would provide review without the need for the consent of Texas, I have 
been informed that this is unlikely to come into law before Medell&#237;n&#8217;s execution date. 
</p>
<p> It thus appears that - unless urgent measures are taken by the US Government - Texas will 
execute Medell&#237;n in violation of the 2005 Avena Judgment, and the 2008 Avena Order. This 
execution, and any further executions of other Mexican nationals without review, will 
constitution a violation of international law, and will engage the international responsibility of 
the US Government. 
</p>
<p> I would thus greatly appreciate receiving, on an urgent basis, information from your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government concerning the steps being taken to comply with its international legal 
obligations. In particular: </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p> 1. Please provide information on the immediate measures being taken to prevent any 
imminent executions from taking place without the required review and reconsideration.

<p> 2. Please indicate if your Excellency&#8217;s Government considers that the United States 
Congress is in a position to implement the necessary legal measures to ensure that steps are taken 
to comply with the international legal obligations of the United States in relation to this issue. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information as to the measures that will be taken to provide review to 
those foreign nationals currently on death row, but without execution dates.

scheduled to be executed on 23 September 2008. Mr Davis was sentenced to death in 1991 for 
the August 1989 killing of Mark Allen McPhail, a security officer (and off-duty police officer) in 
Savannah, Georgia. It is my understanding that a clemency hearing before the state Board of 
Pardons and Paroles is scheduled to take place today, 12 September 2008. 
</p>
<p> In recent years, Mr Davis&#8217; defense has made numerous unsuccessful attempts to obtain a 
hearing to present post-conviction evidence, including affidavits from the seven out of nine 
non-police witnesses who have recanted or changed their testimony subsequent to the conviction. 
In 2007, a Georgia trial-level judge dismissed Mr Davis&#8217; appeal for a new trial without 
conducting a hearing. On 17 March 2008, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled on the appeal against 
this decision. In a 4-3 ruling, it decided that the lower court had not abused its discretion. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 419 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> The Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court authored the dissenting opinion. She 
noted that &#8220;nearly every witness who identified Davis as the shooter at trial has now disclaimed 
his or her ability to do so reliably&#8221;. Most importantly from the perspective of international law, 
the Chief Justice argued that &#8220;this case illustrates that this Court&#8217;s approach in extraordinary 
motions for new trials based on new evidence is overly rigid and fails to allow an adequate 
inquiry into the fundamental question, which is whether or not an innocent person might have 
been convicted or even, as in this case, might be put to death.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Article 14(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which 
the United States of America is a party, provides &#8220;Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the 
right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.&#8221; On 
the one hand, there can be no doubt that - from a formal point of view - this right is protected to 
an exemplary degree in the United States, as illustrated by the innumerable instances of appeal at 
the State and Federal level the case of Mr Davis has gone through in the seventeen years since 
his conviction. On the other hand, however, Article 14(5) ICCPR requires that a review by a 
higher court must be a genuine review of the issues in the case. An &#8220;overly rigid [approach 
which] fails to allow an adequate inquiry into the fundamental question&#8221; (in the words of the 
Georgia Chief Justice) cannot live up to that standard. In the context of Mr Davis&#8217; case, the 
refusal by the courts to grant a rehearing when presented with significant new evidence which 
casts doubt on the initial conviction, appears to amount to a denial of the right to a genuine 
review as required. 
</p>
<p> Such a genuine review would be particularly appropriate in this case in the light of 
information regarding the alleged failure of trial counsel to conduct an adequate investigation of 
the state&#8217;s evidence, to which I drew your Government&#8217;s attention in a previous communication 
regarding this case dated 16 July 2007. I also noted that the Georgia Resource Center, a 
post-conviction defender organization (PCDO) which represented Mr Davis, reportedly had its 
budget reduced by two-thirds and the number of lawyers on its staff reduced from eight to two at 
the time it was engaged in Mr Davis&#8217; defense. A lawyer working on Troy Davis&#8217; case stated in 
an affidavit that &#8220;I desperately tried to represent Mr Davis during this period, but the lack of 
adequate resources and the numerous intervening crises made that impossible&#8230; We were 
simply trying to avert total disaster rather than provide any kind of active or effective 
representation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> International law requires Governments to provide a defendant accused of a serious crime 
with legal counsel without payment by him if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it 
(Article 14(3)(d) ICCPR). Where such public defense is provided to an indigent defendant, it 
must live up to the requirement that the accused shall have &#8220;adequate time and facilities for the 
preparation of his defense&#8221; (Article 14(3)(b) ICCPR). As stated by the UN Human Rights 
Committee, &#8220;[w]hen an accused is represented by assigned counsel, the authorities [&#8230;] have a 
special duty to take measures to ensure that the accused is effectively represented (Kelly v. 
Jamaica (253/1987), 8 April 1991, Report of the HRC, (A/46/40), 1991, at 248, para. 5.10).&#8221; 
In the present case there are grounds for concern that poor legal representation afforded to 
Mr Davis since 1989 has denied him both the right to a fair trial and the right to effectively 
appeal against conviction and the death sentence. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> In light of these serious and pressing concerns, based upon human rights norms recognized 
by the international community, I would respectfully request Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with accepted standards of 
international human rights law. I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to put Mr Davis execution 
on hold in light of the above facts with a view to commuting his death sentence. 
</p>
<p> In closing I wish to reiterate two points. The first is that, despite receiving a significant 
number of complaints in relation to the carrying out of the death sentence in the United States, I 
have only rarely acted on these complaints. In this instance I firmly believe that the case merits 
this urgent appeal and warrants immediate action on the part of the U.S. Government. The 
second is that I take no position either for or against the death penalty but act only when it seems 
clear that the risk of injustice is such that internationally accepted standards will be violated in 
the absence of urgent intervention by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of the United States of America dated 6 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> We are in receipt of your letter or September 12 regarding the pending execution of 
Troy Anthony Davis. Mr. Davis was sentenced to death in 1991 for the August 1989 killing of 
security officer Mark Allen McPhail in Savannah, Georgia. We have passed along your letter to 
the offices of Georgia Attorney General Thurbert E. Baker and Governor Sonny Perdue for 
information regarding the steps taken to comply with the State Party&#8217;s relevant obligations under 
international law. 
</p>
<p> As you may be aware, on September 23, prior to Mr. Davis&#8217; scheduled execution, the U.S. 
Supreme Court granted Mr. Davis&#8217; application for a stay of execution. The Court is now 
considering whether to grant Mr. Davis&#8217; petition for a writ of certiorari. The stay order issued by 
the Court states: &#8220;Should the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate 
automatically. In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate 
upon the issuance of the mandate of this Court.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We thank you for your letter. Please be assured we will pay utmost attention to this case.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur

<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response of the Government of the United States 
with respect to the case of Larry Ray Swearingen, but notes that the response does not address 
the substantive issues raised by the Special Rapporteur, including the existence of procedural </p>

<p>barriers to judicial consideration of potentially exculpatory evidence. The Special Rapporteur 
looks forward to receiving from the Government information about further developments in 
Mr. Swearingen&#8217;s case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 26 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
information I have received regarding Mr. <b>Larry Ray Swearingen</b>, who is reportedly scheduled 
to be executed in Texas on <b>27 January 2009</b>. Mr. Swearingen was sentenced to death in 2000 
for the 1998 killing of Melissa Trotter. 
</p>
<p> In recent years, Mr. Swearingen&#8217;s defense has made several requests to obtain full DNA 
testing of crime scene evidence which includes male blood found under the victim&#8217;s fingernails 
and pubic hair found on the victim&#8217;s body. According to information received testing of both 
these elements has excluded Mr. Swearingen as the donor. The requests for full DNA testing 
have been denied on several occasions including by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on 
1 February 2006 and most recently by the Ninth State District Court on 17 January 2009. 
</p>
<p> Article 14(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which 
the United States of America is a party, provides &#8220;Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the 
right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.&#8221; On 
the one hand, there can be no doubt that - from a formal point of view - this right is protected to 
an exemplary degree in the United States, as illustrated by the numerous instances of appeal at 
the State and Federal level the case of Mr Swearingen has gone through in the eight years since 
his conviction. On the other hand, however, Article 14(5) ICCPR requires that a review by a 
higher court must be a genuine review of the issues in the case. While it may be appropriate for a 
State to enact procedural barriers in order to limit the basis upon which appeals may be lodged 
and be entitled to be heard, it cannot be justified under the terms of the Covenant for a State to 
proceed with the ultimate penalty of death in circumstances in which it has failed to give 
appropriate consideration to potentially exculpatory evidence that might emerge from a DNA 
request which is sought in good faith and on the understanding that it genuinely offers the 
prospect of putting new evidence before the court. This is underscored by the record of over 
220 post-conviction DNA exonerations in the United States, including 17 capital cases. 
</p>
<p> In light of these serious and pressing concerns, based upon human rights norms recognized 
by the international community, I would respectfully request Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with accepted standards of 
international human rights law. I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to put Mr Swearingen&#8217;s

grateful for your cooperation and your observations. In addition to an expeditious first reply, I 
would greatly appreciate being informed about further developments in this case. I undertake to

addition, on 14 January, Mr. Swearingen&#8217;s lawyers filed a petition for review with the

torture<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government information we 
have received concerning three recent cases of death in custody in Uzbekistan. The three victims, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 423 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Mr. <b>Hoshimjon Kadyrov</b>, aged 33, Mr. <b>Muhammadshokir Artykov</b>, aged 33, and 
Mr. <b>Abdurahman Kuchkarov</b>, aged 36, were all imprisoned in connection with the events of 
May 2005 in Andijan. 
 According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Hoshimjon Kadyrov went into hiding after being involved in the 2005 Andijan events. On 
3 November 2008 he secretly visited his parents in Andijan and was taken into custody and 
detained in the Andijan prison. On 23 November 2008, the police returned his remains to 
his family. His body was covered with bruises, his nails had been removed and he had no 
teeth left in his mouth. Mr. Kadyrov&#8217;s parents were told by the authorities to bury him 
quickly and not to protest. 
</p>
<p>Muhammadshokir Artykov was one of the prisoners freed during the Andijan prison break 
of 12 May 2005. He was subsequently re-arrested and imprisoned in Tashkent. He became 
physically disabled due to ill-treatment by prison guards. On an unspecified date in autumn 
2008 his mortal remains were returned to his family. The authorities explained that he died 
of natural causes.  
</p>
<p>Abdurahman Kuchkarov was serving a sentence for his involvement in the 2005 Andijan 
events in the Tavaksay prison in Tashkent Region. His mortal remains were returned to his 
family in Andijan, on 3 October 2008. He had been taken from the prison to the prison 
hospital, where he died. The circumstances surrounding his death were not explained in 
detail to the family, who was told to proceed quickly with the funeral. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to draw 
the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to these cases. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights provides, to which Uzbekistan is a Party, that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the Covenant states that no 
one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When the State detains an individual, it is held 
to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when 
an individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a 
presumption of State responsibility. In this respect we would like to recall the conclusion of the 
Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case (<i>Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay</i>, communication 
no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraphe 9.2): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo Dermit 
committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; yet, the 
inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either by 
act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, as 
required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from 
injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of 
all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where 
complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 424 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human 
Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have 
&#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which Uzbekistan is a Party. 
</p>
<p> We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to carry out inquiries into the circumstances 
surrounding the deaths of Hoshimjon Kadyrov, Muhammadshokir Artykov and 
Abdurahman Kuchkarov expeditiously, impartially and transparently, also with a view to 
taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any 
person guilty of the alleged violations, as well as to compensate their families. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the case summaries accurate? If not so, please share all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to each of the cases. Please explain the steps 
taken to ensure that these investigations comply with the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the deaths in custody of Hoshimjon Kadyrov, Muhammadshokir Artykov and 
Abdurahman Kuchkarov. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details of any compensation payments made to the families 
or dependants, if any, of Hoshimjon Kadyrov, Muhammadshokir Artykov and 
Abdurahman Kuchkarov. </p>

KUCHKAROV 
</b></p>
<p>1. <b>H. Kadyrov</b>, born in the town of Andijan on 10 March 1975, was under investigation. He 
was arrested on 15 October 2008 and charged with an offence under article 159-4 of the 
Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan (Attempt to overthrow the constitutional order of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan). 
</p>
<p> On 6 November 2008 H. Kadyrov was admitted to Tashkent hospital facility UY-64/18 
with the diagnosis &#8220;acute cardiac insufficiency and a gastric ulcer complicated by a stomach 
haemorrhage&#8221;. Despite comprehensive treatment, the complications worsened and, on 
9 November 2008, H. Kadyrov died. 
</p>
<p> H. Kadyrov was not subjected to torture or other forms of irregular treatment at the hands 
of the administration or staff of the facility. 
</p>
<p>2. <b>M. Artykov</b>, born in Andijan on 2 September 1975, had been found guilty 
on 14 November 2005 by the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan under 
article 97-2 (a) (Intentional homicide) and article 132-2 (Demolition, destruction and damage to 
historical and cultural monuments) of the Criminal Code, and sentenced to 17 years deprivation 
of liberty. 
</p>
<p> He was serving his sentence in facility UY 64/65 in Zangiot settlement in Tashkent 
province. His state of health in March 2008 caused him to be transferred to Tashkent hospital 
facility 64/18 for treatment. 
</p>
<p> While in the hospital ward, the convicted offender Artykov began appropriate treatment, 
which was however complicated by secondary infections. 
</p>
<p> As a consequence, the convicted offender Artykov died on 7 September 2008. The 
diagnosis was &#8220;infiltrative, disseminated and fibrous-cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic 
hepatitis and chronic pyopneumothorax&#8221;, complicated by pulmonary-cardiac insufficiency. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>A. Kuchkarov</b>, born in Andijan on 8 November 1971, was found guilty 
on 21 November 2005 by the Syrdaryo provincial court under article 244-2-1 of the Criminal 
Code (Production or distribution of material posing a threat to public security and public order), 
and sentenced to six years deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p> He was serving his sentence in facility UY-64/3 in Tavaksai settlement, Tashkent province. 
</p>
<p> Owing to his state of health, in May 2008 he was transferred to Tashkent medical facility 
UY-64/18 for hospital treatment. 
</p>
<p> While in hospital the convicted offender Kuchkarov commenced appropriate treatment. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 426 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> On 27 March 2008, the convicted offender Kuchkarov died. The diagnosis was a bladder 
stone and chronic liver insufficiency. 
</p>
<p> Forensic investigations were carried out into all three deaths of convicted offenders, and 
they were investigated by the staff of the procuracy. 
</p>
<p> In view of the foregoing, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan 
decisively rejects all the allegations by so-called human rights defenders of &#8220;torture and other 
violations of offenders&#8217; rights&#8221;. Facility staff operate within the framework of their official 
duties, observing legal norms and the rules for the treatment of offenders. 
</p>
<p> The material which has been published is yet another attempt to discredit staff of the 
Central Penal Correction Department and of the law enforcement agencies of Uzbekistan in 
general. Moreover, the distribution of communications of this sort via electronic media is 
intended to create an artificial stir around the question of human rights observance in Uzbekistan.

</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information we 
have received <b>concerning several incidents of allegedly arbitrary killings of indigenous 
Degar individuals by your Government&#8217;s security forces</b>.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 14 April 2008, <b>Y-Cung Nie</b>, born in 1982, from the village of Buon Cuor Hdang, 
district of Cu Mgar in Daklak province, took part in a demonstration at the commune of 
Ia Knuec to demand the release of three Degars arrested on 9 April. Not long after he 
arrived home on the same day, security police from the district of Cu Mgar arrested him in 
his home and took him into a nearby wooded area. Soon thereafter, the security police 
returned to the village and told Y-Cung Nie&#8217;s parents and family that they had killed him 
and wanted the family to go pick up his corpse and bury it. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 427 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The security police threatened the family not to tell anyone about Y-Cung Nie&#8217;s death, 
particularly not Degars living in the United States. They said that they would come back 
and kill them all if they did. When the family went to pick up the corpse, they saw that he 
had been beaten beyond recognition. His face and body were covered with blood, his skull 
was fractured and his entire body was bruised. The security police watched the family 
while they cleaned and dressed the corpse and stayed until the burial had taken place on 
16 April 2008 to prevent pictures of the corpse from being taken. 
</p>
<p><b>Y-Song Nie</b>, a 24-year-old man from Buon Pok village, commune Ea Ken, district 
Krong Pac in Daklak province, married with children, and <b>Y-Huang Nie</b>, aged 23, from 
Buon Kreh village, commune Ea Ken, district Krong Pac in Daklak province, married with 
children, also took part in the same demonstration on 14 April 2008. They were on their 
way back to their villages from Ia Knuec when they were detained by security police. The 
security police broke both men&#8217;s legs, both their hands and cracked their skulls. The 
security police then returned the remains to the families and ordered them to bury the 
corpses. They gave each of the families one 100 kg bag of rice and one million dong 
(corresponding to 66 USD). The security police also told the families: &#8220;If anyone of you 
reports this incident to the international community or to Kok Ksor [President of the 
Montagnard Foundation, Inc.], we will come and kill all of you.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>On 22 June 2008, <b>A Lat</b>, aged 61, and <b>A Brin</b>, aged 46, two men from Plei Kuk Gyer 
village, commune of An Thanh, Dak Bo district in Gialai province, were among a group of 
approximately 35 Degar Catholics trying to cross a lake in canoes to reach a sacred place 
near Ploi Hamong Katu village, as they would do twice a month. When they approached 
the other side of the lake security police ambushed them and began throwing heavy rocks 
at the canoes. A Lat and A Brin were hit by rocks on their heads, fell into the lake and 
drowned. The families wished to bury their dead at the sacred site, but the security forces 
forced them to carry the corpses back to their village for burial. 
</p>
<p>On 9 August 2008, <b>Y-Phit Kbuor</b> and his two sons encountered soldiers on the road back 
to their village Buon Tri after fishing at the river of Ea Kin about 20 km from the village. 
The soldiers stopped them and ordered them to raise their hands. However, while they 
were raising their hands, the soldiers opened fire at them. Y-Phit Kbuor died on the spot, 
while his two sons escaped and returned home to their village. Many villagers 
accompanied the family to pick up the corpse of Y-Phit Kbuor. At the site of the incident, 
they found the soldiers still there. The soldiers apologized, said that they had made a 
mistake, and paid the family ten million dong (approximately $660 USD) for the coffin 
and the cost of the burial ceremony. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to refer 
your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Viet Nam is a party, provides that every 
individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by 
law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). In particular, 
Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement officials only when 
strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 428 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention that your Government has a 
duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life. The Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions 
(Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/65 of 24 May 1989), though not in themselves 
binding law, provide an authoritative and convincing interpretation of the obligations descending 
from the right to life and Article 6 of the ICCPR in particular. Governments shall prohibit by law 
all extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions and shall ensure that any such executions are 
recognized as offences under their criminal laws, and are punishable by appropriate penalties 
which take into account the seriousness of such offences (Principle 1). There shall be thorough, 
prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary 
executions (Principle 9). Persons identified by the investigation as having participated in 
extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions in any territory under their jurisdiction shall be 
brought to justice (Principle 18). Superiors and other public officials may be held responsible for 
acts committed by officials under their authority if they had a reasonable opportunity to prevent 
such acts (Principle 19). 
</p>
<p> With regard to witnesses and family members of victims, Principle 15 of the Principles on 
the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions 
provides that complainants, witnesses, and their families shall be protected from violence and 
any other form of intimidation. Those potentially implicated in extra-legal executions shall be 
removed from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over complainants, 
witnesses and their families, as well as over those conducting investigations. Families of the 
deceased should be informed about the investigation, and the findings of the investigation should 
be made public (Principles 16 and 17). The families and dependents of victims of extra-legal, 
arbitrary or summary executions shall be entitled to fair and adequate compensation 
(Principle 20). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps 
to ensure the right of peaceful assembly as recognized in article 21 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;The right of peaceful assembly shall be 
recognized. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed 
in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of 
national security of public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or 
morals of the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, we would like to call the attention of your Government to the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people of 27 February 2007, in which he observed that &#8220;The criminalization of social protest, 
and the repression practiced by the security forces &#8230; are still regularly denounced by indigenous 
and civil society organizations&#8221; (A/HRC/4/32, para. 53). In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
recommended that &#8220;these people&#8217;s legitimate demands in respect of their legitimate rights should 
not be criminalized&#8221;. (para. 57). 
</p>
<p> In addition, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly on 
13 September 2007, and in particular to Article 2, which states that &#8220;Indigenous peoples and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 429 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>individuals are free and equal to all other peoples and individuals and have the right to be free 
from any kind of discrimination, in the exercise of their rights, in particular based on their 
indigenous origin or identity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations 
on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please share all information 
and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the investigations, and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the above killings. Please explain the steps 
taken to ensure that these investigations comply with the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and criminal 
prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the killing of <b>Y-Song Nie, Y-Huang Nie, Y-Cung Nie, A Lat, A Brin </b>and 
<b>Y-Phit Kbuor</b>. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants, 
witnesses and family members of the victims are not subject to any intimidation or retaliation, as 
provided in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions.

<p><b>Response from the Government of Viet Nam dated 29 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> In reply to your letter under the reference code AL G/SO 214 (67-14) G/SO 214 (33-24) 
Indigenous (2001-5) VNM 2/2008, dated 29 August 2008, I have the honour to convey to you 
the following information regarding the cases mentioned in your above said letters: 
</p>
<p>1. When receiving your above said letter, the professional agencies of Viet Nam carried out 
an investigation on the alleged cases mentioned in your letter. They found out that in Gia Lai 
province, there is no village named after Plei Kuk Gyer, no district named after Dak Bo, but 
there is a district named after Dak Po. They also found out that there were no men named after 
A Lat and A Brin who were drowned in a lake on 22 June 2008. They found a report saying that 
two persons were drowned on 25 June 2008. These two persons were Dinh Lak, born in 1948 
and Dinh Prin, born in 1961. They together with eight persons of ethnic minority are residing at 
Kuk Kon village, An Thanh commune, Dak Po district, Gia Lai Province. When hearing the 
news that Virgin Mary would appear at Dak Mon commune, Dak Ha district, Kon Tum province, 
they went to this place (Dak Mon commune) to participate in their religious activity on 
25 June 2008. On the way back, their boat was upturned, causing the drowned death of Dinh Lak 
and Dinh Prin. Therefore, the information mentioned in your letter that A Lat, aged 61 and 
A Brin, aged 46, from Plei Kuk Gyer village, An thanh commune, Dac Bo district, Gia Lai 
province, were drowned by the security forces, was untrue. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 430 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2. The results of the investigation showed that all alleged cases mentioned in your letter were 
wrong, thus causing great difficulties for and took the investigators mach time to verify the 
cases. Moreover, investigations of wrong cases waste a lot of resources while Viet Nam is still 
poor and needs scarce resources for her socio-economic development programmes in general and 
for the development of the ethnic communities in particular. 
</p>
<p> On this occasion, may I kindly request you and through you, request the Working Group 
on Communications to verify individual&#8217;s name and geographic name(s) of any case before 
sending to us to facilitate our investigation.

<p><b>Viet Nam:  Killing of Y-Ben Hdok and Mup

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response of the Government of Viet Nam with 
respect to the deaths of Y-Ben Hdok and Mup. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 16 October 2008</b>, sent with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief<b> 
</b></p>
<p> We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government information we 
have received concerning the alleged arbitrary killing of indigenous Christian Degar men, 
<b>Y-Ben Hdok</b> and <b>Mup</b>, by your Government&#8217;s security forces. In this connection, we would like 
to recall that on 29 August 2008, a communication was addressed to your Government regarding 
similar allegations of arbitrary killing of six Degar men. 
</p>
<p> According to the information recently received: 
</p>
<p>On 28 April 2008,<b> </b>Y-Ben Hdok, a Christian Degar man from Buon Dung village, 
commune of Cu Ebur, town of Buonmethuot in the province of Daklak, was invited to 
drink coffee by a friend, a police officer (his name is on record with the Special 
Rapporteurs). When Y-Ben Hdok arrived at the restaurant, eight security police (the 
Special Rapporteurs have been provided a list with their names) apprehended him, 
handcuffed him and took him to a secluded location. There they struck him repeatedly with 
their police batons and kicked, punched, and stomped on him until he fell down 
unconscious. The police officers then placed a rope around his neck, tied it to a police jeep 
and dragged him around until he was dead. Finally, the police took his corpse to the 
hospital and called his family, informing them that Y-Ben Hdok had committed suicide. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 431 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>When the corpse was brought to Y-Ben Hdok&#8217;s home, the police prevented the family 
from taking pictures. They also prevented relatives and friends from entering the house and 
viewing the body, which bore clearly visible marks of ill-treatment, including broken 
bones in both legs and arms. On 4 May 2008, the day of the burial, around 200 security 
police escorted the family to the burial grounds where numerous other security police were 
also stationed to prevent foreigners from interviewing the family and to prevent villagers 
from demonstrating. The security forces also warned the family and community not to 
report Y-Ben Hdok&#8217;s death to the Degar community in the United States. 
</p>
<p>Mup, a Christian preacher in Ploi Rong Khong village, district of Dak Doa, Gia Lai 
province, had been summoned three times by the security police to come to their 
headquarters to be heard on his religious activities. Because he feared the police, Mup had 
failed to follow these summonses. On 25 August 2008, Mup left his village to attend the 
funeral of a relative in Ploi Bla village. When he returned to his village that evening, Mup 
was approached by officials and spoke to them. This was the last time his fellow villagers 
saw him alive. In the morning of 26 August 2008, his lifeless body was found about 
100 meters from the village gate, bearing the traces of beating. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to refer 
your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a party, 
provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall 
be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). 
</p>
<p> When the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence 
of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In 
order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries 
sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 
of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions) into the causes and circumstances of death. This principle was reiterated 
by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that 
all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. 
 The Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions Persons further state that those identified by the investigation as having 
participated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be brought to justice 
(Principle 18). Superiors and other public officials may be held responsible for acts committed 
by officials under their authority if they had a reasonable opportunity to prevent such acts 
(Principle 19). 
</p>
<p> With regard to witnesses and family members of victims, Principle 15 provides that 
complainants, witnesses, and their families shall be protected from violence and any other form 
of intimidation. Those potentially implicated in extra-legal executions shall be removed from any 
position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over complainants, witnesses and their 
families, as well as over those conducting investigations. Families of the deceased should be </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 432 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>informed about the investigation, and the findings of the investigation should be made public 
(Principles 16 and 17). The families and dependents of victims of extra-legal, arbitrary or 
summary executions shall be entitled to fair and adequate compensation (Principle 20). 
</p>
<p> We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure the right to 
freedom of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and 
articles 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases 
to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations

prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as responsible 
commanders, for the killing of Y-Ben Hdok and Mup. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details of any measures taken to ensure that complainants,

<p><b>Response from the Government of Viet Nam dated 31 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p> With reference to your letter under the reference code AL G/SO 214 (56-20) G/SO 214 
(33-24) dated 16 October-2008 regarding alleged cases of arbitrary killing, I have the honour to 
convey to you the following reply: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Y-Ben H&#8217;Dok (other name is Ama Way) was born in 1979; native village: Buon Mbre 
Village, Hoa Phu Commune, Buon Ma Thuot Town; residence: Buon Dung Village, 
Cu Bur Commune, Buon Ma Thuot Town, Dac Lak Province. Due to his activities of 
law violation, on 28 April 2008, he was summoned by the Agency for Investigation of 
Buon Ma Thuot Town at the Police Headquarters of Tan An Wart. On 30 April 2008, 
according to a decision of the People&#8217;s Procuracy, the Agency for Investigation of 
Buon Ma Thuot Town provisionally detained him for investigation. He confessed that 
he had conducted activities of law violation. On 1 May 2008, he was found dead (he 
committed suicide by hanging with his shirt) in the detention house of Tan An Wart. 
The Police of Dak Lak Province in collaboration with other concerned agencies carried </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 433 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>out investigation of the scene, decided to send his dead body to the general hospital of 
Dak Lak Province for a post-mortem to find out reasons of his death, but his family did 
not agree with a post-mortem examination on his dead body. His family voluntarily 
wrote a paper of guarantee, pledging to take his dead body to his village for burial. 
Therefore, the reasons of his death could not be identified. In fact, the professional 
agencies of Viet Nam are facing with difficulties in sending a dead body for a 
post-mortem. The local people believe that a post-mortem breaks their traditional 
custom. They don&#8217;t want a dead body to be operated. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Mup was born in 1962, residing at Rkhuong Village, Kdang Commune, Dac Doa 
District, Gia Lai Province. On 26 August 2008, the People&#8217;s Committee of Kdang 
Commune invited him to its Office to identify his activities contrary to law provisions. 
When he finished his declaration he was allowed to go home. On 27 August he 
committed suicide by hanging in a garden behind his house. When his family member 
saw him, he was already died. Local people said that he had symptoms of mental 
disease. In the past, he committed suicide for many times, but he were discovered and 
timely cured. His family certified that he died because he committed suicide by hanging 
himself. His family asked for permission to bury his dead body, refused a post-mortem 
examination on his dead body and did not complain about his death. 
</p>
<p> Through the above information and clarification I hope that you have a better 
understanding about those two cases and see that the allegations mentioned in your letter are 
untrue, distorted. 
</p>
<p> May I take this opportunity to inform you that in Viet Nam the right of complainants and 
denunciators are guaranteed by laws. In fact, there is a strong legal framework to protect 
complainants and denunciators. Article 74 of the 1992 Constitution stipulates that citizens have 
the right to lodge with any competent State authority a complaint or denunciation regarding 
transgressions of the law by any State agencies, economic or social organisations, people&#8217;s 
armed force units or any individual; retaliation against complainants or denunciators is strictly 
prohibited. 
</p>
<p> Stipulations for dealing with wrong doings of individuals who take responsibility to settle 
complaints, denunciations and dealing with Heads of competent agencies, organisations that do 
not apply necessary measures to prevent wrong doings of his/her employees are provided in the 
following law provisions: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Article 132, 298, 299 and 309 of the Penal Code; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Section 1 of article 3-26-and-Section 1 of artic1e 335 of the 2003 Criminal Procedures 
Codes; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Paragraph 1 of Section 2, and Section 3 of Article 13, Section 6 of Article 66 and 
Section 1 of Article 399 of the Civil Procedures Code;

who have activities of intimidation, suppression or retaliation towards the complainants,

or denunciation. 
</p>
<p> Some following measures are applied by professional agencies (People&#8217;s Court, People&#8217;s 
Procuracy ...) to protect complainants and denunciators: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To friendly receive complainants and. denunciators, to dialogue with them to find out 
prompt solutions; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To guide the professional agencies at the lower levels to strengthen their cooperation in 
dealing with complaints, denunciations; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The People&#8217;s Procuracy in collaboration with the People&#8217;s, Court and other professional

<p><b>Yemen:  Death sentences of Ismail Lutef Huraish and  
Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 2 males 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Yemen has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 24 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p> I would like to draw the attention of your Government to information I have received 
concerning the situation of Mr. <b>Ismail Lutef Huraish</b>, a 49-year-old deaf man, and his cousin 
Mr. <b>Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish</b>, aged 39, who are reportedly at risk of imminent 
execution. They were sentenced to death in 2000 for a murder committed in 1998. The 
Supreme Court of Yemen upheld their death sentences in January 2004. 
</p>
<p> On 8 December 2005, I wrote to your Government and expressed concerns regarding the 
fairness of the proceedings in which they were sentenced to death. These concerns related to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 435 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>reports that the authorities did not provide Ismail Lutef Huraish access to sign-language 
interpretation and that the conviction of both men was based on statements made by 
Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish during police interrogation and during their trial. 
</p>
<p> Your Excellency&#8217;s Government replied twice to my urgent appeal. On 1 June 2006 your 
Government informed that the guilt of both defendants was established in a fair trial and that 
both of them were represented by a lawyer. As to communication with the deaf defendant, 
Ismail Lutef Huraish, your Government explained that he does in fact not communicate in the 
sign language of any community of deaf people, but in a sign language and can only be 
understood by his close friends and family members. The reply stated that &#8220;the two accused have 
been represented by a lawyer and that the statements of the deaf accused person have been 
translated by those of the second one&#8221;. A second letter by your Government of 2 July 2007 
informed that the case had been submitted for retrial to the first instance court. 
</p>
<p> I have now received reports that Ismail Lutef Huraish and Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad 
Huraish have exhausted all their appeals and that their death sentences were ratified by the 
President, which puts them at imminent risk of execution. 
</p>
<p> In addressing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government another urgent appeal regarding this case, 
I acknowledge the careful responses provided in 2006 and 2007. In my view, they highlight the 
great difficulty, if not impossibility, of providing a trial that fully lives up to international 
standards to a person in the situation of Ismail Lutef Huraish. I accept that reasonable steps 
might have been undertaken to convey to Ismail Lutef Huraish what was happening at the trial 
and to allow him to state his version of the facts and arguments in his defence. Due to his 
disability, however, these efforts will hardly have been sufficient to ensure the rigorous 
observation of all the guarantees for a fair trial, including the right to be informed of the charges 
against him, to have proceedings conducted in a language which he understands, and to 
&#8220;examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and 
examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him&#8221; 
(Article 14(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). 
</p>
<p> In the circumstances of this case, which clearly do not fit easily into the framework 
envisaged by the relevant international legal standards, I would attach the highest importance to 
the granting of clemency. In this respect, Article 6(4) of the Covenant expressly provides that 
&#8220;amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all cases.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights Council, to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. While I acknowledge that your Government has 
provided information responsive to the questions I put in my letter of 8 December 2005, I would 
still be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged above accurate?   
</p>
<p> 2. Please explain the grounds on which a re-trial was ordered in 2007.  
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide details of the circumstances in which Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad 
Huraish&#8217;s confessions were obtained. Did he repeat his previous confessions at the re-trial 
in 2007? </p>

<p> In both urgent appeals I urged your Excellency&#8217;s Government not to proceed with the 
executions on the ground that they would appear not to be compatible with your Government&#8217;s 
obligations under international law. Regrettably, your Government has not replied to either of 
my communications (your Excellency&#8217;s Government had replied twice, in 2006 and 2007, to a 
previous communication concerning the case of Ismail Lutef Huraish and Ali Mussara&#8217;a 
Muhammad Huraish). 
</p>
<p> In the meantime, I have received reports that Ismail Lutef Huraish and Ali Mussara&#8217;a 
Muhammad Huraish were executed on 29 October 2008. Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari was 
reportedly executed on 7 February 2009. 
</p>
<p> In carrying out my mandate as Special Rapporteur, I take no position either for or against 
the death penalty but act only when it seems clear that restrictions on the use of the death penalty 
enshrined in international law, applicable to countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty, might have been violated. This would appear to have been the case in the two cases at 
hand. 
</p>
<p> Ismail Lutef Huraish was a deaf man. Your Government explained that he did not 
communicate in the sign language of any community of deaf people, but in a sign language that 
could only be understood by his close friends and family members. At trial, his statements were 
translated by his co-accused, Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish. As I argued in my 
communication of 24 October 2008, your Government&#8217;s careful responses provided in 2006 and 
2007 highlighted the great difficulty, if not impossibility, of providing a trial that fully lives up to 
international standards to a person in the situation of Ismail Lutef Huraish. I accepted that 
reasonable steps might have been undertaken to convey to Ismail Lutef Huraish what was 
happening at the trial and to allow him to state his version of the facts and arguments in his 
defence. Due to his disability, however, these efforts will have been insufficient to ensure the 
rigorous observation of all the guarantees for a fair trial, including the right to be informed of the 
charges against him, to have proceedings conducted in a language which he understands, and to 
&#8220;examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and 
examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him&#8221; 
(Article 14(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). 
</p>
<p> Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari, a soldier, was reportedly found guilty of having 
unintentionally killed a fellow soldier and sentenced to death for this offence by a military court. 
As I explained in my letter, pursuant to Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Yemen is a party, &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. This means </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 437 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an 
intention to kill (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). If the reports that Mr. al-Ja&#8217;fari was found guilty of an 
unintentional killing were correct, the imposition of the death sentence in his case would not 
have been compatible with the obligations of your Government under international law. 
</p>
<p> It is my responsibility under the mandates provided to me by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on these cases to 
the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your observations on the following matters 
(which reiterate, in part, the unanswered questions in my previous communications): 
</p>
<p> 1. Is it accurate that Ismail Lutef Huraish and Ali Mussara&#8217;a Muhammad Huraish were 
executed on 29 October 2008, and that Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari was executed on 
7 February 2009? 
</p>
<p> 2. What was the finding of the courts with regard to the intentionality of the killing 
committed by Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please indicate which offences carry the death penalty in Yemen. 
</p>
<p><b>Yemen:  Death sentence of Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 male (soldier) 
<b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Yemen has failed to cooperate with 
the mandate that he has been given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 3 February 2009 
</b></p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
information I have received regarding the death sentence imposed against <b>Bashir Sultan 
Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari</b>, aged 23, a soldier in the Yemeni army. The execution is reportedly 
imminent and could take place as early as tomorrow, 4 February 2009. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>In August 2006, a military court found Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari guilty of having 
unintentionally killed a fellow soldier and sentenced him to pay diya (compensation) to the 
victim&#8217;s family. In November 2007, however, a military appeals court changed the 
sentence to death. The Military Division of the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence 
in March 2008. The death sentence was ratified by the President of Yemen in 
October 2008. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 438 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari is detained in the military prison in Sana&#8217;a. His 
execution was scheduled to be carried out on 28 January 2009 but was postponed for one 
week. It could now be carried out as early as tomorrow, 4 February 2009. 
</p>
<p> In this connection, I would like to recall that, although the death penalty is not prohibited 
under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental 
right to life, and must as such be applied in the most restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Yemen is a party, provides that 
&#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> As observed in a recent report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn 
from a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations 
bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can 
only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). 
</p>
<p> The information I have received in the present case suggests that the trial court found that 
Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari had not committed the killing of his fellow soldier 
intentionally. If that was correct, the imposition of the death sentence in this case would not be 
compatible with the obligations of your Government under international law, specifically 
Article 6(2) of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p> I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that 
Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari&#8217;s rights are respected. Considering the irremediable nature of 
capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the execution until the issue of intent has 
been clarified and, should it be confirmed that the courts had found that the killing was not 
intentional, commutation of the death sentence. In view of the urgency of the matter, I would 
appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard 
the rights of Bashir Sultan Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari in compliance with its international legal 
obligations. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report on 
these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? What was the 
finding of the courts with regard to the intentionality of the killing committed by Bashir Sultan 
Mohamed al-Ja&#8217;fari? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please indicate which offences carry the death penalty in Yemen.

unidentified persons who may be linked to the categories mentioned above and when the 
Government is failing to take appropriate protection measures; Deaths due to the attacks or

</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: Unknown 
<b>Character of reply</b>: Allegations rejected but without adequate substantiation 
<b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes the response of the Government of Zimbabwe with respect 
to the post-election violence. He looks forward to receiving from the government detailed 
information about investigations into the six alleged murders referred to by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 22 April 2008</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination 
in this context, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression 
</p>
<p> In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to information 
we have received regarding <b>reports of intimidation, violence and torture as a form of 
retribution or victimization in the aftermath of recent elections</b>. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Between 29 March and 14 April 2008, 160 cases of injury resulting from organized 
violence and torture have been treated by various doctors with many of the patients still 
remaining in hospital. One third of the patients were women. A fifth of the victims were 
members of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and another 20% </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 441 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>were involved in the elections for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). Nine 
patients sustained fractures (broken bones), reportedly typical of &#8220;defence injuries&#8221;, 
resulting from the victim raising his or her hands and arms to protect the face and upper 
body from assault. 
</p>
<p>At least two politically motivated murders, 15 abductions of women, 288 cases of homes 
destroyed through politically motivated arson subjecting 175 families and 14 persons to 
displacement, and 48 cases of assault took place during this period. The majority of 
persons displaced are said to be women and children. About 70 MDC members have been 
arrested in the last few days. 
</p>
<p>The above-described violence has been perpetrated by police officers, soldiers and 
members of the ruling Zanu PF party as part of a retributive and reprisal campaign mainly 
in rural areas, where people have voted for opposition candidates. In many instances 
victims were told that they were being victimized because they support the opposition; 
they were accused of &#8220;celebrating the MDC victory&#8221;,&#8221; of selling the country to the whites&#8221; 
and/or &#8220;of being responsible for the rigging of elections in favour of the MDC&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Reports also indicate that the authorities are targeting the independent local and foreign 
media, attempting to impede reporting on the current situation and the aftermath of the 
election, by resorting increasingly to police harassment and the arrest and detention of 
journalists; the deportation of one foreign journalist has been reported. 
In parallel, the State-controlled media is reportedly airing programmes and songs 
encouraging violence, such as &#8220;Mr Government&#8221; by Man Soul Jah, which celebrates the 
Government&#8217;s land seizures and calls for the decimation of perceived political sell-outs 
(the song says: &#8220;We are living like squatters in the land of our heritage... give me my spear 
so that I can kill the many sell-outs in my forefathers&#8217; country.&#8221;) and a well known song 
encouraging people to take up arms and fight for their freedom aired by ZTV. Moreover, 
reports have appeared that there are plans to entrust the distribution of food aid to the 
military in order to control the population through the politicization of food distribution. 
</p>
<p> While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we should like to 
appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances regarding the 
allegations above. We would like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the 
right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to recall that human rights law protects every individual&#8217;s inherent 
right to life and security (Article 6, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR); Article 3, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)). Article 6 of the ICCPR 
provides that the right to life and security shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. Your government has a due diligence obligation to protect 
the lives of persons within your territory and jurisdiction from attacks by other persons within 
your territory (<i>Jim&#233;nez Vaca v Colombia, </i>UN Human Rights Committee, 25 March 2002, 
paragraph 7.3). We would also like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention the duty to 
thoroughly, promptly and impartially investigate killings, and to prosecute and punish all </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 442 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to life. As reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in 
Resolution 2005/34, all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, and &#8220;to 
identify and bring to justice those responsible&#8221;. 
 We would also like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Commission on Human 
Rights resolutions 1993/77 and 2004/28 on forced evictions, which stated that &#8220;Forced evictions 
are a gross violation of human rights, in particular the right to adequate housing&#8221;, as well as to 
Commission resolution 2004/21 entitled &#8216;Adequate Housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living&#8217; which calls upon States to &#8220;protect all persons from forced 
evictions&#8230;. and to provide legal protection and redress for such forced evictions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> As your Excellency may be aware, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing has 
repeatedly drawn the attention of the International Community to the worrying practice of forced 
evictions worldwide. Forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of 
internationally recognized human rights and large-scale evictions can only be carried out under 
exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law. In view of 
this, the Special Rapporteur has recently developed a set of guidelines, presented in his most 
recent report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/4/48) aiming at assisting States in 
developing policies and legislation to prevent forced evictions at the domestic level. 
</p>
<p> We should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to 
secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of all persons, in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and reiterated in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which 
provides that &#8220; Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include 
freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, 
either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> We also deem it appropriate to make reference to Article 20 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights which provides that: 
</p>
<p> [&#8230;] 
</p>
<p>2. Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. 
</p>
<p> We wish to reiterate our understanding that, whilst recognizing the need to ensure a 
balance between efforts to combat racism, discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance, on the 
one hand, and ensuring the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, on the 
other hand, we consider harmful and dangerous all forms of expression which incite or otherwise 
promote racial hatred, discrimination, violence and intolerance. 
</p>
<p> We would also like to bring to Your Excellency&#8217;s attention Article 4 (c &amp; d) of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the 
responsibility of States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with 
national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by 
the State or by private persons. To this end, States should develop or have available penal, civil, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 443 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs 
caused to women who are subjected to violence. Women who are subjected to violence should 
be provided with access to the mechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national legislation, 
to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered. States should, moreover, 
inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, 
we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of all persons concerned by the violence described above are respected and 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your 
Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. 
</p>
<p> In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps 
taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the persons victimized for 
allegedly supporting the political opposition in compliance with the above international 
instruments. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Commission on 
Human Rights and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to 
our attention. Since we are expected to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we 
would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when 
relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. If no 
inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been or will be 
undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on any of the 
alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p> 5. Please indicate whether compensation has been or will be provided to the alleged 
victims or their families. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government of Zimbabwe dated 11 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p> The Government of Zimbabwe provided the following information. 
</p>
<p> It is indeed true that some isolated and localised cases of violence have occurred in the 
country during the post-election period, but nothing to the scale painted by the MDC-T in its 
current diplomatic and information offensive. There is overwhelming evidence which points 
to the fact that the MDC-T premeditated and planned this violence well ahead of the 
March 29th 2008 Harmonised Elections as part of its grand strategy aimed at inviting foreign 
intervention. Zimbabwe has been enduring vicious and sustained machinations from Britain </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
page 444 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>and her allies in pursuit of &#180;regime change&#180; since 2000, in reaction to the Land Reform 
Programme. This is the root of the present challenges in the country, including the political 
polarisation that is producing the current violence. Without this adversity, Zimbabwe has the 
political will and experience to resolve its own internal problems.  
</p>
<p><i>Contextual overview 
</i></p>
<p> It is unfortunate that the esteemed Rapporteurs have not proffered any immediately 
actionable specific information, such as names, dates, times and particular circumstances of each 
case as reported to them; this would have facilitated the work of concerned authorities and 
helped them in their research of the truth. In the past, MDC-T has made several false claims, in 
their objective to use the media and diplomatic circles, in order for the international community 
to maintain pressure on the Government of Zimbabwe, and not the welfare of the alleged 
victims. Thus, the statistic regarding the violence that occurred in the pre-election period and the 
Election Day are exaggerated and have been set out to mislead and stampeded the world into 
intervening in a situation that, by world standards, does not at all warrant the attention that it is 
being accorded. 
</p>
<p> Some revelations testified to the MDC-T&#8217;s clear mission of deceit. The MDC-T&#8217;s 
Transitional Strategy Document dated 15 march 2008 clearly testifies to premeditation and 
forward planning for a campaign of violence if things did not go according to the MDC-T&#8217;s plan 
in the March 29th Harmonised Elections. Several arrests made by the law enforcement agencies 
in connection to the above mentioned violence have confirmed the implication of organised units 
of the MDC-T&#8217;s. They attacked ZANU-PF supporters, notably in remote rural areas. The real 
motive behind the MDC&#8217;s forays that ferry its casualties in certain area is the convenience of the 
proximity of these suburban hospitals to the major western embassies. From there, it is easier to 
parade these &#8216;victims&#8217; of violence and &#8216;internally displaced people&#8217; to the media and selected 
western embassies. Unfortunately, western countries tend to believe these false allegations and to 
prejudge of Zimbabwe actions. Some NGO&#8217;s also do the same, when they don&#8217;t spread false 
information themselves. 
</p>
<p><i>Responses to specific questions raised 
</i> The Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe does not condone or espouse violence in all 
its forms, real or imagined, as a political tool. It pursues a policy of zero tolerance for violence, 
as many high ranking members of the Government and the Police repeatedly declared. Without 
dignifying the MDC-T&#8217;s litany of lies, Government submits that all cases that have been reported 
to the police are the subject of investigations as part of the due processes of the law. In 
Zimbabwe, as would be the case in all other democracies, a report by an aggrieved party or 
reasonable suspicion of a crime having been committed or about to be committed is a critical 
step in launching this due process of the law. Once reported, the ZRP would then exercise its 
mandate to arrest, open a docket, investigate and bring suspects before the courts of law for 
prosecution and, ultimately, judgement. Where no report has been made to the police, as appears 
to be the case regarding the 31 politically motivated murders claimed by the MDC-T as having 
occurred since 29th March 2008, the Police would find it impossible to take the initial steps to 
launch the due process described above, bearing in mind that at Zimbabwean law, a person is 
presumed innocent until proven guilty. </p>

</p>
<p> According to the ZRP records, ZNU-PF was accused of 6 murders, 17 malicious damage to 
property, 30 assaults, 4 kidnappings, 1 attempted murder, 2 threats of violence and 
1 intimidation. The MDC-T was accused of 2 murders, 34 malicious damage to property, 
29 assaults, 3 kidnappings, 3 attempted murder, 3 threats of violence, 6 other offences and 
1 public violence. The esteemed Commission would note that the 8 murders officially attributed 
to the two sides fall far below the 31 claimed by MDC-T. It is impossible to verify the MDC-T&#8217;s 
claims, particularly because it appears to be complaining to the press before reporting them to 
the police. Even then, of the 6 murders allegedly committed by ZANU-PF supporters, subject to 
ongoing investigations which may find otherwise, at least two do not seem to have been 
politically motivated. One of these was the case of Clemence Dube, who MDC-T&#8217;s 
Antony Chamisa claimed to have been murdered in Shurugwi by a ZANU-PF supporter on 
27 April 2008. According to established facts, however, Dube died of immuno-suppression and 
tuberculosis at Mpilo Hospital, Bulawayo, on 27 April 2008. Incidentally, on 11 April 2008, he 
had fought with a ZANU-PF supporter at a local township over money, but eye witnesses say the 
two later went their separate ways. In the other case, the alleged victim, a teacher in Muzarabani 
area, has turned out to be alive. He has actually denounced the MDC-T for using his name to 
justify &#180;dubious statistics&#180;. It seems, from these two cases alone, that the MDC-T is fabricating 
and exaggerating its tally of victims in order to give substance to its claims that there is a raging 
civil war in Zimbabwe. The same goes for all the statistics in the other categories of violence that 
it claims to have occurred. 
</p>
<p> Some of the alleged crimes in the MDC-T&#8217;s tally, such as politically motivated rape, are 
completely alien and unheard of in Zimbabwe&#8217;s political culture. The MDC-T is extrapolating 
these terms from foreign environments, to foist them upon the Zimbabwe situation simply 
because they resonate with their target audiences in the international community. Government 
finds absurd the concerns that have also been raised over the arrests of polling officials on 
suspicion of tampering with the ballots, because this is the rule of law at work. As a result of the 
ongoing investigations pertaining to Electoral Fraud, close to 100 arrests have been made. Time 
must be allowed for the law to take its course. Government would like to appeal to the 
international community, the esteemed Human Rights Council included, to avoid applying 
unusually intrusive oversight standards on Zimbabwe to a point where it becomes impossible to 
effectively police or defend the country. 
</p>
<p> Regarding questions of compensation for alleged victims which are also raised in the 
communication, Government submits that the victims are receiving the usual basic assistance 
from the Civil Protection Department and the resident humanitarian agencies in the country. 
However, contrary to the over 5000 &#180;IDPs&#180; that the MDC-T claims to have registered, the 
Government, with the support of non-partisan civil society, are attending to no more than 
100 households comprising 700 people. There are no new cases. Besides, it is still too early to 
start talking about long-term resettlement support at this stage when the problem is still being 
quantified, the victims screened and registered according to their needs. The Government also 
disregard allegations of hate propaganda. If anything, the MDC-T is the guilty when it comes to 
the use of hate language. </p>

<p><i>The human rights framework in Zimbabwe 
</i> Human rights and fundamental freedoms are enshrined in the Constitution of Zimbabwe. 
Zimbabwe has an independent Judiciary. It upholds the freedom of expression and association as 
demonstrated by the existence of a substantial private media and the practice of political 
pluralism. The State also ratified legal instruments regarding the rights of children and women. 
</p>
<p> The Government wishes to make it categorically clear that it has always discharged its 
sovereign constitutional mandate without fear or favour. There is no cataclysmic explosion of 
violence in Zimbabwe, there is no escalation, there is no war and whatever has happened is well 
within the Government&#8217;s resource capacity to handle and remedy without external assistance. No 
Zimbabwean want to go through another war; therefore, it urges the ZANU-PF not to instigate or 
execute a campaign of violence.

</p>
<p> In view of credible reports by numerous sources on the escalating level of violence in the 
wake of the second round of the presidential elections, we wish to express our strongest concern 
that the above mentioned cases appear to be part of a systematic and widespread campaign of 
violence against citizens seeking to express their democratic opinions and elect the Government 
of their choice. 
</p>
<p> In particular we wish to recall Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions which requires in unequivocal 
terms that a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; be undertaken. This principle was 
reiterated by the Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to 
conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this includes the obligation &#8220;to 
identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230; to grant adequate compensation within a 
reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including 
legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.1 
  page 449 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> We would also refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulating the absolute prohibition of torture. The Human 
Rights Committee has observed that it is the duty of the State &#8220;to afford everyone protection [&#8230;] 
against the acts prohibited by article 7, whether inflicted by people acting in their official 
capacity, outside their official capacity or in a private capacity&#8221; (General Comment 20/44, 
para. 2). The absence of a prompt, impartial and thorough investigation constitutes a violation of 
the victim&#8217;s right to an effective remedy as well as of the State&#8217;s positive obligation to fulfill the 
protection from torture. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we would like to urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with the principles 
set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 19 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have 
the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> We therefore urge your Government to initiate an inquiry into the circumstances 
surrounding the above mentioned cases and bring those responsible to justice. 
 It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights Council to 
seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention and to report on these cases to the Council. We 
would therefore be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following matters, 
when relevant to the case under consideration: 
</p>
<p> 1. Please indicate the nature of the relationship between your Government&#8217;s security 
forces and the activities of the Zanu PF members and representatives of the war veterans&#8217; 
organization who are alleged to have participated in the abovementioned incidents. 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigations and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to these cases. If no inquiries have taken place, 
or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 3. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details 
of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative 
sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p> 4. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the alleged victims. 
</p>
