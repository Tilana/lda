TRANSATLANTIC PETROLEUM CORP.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Unaudited
(Tabular amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars unless otherwise noted)
June 30, 2009
1. General
Nature of operations  
TransAtlantic Petroleum Corp. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “TransAtlantic”) is a vertically integrated 
international oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration for and the development and production of crude oil 
and natural gas in Morocco, Romania, Turkey and California. Approximately 56% of the Company’s outstanding common 
shares are beneficially owned by N. Malone Mitchell, 3rd. Mr. Mitchell is the Chairman of the Company’s board of directors.
TransAtlantic was incorporated in 1985 under the laws of British Columbia and continued to Alberta in 1997. In 2008, the 
Company changed its operating strategy from that of a prospect generator to a vertically integrated project developer.  
To execute this new strategy, the Company has:
1.
2.
3.
4.
acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Longe Energy Limited (“Longe”), in consideration for the 
issuance of 39,583,333 common shares of the Company and 10,000,000 common share purchase warrants (see Note 
4);
closed a concurrent 35,416,667 common share private placement pursuant to which Dalea Partners, LP (“Dalea”), 
an entity 100% owned by Mr. Mitchell and his wife, and others invested $42.5 million in the Company. Both the 
Longe acquisition and the private placement were approved by the Company’s shareholders and closed in December 
2008 (see Note 4);
acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Incremental Petroleum Limited (“Incremental”), an 
international oil and gas company that was publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (see Note 4); and
closed a Regulation S offering of common shares outside the United States and a concurrent Regulation D private 
placement inside the United States in which the Company sold an aggregate of 98,377,300 common shares at a price 
of Cdn$1.65 per common share, raising gross proceeds of approximately $147.6 million (see Note 10).
Basis of presentation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. Dollars and have been prepared by management in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). All amounts in these notes to the 
consolidated financial statements are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated. In preparing financial statements, management 
makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial 
statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, 
management reviews estimates, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, contingencies and 
income taxes. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these 
estimates.  
These unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of 
management, necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial position of the Company as at June 30, 2009 and for the 
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. Certain amounts for prior periods have been revised to reflect 
retrospective application of the successful efforts method of accounting. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2009 are 
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2009.  
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP 
have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in the Company’s 
registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2009.

2.
Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation  
The Company’s reporting standard for the presentation of its consolidated financial statements is U.S. GAAP. The consolidated 
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries. All significant inter-
company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include term deposits and investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of 
acquisition. The Company considers all highly-liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or 
less to be cash equivalents. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in cash and cash 
equivalents and marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date.
Derivative instruments  
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, 
requires derivative instruments to be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting 
for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on their intended use and resulting hedge designation. For 
derivative instruments designated as hedges, the changes in fair value are recorded in the balance sheet as a component of 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges 
are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair value measurements  
The Company follows SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which became effective for financial assets and 
liabilities of the Company on January 1, 2008 and non-financial assets and liabilities of the Company on January 1, 2009. This 
standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value 
measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but applies to assets and liabilities that are required 
to be recorded at fair value under other accounting standards. The impact to the Company from the adoption of SFAS 157 in 
2009 was not material.
Foreign currency translation  
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries in Morocco, Turkey, and 
Romania had changed from the U.S. Dollar to the Moroccan Dirham, Turkish New Lira, and the Romanian Ron, respectively. 
The Company has entered into contractual obligations and commitments that will result in increasingly significant levels of 
transactions conducted in these currencies. In recognition of these contractual obligations and commitments combined with the 
resulting increases in future revenues and expenditures in these countries, the Company determined the appropriate functional 
currency was the local currency for each of these subsidiaries.  
SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation, requires the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of a foreign operation to be 
measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation. Because the functional currency is now the local currency, 
translation adjustments will result from the process of translating subsidiary financial statements into the U.S. Dollar reporting 
currency. Translation adjustments will not be included in determining net income but will be reported separately and 
accumulated in the balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The accounting basis of 
the assets and liabilities affected by the change are adjusted to reflect the difference between the exchange rate when the asset or 
liability arose and the exchange rate on the date of the change. The change in functional currency will have no impact on the 
Company’s actual foreign-based revenues and expenditures in these countries.
Oil and gas properties  
In the first quarter of 2009, the Company changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development 
activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method. In accordance with SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes 
and Error Corrections (“SFAS 154”), financial information for prior periods has been revised to reflect retrospective application 
of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing 
Companies (“SFAS 19”)(see Note 3). Although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development 
activities continues to be an accepted alternative, the successful efforts method of accounting is the preferred method. The 
Company believes the successful efforts method provides a more transparent representation of its results of
7
operations and the ability to assess the Company’s investments in oil and gas properties for impairment based on their estimated 
fair values rather than being required to base valuation on prices and costs as of the balance sheet date.  
In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties, costs of productive wells, 
developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized into appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and 
geological similarities. These capitalized costs are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved 
reserves. Proceeds from sales of properties are credited to property costs, and a gain or loss is recognized when a significant 
portion of an amortization base is sold or abandoned.  
Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead, are charged to 
expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized but charged 
to exploration expense if and when the well is determined to be nonproductive. The determination of an exploratory well’s 
ability to produce must be made within one year from the completion of drilling activities. The acquisition costs of unproved 
acreage are initially capitalized and are carried at cost, net of accumulated impairment provisions, until such leases are 
transferred to proved properties or charged to exploration expense as impairments of unproved properties.
Drilling services and other equipment  
Drilling services and other equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives (ranging from 3 to 7 years) of the respective assets. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs are 
charged to expense as incurred. Material expenditures that increase the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the 
estimated remaining useful life of the asset. The cost of equipment sold, or otherwise disposed of, and the related accumulated 
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in current operations.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Oil and gas properties are evaluated by field for potential impairment. Other properties are evaluated for impairment on a 
specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets as applicable. An impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted 
future net cash flows of an asset are less than its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the carrying value of the impaired asset 
is reduced to fair value.
Joint interest activities  
Some of the Company’s exploration, development and production activities are conducted jointly with other entities and 
accordingly the consolidated financial statements reflect only the Company’s proportionate interest in such activities.

Asset retirement obligations  
The Company recognizes a liability for the present value of all legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible, long-
lived assets and capitalizes an equal amount as a cost of the asset. The cost associated with the abandonment obligation is 
included in the computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization. The liability accretes until the Company settles the 
obligation. The Company uses an adjusted risk-free interest rate in its calculation of asset retirement obligations.
8
Revenue recognition  
Revenue from the sale of products is recognized upon delivery to the purchaser when title passes. Drilling service revenues are 
recognized when the related service is performed.
Share-based compensation
The Company follows SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”), which requires the measurement 
and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including employee stock options, based on 
estimated fair values. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense on a 
straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period. SFAS 123R requires the Company to estimate the fair value of stock option 
awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-
Scholes Model”) as its method of valuation for share-based awards. The Company’s determination of fair value of share-based 
payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Model is affected by the Company’s stock price, as well as 
assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company’s expected 
stock price volatility over the term of the awards, as well as actual and projected exercise and forfeiture activity. The fair value 
of options granted to consultants, to the extent unvested, are determined on subsequent reporting dates.
Income taxes  
The Company follows the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (“SFAS 109”). 
Under this method of accounting for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax 
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and 
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable 
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the 
enactment date.  
Pursuant to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for 
Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”), the Company does not have any 
unrecognized tax benefits other than those for which a valuation allowance has been provided thereon. The Company does not 
believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months. The Company’s policy 
is that it recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The 
Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any tax-related 
interest expense recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2009 or 2008.
Comprehensive (gain) loss  
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income (“SFAS 130”), established standards for reporting and displaying 
comprehensive income and its components (revenue, expenses, gains and losses) in a full set of general-purpose financial 
statements. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on foreign currency 
translation as other comprehensive gain. There were no differences between net loss and comprehensive loss in 2008.
Business Combinations  
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (“SFAS 141R”), and SFAS No. 160, Non-
controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 141R requires most identifiable assets, 
liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at “fair value.” The 
statement applies to all business combinations, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract 
alone. Under SFAS 141R, all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Accordingly, 
transactions costs related to acquisitions are to be recorded as a reduction of earnings in the period they are incurred and costs 
related to issuing debt or equity securities that are related to the transaction will continue to be recognized in accordance with 
other applicable rules under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 141R is effective for periods beginning on or 
after December 15, 2008 and has been applied to the Incremental acquisition. SFAS 160 will require non-controlling interests 
(previously referred to as minority interests) to be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item 
outside of permanent equity. The statement applies to the accounting for non-controlling interests and transactions with non-
controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for periods beginning on or after 
December 15, 2008 and has been applied prospectively to the non-controlling interests from the Incremental acquisition.
Per share information  
Basic per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The Company 
uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of stock options and other dilutive instruments. Under the 
treasury stock method, only “in the money” dilutive instruments impact the diluted calculations in computing diluted earnings
per share. Diluted calculations reflect the weighted average incremental common shares that would be issued upon exercise of 
dilutive options assuming the proceeds would be used to repurchase shares at average market prices for the period.
Accounting changes and recent pronouncements 
Changes in accounting principles  
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development 
activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method. In accordance with SFAS 154, financial information for 
prior periods has been revised to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by SFAS 19. In 
accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties, costs of productive wells, developmental 
dry holes and productive leases are capitalized into appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological 
similarities. These capitalized costs are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved reserves. 
Proceeds from sales of properties are credited to property costs, and a gain or loss is recognized when a significant portion of an 
amortization base is sold or abandoned.

Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead, are charged to 
expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs, including the cost of stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized but charged 
to exploration expense if and when the well is determined to be nonproductive. The determination of an exploratory well’s 
ability to produce must be made within one year from the completion of drilling activities. The acquisition costs of unproved 
acreage are initially capitalized and are carried at cost, net of accumulated impairment provisions, until such leases are 
transferred to proved properties or charged to exploration expense as impairments of unproved properties.

Recent accounting pronouncements
In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (“SFAS 141R”), and SFAS No. 160, Non-controlling 
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 141R requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, non-
controlling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at “fair value.” The statement applies to all 
business combinations, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. Under SFAS 141R, 
all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method. SFAS 141R is effective for periods 
beginning on or after
11
December 15, 2008. Accordingly, deferred transactions costs related to acquisitions are to be recorded as a reduction of earnings 
in the period they are incurred and costs related to issuing debt or equity securities that are related to the transaction will 
continue to be recognized in accordance with other applicable U.S. GAAP rules. The Company adopted SFAS 141R as of 
January 1, 2009. SFAS 160 will require non-controlling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be treated as a 
separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity. The statement applies to the 
accounting for non-controlling interests and transactions with non-controlling interest holders in consolidated financial 
statements. SFAS 160 is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and has been applied prospectively to 
the non-controlling interests from the Incremental acquisition.  
In December 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted release no. 34-59192, Modernization of Oil and 
Gas Reporting, which revised the then-existing Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X oil and gas reporting requirements to align 
them with current industry practices and technological advances. The release revises a number of definitions relating to oil and 
gas reserves, permits the disclosure in filings with the SEC of probable and possible reserves and permits the use of new 
technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable 
conclusions about reserve volumes. In addition, the new disclosure requirements require a company to (i) disclose its internal 
control over reserves estimation and report the independence and qualification of its reserves preparer or auditor, (ii) file a report 
of a third party if the Company represents that the third party prepared reserves estimates or conducted a reserves audit, 
(iii) report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 12-month period rather than period-end prices, and 
(iv) disclose, in narrative form, the status of proved undeveloped reserves and changes in status of these from period to period. 
The provisions of this release will become effective for disclosures in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 2009. Management is still evaluating the impact of these changes on its financial statements.
The FASB issued SFAS 165, Subsequent Events (“SFAS 165”), on May 28, 2009. SFAS 165 establishes general standards of 
accounting for, and disclosure of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are 
available to be issued. Although there is new terminology, the standard is based on the same principles as those that currently 
exist in the auditing standards. The Company has adopted SFAS 165, which includes a new required disclosure of the date 
through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events, effective for the period ended June 30, 2009.  
The Company has reviewed other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if 
any, on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that 
none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations.
Acquisitions 
Incremental Petroleum  
On October 27, 2008, the Company announced its intention to make a cash takeover offer (the “Offer”) through TransAtlantic 
Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for all of the outstanding common shares of Incremental, an 
international oil and gas company that was publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Offer expired on March 6, 
2009. As of March 6, 2009, the Company owned common shares of Incremental, representing approximately 65.4% of 
Incremental’s outstanding common shares, and had received offers to acquire an additional approximately 11.6% of 
Incremental’s outstanding common shares. On March 20, 2009, the Company purchased 15,025,528 common shares of 
Incremental from Mr. Mitchell. The Company acquired these shares from Mr. Mitchell for cash at a price of AUD $1.085 per 
share, the same price per share and pursuant to the same terms as the shares acquired from Incremental’s other shareholders, 
none of whom had any relationship with the Company. Incremental was delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange on March 
26, 2009. At March 31, 2009, the Company had paid for and owned approximately 96% of the common shares of Incremental. 
On April 20, 2009, the Company paid for and completed the acquisition of the remaining 4% of Incremental’s common shares 
through an Australian statutory procedure. These shares were acquired at the same price per share as the previous share 
purchases. In addition, the Company agreed to purchase all of the outstanding options to acquire common shares of Incremental. 
On April 8, 2009, in exchange for the assignment of the Incremental options to the Company, the Company paid the Incremental 
option holders an aggregate of $721,000 in cash and issued them an aggregate of 101,585 common shares of the Company and 
829,960 common share purchase warrants of the Company. Each warrant is exercisable through April 2, 2012 and entitles the 
holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of $1.20 per share. The common shares and common 
share purchase warrants were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended. The acquisition of Incremental was accounted for as a business combination.

The fair value of the 101,585 common shares of the Company issued as part of the consideration paid in the 
Incremental acquisition was determined on the basis of the closing market price of the Company’s common shares 
on the acquisition date, or $0.70 per share. The fair value of the 829,960 warrants of the Company issued as part of 
the consideration paid in the Incremental acquisition was determined using the Black-Scholes Model using the 
following assumptions: strike price of $1.20 per share, expected life of three years based on management’s 
expectation that the warrants will not be exercised until near the end of the 36 month contractual term of the 
warrants, volatility of 40% based on a third party independent valuation of the warrants offered to the Incremental 
option holders, a 3.5% risk-free interest rate, and a forecasted dividend rate of 0% based on the Company’s historic 
dividends and future plans for paying dividends. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Model yielded a fair 
value of $0.25 per warrant.
Acquisition-Related Costs:
Included in general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009, of which $181,000 was incurred in 2008 and

Longe Energy  
On September 19, 2008, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding 
shares of Longe from Longfellow Energy, LP, an entity indirectly owned by Mr. Mitchell, his wife and children, and agreed to 
make a concurrent private placement of common shares of the Company. The transactions closed on December 30, 2008 (the 
“Closing Date”). At the time of closing, Longe was an exploration stage company whose activity through the Closing Date had 
been to acquire oilfield service equipment and exploration licenses in Morocco. Longe, a private Bermuda limited company, was 
incorporated on April 14, 2008 and became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on December 30, 2008. 
Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Longe in 
consideration for the issuance of 39,583,333 common shares of the Company and 10,000,000 common share purchase warrants. 
Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of $3.00 per share through 
December 30, 2011. Concurrently with the acquisition, the Company issued 35,416,667 common shares at a price of $1.20 per 
share in a private
14
placement with Dalea, Riata TransAtlantic, LLC (“Riata TransAtlantic”), Matthew McCann, at the time a director of the 
Company, and other purchasers with business or familial relationships with Mr. Mitchell, resulting in gross proceeds of $42.5 
million to the Company. Mr. Mitchell manages Riata TransAtlantic.

warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes Model with the following assumptions: stock price of $0.71; volatility of 
169%; dividend rate of 0%; risk-free interest rate of 1.67%; and term of three years.

Restricted cash
Restricted cash represents cash placed in escrow accounts or in certificates of deposit that are pledged for the satisfaction of 
liabilities or performance guarantees. At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, restricted cash included: $240,000 for 
settlement of liabilities in Nigeria; $3.0 million in certificates of deposit supporting a $3.0 million bank guarantee of the 
Company’s Morocco work program (see Note 14) and $28,000 in a certificate of deposit that is a collateral for a letter of credit 
in favor of the Oklahoma Tax Commission. In March 2009, a $1.5 million certificate of deposit was pledged to support a bank 
guarantee for oilfield services in Morocco and Turkey.
Discontinued operations held for sale
In 2007, the Company designated certain oil and gas properties as held for sale in conjunction with its plan to sell its proved and 
undeveloped interests in the United States, primarily in Texas. In November 2007, the Company sold its South Gillock and State 
Kohfeldt Units, as well as the shallow rights over the South Gillock Unit, for $4.0 million, and the buyer assumed an estimated 
$2.0 million in plugging and abandonment liability associated with the units. In addition, the Company sold its Jarvis Dome 
property in October 2007 for $250,000. One property in Oklahoma remained during 2008, the operations of which were reported 
as discontinued. In connection with the acquisition of Incremental, the Company acquired interests in non-operated properties in 
California. As a result of acquiring these properties in California, previously reported U.S. discontinued operations are now 
continuing and the results of operations in 2008 previously reported as discontinued have been reclassified to operating 
revenues, costs and expenses.

Uncertainties affect the recoverability of these costs as the recovery of the costs outlined above are dependent upon the 
Company obtaining government approvals, obtaining and maintaining licenses in good standing and achieving commercial 
production or sale.

At June 30, 2009, $29.0 million (December 31, 2008-$40.0 million) in drilling services and other equipment was excluded from 
depreciation as the equipment had not yet been placed in service.
Asset retirement obligations
As part of its development of oil and gas properties, the Company incurs asset retirement obligations (“ARO”). The Company’s 
ARO results from its responsibility to abandon and reclaim its net share of all working interest properties. At June 30, 2009, the 
net present value of the Company’s total ARO is estimated to be $6.9 million, with the undiscounted value being $14.2 million. 
Total ARO for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 shown in the table below consists of provisional amounts for future plugging and 
abandonment liabilities on the Company’s developed wellbores as of June 30, 2009, based on a third-party estimate of such 
costs, adjusted for historic Turkish inflation rates ranging from approximately 7% to 11% per annum, and discounted to present 
value using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of 6.0% per annum.

On November 28, 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Dalea. The purpose of the 
Credit Agreement was to fund the cash takeover offer by TransAtlantic Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
Company (“TransAtlantic Australia”), for all of the outstanding shares of Incremental (see Notes 4 and 15).
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, as amended, until June 30, 2009, the Company could request advances from Dalea of (i) up to 
$62,000,000 for the sole purpose of purchasing Incremental common shares in connection with the Offer, plus related 
transaction costs and expenses; and (ii) up to $14,000,000 for general corporate purposes. Advances under the Credit Agreement 
related to the Incremental acquisition were
16
denominated in U.S. Dollars, but were advanced in Australian Dollars at an agreed upon currency exchange rate of AUD $1.00 
to US $0.7024. Advances under the Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes were denominated and advanced in U.S. 
Dollars.
The aggregate unpaid principal balance, together with all accrued but unpaid interest was immediately due and payable by the 
Company upon the earliest of (i) April 20, 2010; (ii) the date of any change in ownership of or control or direction over, directly 
or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Company; and (iii) the occurrence of an event of default.
The total outstanding balance of the advances made under the Credit Agreement accrued interest at a rate of ten percent 
(10%) per annum, calculated daily and compounded quarterly. Interest was payable by the Company on the first day of each 
March, June, September, and December during the term of the loan. Following an event of default, the outstanding balance 
would accrue additional interest at a rate of four percent (4%) per annum until the event of default was cured or waived. The 
Company could prepay the loan at any time before maturity without penalty.  
The Credit Agreement was secured by all of the personal property or assets of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, 
TransAtlantic (Holdings) Australia Pty. Ltd., including all of the ordinary shares in the capital of TransAtlantic Australia.  
There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2008. The Company borrowed an 
aggregate of $64.6 million under the Credit Agreement and paid $2.0 million in interest during the first six months of 2009. The 
loan was repaid in full on June 23, 2009, at which time the Credit Agreement was terminated.  
On July 5, 2007, Petroleum Exploration Mediterranean International Pty. Ltd. (“PEMI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Incremental, entered into a general credit agreement (the “PEMI Credit Agreement”) with Turkiye Garanti Bankasi. PEMI 
borrowed $5.5 million under the PEMI Credit Agreement in order to fund drilling and development activity in the Selmo oil 
field. The loan bears interest at a rate of 7.6% per annum, and all outstanding principal and interest under the PEMI Credit 
Agreement is due August 6, 2010. As of June 30, 2009, $3.3 million in principal is outstanding under the PEMI Credit 
Agreement, of which $2.8 million is short-term.

10. Common shares
June 2009 share issuance
On June 22, 2009, the Company closed a Regulation S offering of common shares outside the United States and a concurrent 
Regulation D private placement inside the United States. In the aggregate, the Company sold 98,377,300 common shares at a 
price of Cdn$1.65 per common share, raising gross proceeds of approximately $143.1 million. Of the 98,377,300 common 
shares sold, 41,818,000 common shares were sold to Dalea. In connection with these offerings, the Company entered into a 
registration rights agreement providing for the registration of up to 98,377,300 common shares issued in these offerings (the 
“Registrable Securities”). Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, on July 20, 2009, the Company filed a registration 
statement on Form S-1 registering the resale of 55,544,300 common shares. If this registration statement is not declared 
effective by October 1, 2009, the Company is required to pay to the holders of the Registrable Securities (other than Dalea) 
liquidated damages in cash equal to 1% of the purchase price of the Registrable Securities held by the holders on October 1, 
2009, with an additional 1% if the registration statement is not declared effective by October 31, 2009, and a further 1% if the 
registration statement is not declared effective by November 30, 2009. If the Company does not pay the liquidated damages 
amount in full within seven calendar days after the date payable, interest would accrue on the unpaid amount until paid in full at 
the rate of 12% per annum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Dalea, an entity controlled by the Company’s 
chairman, Mr. Mitchell, be entitled to receive any liquidated damages under the registration rights agreement.
17
Equity issued in connection with the Incremental acquisition
In April 2009, the Company issued 101,585 common shares of the Company and 829,960 warrants to purchase the Company’s 
common shares at an exercise price of $1.20 per share through April 2, 2012 to retire share-based payment arrangements of 
Incremental (see Note 4).
December 2008 private placement and Longe acquisition  
In December 2008, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Longe from Longfellow in 
consideration for the issuance of 39,583,333 common shares of the Company valued at $0.71 per share, and 10,000,000 
common share purchase warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise 
price of $3.00 per share through December 30, 2011. Concurrently, the Company issued 35,416,667 common shares at a price of 
$1.20 per share in a private placement with Dalea, Riata TransAtlantic, Mr. McCann and other purchasers with business or 
familial relationships with Mr. Mitchell, resulting in gross proceeds of $42.5 million. Mr. Mitchell manages Riata TransAtlantic. 
Mr. McCann currently serves as the chief executive officer and a director of the Company and, at the time of the private 
placement, was a director of the Company. The Company recorded $1.1 million in transaction costs for the Longe acquisition 
and the concurrent private placement.
April and May 2008 private placement  
In April and May 2008, the Company issued 10,000,000 common shares and 25,000,000 common shares, respectively, to Riata 
TransAtlantic, Dalea, Mr. McCann and certain friends and family of Mr. Mitchell in connection with a two-stage private 
placement transaction announced in March 2008. The private placements resulted in gross proceeds of Cdn $12.0 million.
Restricted stock units  
On February 9, 2009, the Company’s board of directors approved the TransAtlantic Petroleum Corp. 2009 Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), pursuant to which the Company can award restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or other share-based 
compensation to certain of its directors, officers, employees and consultants. In addition, on February 9, 2009, the Company’s 
board of directors approved awards of RSUs to certain directors, officers, employees and consultants. The Incentive Plan was 
approved at the Company’s annual and special meeting of shareholders on June 16, 2009. Share-based compensation expense of 
$423,000 with respect to RSU awards was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2009.  
Under the Incentive Plan, RSUs vest over specified periods of time ranging from immediately to four years. RSUs are deemed 
full value awards and their value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common shares on the grant date. SFAS 123R 
requires that the Incentive Plan be approved in order to establish a grant date. Under SFAS 123R, the approval date for the 
Incentive Plan was February 9, 2009, the date the board of directors approved the Incentive Plan.
Each RSU is equal in value to one common share of the Company on the grant date. Upon vesting, an employee is entitled to a 
number of common shares of the Company equal to the number of vested RSUs. The RSU awards can only be settled in 
common shares. As a result, RSUs are classified as equity. At the grant date, the Company makes an estimate of the forfeitures 
expected to occur during the vesting period and adjusts its compensation cost accordingly. The current forfeiture rate is 
estimated to be 10%. The following table sets forth restricted stock unit activity for the six months ended June 30, 2009:

As of June 30, 2009, the Company had approximately $764,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 
RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.
Stock option plan
The Company’s Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plan”) was terminated on June 16, 2009. All 
outstanding awards issued under the Option Plan will remain in full force and effect. All options presently issued under the 
Option Plan have a five-year term.
18
Under the Black-Scholes Model, the fair value of all outstanding options under the Option Plan is calculated at approximately 
$128,000 and $346,000 recognized as share-based compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, 
respectively. At June 30, 2009, the unamortized amount of share-based compensation expense was $69,000, which is expected 
to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than one year. The following table sets forth stock option activity for the

12. Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities were each estimated to have a fair value 
approximating the carrying amount due to the short maturity of those instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of its fixed rate note and its variable rate short-term cash holdings. 
Interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of the Company’s fixed rate debt due to differences 
between the current market interest rates and the rates governing this note.
Foreign currency risk  
The Company has underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposure. The Company’s currency exposures relate to 
transactions denominated in the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, European Union Euro, Romanian Ron, 
Moroccan Dirham and Turkish New Lira. Foreign currency forward contracts have not been used to manage exchange rate 
fluctuations. The Company agreed to a fixed currency exchange rate of AUD $1.00 to US $0.7024 in the Credit Agreement with 
Dalea (see Note 9). During the three months ended June 30, 2009, the loan was repaid in its entirety and the Credit Agreement 
was terminated. The resulting realized exchange loss was $4.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. In June 2009, the 
Company sold 98,377,300 common shares, raising gross proceeds of approximately $143.1 million. At June 30, 2009, the 
Company had Cdn $77.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, which exposes the Company to exchange rate risk based on 
fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar.
Concentration of credit risk
The majority of the Company’s receivables are within the oil and gas industry, primarily from its industry partners and from 
government agencies. Included in receivables are amounts due from the national oil company of Turkey, which purchases all of 
the Company’s oil production in Turkey. The receivables are not collateralized. To date, the Company has experienced minimal 
bad debts, and has no allowance for doubtful accounts. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by 
three financial institutions in the U.S. and Turkey.
Commodity price risk
Realized pricing of the Company’s oil and gas production in Turkey and the U.S. is primarily driven by the prevailing 
worldwide price of oil, subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual product sold. Historically, oil and gas prices have 
been volatile and unpredictable. Price volatility relating to the Company’s production is expected to continue in the foreseeable 
future. The Company does not currently engage in any hedging activities to protect itself against market risks associated with oil 
and gas price fluctuations, although the Company may elect to do so in the future.
13. Contingent liabilities
Incremental has been involved in litigation with persons who claim ownership of a portion of the surface at the Selmo field in 
Turkey. These cases are being vigorously defended by Incremental and Turkish government authorities. The Company does not 
have enough information to estimate the value of the purported surface owners’ claims.
14. Commitments and contingencies
The Company has remaining work program commitments of $2.0 million under its Guercif exploration permits and $1.0 million 
under its Tselfat exploration permit in Morocco that are supported by fully-funded bank guarantees. The bank guarantees are 
reduced periodically based on work performed. In the event the Company fails to perform the required work commitments, the 
remaining amount of the bank guarantees would be forfeited.
On March 3, 2009, the Company amended the lease for its Dallas, Texas office space extending the term to December 31, 2013. 
The Company has entered into three-year leases for two offices and an apartment, along with one-year leases for an apartment 
and an operations yard in Morocco as well as one-year leases for an office and apartment in Romania. The Company has entered 
into a five-year lease for an operations yard and a one-year lease for apartments and office space at a hotel in Turkey. The 
Company’s aggregate annual commitments as of June 30, 2009 are as follows:

Normal purchase arrangements are excluded from the table as they are discretionary and/or being performed under contracts 
which are cancelable immediately or with a 30-day notification period.  
The Company’s commitments under its permits and contracts require the Company to complete certain work projects on the 
relevant permit or license within a specified period of time. The Company’s current commitments under its permits and 
contracts are due in 2009 and 2010. If the Company fails to complete a work project by the specified deadline, the Company 
would lose its rights in such license or permit, and in the case of the Tselfat and Guercif permits, any remaining amount of the 
bank guarantees would be forfeited.  
The Company’s commitments for permits as of June 30, 2009 included commitments to:
Drill one well on the Tselfat permit in Morocco;  
  Drill one well on one of the Guercif permits in Morocco;
Drill one well on the Vanatori permit in Romania; 
  Drill one well on the Marsa permit in Romania;  
  Drill three wells on the Izvoru permit in Romania; and 
  Conduct miscellaneous exploratory activities on several of the Company’s Turkish licenses.

Effective May 1, 2008, the Company entered into a service agreement, as amended (the “Service Agreement”), with 
Longfellow, Viking Drilling, LLC, Longe, MedOil Supply, LLC and Riata Management, LLC (“Riata”). Mr. Mitchell and his 
wife own 100% of Riata. In addition, Mr. Mitchell, his wife and children indirectly own 100% of Longfellow. Prior to the 
Company’s acquisition of Longe, Longe was owned 100% by Longfellow. Riata owns 100% of MedOil Supply, LLC. Dalea 
owns 85% of Viking Drilling, LLC. Under the terms of the Service Agreement, the Company pays, or is paid, for the actual cost 
of the services rendered plus the actual cost of reasonable expenses on a monthly basis. The Company recorded expenditures for 
the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 of $2.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for goods and services provided to 
the Company under the Service Agreement, of which $5.3 million was payable at June 30, 2009. The Company recorded 
expenditures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 of $13,000 for goods and services provided to the Company 
under the Service Agreement. Payables in the amount of $1.1 million due under the Service Agreement at March 31, 2009 were 
settled in cash during the second quarter of 2009. There were no amounts payable to the Company under the Service Agreement 
as of June 30, 2009.  
On November 28, 2008, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with Dalea. The purpose of the Credit Agreement was 
to fund the Offer for Incremental. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, as amended, until June 30, 2009, the Company could 
request advances from Dalea of (i) up to $62,000,000 for the sole purpose of purchasing Incremental common shares in

On March 20, 2009, TransAtlantic Australia purchased 15,025,528 common shares of Incremental from Mr. Mitchell. The 
Company acquired these shares from Mr. Mitchell for cash at a price of AUD $1.085 per share, the same price per share and 
pursuant to the same terms as the shares acquired from Incremental’s other shareholders, none of whom had any relationship 
with the Company. Mr. Mitchell had purchased the Incremental shares between October 27, 2008 and December 23, 2008 at an 
average price of AUD $0.99 per share.  
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company’s subsidiary, TransAtlantic Turkey, Ltd. (“TransAtlantic Turkey”), entered into a lease 
agreement under which it leases rooms, flats and office space at a resort hotel owned by a Turkish company controlled by 
Mr. Mitchell. Under the lease agreement, TransAtlantic Turkey pays the Turkish New Lira equivalent of $5,000 per month base 
rent and up to 45,000 Turkish New Lira per month (approximately $26,000 per month) in operating expense reimbursement. 
The lease agreement has a one-year term. The amounts paid under the lease agreement are included in amounts paid under the 
Service Agreement.
16. Subsequent events

Energy Operations Turkey Acquisition  
On July 23, 2009, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, TransAtlantic Worldwide Ltd., acquired all of the ownership 
interests in Energy Operations Turkey, LLC (“EOT”) for total consideration of $7.8 million. EOT’s assets include a 50% 
interest in License 3118 in southeastern Turkey, interests in ten other exploration licenses in southern and southeastern Turkey, 
inventory and seismic data. In connection with the purchase of EOT, TransAtlantic Worldwide Ltd. entered into a promissory 
note with the sellers in the amount of $1.5 million due July 23, 2010. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3% per annum.
Rig Purchase  
On July 27, 2009, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Viking International Limited (“Viking International”), purchased a 
drilling rig and associated equipment from Viking Drilling, LLC (“Viking Drilling”). Dalea owns 85% of Viking Drilling. 
Viking International paid $1.5 million in cash for the drilling rig and entered into a note to Viking Drilling in the amount of $5.9 
million. The note is due and payable on August 1, 2010, bears interest at a fixed rate of 10% per annum and is secured by the 
drilling rig and associated equipment. Interest under the note is payable quarterly on November 1, 2009, February 1, 
2010, May 1, 2010 and August 1, 2010.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Item 2.
Executive Overview and Recent Developments
We are a vertically integrated, international oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and
production of crude oil and natural gas. We hold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties in Turkey, Morocco, 
Romania, and California. In addition, we plan to provide oilfield services and contract drilling services in Morocco and Turkey.
Strategic Transformation. We underwent a strategic transformation during 2008 as a result of a series of transactions with N.
rd
Malone Mitchell, 3 , chairman of our board of directors. Mr. Mitchell founded Riata Energy, Inc. in 1985 and built it into one of the 
largest privately held oil and gas producers in the United States. In 2006, Mr. Mitchell sold his controlling interest in Riata Energy, 
Inc. (now Sandridge Energy, Inc.) and founded a group of companies that are primarily focused on investing in international energy 
opportunities.
In March 2008, we announced that we had entered into a strategic relationship with Riata Management, LLC (“Riata”), an entity
owned by Mr. Mitchell and his wife. Our initial arrangements with Riata included an equity investment into us, the replacement of 
our farm-in partner in both of our Moroccan properties, the extension of a short term credit facility to us to repay our outstanding 
short-term debt, and the provision of technical and management expertise to assist us in successfully developing and expanding our 
international portfolio of projects.
During the second quarter of 2008, we completed a two-stage private placement issuing 35,000,000 common shares to Riata
TransAtlantic, LLC (“Riata TransAtlantic”), Dalea Partners, LP (“Dalea”) and certain friends and family of Mr. Mitchell, for 
aggregate gross proceeds of Cdn$12 million. Mr. Mitchell is a manager of and has sole voting and dispositive power over the 
common shares held by Riata TransAtlantic, and Mr. Mitchell also owns and controls Dalea. We used the net proceeds to pay off all 
of our short-term debt, to fund international exploration activities and for general corporate purposes. Longe Energy Limited 
(“Longe”), an entity that was indirectly owned by Mr. Mitchell, his wife and children, replaced our prior farm-in partner in our 
Moroccan properties. In addition, Mr. Mitchell and Matthew McCann, general counsel for Riata, were designated by Riata and 
elected to our board of directors in connection with the private placement. Mr. Mitchell serves as chairman of our board of directors, 
and Mr. McCann also serves as our chief executive officer.
In the third quarter of 2008, we changed our operating strategy from a prospect generator to a vertically integrated project
developer. To execute this new strategy, in December 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Longe from 
Longfellow Energy, LP (“Longfellow”), an entity indirectly owned by Mr. Mitchell, his wife and children, in consideration for the 
issuance of 39,583,333 common shares and 10,000,000 common share purchase warrants. Concurrently, we issued 35,416,667 
common shares in a private placement with Dalea, Mr. McCann and other purchasers that have business or familial relationships with 
Mr. Mitchell, for gross proceeds of $42.5 million. Longe owns interests in our Moroccan properties and four drilling rigs, as well as 
associated service equipment, tubulars and supplies. Immediately after the Longe acquisition, we purchased at cost an additional $8.3 
million in drilling and service equipment, tubulars and supplies from Viking Drilling, LLC, an entity in which Dalea owns 85%.
We anticipate that ownership of our own drilling rigs and service equipment will enable us to lower drilling and operating costs 
over the long term and control timing for development of our properties, thereby providing a competitive advantage. In addition, we 
expect that ownership of the drilling rigs will allow us to achieve operational capabilities in each country in which we operate. 
Because the availability of drilling rigs and service equipment is limited in Turkey, Morocco and Romania, we also anticipate that the 
Longe acquisition will create opportunities to increase acreage in each country in which we operate by drilling to earn interests in 
existing third party licenses. When the rigs and equipment are not operating on our properties, we expect to use them to provide 
drilling and oilfield services to third parties, creating additional opportunities.
Incremental Acquisition. In the first quarter of 2009, we acquired Incremental Petroleum Limited (“Incremental”) through our 
wholly-owned subsidiary, TransAtlantic Australia Pty. Ltd. (“TransAtlantic Australia”). We announced our intention to make an all 
cash takeover offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Incremental in the fourth quarter of 2008. The offer expired on March 6, 
2009 and Incremental delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange on March 26, 2009. At March 31, 2009, we owned approximately 
96% of Incremental’s outstanding common shares. We completed the acquisition of the remaining 4% of Incremental’s outstanding 
common shares through an Australian statutory procedure on April 20, 2009. The acquisition of Incremental expanded our rig fleet 
and increased our workforce of highly qualified field staff, engineers and geologists in Turkey, one of our target countries.
27
Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired a 100% working interest in the Selmo oil field (“Selmo”) in southeastern
Turkey. Situated on the northern edge of the Zagros fold belt of Iran and Iraq in southeast Turkey, Selmo has produced approximately 
83 million barrels of oil to date from a total of 47 wells, 23 of which are still active. During the second quarter of 2009, the Selmo 
field produced 143,735 barrels of crude oil at an average rate of 1,580 barrels per day.
In addition, through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired a 55% working interest in the Edirne gas field located in the
Thrace Basin in northeastern Turkey. We expect our initial eight wells in the Edirne field to come online in the fourth quarter of 2009 
with net production to us exceeding 5.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. In addition to the existing wells, we have identified 
numerous additional prospects in the Edirne field that may add to future gas production.
Incremental’s other Turkish properties include a 100% working interest in License 4262, covering 2,805 acres in southeastern
Turkey, a 100% working interest in four exploration licenses in Midyat in southeastern Turkey covering approximately 460,400 acres 
and a 50% working interest in eight exploration licenses in the Tuz Gulu basin in central Turkey covering approximately 870,000 
acres.
Through the Incremental acquisition, we acquired interests in three projects in the San Joaquin Valley in central California. We 
own a non-operated working interest in the Kettleman Middle Dome Unit. This unit produces approximately 125 gross barrels of oil 
per day along with small amounts of associated natural gas. We own a 5% interest in five existing wells on the Kettleman Middle 
Dome Unit (three are currently producing). On all new projects and well proposals submitted and completed after May 16, 2008, we 
will own a 10% non-operated working interest. In addition, we drilled two wells in March and April 2009, paying 100% of the cost to 
earn a 50% interest in the McFlurrey natural gas project. We are currently testing and completing the two McFlurrey wells. We also 
own a 50% interest in the South East Kettleman North Dome oil field.
Drilling and Exploration Activity. In Turkey, we recently drilled the Atesler well on License 4262 (100% interest) to a depth of
10,851 feet (3,308 meters). We have moved a smaller rig to the location and commenced testing of the Atesler well in early August 
2009. We drilled the Kirmizihoyuk-1 well and the Kusey Ikihoyuk-1 well on the Edirne license (55% interest) in the Thrace Basin 
and successfully tested two other wells on the Edirne license. We have commenced drilling the S-54 well in the Selmo field to a 
targeted depth of 6,500 feet (1,981 meters). In addition, we plan to drill up to four additional wells at Selmo and up to three additional 
wells at the Thrace Basin during the remainder of 2009.
In Morocco, we are currently drilling two wells. The OZW-1 well is being drilled at our cost to a targeted depth of at least 8,200 
feet (2,500 meters) and up to 14,435 feet (4,400 meters) on the Ouezzane-Tissa exploration permit (50% interest). The HR-33bis well 
is now being drilled to a targeted depth of 4,921 feet (1,500 meters) in the Haricha field on the Tselfat exploration permit (100% 
interest). We conducted a 2D seismic survey in late 2008 and acquired 200 kilometers of 2D seismic over the Asilah permits (50% 
interest), and we are now acquiring an additional approximately 90 kilometers of 2D seismic on the Asilah permits.
In Romania, we recently completed drilling the Delta and Beta wells on the Izvoru license (100% interest). We plan to drill two 
other wells, one on the Vanatori license (100% interest) and one on the Marsa license (100% interest) in the third quarter of 2009. We 
will test and complete these four wells with a different rig once they have all been drilled. We then plan to drill three wells at our cost 
each to a total depth of approximately 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) on the Sud Craiova license (50% interest).
In California, we drilled two wells on the McFlurrey natural gas prospect (50% interest) to a depth of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters)
in March and April 2009. We are now testing and completing these two wells.
With the exception of the wells in Romania and California, we conducted all of our 2009 drilling activities using our own rigs.
Sale of Common Shares. On June 22, 2009, we closed a Regulation S offering of common shares outside the United States and a 
concurrent Regulation D private placement of common shares inside the United States. In the aggregate, we sold 98,377,300 common 
shares at a price of Cdn$1.65 per common share, raising gross proceeds of approximately $143.1 million. Of the 98,377,300 common 
shares sold, 41,818,000 common shares were offered and sold by us to Dalea. We used $61.8 million of the net proceeds towards 
paying off a credit agreement with Dalea. The remaining portion of the net proceeds will be used to fund our exploration and 
development activities and for general corporate purposes. In connection with these offerings, we entered into a registration rights 
agreement providing for the registration of up to 98,377,300 common shares issued in these offerings. Pursuant to the registration 
rights agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) on July 20, 2009 to register the resale 
of 55,544,300 common shares. If the Registration Statement is not declared effective by October 1, 2009, we are required to pay to 
the holders of the registrable securities liquidated damages in cash equal to 1% of the purchase price of the registrable securities held 
by the holders on October 1, 2009, with an additional 1% if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by October 31, 2009, 
and a further 1% if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by November 30, 2009. If we do not pay the liquidated 
damages amount in full within seven calendar days after the date payable, interest would accrue on the unpaid amount until paid in 
full at the rate of 12% per annum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Dalea, an entity controlled by our chairman, 
Mr. Mitchell, be entitled to receive any liquidated damages under the registration rights agreement.
28
Shareholder Approval of Proposed Continuance. On July 14, 2009, our shareholders approved a special resolution approving an
arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), involving our company and our shareholders, pursuant to which 
TransAtlantic Petroleum Corp. will be continued under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda under the name “TransAtlantic 
Petroleum Ltd.” We expect to complete the continuance in the third quarter of 2009. We believe that continuing our company to 
Bermuda will be beneficial to us and our shareholders because we will receive more favorable tax treatment in Bermuda.
EOT Acquisition. On July 23, 2009, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TransAtlantic Worldwide Ltd., acquired all of the ownership
interests in Energy Operations Turkey, LLC (“EOT”) for total consideration of $7.8 million. EOT’s assets include a 50% interest in 
License 3118, interests in ten other exploration licenses in southern and southeastern Turkey, inventory and seismic data. License 
3118, which covers approximately 96,000 acres (389 square kilometers), is located near the city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey. 
In April and September 2008, EOT participated in the drilling of the Arpatepe-1 and Arpatepe-2 wells on License 3118, which 
represent Turkey’s first and second economic discoveries of crude oil from deeper, Paleozoic sandstone formations. The wells, which 
flowed naturally and were not stimulated, had initial production rates of 440 and 190 gross barrels per day, respectively, from limited 
perforations. At August 1, 2009, the wells were producing an aggregate of approximately 120 gross barrels per day.
Current Activities. Our current activities are focused on integrating the acquisitions of Incremental and EOT and developing our
oil and gas properties in Turkey, Morocco, Romania and California. Our success will depend in part on discovering hydrocarbons in 
commercial quantities and then bringing these discoveries into production. To that end, we plan to execute on the following drilling 
and exploration activities during the remainder of 2009:

Change in Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Activities  
        Effective January 1, 2009, we changed our method of accounting for our oil and gas exploration and development activities from 
the full cost method to the successful efforts method. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 
No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” financial information for prior periods has been revised to reflect 
retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and Reporting by 
Oil and Gas Producing Companies.” Although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development 
activities continues to be an accepted alternative, the successful efforts method of accounting is the preferred method. We believe the 
successful efforts method provides a more transparent representation of our results of operations and the ability to assess our 
investments in oil and gas properties for impairment based on their estimated fair values rather than being required to base valuation 
on prices and costs as of the balance sheet date.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
29
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Notes 2 and 3 to our 
unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. We have identified below policies that 
are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of 
significant judgment by management. These estimates are based on historical experience, information received from third parties, and 
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for 
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements.
Oil and Gas Properties. In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties, costs of
productive wells, developmental dry holes and productive leases are capitalized into appropriate groups of properties based on 
geographical and geological similarities. These capitalized costs are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on 
estimated proved reserves. Proceeds from sales of properties are credited to property costs, and a gain or loss is recognized when a 
significant portion of an amortization base is sold or abandoned. Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical 
costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs, including the cost of 
stratigraphic test wells, are initially capitalized but charged to exploration expense if and when the well is determined to be 
nonproductive. The determination of an exploratory well’s ability to produce must be made within one year from the completion of 
drilling activities. The acquisition costs of unproved acreage are initially capitalized and are carried at cost, net of accumulated 
impairment provisions, until such leases are transferred to proved properties or charged to exploration expense as impairments of 
unproved properties.
Valuation of Property and Equipment Other than Oil and Gas Properties. We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 144, 
“Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”). SFAS 144 requires that our long-lived assets, 
including drilling service and other equipment, be assessed for potential impairment in their carrying values whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred. Impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted 
future net cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value. Any such impairment is recognized based on the difference in the 
carrying value and estimated fair value of the impaired asset.
Business Combinations. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 141R,
“Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”), and SFAS No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial 
Statements” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 141R requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and goodwill acquired 
in a business combination to be recorded at “fair value.” The statement applies to all business combinations, including combinations 
among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. Under SFAS 141R, all business combinations will be accounted for by 
applying the acquisition method. Accordingly, transactions costs related to acquisitions are to be recorded as a reduction of earnings 
in the period they are incurred and costs related to issuing debt or equity securities that are related to the transaction will continue to 
be recognized in accordance with other applicable rules under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 141R is effective 
for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and has been applied to the Incremental acquisition. SFAS 160 will require non-
controlling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability or 
other item outside of permanent equity. The statement applies to the accounting for non-controlling interests and transactions with 
non-controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for periods beginning on or after 
December 15, 2008 and has been applied prospectively to the non-controlling interests from the Incremental acquisition.
Per Share Information. Basic per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during 
the year. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of stock options and other dilutive instruments. Under the 
treasury stock method, only “in the money” dilutive instruments impact the diluted calculations in computing diluted earnings per 
share. Diluted calculations reflect the weighted average incremental common shares that would be issued upon exercise of dilutive 
options assuming the proceeds would be used to repurchase shares at average market prices for the period.
Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The FASB issued SFAS 165, “Subsequent Events” (“SFAS 165”), on May 28, 2009. SFAS 165 establishes general standards of
accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are 
available to be issued. Although there is new terminology, the standard is based on the same principles as those that currently exist in 
the auditing standards. The standard, which includes a new required disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated 
subsequent events, is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
30
We have reviewed other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on
our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Based on that review, we believe that none of these 
pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations.
In December 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) released Final Rule, “Modernization of Oil and Gas
Reporting,” to revise the existing Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X oil and gas reporting requirements to align with current 
industry practices and technological advances. The final rule revises a number of definitions relating to oil and gas reserves, permits 
the disclosure in filings with the SEC of probable and possible reserves and permits the use of new technologies to determine proved 
reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. In addition, 
the new disclosure requirements require a company to (i) disclose its internal control over reserves estimation and report the 
independence and qualification of its reserves preparer or auditor, (ii) file a report of a third party if we represent that the third party 
prepared reserves estimates or conducted a reserves audit, (iii) report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 
12-month period rather than period-end prices, and (iv) disclose, in narrative form, the status of proved undeveloped reserves and 
changes in status of these from period to period. The provisions of this final ruling will become effective for disclosures in our 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Management is still evaluating the impact of these changes on 
its financial statements.

In 2007, we decided to exit our U.S. operations and focus on the development of our international properties. As a result of the
decision to sell our U.S. operations, we reclassified our U.S. properties as “discontinued operations.” Accordingly, revenues and 
expenses associated with our U.S. cost center in 2008 and comparative periods were reflected as components of “loss from 
discontinued operations.” Substantially all of these properties were sold late in 2007. In connection with the acquisition of 
Incremental, we acquired interests in non-operated properties in California. As a result of acquiring these properties in California, 
previously reported U.S. discontinued operations are now continuing and the results of operations in 2008 previously reported as 
discontinued have been reclassified to operating revenues, costs and expenses.
Results of Operations—Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2008
Revenue. Total crude oil and natural gas sales increased to $8.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2009 from $61,000
realized in the first six months of 2008. The increase is the result of the acquisition of Incremental in the first quarter of 2009, as 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of crude oil from the Selmo oil field in Turkey.
Production Expenses. Production expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased to $3.2 million from $46,000 in
the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increase in production expenses is the result of the acquisition of Incremental and its 
producing properties in the first quarter of 2009.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30,
2009 compared to $1.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2008, primarily due to increased corporate staffing and salaries 
resulting from the acquisitions of Longe and Incremental in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, respectively. We 
also recorded $779,000 in transaction expenses relating to the Incremental acquisition during the first six months of 2009.
International Oil and Gas Activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, we continued exploration activities in
foreign countries including consulting, legal, accounting, travel and other costs necessary to further our identification and 
development of business opportunities. The following table presents exploration expenditures by country:

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $3.8 million for the six 
months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2008. We had no assets subject to depreciation, 
depletion and amortization in the first six months of 2008 due to the write-down and sale of substantially all of our U.S. properties 
during 2007. The increase is due to the acquisition of Incremental in the first quarter of 2009 and drilling services equipment put in 
service during the first six months of 2009. We recorded $112,000 of accretion expense in the first six months of 2009 for asset 
retirement obligations related to the Incremental acquisition. We did not record any accretion expense in the first six months of 2008.
Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income increased to $199,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as 
compared to $77,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008, as a result of increased interest income on higher invested cash 
balances from the concurrent common share offerings closed in the second quarter of 2009.
31
Net Loss. The consolidated net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $20.6 million, or $0.13 per share (basic and
diluted), compared to a consolidated net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted), for the six months ended June 30, 
2008. The net loss for the first six months of 2009 is primarily composed of production expenses of $3.2 million, seismic and other 
exploration costs of $3.6 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses of $3.8 million, general and administrative 
expense of $4.8 million, and foreign exchange loss of $4.2 million relating to our financing of the acquisition of Incremental in the 
first quarter of 2009.
Results of Operations—Three Months Ended June 30, 2009 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2008
Revenue. Total crude oil and natural gas sales increased to $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $47,000 realized in 
the second quarter of 2008. The increase is the result of the acquisition of Incremental in the first quarter of 2009. Substantially all of 
our revenue is derived from the sale of crude oil from the Selmo oil field in Turkey. We sold 124,400 net barrels of crude oil at a 
realized price of $59.59 per barrel during the second quarter of 2009.
Production. We produced 143,735 gross barrels of crude oil during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 at an average rate of 1,580 
barrels per day. Substantially all of our production is generated from the Selmo oil field in Turkey. We produced a nominal amount of 
crude oil in the second quarter of 2008.
Production Expenses. Production expenses in the second quarter of 2009 increased to $2.2 million from $17,000 in the second 
quarter of 2008. The increase in production expenses is the result of the acquisition of Incremental and its producing properties in the 
first quarter of 2009.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 
2009 compared to $884,000 in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased corporate staffing and salaries resulting from 
the acquisitions of Longe and Incremental in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, respectively. We also recorded 
$316,000 in transaction expenses relating to the Incremental acquisition during the second quarter of 2009.
International Oil and Gas Activities. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we continued exploration activities in
foreign countries including consulting, legal, accounting, travel and other costs necessary to further our identification and 
development of business opportunities. The following table presents exploration expenditures by country:

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $2.5 million in the second
quarter of 2009 as compared with $0 in the second quarter of 2008. We had no assets subject to depreciation, depletion and 
amortization in the second quarter of 2008 due to the write-down and sale of substantially all of our U.S. properties during 2007. The 
increase is due to the acquisition of Incremental in the first quarter of 2009. We recorded $47,000 of accretion expense in the second 
quarter of 2009 for asset retirement obligations related to the Incremental acquisition. We did not record any accretion expense in the 
second quarter of 2008.
Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income increased to $88,000 in the second quarter of 2009 as compared to
$50,000 in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of the concurrent common share offerings closed in the second quarter of 2009.
32
Net Loss. The consolidated net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 was $7.1 million, or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted),
compared to a consolidated net loss of $920,000, or $0.01 per share (basic and diluted), for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. The 
second quarter 2009 net loss is primarily composed of production expenses of $2.2 million, seismic and other exploration costs of 
$1.2 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $2.5 million, general and administrative expense of $3.1 million, 
international oil and gas activities of $2.2 million and interest and other expense of $1.7 million.
Capital Expenditures
We recorded capital expenditures of $22.6 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared to $265,000 for capital
expenditures in the second quarter of 2008. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to drilling activities and the 
acquisition of equipment in the second quarter of 2009.
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, we have incurred $33.1 million in capital expenditures, excluding the Incremental
acquisition, compared to capital expenditures of $265,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008. We expect to incur capital 
expenditures of approximately $64.0 million for the remainder of 2009, of which approximately $33.0 million is planned to be 
incurred for exploration and production activities and approximately $31.0 million is planned to be incurred for equipment and other 
capital expenditures.
Settlement Provision
In conjunction with the sale of our Bahamian subsidiary effective June 20, 2005, we deposited funds into an escrow account to
address any liabilities and claims relating to our prior operations in Nigeria. The remaining potential liability to us includes taxes 
owed for the period January through June 2005, and we expect the remaining escrow amount of $240,000 to be sufficient to cover any 
potential liabilities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity for 2008 and the first six months of 2009 were our cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from
the issuance of our common shares. Since the acquisition of Incremental, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from 
operations and proceeds from the sale of our common shares. At June 30, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $79.1 million, 
$2.8 million in short-term debt, $492,000 in long-term debt and working capital of $64.4 million compared to cash and cash 
equivalents of $30.1 million, no debt, and working capital of $28.9 million at December 31, 2008. Cash used in operating activities 
during the second quarter of 2009 was $5.6 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 million in the second 
quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of changes in the net loss from operations, depreciation, depletion and amortization, accounts 
receivable and accounts payable.
On July 5, 2007, Petroleum Exploration Mediterranean International Pty. Ltd. (“PEMI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Incremental, entered into a general credit agreement (the “PEMI Credit Agreement”) with Turkiye Garanti Bankasi. PEMI borrowed 
$5.5 million under the PEMI Credit Agreement in order to fund drilling and development activity in the Selmo oil field. The loan 
bears interest at a rate of 7.6% per annum, and all outstanding principal and interest under the PEMI Credit Agreement is due 
August 6, 2010. As of June 30, 2009, $3.3 million in principal is outstanding under the PEMI Credit Agreement, of which $2.8 
million is short-term.
On July 23, 2009, in connection with our acquisition of EOT, we entered into a promissory note with the sellers in the amount of
$1.5 million due July 23, 2010. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3% per annum.
On July 27, 2009, in connection with our purchase of a drilling rig from Viking Drilling, LLC, we entered into a promissory
note in the amount of $5.9 million. Dalea owns 85% of Viking Drilling, LLC. The note is due and payable on August 1, 2010, bears 
interest at a fixed rate of 10% per annum and is secured by the drilling rig and associated equipment. Interest under the note is 
payable quarterly on November 1, 2009, February 1, 2010, May 1, 2010 and August 1, 2010
In December 2008, we issued 35,416,667 common shares at a price of $1.20 per share in a private placement with Dalea, Riata
TransAtlantic, Mr. McCann and other purchasers that have business and familial relationships with Mr. Mitchell, that resulted in 
gross proceeds of $42.5 million. We used a large portion of the net proceeds to purchase additional equipment for our planned drilling 
and service operations in Turkey, Morocco and Romania, to fund drilling activities in those countries and for general corporate 
purposes.
33
On June 22, 2009, we closed a Regulation S offering of common shares outside the United States and a concurrent Regulation D
private placement of common shares inside the United States. In the aggregate, we sold 98,377,300 common shares at a price of 
Cdn$1.65 per common share, raising gross proceeds of approximately Cdn$162.3 million (approximately $143.1 million). Of the 
98,377,300 common shares sold, 41,818,000 common shares were offered and sold by us to Dalea. We used $61.8 million of the net 
proceeds towards paying off a credit agreement with Dalea. The remaining portion of the net proceeds will be used to fund our 
exploration and development activities and for general corporate purposes.
In addition, we have cash flow from operations from our acquisition of Incremental, which included a 100% working interest in 
the producing Selmo oil field among other assets. In order to partially fund our expanded 2009 and 2010 drilling program, we plan to 
secure a reserves-based credit line by the fourth quarter of 2009. Upon successful completion of this credit facility, we believe that 
our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through the first quarter 
of 2010.
Contractual Obligations
There are no material changes to our contractual obligations at June 30, 2009 compared to our contractual obligations at
December 31, 2008.
Related Party Transactions
Effective May 1, 2008, we entered into a service agreement, as amended (the “Service Agreement”), with Longfellow, Viking
Drilling, LLC, Longe, MedOil Supply, LLC and Riata Management, LLC (“Riata”). Mr. Mitchell and his wife own 100% of Riata. In 
addition, Mr. Mitchell, his wife and children indirectly own 100% of Longfellow. Prior to our acquisition of Longe, Longe was 
owned 100% by Longfellow. Riata owns 100% of MedOil Supply, LLC. Dalea owns 85% of Viking Drilling, LLC. Under the terms 
of the Service Agreement, we pay, or are paid, for the actual cost of the services rendered plus the actual cost of reasonable expenses 
on a monthly basis. We recorded expenditures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 of $2.5 million and $6.1 million, 
respectively, for goods and services provided to us under the Service Agreement, of which $5.3 million was payable at June 30, 2009. 
The Company recorded expenditures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 of $13,000 for goods and services provided to 
the Company under the Service Agreement. Payables in the amount of $1.1 million due under the Service Agreement at March 31, 
2009 were settled in cash during the second quarter of 2009. There were no amounts payable to us under the Service Agreement at 
June 30, 2009.
On November 28, 2008, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Dalea. The purpose of the Credit Agreement was to fund the
offer for Incremental. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, as amended, until June 30, 2009, we could request advances from Dalea of 
(i) up to $62,000,000 for the sole purpose of purchasing Incremental common shares in connection with the offer, plus related 
transaction costs and expenses; and (ii) up to $14,000,000 for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under 
the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2008. We borrowed an aggregate of $64.6 million under the Credit Agreement and paid 
interest of $2.0 million during the first six months of 2009. The loan was repaid in full, including $389,000 in accrued interest, on 
June 23, 2009, at which time the Credit Agreement was terminated.
On March 20, 2009, TransAtlantic Australia purchased 15,025,528 common shares of Incremental from Mr. Mitchell.
TransAtlantic Australia acquired these shares from Mr. Mitchell for cash at a price of AUD $1.085 per share, the same price per share 
and pursuant to the same terms as the shares acquired from Incremental’s other shareholders, none of whom had any relationship with 
us. Mr. Mitchell had purchased the Incremental shares between October 27, 2008 and December 23, 2008 at an average price of AUD 
$0.99 per share.
Effective January 1, 2009, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TransAtlantic Turkey, Ltd. (“TransAtlantic Turkey”), entered into a
lease agreement under which it leases rooms, flats and office space at a resort hotel owned by a Turkish company controlled by 
Mr. Mitchell. Under the lease agreement, TransAtlantic Turkey pays the Turkish New Lira equivalent of $5,000 per month base rent 
and up to 45,000 Turkish New Lira per month (approximately $26,000 per month) in operating expense reimbursement. The lease 
agreement has a one-year term. The amounts we paid under the lease agreement are included in amounts paid under the Service 
Agreement.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are “forward-looking statements” and are prospective.
Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “project,” 
“estimate,” “continue” or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Such forward-looking 
statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results 
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements:
market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil products; estimates of reserves and economic assumptions; the ability to 
produce and transport natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil; the results of exploration and development drilling and related activities; 
the global economic crisis and economic conditions in the countries and provinces in which we carry on business, especially 
economic slowdowns; actions by governmental authorities including increases in taxes, changes in environmental and other 
regulations, and renegotiations of contracts; political uncertainty, including actions by insurgent groups or other conflict; the 
negotiation and closing of material contracts; and the other factors discussed in other documents that we file with or furnish to the 
SEC. The impact of any one factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty, as such factors are 
interdependent upon other factors. In that regard, any statements as to future natural gas or oil production levels; capital expenditures; 
the allocation of capital expenditures to exploration and development activities; sources of funding for our capital program; drilling of 
new wells; demand for natural gas and oil products; expenditures and allowances relating to environmental matters; dates by which 
certain areas will be developed or will come on-stream; expected finding and development costs; future production rates; ultimate 
recoverability of reserves; dates by which transactions are expected to close; cash flows; uses of cash flows; collectability of 
receivables; availability of trade credit; expected operating costs; changes in any of the foregoing and other statements using forward-
looking terminology are forward-looking statements.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as there can be no assurance that the plans,
intentions or expectations upon which they are based will occur. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous 
assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the 
predictions, forecasts, projections and other things contemplated by the forward-looking statements will not occur. Assumptions have 
been made regarding, among things, future crude oil and natural gas prices, continuing access to our fields, availability of qualified 
personnel to staff drilling rigs, tax and royalty regimes remaining unchanged, obtaining drilling success consistent with expectations, 
necessary government and regulatory approvals being obtained, estimated timelines being met and actual costs being consistent with 
estimated costs.
Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on management’s beliefs and opinions at the time 
the statements are made. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in 
their entirety by this cautionary statement. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made 
as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking 
statements to reflect new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws.  
  
Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Not applicable.
Item 4T. Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that 
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and 
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a 
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, 
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2009. 
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective as of June 30, 2009.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
On December 30, 2008, we acquired Longe. During the first quarter of 2009, we acquired a controlling interest in Incremental
and completed the acquisition of Incremental’s remaining outstanding shares in the second quarter of 2009. We have not been able to
35
conduct an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for either of the acquired entities. We are in the process of 
integrating the operations of Incremental and Longe with those of our company and incorporating the internal controls and procedures 
of Incremental and Longe into our internal control over financial reporting. Excluding Incremental and Longe, there were no changes 
to our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Any material change to our internal control over 
financial reporting due to the acquisitions of Incremental and Longe will be disclosed in our annual report for the fiscal year ending 
December 31, 2009 in which our assessment that encompasses Incremental and Longe will be included.
36
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
PART II.
Incremental has been involved in litigation with persons who claim ownership of a portion of the surface at the Selmo oil field in 
Turkey. These cases are being vigorously defended by Incremental and Turkish government authorities. We do not have enough 
information to estimate the value of the purported surface owners’ claims, and no reserve has been recorded for this litigation.  
  
Item 1A. Risk Factors
During the second quarter of 2009, there were no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in “Part I, Item 1A” of our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and “Part II, Item 1A” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for 
the quarterly period ended March 31, 2009, except for the additional risk factors listed below.
We will require significant capital to continue our exploration and development activities beyond the first quarter of 2010.
We have plans for substantial capital expenditures that we may be unable to finance beyond the first quarter of 2010 on
acceptable terms, or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our future growth depends on our ability to 
make large capital expenditures for the exploration, development and production of natural gas and oil properties.
Future cash flows and the availability of debt or equity financing will be subject to a number of variables, such as:
•
•
•
the success of our prospects in Romania, Morocco, Turkey and California;
success in finding and commercially producing reserves; and
prices of natural gas and oil.
Debt financing could lead to:
•
•
•
a substantial portion of operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest;  
  our company being more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns; and
restrictions on our operations.
We might not be able to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If sufficient capital resources are not available,
we might be forced to curtail developmental and exploratory drilling and other activities or be forced to sell some assets on an 
untimely or unfavorable basis, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of 
operations.
Global financial conditions have been subject to increased volatility. This may impact our ability to obtain equity, debt or bank 
financing in the future and may adversely impact our operations.
Current global financial conditions have been subject to increased volatility and numerous commercial and financial enterprises
have either gone into bankruptcy or creditor protection or have had to be rescued by governmental authorities. Access to public 
financing has been negatively impacted by sub-prime mortgage defaults, the liquidity crisis affecting the asset-backed commercial 
paper and collateralized debt obligation markets, massive investment losses by banks with resultant recapitalization efforts and 
deterioration in the global economy. These factors may impact our ability to obtain equity, debt or bank financing on terms 
commercially reasonable to us, if at all. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset 
values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. If these increased levels of volatility and 
market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely impacted and the trading price of our securities could continue to be 
adversely affected.
Banks have been adversely affected by the worldwide economic crisis and have severely curtailed existing liquidity lines,
increased pricing and introduced new and tighter borrowing restrictions to corporate borrowers, with extremely limited access to new 
facilities or for new borrowers. These factors could negatively impact our ability to access liquidity needed for our business in the 
longer term.
We could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.
As of July 31, 2009, approximately 75 of our employees that are employed by one of our Turkish subsidiaries are represented by 
a collective bargaining agreement with the Turkish Employers Association of Chemical, Oil and Plastic Industries (KIPLAS) and the 
Petroleum, Chemical and Rubber Workers Union of Turkey (PETROL-IS). This agreement terminates in January 2010. There can be 
no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of any expiring or expired agreement in a manner acceptable to us. Therefore, 
potential work disruptions from labor disputes may result, which may disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations.
37


Tax consequences may arise from the proposed continuance of our company under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda under 
the name “TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd.”
There may be material adverse tax consequences to us arising from the proposed continuance of our company to Bermuda.
Furthermore, the tax consequences of holding common shares of TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd. if, and when, we continue to Bermuda 
may be materially different from holding our common shares. Please see the information circular and proxy statement dated June 2, 
2009 for the special meeting of shareholders held on July 14, 2009, under the heading “Certain Material Income Tax Considerations,”
for further information on the potential tax consequences arising from the proposed continuance to Bermuda.
Undeveloped resources are uncertain.
We have undeveloped resources. Undeveloped resources, including undeveloped reserves, by their nature, are significantly less 
certain than developed resources. The discovery, determination and exploitation of undeveloped resources require significant capital 
expenditures and successful drilling and exploration programs. We may not be able to raise the additional capital we need to develop 
these resources. There is no certainty that we will discover additional resources or that resources will be economically viable or 
technically feasible to produce.
Our operations are primarily conducted in Morocco, Romania and Turkey and we are subject to political, economic and other 
risks and uncertainties in these countries.
Due to our international operations, we are subject to the following issues and uncertainties that can affect our operations adversely:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the risk of expropriation, nationalization, war, revolution, border disputes, renegotiation or modification of existing
contracts, and import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs;
taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims;
exchange controls, currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over 
international operations;
laws and policies of the United States and of the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, taxation and 
investment;  
  the possibility of being subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the 
possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and  
  the possibility of restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from foreign countries.
Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or civil unrest in Turkey could adversely affect our business.
We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the Selmo oil field in southeastern Turkey. In addition, we have plans for 
substantial exploration activities in Turkey and expect to being producing gas from the Thrace Basin in northeastern Turkey in the 
fourth quarter of 2009. Recently, areas of Turkey have experienced political, social or economic problems, terrorist attacks, 
insurgencies or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may incur substantial costs to maintain the 
safety of our personnel and our operations. Despite these precautions, the safety of our personnel and operations in these locations 
may continue to be at risk, and we may in the future suffer the loss of employees and contractors or our operations could be disrupted, 
any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of common shares may cause the market price of our common shares to 
decline.
Upon effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the 55,544,300 shares registered for resale under the Registration Statement 
will become freely tradable. The ability of our shareholders to sell substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, 
including shares covered by the Registration Statement, or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, could 
create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” and in anticipation of which the market price of our common shares 
could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our 
ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem 
reasonable or appropriate.
We are involved in litigation over the ownership of a portion of the surface rights at the Selmo oil field in Turkey.
Substantially all of our revenue is generated from the sale of oil produced from the Selmo oil field in Turkey. Our subsidiary, 
Incremental, has been involved in litigation with persons who claim ownership of a portion of the surface rights at Selmo. We and the 
Turkish government are vigorously defending these cases. Although the litigation does not affect our ownership of the Selmo 
production license, if this litigation is not resolved in our favor, our operations on the affected portions of the Selmo oil field could be 
materially disrupted. A material disruption to our operations at Selmo could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
In connection with our acquisition of Incremental, on April 8, 2009, in exchange for the assignment of all outstanding options to
acquire shares of Incremental to us, we paid the Incremental option holders an aggregate of $721,000 in cash and issued them an 
aggregate of 101,585 common shares and 829,960 common share purchase warrants. Each warrant is exercisable through April 2, 
2012 and entitles the holder to purchase one common share at an exercise price of $1.20 per share. The common shares and common 
share purchase warrants were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act. Each option 
holder certified that it was not a U.S. person and was not acquiring the securities for the account of a U.S. person. In addition, we 
implemented offering restrictions in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S and the securities were issued with appropriate 
legends in accordance with Regulation S.
