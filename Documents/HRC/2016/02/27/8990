<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In its resolution 7/27, the Human Rights Council invited the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to further consult relevant stakeholders on the draft 
guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights: the rights of the poor, including 
through the organization of a seminar, and to submit a report to the Council to allow it to take a 
decision on the ways forward with a view to the possible adoption of guiding principles on the 
rights of persons living in poverty. 
</p>
<p> The present report draws from and summarizes all submissions collected during the two 
rounds of consultation of 2007-2008, which concluded with a seminar held in Geneva on 27 and 
28 January 2009, with States, civil society organizations, international experts, including the 
independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty,* and other relevant 
stakeholders. Section III of this report also reflects the views expressed on the way forward with 
a view to the possible adoption of guiding principles. 
</p>
<p> The<b> </b>consultation processes<b> </b>have<b> </b>disclosed a broad consensus<b> </b>among respondents on the 
importance of preparing guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights. Guiding 
principles have the potential to strengthen the implementation of existing international human 
rights law, rendering international human rights law and policy directly relevant to people living 
in extreme poverty. However, the current draft guiding principles require work in a number of 
areas. Significantly, their language and terms need to conform more systematically with those of 
international human rights law. Topics requiring further discussion include the level of detail 
guiding principles should have, how to strike a balance between normative clarification and 
operational guidance, and whether or how to deal with global and structural causes of poverty. 
</p>
<p> Although there are a number of views and preferences to be reconciled, the collective input 
derived from the consultations reveals a widespread commitment to advancing this project. 
 At the end of the seminar, the Government of France made a proposal on the way forward, 
recommending that the Human Rights Council mandate the independent expert on human rights 
and extreme poverty to carry out a revision of the draft guiding principles. The proposal received 
the unanimous support of all participants and the independent expert expressed her readiness to 
undertake such a task, should the Council so decide.

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2001, the Commission on Human Rights stressed the need to develop guiding principles 
on the implementation of existing human rights norms and standards in the context of the fight 
against extreme poverty. In response, an ad hoc group of experts was entrusted by the 
Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with preparing draft guiding 
principles on extreme poverty and human rights, which were submitted to the Human Rights 
Council at its second session in 2007. As called for in Human Rights Council resolution 2/2, the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) circulated the 
draft guiding principles to obtain the views of States, relevant United Nations agencies, 
intergovernmental organizations, United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures mandate 
holders, including the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, 
national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), especially those in 
which people in situations of extreme poverty express their views, and other relevant 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>2. The implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 7/27, a second round of 
consultations provided an opportunity to seek further the views of all relevant stakeholders on 
the draft guiding principles. Respondents were invited to consider the following two questions: 
(a) the added value and practical utility of the draft guiding principles in helping to implement 
existing human rights norms and standards in the context of the fight against extreme poverty; 
and (b) the technical legal merit of the draft guiding principles from the perspective of existing 
human rights norms and standards. 
</p>
<p>3. The two rounds of consultation in 2007 and 2008 generated significant feedback, which 
cannot be reflected comprehensively in this report. While some comments are of a more general 
kind, others range from specific language modifications in tracked changes to alternative 
formulations, or even suggested additional paragraphs. 
</p>
<p>4. These consultations concluded with a seminar held on 27 and 28 January 2009, in Geneva, 
with States, civil society organizations, international experts, including the independent expert 
on human rights and extreme poverty, and other relevant stakeholders. While inputs gathered in 
the 2007 consultation are reflected in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the draft guiding principles (A/HRC/7/32), a more detailed account of all 
views and comments is found in a background paper prepared for the seminar and in a final 
technical review of the process. These two papers<b>1</b> were commissioned by OHCHR to an 
independent consultant, Dr. Margot Salomon, of the London School of Economics and Political 
Science.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  These papers, which are intended to serve as main reference documents of a future review of 
</p>
<p>the draft guiding principles, do not necessarily reflect the views of OHCHR, the United Nations 
or the consultant. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I. GENERAL VIEWS ON THE DRAFT GUIDING PRINCIPLES:  
ADDED VALUE, PRACTICAL UTILITY AND TECHNICAL 
MERIT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE 
</b></p>
<p>5. The draft guiding principles are widely viewed as having the potential to advance the 
objectives of international human rights law. All respondents - Governments, NGOs and other 
stakeholders - expressed support for the development of guiding principles in this area and 
indicated that, in general, they represent an appropriate framework for shaping measures and 
activities in order to address extreme poverty across the world. As noted by the independent 
expert on human rights and extreme poverty, they are particularly relevant because there is no 
single document in the human rights law corpus that addresses specifically the rights or needs of 
persons living in extreme poverty. At the opening of the seminar, Alberto J. Dumont, 
Ambassador of Argentina and Vice-President of the Human Rights Council, recalled Council 
resolutions 2/2 and 7/27, which underscore that the application of international human rights law 
in fighting extreme poverty is a priority of the Council. 
</p>
<p>6. Zdzislaw Kedzia, a newly appointed member of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, echoed the view of other respondents, however, when he recommended that the 
specific nature and objectives of the document be clarified before discussion of its added value.<b>2</b> 
The document could be viewed either as guidelines on the human rights of the poor, bringing 
together relevant human rights standards and applying them contextually, as guidelines on the 
elaboration of an operational framework for poverty eradication, or both. 
</p>
<p>7. The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons remarked that guiding principles would have an added value to the extent that, in 
addition to restating existing guarantees, they would also spell out specific aspects of rights that 
are particularly important for persons living in extreme poverty and address obstacles that, in 
practice, limit the enjoyment of human rights. Professor Wouter Vandenhole, of the University 
of Antwerp, suggested that a clear analytical account of how and when human rights are 
deficient in addressing extreme poverty should be provided for in the guiding principles. The 
Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions suggested that a real added value would come from 
setting out the particular obstacles persons and communities living in extreme poverty face, so 
that States may be provided with direction on eliminating those obstacles. At the seminar a clear 
consensus was reached regarding the need for a more operational, action-oriented and accessible 
document, as stated by the Governments of Canada, France, the Philippines, Turkey, and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the independent expert on human rights 
and extreme poverty, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,<b>3</b> the World Alliance for Citizen 
Participation (CIVICUS) and many others.

</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Hereinafter referred to as Special Rapporteur on the right to health. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>8. The adoption of the draft guiding principles may also aim to raise awareness among 
persons living in extreme poverty and the population at large as to their rights and entitlements. 
The Government of Argentina expressed its support for the human rights-based approach to the 
eradication of extreme poverty, emphasizing that &#8220;basic rights&#8221; are a matter of justice, not 
charity. The consensus reflected in the 2008 joint submission of 11 NGOs was to commend the 
human rights approach to poverty reduction adopted in the draft guiding principles, and in 
particular, the way in which they address the process of poverty eradication, and not merely the 
outcome.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>9. Professor Arne Tostensen, Chairman of Michelsen Institute, Professor Camilo P&#233;rez 
Bustillo, of Universidad Aut&#243;noma de la Ciudad de M&#233;xico, and Wouter Vandenhole 
expressed the view that the draft guiding principles as currently framed do not address 
sufficiently the structural phenomenon of extreme poverty in a global context. The Governments 
of the Syrian Arab Republic and Egypt reiterated during the seminar that, unless the role of 
international cooperation is considered, the document will become a tool solely for action at the 
national level, to the possible neglect of important responsibilities at the international level. 
International Movement ATD Fourth World (ATD), however, expressed concern that a 
supranational focus might render guiding principles less directly operational, although it 
supported retaining in the draft guiding principles the provisions concerning international 
cooperation and non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>10. The draft guiding principles have the potential to be a useful lobbying tool for civil society 
organizations to encourage States to realize fully the rights of extremely poor persons. The 
Tunisian Higher Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and a number of other 
respondents<b>5</b> viewed the implementation of guiding principles as a new advocacy tool for the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and poverty reduction strategies, based on a 
new common legal framework. The Government of Mexico noted in this regard that it hoped to 
see the draft guiding principles provide orientation in fulfilling the commitments under the 
Millennium Development Goals that are of particular relevance to the rights of people living in 
poverty. As for all human rights standards, having the guiding principles reflected in legislation 
would also help to ensure that they are given effect to domestically. 
</p>
<p>11. In the consultation on the draft guiding principles undertaken with people living in 
extreme poverty, respondents emphasized the importance of being afforded recognition by 
authorities, and bearing that in mind, programmes and policies should be developed with their 
</p>

</p>
<p>participation.<b>6</b> They reiterated that those in positions of responsibility need to meet and talk with 
poor women and men, in order to gain their trust and involve them in finding solutions. An 
added value of guiding principles then is the sense of personal dignity that comes from being 
acknowledged. 
</p>
<p>12. There was a strong sense from respondents, such as the Governments of France, 
Switzerland and Turkey and the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights,<b>7</b> that the objective should not be to create new 
human rights standards, but rather that it should be to reflect existing human rights norms as 
applied to extreme poverty. Virtually all respondents emphasized the need to ensure that the 
guiding principles are written in a manner that conforms with the agreed language, terms and 
principles found in international human rights instruments and developed through jurisprudence 
(e.g., general comments). 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur on the right to health and several other respondents commented on 
the excessive references made to penal law,<b>8</b> and questionable use of criminal law language in 
some cases, which might deter people from taking action to ensure the progressive realization of 
social and economic rights. 
</p>
<p>14. In his presentation at the seminar, the independent expert on foreign debt noted that the 
draft guiding principles should make it clear that the guiding principles are not to be interpreted 
as limiting, altering or otherwise prejudicing the rights recognized under international human 
rights law. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions urged that every care should be taken to 
ensure that the draft guiding principles do not inadvertently set a lower standard than is 
established elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>15. A number of respondents suggested that the structure of the draft guiding principles could 
be improved. The structure should pay greater attention to some well-established principles in 
international human rights law of central relevance here, such as the prioritization of the most 
vulnerable groups, progressive realization, minimum core obligations,<b>9</b> the principles of 
maximum available resources and of non-retrogression and the principles already reflected in the 
draft guiding principles.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. COMMENTS ON THE CONTENT OF THE 
DRAFT GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Preamble 
</b></p>
<p>16. Several NGOs suggested that it would be appropriate to include in the preamble specific 
references to relevant human rights instruments, beyond the few mentioned. Camilo P&#233;rez 
Bustillo suggested referring more explicitly to, inter alia, articles 22, 25 and 28 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>17. The absence in the preamble of any reference to the Millennium Development Goals<b>10</b> and 
to a number of relevant policy documents was also noted, including the OHCHR Principles and 
Guidelines for a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies,<b>11</b> and relevant work 
by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other agencies in this area. The 
Government of Mexico recommended an explicit reference to Goal 1, given its focus on 
eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people<b>12</b> suggested that, owing to the uniqueness and severity of the issue of poverty 
for indigenous peoples, a specific reference to it should be included in the preamble. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government of the Philippines<b> </b>suggested calling for continuous international 
cooperation and decisive action for the eradication of extreme poverty not only on the national 
level, but also on the subnational level.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human rights and extreme poverty: the rights of the poor (Introduction) 
</b>20. A number of respondents pointed out that the concepts of extreme poverty, basic poverty 
and social exclusion in the draft guiding principles are not defined and that those omissions need 
to be addressed. There was a sense nonetheless among some respondents<b>13</b> that a general 
definition of poverty would also be important to the understanding and interpretation of the text, 
and that it needed to be drafted in a clear and suitably comprehensive manner. At the seminar, 
Professor Peter Townsend, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, advocated 
for moving towards an international measure or definition of poverty by using the international 
human rights framework, which, he noted, offers the means to do so. The Special Rapporteur on 
the right to health even proposed including indicators in the draft guiding principles as a 
mandatory requirement for States to monitor and be accountable. Joseph Ingram, the former

 <p> 
</p>
<p>World Bank Special Representative to the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, 
further stated that monitoring and accountability cannot be achieved without an explicit 
reference to the principle of progressive realization, which is currently missing in the draft 
guiding principles. 
</p>
<p>21. The Governments of Argentina and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and the 
National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (France) remarked that extreme poverty is 
a violation of basic rights and a leading factor in aggravating discrimination. The Government of 
Mexico, however, was of the view that extreme poverty is a violation of human dignity, while 
the Government of Finland stated that poverty as such is not a human rights violation but the 
causes and consequences of extreme poverty often constitute violations of various human rights. 
At the seminar, the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty remarked that the 
issue of whether poverty constitutes in itself a violation of human rights is not an easy question 
and suggested that the draft guiding principles should stress instead how human rights are 
applicable to people living in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>22. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty suggested that 
non-discrimination should also be developed in paragraph 3, thereby grounding and rendering 
consistent the references provided elsewhere in the draft guiding principles, and situating 
non-discrimination as an overarching element. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions 
noted that this process constitutes a unique opportunity to unequivocally recognize poverty as a 
ground of discrimination, thereby enriching the international law <i>acquis </i>in this area. 
</p>
<p>23. The Government of Switzerland and Zdzislaw Kedzia suggested that the universal periodic 
review be mentioned in paragraph 5. 
</p>
<p>24. Joseph Ingram suggested incorporating the recommendation that country economic and 
sector analyses conducted by the Government and/or donor institutions (e.g., the international 
financial institutions) explicitly identify the poorest and the most marginalized, and that national 
development or poverty reduction strategies address the needs of the poorest as a priority.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Section 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Participation by the poor 
</b></p>
<p>25. Many respondents<b>14</b> and seminar participants<b>15</b> stressed generally that the subsection on 
participation by the poor should make more explicit references to the participation of specific 
groups, including indigenous and tribal peoples, minority groups, persons with disabilities, older 
persons, migrants, women and girls, etc.

minority issues.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. Specific remarks on the participation of women were made by Peter Townsend, Care 
International, and the Ukrainian Parliament Commission for Human Rights. However, the 
Secretariat of the Pacific Community remarked that the feminization of poverty and the 
participation of women in anti-poverty strategies are not the same issue and should not be 
included together in a section on participation. It further suggested that recognition of the 
feminization of poverty should be mainstreamed throughout the document. 
</p>
<p>27. Light for the World advocated the full and effective participation of persons living in 
extreme poverty in all activities that concern them and in programmes for the eradication of 
extreme poverty. Joseph Ingram highlighted participation in the monitoring and evaluation 
phases. The Government of Finland highlighted the need to state in the subsection on 
participation by the poor that the poorest should have the right to be informed of their rights and 
of the obligations of their Governments to implement those rights. At the seminar, ATD and 
CIVICUS reiterated the need to describe the conditions necessary for meaningful participation to 
avoid token participation or the manipulation of participation. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government of Georgia remarked that the participation of people living in extreme 
poverty in programmes for the eradication of extreme poverty should be voluntary.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination and stigmatization 
</b></p>
<p>29. The need for consistency with the conventional language of equality and 
non-discrimination was remarked by several respondents, including the Deputy Chief Prosecutor 
of the Supreme Court (France) and former Chair of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. At the seminar, the Government of Bolivia, the independent 
expert on foreign debt and the Special<b> </b>Rapporteur on the right to health insisted that a conceptual 
differentiation needs to be made between stigmatization that is a social construct and 
discrimination that is a legal construct. 
</p>
<p>30. Regarding stigmatization of the poor, the International Federation of Social Workers 
suggested that certain outward appearances or certain types of behaviour, including theft, 
aggression and other forms of violence, do not exclusively characterize the poor or the extremely 
poor. The Equal Opportunity Commission of Hong Kong suggested that stigmatization based on 
social and income status should be specifically denounced. The South African Human Rights 
Commission stated that the draft guiding principles do not identify the entity responsible for 
punishing those who discriminate. The Governments of Costa Rica and Mexico and Care 
International mentioned the impact that means of communication and education systems has on 
discrimination and stigmatization processes. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government of the Philippines noted that paragraph 12 could be expanded to include a 
statement on affirmative action.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Section 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indivisibility and interdependence of rights 
</b></p>
<p>32. Light for the World remarked that paragraph 14 should include a reference to all human 
rights also being &#8220;interrelated&#8221;, as spelled out in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action. Arne Tostensen noted that, while recognizing the coherence of the human rights regime, 
it should not be overlooked that in real life situations difficult trade-offs have to be made. The 
draft guiding principles should offer guidance on how such trade-offs can be made.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>33. At the seminar, the Government of France stated that the subsection on civil and political 
rights needs to be further elaborated, in order to avoid creating the impression that the fight 
against extreme poverty has to do mainly with addressing economic and social rights. The 
independent expert on foreign debt stressed that the uneven treatment diminishes the significance 
of the principle of indivisibility. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and Joseph Ingram 
stated that freedom of association needs to be elaborated and specific guidance should be 
provided on how to remove obstacles that prevent the creation of advocacy organization and self 
advocacy. 
</p>
<p>34. In the consultation with people living in extreme poverty on the draft guiding principles, 
among the rights deemed of particular importance was the &#8220;right to possess official citizenship 
documents&#8221;. A more elaborate section on the right to identity was also suggested by the 
International Federation of Social Workers, HelpAge International and Sightsavers International, 
with specific reference made to the right of women in cases of female-headed households and of 
abandoned or unaccompanied children. 
</p>
<p>35. In the consultation with people living in extreme poverty on the draft guiding principles, 
the participants asked that the right to live as a family receive stronger emphasis in the draft 
guiding principles. Similarly, the Government of Belgium considered that paragraph 16 could be 
fleshed out in more detail to address better the rights described therein (respect for privacy and 
family life).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Right to justice 
</b>36. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty recommended amending the 
heading of the subsection on the right to justice to read &#8220;Access to justice, administration of 
justice and equality before the law&#8221;. 
37. The National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (France) noted the recently 
adopted Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights as a very significant development in reinforcing the justiciability of all human rights. The 
need to include a reference to the Optional Protocol in the draft guiding principles was 
mentioned at the seminar by ATD and the independent expert on human rights and extreme 
poverty. The Government of Finland similarly suggested placing further emphasis in the draft </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>guiding principles on the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights. Kamal Siddiqui, a 
member of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, recommended a provision addressing 
effective pro-poor justice at the grass-roots level, since the formal justice system is too costly for 
the poor to afford. The Special Rapporteur on indigenous people remarked that those living in 
extreme poverty should also have the opportunity to access traditional/customary legal systems. 
</p>
<p>38. It was noted that paragraph 40 provides for free legal assistance but fails to address the 
important issue of court fees in civil proceedings, which the poor often cannot afford. The 
Government of Belgium and the 2008 NGO Consultation proposed an explicit reference to the 
obligation of the State and the judicial administration to provide the possibility of legal redress. 
39. The relevance of the right to information was mentioned by Joseph Ingram in the context 
of poverty reduction programmes. The Special Rapporteur on indigenous people recommended 
mentioning that the educational and public information programmes on rights and judicial 
proceedings be made available in the relevant indigenous or minority languages. Some 
participants<b>16</b> suggested that the training programmes mentioned in paragraph 41 also target 
police officers and civil servants responsible for implementing the law. 
</p>
<p><b>Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>40. Many respondents pointed out the lack of reference in section 2 to some social and 
economic rights of particular relevance to people living in extreme poverty. The Centre on 
Housing Rights and Evictions and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community remarked that while 
some attention is devoted to land rights, particularly in the subsection on the right to food, there 
is need to devote a separate subsection in the draft guiding principles to that issue, in particular 
as regards the rights of indigenous peoples, but also, in the view of the latter, with regard to 
women. Kamal Siddiqui advocated for the inclusion of a right to credit. Access to credit on easy 
terms should constitute a basic right of the extremely poor. 
</p>
<p>41. A large number of NGOs and academics emphasized the stark omission of the right to 
social security, with Professor David Gordon, of the University of Bristol, also remarking on the 
absence of any reference to ILO Convention No. 102 on Social Security. HelpAge International 
and Sightsavers International suggested that references be included to the effect that States 
should provide regular and predictable income in the form of non-contributory cash transfers to 
poor persons unable to make regular payments into national insurance or contributory pension 
schemes that would guarantee them an adequate standard of living, and that States unable to 
make such payments on their own be required to seek the assistance of the international 
community. Camilo P&#233;rez Bustillo<b> </b>also noted the importance of referring to the right to an 
adequate standard of living.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>42. Many respondents<b>17</b> stated that the formulation<b> </b>of the right to food in paragraph 20 should 
be in line with Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 12 
(1999) and with the Food and Agriculture Organization Voluntary Guidelines to support the 
progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security. The 
National Centre for Human Rights in Jordan, the Government of Colombia, the People&#8217;s 
Advocate of Romania and Sarah Zaidi also made specific suggestions on the formulation of the 
right in the draft guiding principles. 
</p>
<p>43. Additionally, the Governments of Switzerland and Finland, the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on 
indigenous people, Kamal Siddiqui, the South African Human Rights Commission, HelpAge 
International, Sightsavers International, Volontari nel mondo and the NGO Committee on Social 
Development made specific comments on issues such as the recognition of property rights for 
food security, security of tenure over land and other natural resources, discrimination and 
violence against female farm workers, recognition of the specific needs of women and girls 
concerning the right to food (i.e., during pregnancy), the prevention of discriminatory 
distribution of food in humanitarian responses, and the need for active participation in 
humanitarian programmes and international responsibilities in times of natural disasters. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>44. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty and the Tunisian Higher 
Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms recommended that the heading of the 
subsection on the right to health be amended to read: &#8220;Right to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health&#8221;. The Government of Finland expressed its 
hope for more specific operational guidelines for use by Governments. To those ends, the 
subsection on the right to health might mention a minimum level of gross domestic product that 
States should direct to health care. As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO) at the 
seminar, user fees are one of the main impediments for people living in poverty to access health 
care; therefore a minimum package that is free of charge and includes free family planning, 
maternal health, and child care, as indicated in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, needs to be made available. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur on the right to health provided alternative language to make the 
paragraphs on the right to health more consistent with existing international standards and the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 14, and provided 
actionable suggestions on issues such as the right to association, stigma and international 
cooperation for assistance. 
</p>
<p>46. In addition, the Governments of Belgium, Colombia, Finland and the Philippines, the 
Equal Opportunity Commission of Hong Kong, the South African Human Rights Commission,  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  FAO, 2008 NGO Consultation, and Christophe Golay. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Kamal Sidiqqui, UNDP, HelpAge 
International, Sightsavers International, the International Federation of Social Workers and 
others made specific comments on issues such as the priority attention to persons living in 
extreme poverty in all health services, the protection of reproductive health rights of women, 
making an explicit reference to affordable (or free) health care, international assistance, the 
problem of trading in human organs, and the need for State regulation of private service delivery. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to drinkable water 
</b></p>
<p>47. The independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations in relation to access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation and the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions suggested 
that the right be described as &#8220;the right to water and sanitation&#8221; and be harmonized with the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 15 and the 
Subcommission draft guidelines for the realization of the right to drinking water and sanitation.<b>18</b> 
The Government of Italy and the South African Human Rights Commission proposed taking into 
account the recent report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
scope and the content of the relevant human rights obligations related to equitable access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation under international human rights instruments (A/HRC/6/3), and 
emphasized the importance of the right to water as a self-standing human right and a global 
public good.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>48. The Governments of Colombia, Georgia, the Philippines, and Switzerland, UNDP, and the 
NGO Committee on Social Development raised issues relating to water affordability and access, 
as opposed to the provision of services &#8220;free of charge&#8221;, including in situations of natural 
disasters and floods, and the need to address broader environmental rights in the draft guiding 
principles.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Right to housing 
</b></p>
<p>49. As for the draft guiding principles as a whole, the subsection on the right to housing needs 
to be rendered consistent with existing international human rights standards and language. The 
independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty suggested that the heading of the 
subsection refer to the right to &#8220;adequate&#8221; housing. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions 
emphasized that the current text constitutes a radical break from the right to adequate housing as 
currently recognized under international law. 
</p>
<p>50. In addition, other respondents<b>20</b> expressed the hope to see more references and specificity 
on issues such as forced evictions, the destruction of informal settlements and security of tenure 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  The Government of Switzerland suggested the same at the seminar. 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  The Human Rights Centre of the University of Padova, Volontari nel mondo and 
</p>
<p>Associazione ONG Italiane also called for the same. 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  The Governments of the Philippines and Belgium, the International Federation of Social 
Workers, Care International and the South African Human Rights Commission. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in such settlements, and women&#8217;s rights to inheritance. However, the Government of Georgia 
remarked that it would be more appropriate for States to play a facilitative role in promoting 
access by the poor to housing than to be obligated to guarantee such access, in particular in 
countries with weak or transition economies. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to education and culture 
</b></p>
<p>51. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty recommended amending the 
heading of the subsection on the right to education and culture to read: &#8220;Right to education and 
right to take part in cultural life&#8221;. Additionally, the Governments of Belgium, Greece, 
Switzerland and the Philippines and the Tunisian Higher Committee on Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms suggested including specific provisions on &#8220;youth&#8221; and &#8220;sport&#8221;, the fight 
against school abandonment, access of migrants and persons with disabilities, women and girls, 
and other persons living in extreme poverty to all levels of education, the right to protect their 
culture and identities, and a broader definition of culture in line with the 2004 UNDP Human 
Development Report. 
</p>
<p>52. Joseph Ingram remarked that the draft guiding principles are inadequate in their treatment 
of girls, especially regarding their equal right to education. The Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons noted the need to address 
what he characterized as the number one obstacle for the poor; namely, the issue of school fees 
and the cost of books, uniforms, etc. Programmes such as school feeding or measures to provide 
schoolchildren with basic training materials could help to compensate for the loss of income or 
the additional expenses for the family resulting from school fees.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Right to employment 
</b></p>
<p>53. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty suggested amending the 
heading of the subsection on the right to employment to read: &#8220;Right to work&#8221;. ILO reiterated the 
same at the seminar and added that just and favourable working conditions and freedom of 
association are some of the crucial issues for ILO in terms of guaranteeing the rights of the 
poor.<b>21</b> The 2008 NGO Consultation reflected a preference for the heading &#8220;Right to 
employment, decent work and social security&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>54. Other respondents made several remarks on issues pertaining to the elimination of child 
labour,<b>22</b> forced prostitution, child prostitution and human trafficking,<b>23</b> safety nets and social  
</p>
<p>

Arne Tostensen and the 2008 NGO Consultation indicated a need for more consistent reference 
to ILO labour Conventions, and State obligations on the right to employment. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Section 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>State obligations and international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>55. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty and Wouter Vandenhole 
noted that the subsection on international cooperation should be solidly grounded in the 
authoritative interpretation provided by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and 
should draw on the body of scholarly work built up in this area. Attention was drawn to 
article 2.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comments 3 and 4, and relevant 
concluding observations of treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>Duties and responsibilities of public and private entities in combating poverty 
</b></p>
<p>56. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty suggested that the subsection 
on duties and responsibility of public and private entities in combating poverty be entitled 
&#8220;Duties of non-State actors&#8221;. She highlighted that the draft guiding principles currently overlook 
the issue of responsibilities of national and transnational business enterprises. Although 
international human rights law traditionally binds States rather than corporations or business 
enterprises, there is growing evidence that international law in this area is moving to close this 
legal loophole and address issues of corporate behaviour and responsibility. The draft guiding 
principles have a role to play in providing suggestions as to how States can and should regulate 
when it comes to abuse by business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>57. She suggested that the draft guiding principles be rephrased so as to take into account 
doctrinal developments on the responsibility of companies and international organizations, 
among others, in their application to the issue of extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  DISCUSSION ON THE WAY FORWARD 
</b></p>
<p>58. A discussion on the way forward with a view to adopting guiding principles on extreme 
poverty and human rights took place at the final session of the seminar. The Government of 
France, in its role as one of the co-sponsoring countries of resolution 7/27, proposed that the 
Human Rights Campaign mandate the independent expert on the question of extreme poverty 
and human rights to carry out a revision of the draft guiding principles, which would take into 
consideration the results of the consultations undertaken so far and the conclusions of the 
seminar. The independent expert could also decide to undertake additional final consultations, in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  2008 NGO Consultation and David Gordon. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>accordance with her own judgement. Any future Council decision on the way forward could be 
determined at a later stage, upon the submission by the independent expert of a revised text to 
the Council. 
</p>
<p>59. The proposal made by the Government of France met with the overwhelming support of 
the Governments that took the floor, namely, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Switzerland and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. CIVICUS and ATD, on behalf of a group of 11 NGOs, also 
endorsed the proposal. 
</p>
<p>60. In view of the unanimous response, the independent expert thanked all participants for 
their trust, while acknowledging the difficult task of consolidating so many rich comments and 
inputs. She indicated her willingness in principle to accept the task, should the Council so 
decide, with support from OHCHR, and expressed the hope to receive the cooperation and help 
of States, NGOs and other social movements. </p>
