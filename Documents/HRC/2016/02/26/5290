</p>
<p>*  Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council.<b> </b></p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal profession and 
the integrity of the judicial system are essential prerequisites for the protection of human rights 
and the application of the rule of law and for ensuring a fair trial and that there is no 
discrimination in the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all the previous resolutions and decisions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
the Council and the General Assembly on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and 
on the integrity of the judicial system, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the importance of the ability of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers to cooperate closely, within the framework of his or her 
mandate, with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the 
fields of advisory services and technical cooperation, in an effort to guarantee the independence 
of judges and lawyers, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of bar associations and professional associations of judges and 
non-governmental organizations in the defence of the principles of the independence of judges 
and lawyers, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> <i>with concern</i> the increasingly frequent attacks on the independence of judges, 
lawyers and court officials, </p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> also Council resolution 8/6 of 18 June 2008 on the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Notes</i> <i>with appreciation</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers (A/HRC/11/41), including on the main recent developments in the area of 
international justice, and invites all Governments to seriously consider the conclusions and 
recommendations expressed therein; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Commends</i> the previous Special Rapporteur, for the important work undertaken in 
the discharge of his mandate; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3 <i>Notes</i> <i>with interest</i> the analysis of individual and institutional parameters elaborated 
by the Special Rapporteur in his report for effectively guaranteeing the independence of the 
judiciary; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to elaborate safeguards to ensure and strengthen the 
independence of lawyers, including public defenders where appropriate, as a guarantee in the 
protection of human rights and the rule of law; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States to promote diversity in the composition of the members of the 
judiciary and to ensure that the requirements for joining the judiciary and the selection process 
thereof are non-discriminatory; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> all Governments to respect and uphold the independence of judges and 
lawyers and, to that end, to take effective legislative, law enforcement and other appropriate 
measures that will enable them to carry out their professional duties without harassment or 
intimidation of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges </i>all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the 
performance of her tasks, to provide all information and to respond to communications 
transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur without undue delay; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon </i>Governments to give serious consideration to responding favourably to 
the requests of the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries, and urges States to enter into a 
constructive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur with respect to the follow-up to and 
implementation of her recommendations so as to enable her to fulfil her mandate even more 
effectively; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages</i> Governments that face difficulties in guaranteeing the independence of 
judges and lawyers, or that are determined to take measures to implement this principle further, 
to consult and to consider the services of the Special Rapporteur, for instance by inviting her to 
their country if the Government concerned deems it necessary; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this issue in accordance with its annual 
programme of work.
