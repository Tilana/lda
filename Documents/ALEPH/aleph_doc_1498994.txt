Canamax thereto, and shall include an explanation in reasonable detail of, and such supporting 
documentation  as  is  reasonably  necessary  to  support,  such  changes.    If  Canamax  has  timely

Powder  and  Canamax  resolving  all  disagreements  of  Canamax  set  forth  in  such  notice,  the 
Powder Adjusted Working Capital Statement will become final and binding upon Powder and 
Canamax.

Powder  Meeting  Date  Adjusted  Working  Capital  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  $20,500,000,  the

description of the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making any 
inquiry,  proposal,  offer  or  request  (to  the  extent  then  known  by  Powder).  Powder  will  also 
provide such further and other details of the Powder Acquisition Proposal or any amendment 
thereto as Canamax may reasonably request (to  the extent  then  known by Powder). Powder 
will keep Canamax fully informed of the status, including any change to material terms, of any 
Powder  Acquisition  Proposal  or  any  amendment  thereto,  will  respond  promptly  to  all 
reasonable inquiries by Canamax with respect thereto, and will provide to Canamax copies of

Powder to any person in connection with such inquiry, proposal, offer or request.
Following  receipt  of  a  Powder  Superior  Proposal,  Powder  will  give  Canamax,  orally  and  in

implement  such  Powder  Superior  Proposal  and  not  to  release  the  party  making  the  Powder 
Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and will not withdraw, redefine, modify or

period, Powder will, and will cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith 
with Canamax and its financial and legal advisors to make such adjustments in the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable Powder to proceed with 
the Arrangement, as amended, rather than the Powder Superior Proposal. In the event Powder 
confirms in writing its commitment to amend this Agreement on a basis such that the Powder 
board  of  directors  determines  that  the  proposed  transaction  is  no  longer  a  Powder  Superior 
Proposal and so advises the board of directors of Canamax prior to the expiry of such 72 hour 
period, the board of directors of Powder will not accept, recommend, approve or enter into any 
agreement to implement such Powder Superior Proposal and will not release the party making 
the Powder Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and will not withdraw, redefine, 
modify  or  change  its  recommendation  in  respect  of  the  Arrangement.  Notwithstanding  the 
foregoing,  nothing  contained  in  this  Agreement  will  prohibit  Powder  from  negotiating  or 
making  any  changes  to  this  Agreement  in  the  event  that  Powder  is  in  receipt  of  a  Powder 
Superior  Proposal.  Powder  acknowledges  that  each  successive  material  modification  of  any  
Powder Superior Proposal will constitute a new Powder Superior Proposal for purposes of the 
requirement under this Section 3.4(d) to initiate a new 72 hour notice period.
In the event that Powder provides the notice contemplated by this Section 3.4(d) on a date which 
is less than 72 hours prior to the Powder Meeting, Canamax will be entitled to require Powder to

be  in  a  position  to  expeditiously  and  efficiently  integrate  the  business  and  operations  of 
Powder with those of Canamax immediately upon but not prior to the Effective Date. From and 
after  the  date  hereof  until  the  earlier  of  the  Effective  Time  and  the  termination  of  this 
Agreement,  Powder  agrees  to  keep  Canamax  appraised  in  a  timely  manner  of  every 
circumstance, action, occurrence or event occurring or arising after the date hereof that would

termination of this Agreement, Powder will confer with Canamax prior to taking action (other 
than  in  emergency  situations)  with  respect  to  any  material  operational  matters  involving  its 
business  and  Powder  will  update  Canamax  as  to  all  material  matters  following  any  weekly 
operations meetings held by Powder.

agreements that Canamax may reasonably request in furtherance of Section 3.6(a).

(i)
(ii)
furnish the legal and professional representatives and agents of Canamax with 
such  access  to  Powder’s  books,  records  and  documents  as  Canamax  may 
reasonably request, provided that Powder is satisfied, acting reasonably, that the 
confidentiality  of  the  subject  matter  of  the  disclosure  can  be  maintained  as 
contemplated by the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement; and
endeavour to include in the information furnished to Canamax, or obtained by 
Canamax in the course of the aforesaid investigations, all information that would 
reasonably  be  considered  to  be  relevant  for  the  purposes  of  Canamax’s 
investigation  and  not  knowingly  withhold  any  information  that  would  make 
anything contained in the information delivered erroneous or misleading.
(d)
(e)
The Parties acknowledge and agree that all information provided by Powder to Canamax (or 
any of its representatives) pursuant to this Section 3.5 will be considered to be “Confidential

made  to  Powder  or  the  Powder  Shareholders  prior  to  the  expiry  of  the  first 
Powder Acquisition Proposal) is completed within 6 months of the date the first 
referenced  Powder  Acquisition  Proposal  is  announced,  proposed,  offered  or 
made (provided that, for the purposes of this subparagraph only, all references 
in the definition of “Powder Acquisition Proposal” to “20%” will be read as, and 
deemed to be, references to “50%”); or
(c)
the board of directors of Powder (or any committee thereof) accepts, recommends, approves, 
agrees to, endorses or enters into, or proposes publicly to accept, recommend, approve, agree 
to, endorse or enter into an agreement to implement a Powder Superior Proposal;
(each of the above, if not timely cured, being (upon expiration of any applicable cure period) hereinafter 
referred to as an “Canamax Damages Event”), then in the event of the termination of this Agreement 
pursuant to Section 9.1(d) or 9.1(e) Powder will pay to Canamax $1,300,000 (the “Canamax Termination 
Fee”)  as  liquidated  damages,  in  immediately  available  funds,  to  an  account  designated  by  Canamax,
- 44 -
within  one  Business  Day  after  the  occurrence  of  the  first  Canamax  Damages  Event,  and  after  the

(a)
the board of directors of Canamax (or any committee thereof) accepts, recommends, approves, 
agrees to, endorses or enters into, or proposes publicly to accept, recommend, approve, agree 
to, endorse or enter into an agreement to implement a Canamax Superior Proposal;
(the above, if not timely cured, being (upon expiration of any applicable cure period) hereinafter referred

(b)
Liquidated Damages and Specific Performance
Each of Canamax and Powder acknowledges that the payment of the Canamax Termination 
Fee set out in Section 6.1 is a payment of liquidated damages and represents a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages that Canamax will suffer or incur as a result of the Canamax Damages 
Event giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement and is not a 
penalty.  Powder  irrevocably  waives  any  right  it  may  have  to  raise  as  a  defence  that  the 
Canamax  Termination  Fee  payable  by  it  is  excessive  or  punitive.  For  greater  certainty, 
Canamax  agrees  that  receipt  of  the  Canamax  Termination  Fee  pursuant  to  Section 6.1  is  the 
sole monetary remedy of Canamax hereunder. Nothing in this Article 6 will preclude Canamax 
from seeking and obtaining injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the 
covenants of Powder set out in this Agreement or in the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement or 
specific  performance  of  any  of  such  covenants  of  Powder,  without  the  necessity  of  posting 
bond or security in connection therewith.

manner contemplated by the ABCA, must be sent to and received by Powder by no later than 4:00 p.m. 
(Calgary  time)  on  the  second  Business  Day  immediately  prior  to  the  Powder  Meeting.  Powder

are  ultimately  determined  to  be  entitled  to  be  paid  by  Canamax  fair  value  for  the  Powder 
Shares  in  respect  of  which  they  have  exercised  Dissent  Rights  will  be  deemed  to  have 
irrevocably  transferred  such  Powder  Shares  to  Canamax  pursuant  to  Section 3.1(a)(i)  in 
consideration of such fair value; or
are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid by Canamax fair value for the Powder 
Shares  in  respect  of  which  they  have  exercised  Dissent  Rights  will  be  deemed  to  have
A - 6
participated  in  the  Arrangement  on  the  same  basis  as  a  Powder  Shareholder  who  has  not 
exercised Dissent Rights, as at and from the time specified in Section 3.1(b) and be entitled to 
receive only the consideration set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i);
but in no case will Powder or Canamax or any other Person be required to recognize such holders as 
holders of Powder Shares after the completion of the steps set forth in Section 3.1(a) or 3.1(b), as the case 
may be, and each Dissenting Shareholder will cease to be entitled to the rights of a Powder Shareholder in 
respect  of  the  Powder  Shares  in  relation  to  which  such  Dissenting  Shareholder  has  exercised  Dissent 
Rights and the central securities register of Powder will be amended to reflect that such former holder is 
no longer the holder of such Powder Shares as and from the Effective Time. For greater certainty, and in 
addition to any other restriction under the ABCA, a Powder Shareholder who has voted, or instructed a 
proxyholder to vote, in favour of the Powder Resolution will not be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights 
with respect to the Arrangement.

certificates  representing  the  aggregate  number  of  Canamax  Shares  comprising 
the Canamax Arrangement Shares required to be delivered by Canamax to the 
Powder Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) (calculated without reference

Powder Shares that were transferred to Canamax under Section 3.1(b)(i), together with a duly 
completed  Letter  of  Transmittal  and  such  additional  documents  and  instruments  as  the 
Depositary may reasonably require. As soon as practicable following the later of the Effective

transferred  to  Canamax  under  Section 3.1(b)(i),  together  with  a  duly  completed  Letter  of 
Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably 
require the former holder of such Powder Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor

case  of  both  clauses (i)  and  (ii)  of  this  Section 5.1(b),  any  amounts  withheld  pursuant  to 
Section 5.5, and any certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
(c)
Subject  to  Section 5.4,  until  surrendered  as  contemplated  by  this  Section 5.1,  each  certificate 
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Powder Shares that were transferred 
to  Canamax  under  Section 3.1(b)(i)  will  be  thereafter  deemed  to  represent  only  the  right  to
635551 v8
A - 7
receive  certificates  representing  that  number  of  Canamax  Shares  comprising  the  Canamax 
Arrangement  Shares  such holder  is  entitled  to  receive  pursuant  to Section 3.1(b)(i)  less, in  the

Section 5.5.
(d)
Canamax  will  cause  the  Depositary,  as  soon  as  a  former  holder  of  Powder  Shares  becomes 
entitled to receive the Canamax Shares in accordance with Section 5.1(b), to:

(iii)
forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage paid) to such former holder

if  requested  by  such  former  holder  in  the  Letter  of  Transmittal,  make  available  at  the 
offices of the Depositary specified in the Letter of Transmittal for pick-up by such former 
holder; or
if the Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an address as described in Section 5.1(d)(i) 
nor  contains  a  request  as  described  in  Section 5.1(d)(ii),  forward  or  cause  to  be 
forwarded by first class mail (postage paid) to such former holder at the address of such 
former holder as shown on the applicable securities register maintained by or on behalf 
of Powder immediately prior to the Effective Time;

which  such  former  holder  of  Powder  Shares  is  entitled  to  receive  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions hereof, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.5.
(e)
No former holder of Powder Shares will be entitled to receive any consideration with respect to 
such Powder Shares other than the Canamax Shares that such former holder of Powder Shares is 
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.1 and, for greater certainty, no such former holder 
will  be  entitled  to  receive  any  interest,  dividends,  premium  or  other  payment  in  connection 
therewith.
5.2
Fractional Shares
No fractional Canamax Shares comprising the Canamax Arrangement Shares will be issued in 
connection with the Arrangement. In the event that a former Powder Shareholder would otherwise be 
entitled to a fractional Canamax Share hereunder, the number of Canamax Shares issued to such Powder 
Shareholder will be rounded up to the next whole number of Canamax Shares if the fractional entitlement 
is equal to or greater than 0.5 and will, without any additional compensation, be rounded down to the 
next whole number of Canamax Shares if the fractional entitlement is less than 0.5. In calculating such 
fractional  interests,  all  Powder  Shares  registered  in  the  name  of  or  beneficially  held  by  such  Powder 
Shareholder or his/her/its nominee will be aggregated.
5.3
Loss of Certificates
In  the  event  any  certificate  which  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  represented  one  or 
more outstanding Powder Shares that were acquired by Canamax pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) has been 
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the former holder of such Powder 
Shares,  the  Depositary  will,  in  exchange  for  the  affidavit  in  respect  of  such  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed 
certificate,  deliver  to such former  holder  of  Powder Shares  the  Canamax Shares  such  former  holder  is 
entitled  to  receive  in  respect  of  such  Powder  Shares  pursuant  to  Section 3.1(b)(i)  less  any  amounts 
withheld  pursuant  to  Section 5.5.  When  authorizing  such  payment  in  relation  to  any  lost,  stolen  or 
destroyed  certificate,  the  former  holder  of  such  Powder  Shares  will,  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the
635551 v8
A - 8
delivery  thereof,  give  a  bond  satisfactory  to  Canamax  and  the  Depositary  or  otherwise  indemnify 
Powder,  Canamax  and  the  Depositary  against  any  claim  that  may  be  made  against  any  of  them  with 
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
5.4
Extinction of Rights
(a)
(b)
Any  certificate  which  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  represented  one  or  more 
outstanding  Powder  Shares  that  were  acquired  by  Canamax  pursuant  to  Section 3.1(b)(i) 
which is not deposited with the Depositary in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1 on 
or before the third anniversary of the Effective Date less one day will, on such day, cease to 
represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether as a securityholder or 
otherwise and whether against Powder, Canamax, the Depositary or any other Person. On such 
date,  the  Canamax Shares (including any  interest,  dividends,  premium, distribution  or  other 
payment in connection therewith held in trust for such former holder) such former holder of 
Powder  Shares  would  otherwise  have been  entitled  to  receive, will  be  deemed  to  have  been 
surrendered for no consideration to Canamax. Neither Powder nor Canamax will be liable to 
any Person in respect of any cash or securities (including any cash or securities previously held 
by  the  Depositary  in  trust  for  any  such  former  holder)  which  is  forfeited  to  Canamax  or 
delivered  to  any  public  official  pursuant  to  any  applicable  abandoned  property,  escheat  or 
similar law.
Any  certificates  representing  Canamax Shares  comprising  the  Canamax  Arrangement  Shares 
issued  by  the  Depositary  on  behalf  of  Canamax,  pursuant  to  this  Plan  of  Arrangement  that 
have not been returned to the Depositary or that otherwise remain unclaimed, in each case, on 
or before the third anniversary of the Effective Date less one day will, on such day, cease to 
represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether as a securityholder or 
otherwise and whether against Powder, Canamax, the Depositary or any other Person. On such 
date, the Canamax Shares comprising the Canamax Arrangement Shares such former holder of 
Powder  Shares  would  otherwise  have been  entitled  to  receive, will  be  deemed  to  have  been 
surrendered for no consideration to Canamax. Neither Powder nor Canamax will be liable to 
any Person in respect of any cash or securities (including any cash or securities previously held 
by  the  Depositary  in  trust  for  any  such  former  holder)  which  is  forfeited  to  Canamax  or 
delivered  to  any  public  official  pursuant  to  any  applicable  abandoned  property,  escheat  or 
similar law.
5.5
Withholding Rights
Powder, Canamax and the Depositary will be entitled to deduct, withhold and remit from any 
consideration otherwise payable to any Powder Shareholder or Powder Optionholder under this Plan of 
Arrangement (including any payment to Dissenting Shareholders) such amounts as Powder, Canamax or 
the Depositary is required to deduct, withhold and remit with respect to such payment under the Tax 
Act,  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended,  and  the  rules  and  regulations  promulgated 
thereunder, or any provision of any provincial, state, local or foreign tax law as counsel may advise is 
required to be so deducted and withheld by Powder, Canamax or the Depositary, as the case may be. For 
the  purposes  hereof,  all  such  withheld  amounts  will  be  treated  as  having  been  paid  to  the  Person  in 
respect  of  which  such  deduction  and  withholding  was  made  on  account  of  the  obligation  to  make 
payment  to  such  Person  hereunder,  provided  that  such  deducted  or  withheld  amounts  are  actually 
remitted  to  the  appropriate  Governmental  Authority  by  or  on  behalf  of  Powder,  Canamax  or  the 
Depositary, as the case may be.  To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld 
from  any  payment  to  a  holder  exceeds  the  cash  portion  of  the  consideration  otherwise  payable  to  the 
holder, any of Powder, Canamax or the Depositary is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of 
such other portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Powder, Canamax or
635551 v8
A - 9
the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with all deduction or withholding requirements 
applicable to it, and Powder, Canamax and the Depositary will notify the holder thereof and remit to the 
holder thereof any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.

Any transfer or exchange of securities pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement will be free and clear
of any Liens.

Except  with  respect  to  changes  in  commodity  prices  and  royalties,  the  effect  of  actual 
production  of  oil,  natural  gas  and  other  petroleum  substances  on  reserves  estimates  and  as 
otherwise disclosed to Canamax, Powder has no knowledge of any adverse material change in 
any  production,  cost,  reserves  or  other  relevant  information  provided  to  GLJ  since  the  dates 
that  such  information  was  so  provided.  Powder  believes  that  the  Powder  Reserves  Report 
reasonably  estimated  the  quantity  and  net  present  values  of  future  net  revenues,  on  an 
aggregate  basis,  of  the  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  attributed  to  the  crude  oil,  natural  gas 
liquids and natural gas properties evaluated in the Powder Reserves Report as at September 30, 
2014, based upon information available at the time the Powder Reserves Report was prepared 
and the pricing and other assumptions set out therein.
There  is  no  court,  administrative,  regulatory  or  similar  proceeding  (whether  civil,  quasi-

Schedule 4.1),  against  or  involving  Powder  or  any  Powder  Subsidiary,  or  in  respect  of  the 
businesses, properties or assets of Powder or any Powder Subsidiary, (whether in progress or, 
to the knowledge of Powder, threatened), that if adversely determined, would reasonably be 
expected to have a material adverse effect on Powder or to materially impede the completion of 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the knowledge of Powder, no event 
has occurred that might reasonably be expected to give rise to any such proceeding. There is no 
judgment,  writ,  decree,  injunction,  rule,  award  or  order  of  any  Governmental  Authority  or 
arbitrator  outstanding  against  Powder  or  any  Powder  Subsidiary  that  has  had  or  would 
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Powder or to materially impede the 
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
