Forward-Looking Statements and Risk
This report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts included or incorporated by
reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial
position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and
objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Such forward-
looking statements are based on our examination of historical operating trends, the information
that was used to prepare our estimate of proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, and other
data in our possession or available from third parties. In addition, forward-looking statements
generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,”
“expect,” “intend,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” or “continue” or similar terminology.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include,
but are not limited to, our assumptions about:
•the market prices of oil, natural gas, NGLs and other products or services;
•the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, NGLs and other products or services;
•pipeline and gathering system capacity;
•production and reserve levels;
•drilling risks;
•economic and competitive conditions;
•the availability of capital resources;
•
•capital expenditure and other contractual obligations;
•weather conditions;
•inflation rates;
•the availability of goods and services;
•legislative or regulatory changes, including environmental regulation;
•terrorism and cyber-attacks;
•occurrence of property acquisitions or divestitures;
the securities or capital markets and related risks such as general credit, liquidity, market and
interest-rate risks; and
other factors disclosed under Items 1 and 2 – “Business and Properties — Estimated Proved
Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows,” Item 1A – “Risk Factors,” Item 7 – “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Item 7A –
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” and elsewhere in our most
recently filed Form 10-K.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Partnership, or
persons acting on its behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements.
We assume no duty to update or revise our forward-looking statements based on changes in
internal estimates or expectations or otherwise.

APACHE OFFSHORE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Apache Offshore Investment Partnership, a Delaware general partnership (the Investment
Partnership), was formed on October 31, 1983, consisting of Apache Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (Apache or the Managing Partner), as Managing Partner and public investors (the
Investing Partners). The Investment Partnership invested its entire capital in Apache Offshore
Petroleum Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). The
primary business of the Investment Partnership is to serve as the sole limited partner of the
Operating Partnership. The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of both the
Investment Partnership and the Operating Partnership. The term “Partnership”, as used herein,
refers to the Investment Partnership or the Operating Partnership, as the case may be.
These financial statements have been prepared by the Partnership, without audit, pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They reflect all
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results
for the interim periods, on a basis consistent with the annual audited financial statements. All
such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain information, accounting policies, and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Partnership believes that the disclosures are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015, which contains a summary of the Partnership’s significant accounting
policies and other disclosures.
 
1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership’s significant accounting policies are consistent with those
discussed in Note 2 of its consolidated financial statements contained in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserve
quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom and the
assessment of asset retirement obligations. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Oil and Gas Property
The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this
method of accounting, all costs incurred for both successful and unsuccessful exploration and
development activities, and oil and gas property acquisitions are capitalized. The net book value
of oil and gas properties may not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling limitation is the
estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent per
annum. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an
unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the
previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by
contractual arrangements. For a discussion of the calculation of estimated future net cash flows,
please refer to Note 10-Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures to the consolidated financial
statements contained in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015.
Any excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties over the ceiling is charged to
expense and reflected as “Additional depreciation, depletion and amortization” in the
accompanying statement of consolidated operations. Such limitations are tested quarterly. The
Partnership recorded non-cash write-downs of the carrying value of its proved oil and gas
properties totaling $1,392,268 during the second quarter of 2016 and $2,664,153 during the first
six months of 2016.

New Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a joint revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09.
The new standard removes inconsistencies in existing standards, changes the way companies
recognize revenue from contracts with customers, and increases disclosure requirements. The
guidance requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to
customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which
provides further clarification on the principal versus agent evaluation. The guidance is effective
for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2017. The standard is required
to be adopted using either the full retrospective approach, with all prior periods presented
adjusted, or the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative adjustment to retained
earnings on the opening balance sheet. The Partnership is currently evaluating the level of effort
needed to implement the standard, the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated
financial statements, and whether to use the full retrospective approach or the modified
retrospective approach.
2.    RECEIVABLE FROM / PAYABLE TO APACHE CORPORATION
The receivable from/payable to Apache represents the net result of the Investing Partners’
revenue received and expenditures paid in the current month. Generally, cash in this amount will
be paid by Apache to the Partnership or transferred to Apache in the month after the
Partnership’s transactions are processed and the net results of operations are determined.
3.    RIGHT OF PRESENTMENT
As provided in the Partnership Agreement, as amended (the “Amended Partnership Agreement”),
a first right of presentment valuation was computed during the first quarter of 2016. The per-unit
value was determined to be $6,057 based on the valuation date of December 31, 2015. The
Partnership did not repurchase any Investing Partner Units (Units) during the first six months of
2016 as a result of the limited amount of cash available for discretionary purposes. The
Partnership is not in a position to predict how many Units will be presented for repurchase during
the remainder of 2016 and cannot, at this time, determine if the Partnership will have sufficient
funds available to repurchase any Units. The per-unit right of presentment value computed during
the first quarter of 2015 was determined to be $9,765 based on the valuation date of
December 31, 2014. The Partnership did not repurchase any Units during the first six months of
2015. Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has no obligation to
purchase any Units presented to the extent it determines that it has insufficient funds for such
purchases.
4.    ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The following table describes the changes to the Partnership’s asset retirement obligation
liability for the first six months of 2016:
Asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2015$1,852,113

$1,367,196
5.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the Partnership’s
consolidated balance sheet. As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts
of the Partnership’s current assets and current liabilities approximated fair value because of the
short-term nature or maturity of these instruments.
The Partnership did not use derivative financial instruments or otherwise engage in hedging
activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion relates to Apache Offshore Investment Partnership (the Partnership)
and should be read in conjunction with the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included under Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, as well as its consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes and related
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
included in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015.
The Partnership’s business is participation in oil and gas exploration, development and
production activities on federal lease tracts in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana and Texas.
Results of Operations
Net Income and Revenue
The Partnership reported a net loss of $1.5 million ($1,452 per Limited Partner Unit) for the
second quarter of 2016 compared to net income of $45,439 ($11 per Limited Partner Unit) in the
second quarter of 2015. The 2016 loss included a $1.4 million non-cash write-down in the
carrying value of the Partnership's oil and gas properties and reduced revenues as a result of
lower oil and gas prices compared to the prior year.
For the first six months of 2016, the Partnership reported a net loss of $2.9 million ($2,827 per
Limited Partner Unit) compared to net income of $14,168 ($34 loss per Limited Partner Unit on
total Limited Partner loss of $34,369) in the comparable period of 2015. The 2016 loss included
$2.7 million of non-cash write-downs in the carrying value of the Partnership's oil and gas
properties and reduced revenues as a result of lower oil and gas prices compared to the prior
year.
Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 decreased 25 percent from the second quarter of
2015 on lower oil, gas, and NGL prices in 2016. As noted in the table below, oil, gas and NGL
prices in the quarter declined 29 percent, 31 percent and 21 percent, respectively, from a year
ago. Total revenues in the first six months of 2016 decreased 30 percent from the first six months
of 2015 on lower oil, gas, and NGL prices in 2016.
The Partnership’s oil, gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) production volume and price information
is summarized in the following table (gas volumes are presented in thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per
day):

Oil and Gas Sales
Reflecting lower oil prices in 2016, the Partnership’s crude oil sales for the second quarter of
2016 totaled $296,166 compared to $397,653 of crude oil sales in the second quarter of 2015.
The Partnership’s average realized price in the second quarter of 2016 decreased $17.07 per
barrel from the second quarter of 2015, reducing sales by $113,940. Crude oil volumes increased
to 77 barrels per day as recompletions at South Timbalier 295 in 2015 more than offset the
impact of natural depletion.
Natural gas sales in the second quarter of 2016 totaled $62,232 down 14 percent from the
amount realized in 2015. The Partnership’s average realized natural gas price for the quarter
decreased $0.81 per Mcf, or 31 percent, from the first quarter of 2015, reducing sales by $22,116
from a year ago. Natural gas volumes increased 24 percent from the second quarter of 2015 as a
result of recompletions at South Timbalier 295 in 2015 and Ship Shoal 258/259 in 2016.

During the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership sold 16 barrels per day of natural gas liquids
compared to 20 barrels per day in 2015. The decrease reflected lower processed volumes at
South Timbalier 295 in 2016. The Partnership’s average NGL price for the current quarter
decreased 21 percent from a year ago to $14.95 per barrel.
Crude oil sales for the first six months of 2016 totaled $0.5 million, down 30 percent from the
same period in 2015. The Partnership’s average realized oil price for the first six months of 2016
decreased 36 percent from the first six months of 2015, dropping to $37.46 per barrel in 2016.
The Partnership’s crude oil volumes increased from 73 barrels per day during the first six months
of 2015 to 79 barrels per day during the same period of 2016 as a result of recompletions at
South Timbalier 295.
Natural gas sales for the first six months of 2016 decreased 26 percent from a year ago, dropping
to $122,563 in the current period from $164,912 during the first six months of 2015. The
Partnership’s average realized gas prices decreased from $2.86 per Mcf in the first six months of
2015 to $1.95 per Mcf in 2016, reducing sales by $52,455. A 27 Mcf per day, or 8 percent
increase in natural gas volumes during the first six months of 2016 from the same period a year
ago increased sales by $10,106. The Partnership’s increase in gas production in 2016 primarily
reflected the recompletions at South Timbalier 295.
The Partnership sold 12 barrels per day of natural gas liquids in the first six months of 2016,
down from 14 barrels per day in the first six months of 2015. The decrease reflected lower
processed volumes at South Timbalier 295 in 2016. NGL prices for the first six months decreased
23 percent from a year ago, dropping to $14.74 per barrel in 2016.
Since the Partnership does not anticipate acquiring additional acreage or conducting exploratory
drilling on leases in which it currently holds an interest, declines in oil and gas production can be
expected in future periods as a result of natural depletion. Also, given the small number of
producing wells owned by the Partnership and exposure to inclement weather and pipeline
interruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, the Partnership’s production during the remainder of 2016 and
beyond may be subject to more volatility than those companies with a larger or more diversified
property portfolio.
Operating Expenses
The Partnership’s recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rate, expressed as
a percentage of oil and gas sales, was approximately 43 percent for the second quarter of 2016
and 25 percent for the second quarter of 2015. DD&A, expressed as a percentage of oil and gas
sales, for the first six months of 2016 and 2015 was 43 percent and 24 percent, respectively. The
increase in the rate as a percentage of oil and gas sales in 2016 reflected the impact of declining
oil and gas prices. The dollar amount of recurring DD&A expense for the first six months of 2016
increased from the comparable period a year ago as a result of the higher DD&A rate.
Under the full cost method of accounting, the Partnership is required to review the carrying value
of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and
gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A, may not exceed the present value of estimated future
net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent per annum. Estimated
future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic
average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat
for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. As a
result of the ceiling limitation, the Partnership wrote-down the carrying value of its oil and gas
properties by approximately $1.4 million during the second quarter of 2016 and $2.7 million
during the first six months of 2016. The write-downs are reflected as additional DD&A expense.
If commodity prices do not recover from current levels, the Partnership may be required to
recognize a non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in the second
half of 2016. The Partnership’s full cost ceiling limitation at the end of the current quarter was
calculated using a historical 12-month pricing average that included oil prices from the third
quarter of 2015 which were higher than current commodity futures prices
The Partnership recognized $19,767 in asset retirement obligation accretion for the second
quarter of 2016 compared to $32,499 for the second quarter of 2015. For the six month periods,
the Partnership recognized $39,249 in asset retirement obligation accretion for 2016 compared to
$64,530 for 2015. The declines reflected the abandonment of Matagorda Island 681 and North
Padre Island 969/976 in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Lease operating expenses (LOE) for the second quarter of 2016 of $156,693 decreased six
percent from the second quarter of 2015 with the reduced cost resulting from permanently
shutting-in North Padre Island 969/976 for abandonment. LOE for the first six months of 2016 of
$316,264 decreased 25 percent from the comparable period in 2015 as a result of permanently
shutting-in North Padre Island 969/976 for abandonment and temporarily shutting-in Ship Shoal
258/259 for third-party pipeline repairs during the first quarter of 2016.

Gathering and transportation costs for the delivery of oil and gas totaled $30,682 in the second
quarter of 2016 compared to $39,176 in the comparable period in 2015. The decline in
transportation cost in 2016 was a result of a change in marketing arrangements on the South
Timbalier 295 oil where transportation is deducted from the oil sales prices instead of paid
separately. Gathering and transportation costs during the first six months of 2016 totaled $78,620
compared to $68,407 for the first six months of 2015. The increase for the six month period was a
result of higher oil and gas volumes in 2016 and additional cost related to prior production that
was passed on by the operator of South Timbalier 295 during 2016.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
The Partnership’s primary capital resource is net cash provided by operating activities. During
the first six months of 2016, the Partnership had $341,378 of negative cash from operating
activities as the Partnership funded liabilities for accrued asset retirement obligations and
operating expenses. The Partnership had positive cash provided by operations totaling $250,599
in the first six months of 2015.
At June 30, 2016, the Partnership had approximately $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents,
down from approximately $5.2 million at December 31, 2015 as the Partnership paid accrued
asset retirement obligations and operating expenses during the first half of 2016. The
Partnership’s goal is to maintain cash and cash equivalents at least sufficient to cover the
undiscounted value of its future asset retirement obligation liability. The Partnership also plans to
reserve funds for repairs which may disrupt the Partnership’s production and for future
recompletion operations.
The Partnership’s future financial condition, results of operations, and cash from operating
activities will largely depend upon prices received for its oil and natural gas production. A
substantial portion of the Partnership’s production is sold under market-sensitive contracts.
Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market
uncertainty, and a variety of factors beyond the Partnership’s control. These factors include
worldwide political and economic conditions, the foreign and domestic supply of oil and natural
gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of consumer demand, weather, and the price and
availability of alternative fuels.
The Partnership’s oil and gas reserves and production will also significantly impact future results
of operations and cash from operating activities. The Partnership’s production is subject to
fluctuations in response to remaining quantities of oil and gas reserves, weather, pipeline
capacity, consumer demand, mechanical performance and workover, recompletion and drilling
activities. Declines in oil and gas production can be expected in future years as a result of normal
depletion and the non-participation in acquisition or exploration activities by the Partnership.
Based on production estimates from independent engineers and current market conditions, the
Partnership forecasts it will be able to meet its liquidity needs for routine operations in the
foreseeable future. The Partnership will reduce capital expenditures and distributions to partners
as cash from operating activities declines.
In the event that future short-term operating cash requirements are greater than the Partnership’s
financial resources, the Partnership may seek short-term, interest-bearing advances from the
Managing Partner as needed. The Managing Partner, however, is not obligated to make loans to
the Partnership.
On an ongoing basis, the Partnership reviews the possible sale of lower value properties prior to
incurring associated dismantlement and abandonment costs.
Capital Commitments
The Partnership’s primary needs for cash are for operating expenses, drilling and recompletion
expenditures, future dismantlement and abandonment costs, distributions to Investing Partners,
and the purchase of Units offered by Investing Partners under the right of presentment. To the
extent there is discretion, the Partnership allocates available capital to investment in the
Partnership’s properties so as to maximize production and resultant cash flow. The Partnership
had no outstanding debt or lease commitments at June 30, 2016. The Partnership did not have
any contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016, other than the liability for dismantlement and
abandonment costs of its oil and gas properties. The Partnership has recorded a separate
liability for the present value of this asset retirement obligation as discussed in the notes to the
financial statements included in the Partnership’s latest annual report on Form 10-K.
During the first six months of 2016 the Partnership's cash outlays for capital expenditures for
additions to oil and gas properties totaled $34,160 as it participated in a recompletion project at
Ship Shoal 258/259 during the period. The Partnership’s cash outlays for capital expenditures
during the first six months of 2015 totaled $16,335 as the Partnership participated in a
recompletion project at South Timbalier 295 during the period. During the first six months of
2016, the Partnership made cash outlays of $290,458 on accrued asset retirement obligations
incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015.
8
Based on information supplied by the operators of the properties, the Partnership anticipates
capital expenditures of less than $0.1 million during the remainder of 2016 as no new drilling
projects are currently planned for 2016. Capital estimates may change based on realized prices,
changes by the operator to the development plan, pipeline construction or modifications, or
changes in government regulations.
Because of low oil and gas prices and the need to reserve cash for future asset retirement
obligations, no distributions were made to Investing Partners during the first six months of 2016.
The Partnership also made no distribution to Investing Partners during the first six months of
2015 as a result of low product prices and the large amount of pending plugging costs for
Matagorda Island 681 and North Padre Island 969/976.
The amount of future distributions will be dependent on actual and expected production levels,
realized and anticipated oil and gas prices, expected drilling and recompletion expenditures, and
prudent cash reserves for future dismantlement and abandonment costs that will be incurred after
the Partnership’s reserves are depleted. The Partnership’s goal is to maintain cash and cash
equivalents in the Partnership at least sufficient to cover the undiscounted value of its future
asset retirement obligations. The Partnership will review available cash balances, any
development or abandonment plans submitted by the operators of the Partnership’s properties,
and the factors noted above to determine whether there are sufficient funds to make a distribution
to Investing Partners during the second half of 2016.
As provided in the Amended Partnership Agreement, a first right of presentment valuation was
computed during the first quarter of 2016. The per-unit value was determined to be $6,057 based
on the valuation date of December 31, 2015. The Partnership did not repurchase any Investing
Partner Units (Units) during the first half of 2016 as a result of the Partnership’s limited amount of
cash available for discretionary purposes. The Partnership is not in a position to predict how
many Units will be presented for repurchase during the remainder of 2016 and cannot, at this
time, determine if the Partnership will have sufficient funds available to repurchase any units.
Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has no obligation to
repurchase any Units presented to the extent it determines that it has insufficient funds for such
purchases.

ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Commodity Risk
The Partnership’s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas
production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and
spot prices applicable to its natural gas production. Prices received for the Partnership’s crude
oil, natural gas, and NGLs have historically been and continue to be very volatile because of
unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, political climate, and
global supply and demand. The Partnership did not use derivative financial instruments or
otherwise engage in hedging activities during the first six months of 2016 or 2015.
The information set forth under “Commodity Risk” in Item 7A of the Partnership’s Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, is incorporated by reference. Information about market risks
for the current quarter is not materially different.
ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
John J. Christmann IV, the Managing Partner’s Chief Executive Officer and President (in his
capacity as principal executive officer), and Stephen J. Riney, the Managing Partner’s Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (in his capacity as principal financial officer),
evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
June 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation and as of
the date of that evaluation, these officers concluded that the Partnership’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective, providing effective means to ensure that the information it is required
to disclose under applicable laws and regulations is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified under the Commission’s rules and forms and
communicated to our management, including the Managing Partner’s principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered
by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
