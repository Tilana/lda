<p><b>  Report of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the question  
of human rights in Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretary-General</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> The present report has been prepared in accordance with the mandate contained in 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 4 (XXXI) of 1975. Moreover, at its forty-third 
session in 1987, the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1987/50 entitled 
&#8220;Question of human rights in Cyprus&#8221;, which, inter alia, reiterated its previous calls for the 
full restoration of all human rights to the population of Cyprus, in particular to refugees; 
called for the tracing of and accounting for missing persons in Cyprus without any further 
delay; and called for the restoration and respect of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of all Cypriots, including freedom of movement, the freedom of settlement and 
the right to property. It is in this light that this report reflects a variety of human rights 
concerns. 
</p>
<p> In its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General 
and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of their 
activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. The Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 to preserve the 
previous annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the 
Council. The last annual report on the question of human rights in Cyprus was submitted to 
the Council at its tenth session in March 2009 (A/HRC/10/37). 
 The annex to this note, prepared by OHCHR and covering the period up to 31 
December 2009, is herewith transmitted to the Council. It provides an overview of human 
rights issues in Cyprus based on the available information. For the purpose of this report, in 
the absence of an OHCHR field presence in Cyprus, or of any specific monitoring 
mechanism, OHCHR has relied on a variety of sources with particular knowledge of the 
human rights situation on the island.

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the question 
of human rights in Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>1. As of December 2009, Cyprus remains divided, with a buffer zone maintained by 
the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The UNFICYP mandate, 
which dates back to 1964, has been extended by successive Security Council resolutions. In 
resolution 1898 (2009) of 14 December 2009, the Security Council decided to extend the 
mandate for a further period ending 15 June 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. As mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General on his mission of good offices 
in Cyprus (S/2009/610), the process of full-fledged negotiations under United Nations 
auspices aimed at a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem was formally 
launched on 3 September 2008. In early August 2009, the first phase of discussions of six 
chapters, namely governance and power-sharing, property, European Union matters, 
economic matters, territory, and security and guarantees, was concluded. The second phase 
began on 11 September 2009, focusing in particular on governance and power-sharing, the 
election of the executive, federal competencies and external relations.1 
</p>
<p>3. Four technical committees set up in the areas of crime and criminal matters, cultural 
heritage, health, and environment have met regularly and made some progress in 
implementing the 23 confidence-building measures agreed upon by the parties during the 
preparatory phase of the talks, aimed at improving the daily life of Cypriots across the 
entire island.2 
</p>
<p>4. In his May 2009 report on UNFICYP, the Secretary-General reported that the 
mission continued to facilitate humanitarian assistance to the communities, including to 
Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the northern part of the island.3 In his November 
2009 report, the Secretary-General stated that assistance continues to be sought from 
UNFICYP in addressing day-to-day issues arising from the division of the island, including 
in relation to educational matters, the transfer of deceased individuals, and commemorative, 
religious and sociocultural gatherings.4  
</p>
<p>5. UNFICYP has continued its efforts aimed at confidence-building between the Greek 
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in the village of Pyla in the buffer zone. In 
cooperation with an international non-governmental organization, the mission facilitated six 
bicommunal events involving children from Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot schools in 
Pyla. The planning process for a new programme of bicommunal activities for children was 
suspended in the absence of agreement between the two sides.5

<p><b> II. Human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>6. The persisting division of Cyprus continues to have consequences in relation to a 
number of human rights issues on the whole island, including freedom of movement, 
human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons, property rights, discrimination, 
freedom of religion, the right to education and economic rights. The United Nations 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its concluding observations 
following consideration of the fourth and fifth periodic reports of Cyprus, viewed the 
continuous partition as a major difficulty hindering the ability of the State party to ensure 
the implementation of the Covenant throughout the country.6 The Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council reviewed the human rights 
situation in Cyprus in the context of its universal periodic review (UPR) process, at its sixth 
session in November 2009. The report of the Working Group was adopted on 4 December 
2009 and contains 70 specific recommendations made by Member States on all aspects of 
the human rights situation in Cyprus.7  
</p>
<p><b>  Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>7. With regard to freedom of movement, UNFICYP recorded approximately 873,700 
crossings through the buffer zone during the period from November 2008 to May 2009 and 
approximately 928,200 in the period from May to November 2009.8 On the issue of returns, 
the requests made by 11 Greek Cypriot and 44 Maronite internally displaced and refugee 
families wanting to return to, and permanently reside in, the north are still pending, due to 
differences over eligibility criteria for permanent returns.9 In June 2009 an agreement was 
reached to open a seventh crossing point between the communities and through the buffer 
zone to the north-west of the island, linking the villages of Limnitis/Ye&#351;ilirmak in the north, 
and Kato Pyrgos in the south.10 
</p>
<p><b>  Human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) continued the exhumation, identification 
and return of the remains of missing persons. By December 2009, the remains of 585 
individuals had been exhumed on both sides of the buffer zone by the Committee&#8217;s 
bicommunal teams of archaeologists; the remains of 352 missing persons had undergone 
examination at the Committee&#8217;s bicommunal anthropological laboratory in the United 
Nations Protected Area in Nicosia; and the remains of 196 individuals had been returned to 
their respective families.11 In March 2009, the CMP was invited by the Committee of 
Ministers of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to present its activities. The Ministers&#8217; 
Deputies noted with great interest the exchange of views with members of the CMP, 
considered that it was crucial that the current work of the CMP should continue and

 E/C.12/CYP/CO/5, para. 8. The Government of Cyprus, in its comments on the concluding 
</p>
<p>observations emphasized that &#8220;the division of the country [&#8230;] is not merely &#8216;a major difficulty which 
hinders the ability of the State party to ensure the implementation of the Covenant throughout the 
country&#8217; but also generates new obstacles to its effective implementation&#8221;. The Government noted in 
this regard that approximately 99 per cent of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers arrive in the 
Government-controlled area through the northern part of the island (E/C.12/CYP/CO/5/Add.1, paras. 
4 and 5).

</p>
<p>underlined the need for the Committee to have access to all information and places relevant 
to missing persons.12 
</p>
<p>9. On 18 September 2009, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights 
(the Court) adopted a judgement in the case of <i>Varnava and Others v. Turkey</i>.13 The 
applications had been introduced before the Court in the name and on behalf of 18 Cypriot 
nationals, 9 of whom had disappeared during military operations carried out by the Turkish 
army in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974. The applicants alleged that their relatives 
had disappeared after being detained by Turkish military forces in 1974 and that the 
Turkish authorities had not accounted for them since. The Court concluded that there was a 
continuing violation of article 2 (right to life) of the European Convention on Human 
Rights (ECHR) on account of Turkey&#8217;s failure to effectively investigate the fate of the 9 
men who disappeared in 1974.14 The Court also concluded that there was a continuing 
violation of article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the ECHR, due to 
the length of time over which the ordeal of the relatives had been dragged out and official 
indifference in the face of their acute anxiety to know the fate of their close family 
members.15 The Court concluded that there was a continuing violation of article 5 (right to 
liberty and security) of the ECHR. 
10. In the case of <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> concerning the question of missing persons, the 
Council of Europe Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies (CoE CMD) at its December 2009 
session, took note with satisfaction of the information provided by the Turkish authorities 
on the progress of the work of the CMP and, in particular, on the measures taken to 
promote its acceleration. CoE CMD encouraged the Turkish authorities to take concrete 
measures to ensure the CMP had access to all relevant information and places, without 
impeding the confidentiality which is essential to the implementation of its mandate. 
Furthermore, CoE CMD invited the Turkish authorities to inform it of concrete measures 
that they could envisage in continuing the work of the CMP, with a view to ensuring that 
the effective investigations required by the judgement were undertaken.16 
</p>
<p><b>  Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>11. As in previous years, property rights remain the main issue of concern. CoE CMD 
continues to supervise the execution of Court judgements on landmark property cases from 
previous years. In the case of <i>Loizidou v. Turkey </i>(1996), where the Court ruled that the

</p>

 Council of Europe Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies Decisions adopted at the 1051st meeting, 19 
</p>
<p>March 2009, in the case of <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> (25781/94). 
 
</p>
<p>13 On 10 January 2008, the Chamber issued its judgement, after which the case was referred to the 
Grand Chamber on 7 July 2008 at the request of the Turkish Government.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 The Court noted that the Turkish Government had not put forward any concrete information to show 
</p>
<p>that any of the missing men had been found dead or had been killed in the conflict zone under their 
control, nor had there been any other convincing explanation as to what might have happened to them 
that could counter the applicants&#8217; claims that the men had disappeared in areas under the exclusive 
control of the Turkish Government.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 The Court recalled its finding in the fourth inter-State case that in the context of the disappearances in 
</p>
<p>1974, where the military operation had resulted in considerable loss of life and large-scale detentions, 
the relatives of the missing men had suffered the agony of not knowing whether their family members 
had been killed or taken into detention. Furthermore, the Court also recalled that due to the continuing 
division of Cyprus, the relatives had been faced with very serious obstacles in their search for 
information and that the silence of the Turkish authorities in the face of those real concerns could 
only be categorized as inhuman treatment. The Court found no reason to differ from the above 
finding.

</b></p>
<p>applicant remained the legal owner of her property situated in the north, despite having lost 
control thereof due to lack of access, it is recalled that CoE CMD invited the Turkish 
authorities to make an offer to the applicant to comply with their obligation to put an end to 
the violation found and to remedy its consequences. In reply the Turkish Cypriot authorities 
made an offer based on Law No. 67/2005 on the compensation, exchange or restitution of 
immovable property. It is further recalled that following the judgement of the Court of 22 
December 2005 in the case <i>Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey</i>, this law established a compensation, 
exchange and restitution mechanism in the northern part of the island. CoE CMD noted that 
the Court is currently seized of the question of the effectiveness of this established 
mechanism and that its conclusions on this point might be decisive for the execution of this 
judgement.17 
12. In relation to the <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> case (2001),18 CoE CMD at its September 2009 
session examined the questions of the property rights of enclaved persons and the property 
rights of displaced persons. Concerning the property rights of enclaved persons, CoE CMD 
noted that a certain number of questions still need to be examined in depth and to this effect 
invited the Turkish authorities to provide before 15 December 2009 a copy of the entirety 
of the legislation as amended, and related decisions relevant for the examination of this 
issue, in particular the entire text of Law No. 41/77.19 Concerning the property rights of 
displaced persons, at its December 2009 session CoE CMD again referred to the critical 
deliberations under way in the European Court of Human Rights. CoE CMD recalled that in 
the meantime it is important that all possibilities of settlement offered by the mechanism, in 
particular on restitution of property, be preserved (protective measures).20 
13. The Committee of Ministers at its December 2009 meeting decided to resume 
examination of the <i>Demades v. Turkey</i> case (2003)21 at the latest at their 1086th meeting 
(June 2010), in the light of information to be provided by the Turkish authorities on the

 Council of Europe Committee of Ministers, Ministers&#8217; Deputies Decisions, notes on the <i>Loizidou v. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Turkey</i> case (15318/89). 
 
</p>
<p>18
 The European Court held that the matters complained of by Cyprus in its application entailed the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of Turkey under the ECHR. In its judgement, it held that there had been 14 violations 
of the Convention, grouped by the Committee of Ministers into 4 categories: (1) the question of 
missing persons; (2) the living conditions of Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus; (3) the rights of 
Turkish Cypriots living in northern Cyprus; and (4) the question of the homes and property of 
displaced persons.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19
 Following the judgement of 22 December 2005 in the <i>Xenides-Arestis</i> case, an Immovable Property 
</p>
<p>Commission (IPC) was set up under Law No. 67/2005 on the compensation, exchange or restitution 
of immovable property. According to the information available to the Council of Europe Committee 
of Ministers as of June 2009, the total number of requests addressed to the IPC had reached 395. In 
326 cases, the applicants had asked for monetary compensation to the value of their property, and in 
14 cases an exchange of property. The IPC has reportedly concluded 59 friendly settlements (in 4 
cases they stipulated the restitution of property at issue, in 1 case restitution &#8220;once the Cyprus 
problem has been solved&#8221;, in 52 cases compensation in the amount of the current value of the 
property and in 2 cases the exchange of property). By November 2009, the number of requests had 
reached 432, of which 81 had reportedly been resolved &#8220;amicably&#8221;, with maximum compensation of 
&#163;12 million paid to the Severis family. Source: &#8220;Record Agreement was Timed for Best Effect&#8221;,

 This case concerns the violation of the applicant&#8217;s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his property

and enjoyment of them since 1974.  </p>

</p>
<p>measures they envisage taking to remedy the consequences of the continued violation of the 
right to property and right to respect for the applicant&#8217;s home.22 
</p>
<p>14. The <i>Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey</i> case (2006),23 which deals with the issue of displaced 
persons and violation of their property rights in the north, was again discussed by the CoE 
Committee of Ministers at its December 2009 meeting. It was recalled that the Chairman of 
the Committee of Ministers had sent a letter to the Turkish authorities informing them of 
the Committee&#8217;s continuing concern relating to the lack of information on the payment of 
the sums awarded by the judgement of the European Court of 7 December 2006. The 
Ministers&#8217; Deputies expressed regret that this letter remained unanswered at the time of the 
meeting in December 2009 and instructed the CoE secretariat to prepare a draft interim 
resolution for the next examination of this case, unless the Turkish authorities have by then 
provided relevant information on the steps taken towards payment of the above-mentioned 
compensation.24 
</p>
<p>15. In the case of <i>Alexandrou v. Turkey</i>, where the applicant alleged that the occupation 
of the northern part of the island had prevented her from having access to her properties, in 
July 2009 the Court noted that an agreement was reached between the parties involved. The 
Court was satisfied that the settlement was based on respect for human rights and decided 
to remove the remainder of the application from its list of cases.25 
</p>
<p>16. As concerns the <i>Orams v. Apostolides</i> case (reference for a preliminary ruling from 
the Court of Appeal (England and Wales)), the European Court of Justice on 28 April 2009 
held that the judgement of the court in Cyprus deciding a claim over property in the north is 
enforceable, although it concerns an area over which the Government does not exercise 
effective control.26 
</p>
<p>17. The national report submitted by Cyprus in the framework of the UPR states that 
abandoned Turkish Cypriot properties in the south come under the management and 
custody of the Minister of Interior. The Government stated that Turkish Cypriots who 
return from the northern part of the island or abroad and live permanently in the 
Government-controlled areas are entitled, with the consent of the custodian, to use their 
properties. The report mentions that there are several cases in which Turkish Cypriot 
houses and agricultural lands have been returned to the legal owners. In cases where Greek 
Cypriot displaced persons have been temporarily using those properties, the report states 
that measures are taken by the Government to provide all necessary help under alternative 
provisions. According to the report, compulsory acquisition or requisition of Turkish 
Cypriot properties, as for all properties, is only allowed under the Constitution and the law, 
if the public interest is served. Just and equitable compensation, as provided for by the 
Constitution and the law, is deposited in the special fund of the custodian. The report also 
mentions that Turkish Cypriot owners, who settled permanently abroad before 1974 or are 
residing in Government-controlled areas, are immediately eligible for payments, while

 The case concerns the violation of the applicant&#8217;s right to respect for her home (situated in

Cyprus and consequent loss of control thereof.

<p>affected persons living in the northern part of the island are eligible for compensation after 
a solution to the Cyprus question is reached.27 
</p>
<p><b>  Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>18. In its concluding observations on the fourth and fifth periodic reports of Cyprus in 
May 2009, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed its deep 
concern that de facto discrimination persists against, inter alia, Turkish Cypriots. The 
Committee also noted with concern the absence of anti-discrimination case law and the fact 
that Turkish Cypriots continue to face administrative and linguistic obstacles in obtaining 
official documents. The Committee recommended that the Government take all appropriate 
measures to overcome administrative and linguistic obstacles faced by Turkish Cypriots to 
obtain official documents.28 
</p>
<p>19. At the same session, the Committee noted with regret that in spite of the amendment 
of the 2007 law, children of women with displaced person status are not entitled to a 
refugee identity card and are only entitled to a &#8220;certificate by descent&#8221; which does not 
enable them to access any benefits. The Committee urged the Government to adopt 
effective measures to end the discriminatory treatment of children of women with displaced 
person status.29 
</p>
<p>20. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre of the Norwegian 
Refugee Council (IDMC/NRC), as referenced in the OHCHR summary of stakeholder 
submissions to the UPR, up to 200,500 persons are still internally displaced in the area 
under the control of the Government. The IDMC/NRC also noted that such children are not 
entitled to a refugee identity card or the benefits deriving therefrom. As a consequence, 
they cannot access housing assistance, which can take various forms, including a financial 
grant, a land plot, a housing unit, or rent subsidy. An amendment to the Civil Registry Law 
141(I)/2002 on 12 July 2007 ensured that the children of women with displaced person 
status were eligible for the same status, but the law still does not entitle these children to a 
refugee identity card or related benefits. The UPR summary of stakeholder submissions 
further noted that internally displaced persons (IDPs) are still prevented from returning to 
their place of origin and enjoying the property that they left behind. The IDP property issue 
on the island is complicated by several factors. These include the occupation of IDP 
housing and land by secondary occupants, sale of IDP housing and land to third parties, and 
uncompensated expropriation and development of IDP land on both sides of the Green 
Line. Furthermore, different systems were put in place in the south and the north to 
administer and manage property left behind by IDPs. Applicants on both sides of the Green 
Line have reported difficulties in repossessing their property through these mechanisms.30 
</p>
<p>21. The UPR summary of stakeholder submissions also refers to achievements and 
challenges in the protection of the rights of IDPs. A set of criteria has been formulated by 
the Government of Cyprus for displaced person status to facilitate the provision of 
assistance to people displaced by the conflict. In addition, the Government has established 
the Service for Displaced Persons, which provides housing assistance to IDPs, and the

where needed, in order to accommodate Turkish Cypriots and Turkish speakers in general. It also 
mentioned that all official documents are available in the official languages (Greek and Turkish)

international organizations. Significant financial resources are also allocated to assist IDPs. 
The UPR summary mentions that the Government has established conditions and provided 
the means for IDPs in areas under its control to assist them to settle where they are.31 
</p>
<p>22. UNFICYP continues to assist Turkish Cypriots living in the south to obtain identity 
documents, housing, welfare services, medical care, employment and education.32 
</p>
<p><b>  Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>23. In the case of <i>Foka v. Turkey</i> (2009), the European Court of Human Rights found a 
violation of the applicant&#8217;s freedom of expression. The applicant, a Greek-Cypriot resident 
in northern Cyprus, travelled on 13 January 1995 to the Ledra Palace checkpoint to cross 
into the north. At the checkpoint, agents of the northern part of Cyprus took the applicant to 
a police station, where a number of cassettes, books, a diary and maps were confiscated. 
The Court considered that this confiscation did not correspond to a &#8220;pressing social need&#8221;. 
The applicant was awarded just satisfaction to the value of the confiscated items.33

<p>24. With regard to the <i>Solomou v. Turkey</i> (2008), <i>Isaak v. Turkey</i> (2008) and <i>Kakoulli v. 
Turkey</i> (2006) cases,34 the CoE CMD, at its 1059th meeting in June 2009, noted with 
interest, inter alia, the information presented during the debate by the Turkish authorities 
and the Cypriot authorities concerning the individual measures in the case of Kakoulli. It 
considered that this information needed to be assessed; invited the Turkish authorities to 
provide information on any individual measures taken or envisaged in the cases of Isaak 
and Solomou; noted with interest the information provided by the Turkish authorities on the 
relevant general measures, in particular on the legislative provisions on the use of firearms 
and use of force, and invited the Turkish authorities to provide this information in writing 
in order that it might be assessed. It recalled that information is also awaited in relation to 
the cases of Isaak and Solomou, in particular on the regulatory framework governing the 
peaceful, parallel conduct of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations and measures to 
ensure the effective investigation into killings of civilians in the northern part of the island.  
</p>
<p>25. Regarding the <i>Adali</i> case (2005),35 according to information provided by the Turkish 
authorities, an additional inquiry into the death of Mr. Adali was carried out, following a 
letter of 24 March 2006 from the Prosecutor General to the police authorities ordering them 
to initiate an additional investigation, taking into account the shortcomings identified by the 
European Court in its judgement. On 12 March 2009, the Turkish authorities wrote to the 
applicant informing her of the new inquiry carried out following the judgement of the 
Court. The letter states that given the amount of time that had elapsed, the authorities were

 The cases of <i>Solomou v. Turkey</i> (2008) and <i>Isaak v. Turkey</i> (2008) concern the killing in 1996 of the

<p>applicants&#8217; relatives in the context of Greek-Cypriot demonstrations in the area of the United Nations 
buffer zone in Cyprus, and the lack of an effective investigation into their killing. The <i>Kakoulli v. 
Turkey</i> case (2006) concerns the killing of the applicants&#8217; husband and father, in 1996, by Turkish 
soldiers on guard duty along the ceasefire line in Cyprus and the lack of an effective and impartial 
investigation into this killing in violation of article 2 of the ECHR.

<p>unable to obtain any further evidence that would permit criminal charges to be brought. The 
case concerns the alleged lack of an effective investigation into the death of the applicant&#8217;s 
husband, who was shot in front of his house in Nicosia, located to the north of the Green 
Line, in July 1996. The Court found a number of shortcomings in the investigation. The 
case also concerns interference with the applicant&#8217;s freedom of association on account of a 
refusal of permission to cross from the northern part to the southern part of the island to 
attend a bicommunal meeting on 20 June 1997.  
</p>
<p><b>  Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>26. In its concluding observations of May 2009, the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights expressed its concern about the still limited opportunities for Turkish-
speaking Cypriot children to receive instruction in their native language. The Committee 
urged the State party to take all appropriate measures to increase opportunities for Turkish 
Cypriot children to receive teaching in their mother tongue.36 In its comments on the 
concluding observations, the Government of Cyprus stated that the Ministry of Education 
and Culture had taken all necessary measures for the curriculum and teachers at the schools 
the children attend to address their educational needs. It also mentioned that it was the 
choice of the families themselves that Turkish-speaking Cypriot children were attending 
joint, and not separate, primary schools, as this was considered by them the best way to 
avoid segregation and promote the better integration of the children into society.37 
</p>
<p>27. With regard to the right to education, the national report submitted by Cyprus in the 
framework of the UPR mentions that Turkish Cypriots who hold a six-year high-school 
diploma are eligible for admission to public institutions of higher education in the 
Government-controlled areas of Cyprus. It mentions that 10 per cent of the places are 
granted to special categories of people, such as the disabled due to acts of war, children of 
missing persons, and persons living in the northern part of the island. The costs for the 
education in private schools of their choice of Turkish Cypriot students who reside 
permanently in the Government-controlled areas, from pre-primary to higher education, are 
covered by the Government.38 
</p>
<p>28. In Limassol and Paphos, UNFICYP has continued to work with the local authorities 
and community representatives to strengthen its support in educational and social areas. 
There have been no new developments regarding the establishment of a Turkish-language 
primary school in Limassol.39 
</p>
<p>29. UNFICYP continued to facilitate the delivery of textbooks and the appointment of 
teachers to the elementary and secondary Greek Cypriot schools in Rizokarpaso, on the 
Karpas Peninsula in the north. At the time of reporting, 3 out of 12 teachers and other 
academic staff appointed by the Greek Cypriots for the current academic year had been 
allowed to teach at the schools, while 8 had been denied permission and a decision in 1 case 
was still pending. In accordance with the usual practice, UNFICYP provided 205 textbooks 
for review to the authorities in the north; the delivery of 5 of the books was not allowed 
because of what the authorities in the north perceived as objectionable content.40

<p><b>  Freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>30. With regard to freedom of religion, access to sites and icons of religious and cultural 
significance was facilitated by UNFICYP. From November 2008 to May 2009, the Mission 
facilitated five religious and commemorative events, which took place without incident. For 
example, on 20 April 2009, some 250 Greek Cypriots visited the church in Varosha in the 
buffer zone, in an annual pilgrimage, and on 10 May an annual pilgrimage took place to the 
abandoned village of Ayios Georgios Soleas.41 During the period from May to November 
2009 UNFICYP facilitated 17 religious and commemorative events, of which 12 involved 
crossing the buffer zone to the north, 2 involved crossing the buffer zone to the south and 3 
were held in the buffer zone.42 
</p>
<p>31. On 8 August 2009, 1,451 Turkish Cypriots travelled through the buffer zone in the 
area of Limnitis/Ye&#351;ilirmak in order to participate in an annual commemorative event in 
Kokkina/Erenkoy. On 2 September 2009, 645 Greek Cypriot pilgrims were unable to cross 
through this area to attend a religious service at Saint Mamas church following a 
disagreement between the two sides regarding crossing modalities.43 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>32. The persisting de facto partition of the island of Cyprus continues to constitute an 
obstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights. It is hoped that the new momentum to 
achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem will provide avenues to 
improve the human rights situation on the island and that relevant stakeholders will actively 
contribute to achieving enhanced human rights protection and promotion.
