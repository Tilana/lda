<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 22/32 on the right of the child to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, decided to focus its next full-day 
meeting on the theme of &#8220;access to justice for children&#8221;, and invited the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a report on that issue, and to present it to the 
Council at its twenty-fifth session, to inform the annual day of discussion on children&#8217;s 
rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council requested relevant stakeholders, including States, the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund, other relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, relevant special 
procedures mandate holders and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
Violence against Children, regional organizations and human rights bodies, civil society, 
national human rights institutions and children themselves, to provide input for the report.1 
</p>
<p><b> A. Access to justice for children 
</b>3. Access to justice is a fundamental right in itself and an essential prerequisite for the 
protection and promotion of all other human rights. In the Declaration of the High-level 
Meeting of the General Assembly on the Rule of Law at the National and International 
Levels, adopted in September 2012, Member States of the United Nations reaffirmed the 
right of equal access to justice for all, including members of vulnerable groups and 
&#8220;recognized the importance of the rule of law for the protection of the rights of the child, 
including legal protection from discrimination, violence, abuse and exploitation, ensuring 
the best interests of the child in all actions, and recommit to the full implementation of the 
rights of the child&#8221;.2  
</p>
<p>4. For the purpose of the present report, access to justice refers to the ability to obtain a 
just and timely remedy for violations of rights as put forth in national and international 
norms and standards, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.3 It applies to 
civil, administrative and criminal spheres of national jurisdictions, including customary and 
religious justice mechanisms, international jurisdictions, as well as alternative and 
restorative dispute resolution mechanisms, and covers all relevant judicial proceedings, 
affecting children4 without limitation, including children alleged as, accused of, or

 The following States submitted information: Albania, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, 
</p>
<p>Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Colombia, 
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Japan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Mexico, 
Morocco, Norway, Oman, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Spain, Syrian Arab 
Republic, Qatar, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The report was also informed by contributions of five 
international and regional organizations, the Inter-Agency Panel on Juvenile Justice, two special 
procedures mandate holders, five National Human Rights Institutions, the European Network of 
Ombudspersons for Children, and 34 non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors. 
In addition, children were asked to provide their views on accessing justice in a survey that was 
conducted by Child Rights Connect during the summer of 2013. In total, 310 children between 11 and 
17 from 24 countries participated in the survey. Only a selection of the wealth of experiences and 
initiatives on which information was received is outlined in this report.

 The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as &#8220;every human being below the age 
</p>
<p>of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier&#8221; (article 1). </p>


<p>recognized as having infringed the penal law, victims and witnesses5 or children coming 
into contact with the justice system for other reasons, such as regarding their care, custody 
or protection.  
</p>
<p>5. The concept of access to justice for children requires the legal empowerment of all 
children. They should be enabled to access relevant information and to effective remedies 
to claim their rights, including through legal and other services, child rights education, 
counselling or advice, and support from knowledgeable adults.6 Moreover, access to justice 
for children requires taking into account children&#8217;s evolving maturity and understanding 
when exercising their rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Child-sensitive justice and juvenile justice 
</b>6. While juvenile justice and child-sensitive justice are related to the concept of access 
to justice for children, these concepts should be distinguished. Juvenile justice specifically 
addresses the situation of children alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed 
the penal law. It refers to &#8220;laws, policies, guidelines, customary norms, systems, 
professionals, institutions and treatment specifically applicable to children in conflict with 
the law&#8221;.7  
</p>
<p>7. The United Nations Guidelines on Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and 
Witnesses of Crime define child-sensitive as &#8220;an approach that balances the child&#8217;s right to 
protection and that takes into account the child&#8217;s individual needs and views&#8221;.8 Similarly, 
according to a definition of the Council of Europe, child-friendly justice &#8220;means creating a 
justice system which guarantees the respect and the effective implementation of all 
children&#8217;s rights, giving due consideration to the child&#8217;s level of maturity and 
understanding and to the circumstances of the case. It is, in particular, justice that is 
accessible, age appropriate, speedy, diligent, adapted to and focused on the needs and rights 
of the child, respecting the rights of the child including the rights to due process, to 
participate in and to understand the proceedings, to respect for private and family life and to 
integrity and dignity.&#8221;9  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Human rights norms and standards relevant to ensuring access to justice for children 
are set out in a series of legally binding and non-binding international and regional human 
rights instruments.10 Elements of access to justice for children in particular include the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 &#8220;Child victims and witnesses&#8221; denotes children and adolescents, under the age of 18, who are victims 
</p>
<p>of crime or witnesses to crime regardless of their role in the offence or in the prosecution of the 
alleged offender or groups of offenders; Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/20, article 9 
(a).

considered as synonymous. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10
 All core international human rights treaties are relevant in this context. The Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child 
Pornography, which also places obligations on States to follow the principles of child-sensitive 
justice, should be particularly highlighted. Regional human rights treaties &#8211; such as the American 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>rights to relevant information, an effective remedy, a fair trial, to be heard, as well as to 
enjoy these rights without discrimination. In addition, the responsibility of States Parties to 
realize the rights of all children requires structural and proactive interventions to enable 
access to justice. 
9. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child are of particular relevance. Under both instruments, States are required 
to ensure that their domestic legal framework is consistent with the rights and obligations 
provided, including the adoption of appropriate and effective legislative and administrative 
procedures and other appropriate measures that provide fair, effective and prompt access to 
justice.11 
10. Article 2(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for 
the right to an effective remedy. In its General Comment No. 31 on the Nature of the 
General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, the Human Rights 
Committee emphasized that &#8220;in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights, States 
Parties must ensure that individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate 
those rights. Such remedies should be appropriately adapted so as to take account of the 
special vulnerability of certain categories of person, including in particular children.&#8221;12 
Article 2 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also requires the 
availability of adequate reparations<b> </b>to individuals whose rights have been violated.13  
</p>
<p>11. While it is not explicitly mentioned in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child held that the right to an effective remedy is an 
implicit requirement of the Convention. The Committee affirmed that &#8220;States need to give 
particular attention to ensuring that there are effective, child-sensitive procedures available 
to children and their representatives. These should include the provision of child-sensitive 
information, advice, advocacy, including support for self-advocacy, and access to 
independent complaints procedures and to the courts with necessary legal and other 
assistance.&#8221;14 The Committee also stressed that in case of violations of rights, &#8220;there should 
be appropriate reparation, including compensation, and, where needed, measures to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Convention on Human Rights; European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms; Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; Arab Charter on 
Human Rights; African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights; and African Charter on the Rights 
and Welfare of the Child &#8211; also guarantee relevant human rights to ensure access to justice for 
children. Relevant international and regional non-binding standards include, <i>inter alia</i>, the United 
Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice; the United Nations 
Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty; the United Nations Guidelines on 
Justice in matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime; Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners; Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of 
Detention or Imprisonment; United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and Non-custodial 
Measures for Women Offenders; United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial 
Measures; Basic Principles on the Use of Restorative Justice Programmes in Criminal Matters;

<p>promote physical and psychological recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration, as required 
by article 39 [of the Convention]&#8221;.15 The United Nations Guidelines on Justice in Matters 
involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime further specify that procedures for 
obtaining and enforcing reparation should be readily accessible and child-sensitive.16<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. While all the fair trial guarantees<b> </b>provided in the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights are equally applicable to children, the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child additionally provides a list of fundamental safeguards to ensure fair treatment of 
children, including the rights to information,17 expeditious decisions,18 prompt access to 
legal assistance and to prompt decisions by the court.19 Article 12 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, which establishes the child&#8217;s right to be heard and taken seriously, is of 
particular importance. Paragraph 1 assures, to every child capable of forming his or her 
own views, the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child. It 
requires that the views of the child be given due weight in accordance with their age and 
maturity. In addition, paragraph 2 establishes that children shall be provided the right to be 
heard in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting them, either directly, or 
through a representative or an appropriate body. The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
recognized article 12 as one of the four fundamental principles of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the others being the right to non-discrimination, the right to life and 
development, and the primary consideration of the child&#8217;s best interests, which frame 
children&#8217;s access to justice and should be considered in the interpretation and 
implementation of all other rights.20 
</p>
<p><b> III. Barriers to children&#8217;s access to justice 
</b>13. In spite of the comprehensive legal framework ensuring and protecting children&#8217;s 
rights and due to their special and dependent status, access to justice remains a tremendous 
challenge for children.21 There are several reasons for this situation. 
</p>
<p>14. The complexity of justice systems makes them difficult to understand for children. 
Children are often unaware of their rights and the existence of services, lacking information 
about where to go and whom to call to benefit from advice and assistance.22 Moreover, 
legislation and procedures concerning the treatment and participation of children in 
proceedings, including criminal, administrative and civil proceedings, are often not adapted 
to children&#8217;s rights and needs or may even be discriminatory towards children based on 
their age and gender. States have also highlighted that specialized judges, prosecutors, 
lawyers and other personnel working with children, as well as sufficient resources to 
provide specialized training, are frequently lacking.

children</i>, 2012, p. 6.  </p>


<p>15. The justice system is often intimidating for children. They may be afraid to make 
complaints out of fear of harassment, further stigmatization, abandonment or reprisals 
against them or their families. They may also lack trust and confidence that their complaints 
will be taken seriously and fairly assessed.23 In addition, in some parts of the world, it is 
culturally and socially unacceptable for children to lodge complaints and claim redress. 
Doing so would place children at great risks of reprisals, including violence, intimidation, 
exclusion and ostracism. Violence against children is also often considered as a fact of life 
rather than a rights violation that could be brought to court. 
</p>
<p>16. In addition, access to justice for children usually depends on the support provided by 
adults, who themselves may not be aware of children&#8217;s rights or know how to best support 
their children. Children often have no capacity to act without their parents or legal 
representatives, which is particularly problematic in case of a conflict of interest. 
In addition, children are sometimes not accepted or seen as rights holders, but rather as 
subject to the good will of adults, who may not act in the best interest of the child. During 
the process, decisions are often taken without explaining them and their consequences to 
children. Children&#8217;s ability to access justice is also affected by factors such as the costs of 
proceedings and the physical distance to courts as they often lack the necessary means to 
pay for fees or organize travel. 
</p>
<p>17. While difficulties mentioned above are experienced by many children, certain 
groups of children, including children in alternative care, children deprived of their liberty, 
children with disabilities, children living in poverty,24 children living in the streets, 
belonging to minorities or who are indigenous children,25 girls,26 children in conflict 
situations, asylum-seeking and migrant children, are faced with additional barriers in 
accessing justice. These children are often exposed to multiple forms of stigmatization and 
discrimination, including on grounds of sex, disability, race, ethnicity, colour, language, 
religion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status, such as sexual orientation 
or gender identity, as well as violence, such as gender-based violence, domestic violence, 
murder and violence related to organized crime and gangs, witchcraft and serious forms of 
violence based on ill perceptions towards children with disability and albinism. It should be 
emphasized that girls and boys often experience violence differently. While boys are more 
exposed to serious forms of violence on the streets, in gangs and in organized crime, girls 
are more exposed to violence in the private sphere, in particular sexual violence, which is 
often associated with shame, fear and distrust, which prevents them from speaking out and 
seeking help to bring the perpetrator to justice.

</p>
<p>On 18 February 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women held 
a half-day general discussion on access to justice, in order to start elaborating a general 
recommendation on access to justice for women and girls. </p>


<p><b> IV. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Empowering children with child-sensitive information 
</b></p>
<p>18. Children&#8217;s access to information about their rights and ways of promoting their 
safeguard and implementation, as well as ensuring their informed consent to decisions in 
line with their evolving capacities, is a crucial dimension of access to justice. Most 
countries that contributed information to the present report indicated that dedicated 
arrangements for the dissemination of adequate information to children are in place. These 
arrangements include, <i>inter alia</i>, (a) information on websites and online counselling 
services; (b) initiatives to raise awareness, such as human rights education, discussions and 
presentations in schools, organization of court visits and moot courts; (c) the publication 
and dissemination of brochures, leaflets, posters in child-sensitive language and adapted to 
children&#8217;s age in police stations, courts, and victim support services; (d) the establishment 
of help-lines that provide free, private and confidential 24-hour telephone counselling for 
children, as well as other creative initiatives. For instance, in Belarus, writing and art 
competitions aiming at enhancing knowledge about children&#8217;s rights are carried out. 
</p>
<p>19. In this context, it is important to recall that children should be provided with 
information and advice that is adapted to their age, maturity and circumstances. It should be 
conveyed in language children are able to understand and which is gender- and culture-
sensitive, and supported by child-sensitive materials and information services.27 
</p>
<p>20. Information should also be available to parents, teachers and people working with 
and for children. In a survey conducted by Child Rights Connect with 310 children from 
24 countries on their views and opinions on accessing justice, children overwhelmingly 
stated that the main source of information about remedies would come from their parents or 
family members. The vast majority of children also said that they would want their parents 
to help them in obtaining access to justice because they trusted them. The survey also 
showed a preference for information to be sent directly to them as well as for information to 
be provided at school and online.28 In that regard, the essential role of civil society 
organizations in awareness-raising, providing information and promoting public discussion 
on children&#8217;s rights has been highlighted by a number of States. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Child-sensitive procedures as a prerequisite condition to access justice  
</b>21. In order to ensure effective access to justice for children, national legal systems 
should have the capacity to accept and address complaints from or on behalf of children, 
while fully respecting, protecting and ensuring their rights. This implies that the system is 
child-sensitive, in particular taking into account the general principles and relevant 
provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as all other relevant human 
rights norms and standards.29

</p>
<p>28
 Child Rights Connect, survey, see footnote 1 above. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>29
 See paras. 8-12. In particular, the United Nations Guidelines on Justice in matters involving Child 
</p>
<p>Victims and Witnesses of Crime, and the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of 
Europe on Child-Friendly Justice provide further guidelines on the requisite elements of a child-
sensitive justice system. The main elements of a child-sensitive system are addressed throughout 
chapter IV of this report. </p>


<p>22. A number of States provided information on initiatives to ensure child-sensitive 
justice systems. Denmark, for instance, reported that it strengthened the advocacy function 
of its National Council for Children in 2012. The Council, <i>inter alia</i>, advises the 
Government and Parliament about areas in legislation or administrative practices where the 
rights of the child are not taken into account. Spain informed about its comprehensive 
national strategy to prioritize the implementation of children&#8217;s rights in the political agenda. 
Moreover, several States referred to comprehensive reforms of their juvenile justice 
systems to ensure that it takes into account the needs of children and complies with the 
rights of children involved with the criminal justice system, including through ensuring the 
full participation of children in proceedings.  
</p>
<p><i>  Existence of child-sensitive alternative mechanisms to solve disputes and seek redress 
</i>23. Apart from judicial and administrative authorities, alternative mechanisms exist in 
some States. Article 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States to 
develop and use effective alternative mechanisms to formal criminal proceedings that 
respect human rights and procedural safeguards and are child- and gender-sensitive. These 
alternatives include diversion, restorative justice processes,30 mediation and community-
based programmes, including treatment programmes for children with substance abuse 
problems.31 Georgia, for instance, reported on extensive diversion and mediation 
programmes for child offenders, including a programme called &#8220;my senior friend&#8221; which 
brings together child offenders with adults who have successfully undergone such a 
programme. 
</p>
<p>24. States have also developed child-sensitive alternative models for civil and 
administrative procedures. For instance, in Australia, Family Relationship Centres and 
other family dispute resolution services provide a child-inclusive practice as part of the 
family dispute resolution process. In Finland, a child-sensitive alternative dispute resolution 
and mediation mechanism has been established in district courts for disputes on child 
custody and visiting rights.  
</p>
<p>25. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged States to establish National 
Independent Human Rights Institutions and ombudspersons for children with the authority 
to receive individual complaints submitted by or on behalf of children, carry out 
investigations, and secure effective remedies for breaches of children&#8217;s rights.32 The joint 
report by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children 
and the Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children on <i>Safe and child-sensitive counselling, 
complaint and reporting mechanisms to address violence against children </i>found that 
compared to the judicial system, Independent Human Rights Institutions for Children are 
generally more accessible as their complaint system is free of charge, less formal and 
simpler to use, and does not require the involvement of a lawyer. They are also crucial to 
disseminate information and raise awareness of children&#8217;s rights to empower children and 
support efforts to access justice. However, they require adequate resources, institutional 
cooperation with other actors and independence in the performance of their mandate in 
order to be effective. Their effectiveness is also dependent on the level of trust they 
generate among young people.33

<p>26. A number of States have established Ombudsman Offices or similar institutions to 
receive complaints from children about violations of their rights. In Estonia, for example, 
the Ombudsman Office for Children is, <i>inter alia</i>, responsible for resolving complaints 
related to children&#8217;s rights concerning individuals and authorities that perform public 
functions, and to verify whether the legal acts related to children&#8217;s rights are in accordance 
with the Constitution and international law.  
</p>
<p><b>  </b><i>Complaints mechanisms for children in closed institutions 
</i>27. Mechanisms through which children in closed institutions can file a complaint 
regarding their treatment are of utmost importance to these children. When a child is placed 
in such an institution, States are responsible for ensuring their safety, protection, welfare 
and appropriate care and treatment. Without access to complaint mechanisms, these 
children face an increased risk of suffering abuse of authority, humiliation, ill-treatment and 
other unacceptable deprivations of rights.34 
</p>
<p>28.  The United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty 
provide that children in closed facilities of any kind &#8220;should have the opportunity of 
making requests or complaints to the director&#8221;, and the right to make complaints to 
administrative and judicial authorities, and to be informed of the response without delay. 
The Rules also call for the establishment of an independent office, such as an ombudsman, 
to receive and investigate complaints made by juveniles deprived of their liberty and to 
assist in the achievement of settlements.35 Moreover, the Guidelines for the Alternative 
Care of Children provide that &#8220;[c]hildren in care should have access to a known, effective 
and impartial mechanism whereby they can notify complaints or concerns regarding their 
treatment or conditions of placement&#8221;.36 
</p>
<p>29. For example, Uzbekistan stated that children deprived of their liberty have the right 
to report infringements of their rights to a wide variety of actors, including the 
administration of the institution where they are held, Government bodies, civil society 
groups and other institutions and organizations. All places of detention are also equipped 
with letter-boxes for complaints. In police facilities, a helpline is available, which can be 
used to obtain legal assistance. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b><i>Customary and religious justice systems  
</i>30. Customary and religious justice systems in some State are recognized by law and 
provide certain types of dispute resolution processes. The Human Rights Committee has 
indicated that these mechanisms should be limited to minor civil and criminal matters.37 
Customary justice mechanisms are sometimes more available for children and their families 
and provide the means for easier conflict resolution. The Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Violence against Children noted that they tend to use more accessible 
language, have a greater potential for healing, are less costly and promote more direct 
involvement of the offender and victim, as well as their families and the community.38 The

<p>child normally appears in a customary proceeding with his or her family, and the focus is 
on reparation, reconciliation and ensuring the child remains part of the community. 
</p>
<p>31. However, in spite of some of the positive features of customary and religious justice 
mechanisms, human rights concerns may nevertheless arise.39 Persons acting in a judicial or 
quasi-judicial capacity may not be familiar with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
there may not be specially established procedures when dealing with children, and they 
may still use sanctions for wrongful conduct that are incompatible with human rights, such 
as corporal punishment or banishment, and sanctions that discriminate on the basis of 
gender or other status. Possible avenues to address human rights issues in customary and 
religious justice mechanisms, without jeopardizing their positive aspects, may include 
training and awareness raising initiatives, as well as education on children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p><i>  Complaint mechanisms at the international level 
</i></p>
<p>32. States parties are primarily obliged to develop appropriate national mechanisms to 
enable children whose rights have been violated to have access to effective remedies at the 
domestic level. However, in order to reinforce and complement the national system, 
complaint mechanisms have also been established at the regional40 and international level.<footnote name="4">7 Convention on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 10, para. 49.  </footnote>1 
One important development in that context is the adoption of the third Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which establishes a communications procedure. 
Upon entry into force of the third Optional Protocol,<footnote name="4">6 See the Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 40(2)(b)(ii) and (iii); article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; United Nations Principles and Guidelines on 
Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, paras. 2, 3 and 10. 
</footnote>2 children will have the possibility to 
submit a complaint about violations of their rights to the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child.  
</p>
<p><i>  Training on access to justice for children and children&#8217;s rights 
</i>33. Another crucial aspect of the right to access to justice for children is the training of 
relevant professionals on relevant legislation, including anti-discrimination and gender 
equality laws, training and development of child-sensitive skills to communicate with 
children and creating a safe environment in the justice process. Such training should be 
multi-disciplinary and include all persons working with and for children, such as lawyers, 
judges, public prosecutors, police, teachers, prison staff, social workers, health 
professionals, as well as persons working in the alternative care system, public 
administration, immigration control, civil society actors and traditional leaders.  
</p>
<p>34. In most countries, important initiatives have been undertaken to ensure child rights 
training for professionals working in the justice system and other public officials, including 
the incorporation of children&#8217;s rights training in university curricula and compulsory 
training courses. The Mexican Supreme Court, for instance, issued a &#8220;Protocol of action for 
those delivering justice in cases affecting children and adolescents&#8221;. By comprehensively 
expounding the general rules and principles that need to be observed at all stages of a

 For example, the Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights, the European Committee

 According to article 19 (1) of the third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, the protocol will enter into force three months after the deposit of the tenth instrument of 
ratification or accession. As of November 2013, 8 States had ratified the Convention, including 
Albania, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Gabon, Germany, Montenegro, Portugal, Spain and 
Thailand. </p>


<p>process involving children, the document provides guidelines not only for judges and 
magistrates, but also to lawyers and other relevant actors, as well as civil society at large. 
</p>
<p>35. While training for teachers, parents, civil society actors and other persons working 
with children was less often referred to in contributions to this report, a number of 
initiatives have also been highlighted. Burkina Faso, for instance, reported on training and 
awareness raising initiatives for parents associations, as well as civil society actors on 
children&#8217;s rights. The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport in Cambodia also regularly 
carries out trainings on children&#8217;s rights for school (deputy) directors and teachers in 
primary and high schools across the country.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Triggering judicial action 
</b>36. The right of children to take legal action or invoke administrative proceedings to 
protect their rights differs in various countries. In this context, the importance of non-
discriminatory birth registration as provided in article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child should be highlighted.43 Apart from ensuring the existence of the child under law, 
birth registration provides the foundation for safeguarding children&#8217;s rights, including 
children&#8217;s access to justice. 
37. Some States recognize the legal standing of children to lodge complaints before 
judicial and other authorities. For instance, the South African Children&#8217;s Act enables 
children not only to participate in civil proceedings but also to institute proceedings 
themselves. In some countries, the exercise of this right is limited to older children and may 
also depend on the fulfilment of other requirements, such as the child&#8217;s level of personal 
development, their capacity to understand the legal proceedings, or the consent of their 
parents. Younger children sometimes have the possibility to turn to administrative bodies, 
which may initiate legal proceedings on their behalf if they consider it appropriate.44 For 
instance, in the Russian Federation, when the rights and legitimate interests of a child are 
infringed in relations between the child and the parents or other legal representatives, all 
children, irrespective of their age, shall be legally entitled to approach the child care 
authorities to seek their protection, or a court on reaching the age of 14 years. However, in 
many countries, children can only take action through their parents or legal representatives. 
In this case, it is important that the child&#8217;s views are transmitted correctly to the competent 
body. Moreover, the representative should be aware that he or she represents exclusively 
the interests of the child.45 
</p>
<p>38. The interest of children and their legal representative may also be in conflict. For 
instance, parents involved in separation or divorce may seek to use their interpretation of 
their children&#8217;s rights to pursue their own interests, rather than their children&#8217;s. 
Furthermore, parents or legal representatives may be the direct or indirect perpetrators of 
breaches of many children&#8217;s rights. In a number of countries, courts are empowered to 
exclude parents/legal representatives from proceedings and appoint an ad hoc legal 
guardian to represent a child&#8217;s interest in such cases. For instance, in Germany, parents are 
excluded from representing the child in certain civil cases prescribed by law, such as legal 
transactions between the child and one of his or her parents, and a supplementary curator is 
appointed for the child in that matter. Before the family court, the court must appoint a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>43
 Article 16 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also recognizes that &#8220;[e]veryone 
</p>
<p>shall have the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law&#8221;.

</p>

<p>legal advisor to the child in order to be able to clearly assert the child&#8217;s best interest in cases 
of significant conflict with parents&#8217; interest. The legal advisor establishes what is in the 
child&#8217;s best interest and asserts those interests in court. Moreover, he or she also informs 
the child, in an appropriate manner, of the subject matter, the course and possible outcome 
of the proceedings. </p>
<p>39. A number of non-governmental organizations emphasized the fact that if the parents, 
legal guardians or legal representatives are unable or unwilling to represent child victims in 
court, it may also be beneficial for children to be able to turn to other actors in getting 
redress, including National Human Rights Institutions, legal clinics, public child defenders 
and non-governmental organizations. Moreover, the possibility to access group litigation 
and complaints, such as combined cases or test cases, can provide the opportunity to 
challenge systematic, grave or widespread children&#8217;s rights violations. This possibility is 
particularly relevant if there are difficulties in identifying victims without doubt due to the 
nature of violations, such as in the case of child pornography, or characteristics of the 
victims, for example very young children.  
</p>
<p><i>  Legal and other appropriate assistance for children  
</i>40. As children are usually at a disadvantage in engaging with the legal system, whether 
as a result of inexperience or lack of resources to secure advice and representation, they 
need access to free or subsidized legal and other appropriate assistance to effectively 
engage with the legal system. Without such assistance, children will largely be unable to 
access complex legal systems that are generally designed for adults. Free and effective legal 
assistance is particularly important for children deprived of their liberty.  
</p>
<p>41. The right to legal and other appropriate assistance in the context of criminal 
proceedings, including for children, is well established under international human rights 
law.46 The United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal 
Justice Systems specify that &#8220;[l]egal aid provided to children should be prioritized, in the 
best interests of the child, and be accessible, age-appropriate, multidisciplinary, effective 
and responsive to the specific legal and social needs of children.&#8221; The Committee on the 
Rights of the Child has also explicitly recognized that legal or other appropriate assistance 
for children should be free of charge and recommended that States provide as much as 
possible for adequate trained legal assistance, such as expert lawyers or paralegal 
professionals. Other appropriate assistance includes, for instance, social workers, 
psychologists, National Human Rights Institutions, friends and family members. Such a 
person must, however, have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the various legal 
aspects of the judicial process and must be adequately trained to work with children in 
conflict with the law. 47 
</p>
<p>42. In this regard, Sierra Leone provided information that it piloted a national legal aid 
scheme which, <i>inter alia</i>, provides legal aid to children in conflict with the law and 
supports lawyers in providing legal assistance to victims. Moreover, Sierra Leone 
acknowledged the important role that paralegals can play in providing legal aid and 
reported that it trains paralegals to monitor police stations and advocate for the release of 
children, as well as to provide free legal advice and mediation services at grassroots level. 
</p>
<p>43. While the right to free legal assistance is not explicitly provided for in international 
law outside the criminal law context, access to legal and other assistance in these matters is 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>nevertheless essential for ensuring that children are able to take action to protect their 
rights. The Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers establish that all persons should have 
effective and equal access to lawyers, and call on Governments to &#8220;ensure the provision of 
sufficient funding and other resources for legal services to the poor and, as necessary, to 
other disadvantaged persons&#8221;.48 In South Africa, for instance, the child&#8217;s right to legal 
assistance at State expense in civil matters is guaranteed in its Constitution. In many States, 
however, free legal aid is provided only for specific cases and parents are often viewed as 
the natural representatives for children. 
</p>
<p><i>  Statutory limitations 
</i></p>
<p>44. Limitation periods can pose a problem for children in accessing justice since they 
may not be able to challenge violations of their rights until they have reached majority. The 
Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of 
Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law require that statutes of limitations should not apply to 
gross violations of international human rights law and should not be unduly restrictive for 
other types of violations.49 In the context of violations of children&#8217;s rights, this includes that 
the time period should not begin running until the child has reached majority, or even later.  
45. Austria reported that its statutory period of limitation for certain offences against 
children was extended. According to the second Violence Protection Act, the time from the 
day the offence was committed to when the victim has reached the age of 28 shall no longer 
be included in calculating the period of limitation. Similarly, in the context of a civil claim 
to defend their property rights against an insurance company, which had become time-
barred when the applicants reached majority, the European Court of Human Rights found 
that the strict application of a statutory limitation period, without taking into account the 
particular circumstances of the case, had prevented the applicants from using a remedy that 
in principle was available to them.50 </p>
<p><b> D. Participation in proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><i>  The right to be heard 
</i></p>
<p>46. The right to access to justice also requires that children be able to participate in an 
effective and meaningful way in all matters affecting them, including criminal, civil and 
administrative proceedings. Wherever possible, children should be heard directly. Children 
must not only be provided the possibility to express their views and to be heard, States must 
also ensure that their views are given due consideration and that children are not subjected 
to undue pressure or manipulation.51 
</p>
<p>47. As emphasized by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, article 12 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child manifests that children are subject of rights. They 
hold rights which have an influence on their life, and not only rights derived from their 
vulnerability or dependency on adults.52 In this respect, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child also clarified that article 12 imposes no age limit and confirmed that children are able

<p>to form views from the youngest age, even when they may be unable to express them 
verbally. The Committee, furthermore, established that all processes in which children are 
heard and participate must be transparent and informative, voluntary, respectful, relevant, 
child-sensitive, supported by training, safe and sensitive to risk and accountable.53 
</p>
<p>48. The right to be heard has also been emphasized by many States as an important 
element of access to justice for children. For instance, Belgium reported that its 
Constitution recognizes children&#8217;s right to be heard on any question which concerns them. 
Their opinion must be taken into account in accordance with the child&#8217;s age and 
discernment. According to the Norwegian Child Welfare Act, a child who has reached 7 
years of age, and younger children who are capable of forming their own opinions, shall 
receive information and be given an opportunity to state their opinion before a decision is 
made in cases concerning them.  
</p>
<p><i>  Treatment of children during proceedings 
</i>49. The hearing of a child is a difficult process and can even be traumatic, in particular 
for child victims of sexual crimes. Therefore, article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child requires States to ensure a safe, child-sensitive environment in which the child 
feels respected, as well as conditions that take into account a child&#8217;s individual situation.54 
During proceedings, the privacy and confidentiality of children must be protected and their 
safety ensured.  
</p>
<p>50. Many States have reported on a wide variety of special protection measures for 
hearings and questioning of children, as well as interrogation of children. Measures taken 
include (a) the establishment of child-sensitive premises for the hearing of a child; (b) the 
conduct of hearings solely in the presence of a parent, guardian or any other person who 
takes care of the child, except where this does not correspond to the child&#8217;s interest, or 
other specially trained professionals, such as psychological experts; (c) measures to ensure 
privacy for children, such as the restriction of public access to courts and the prohibition to 
disclose certain information; (d) audio-visual recording of the interview of the child and 
questioning outside the courtroom, as well as one-stop shops which bring together services 
under one roof to collect forensic evidence, provide legal advice, health care and other 
support. These measures are taken to prevent re-victimization of the child, to gather 
necessary evidence, to support healing and reintegration, and to prevent impunity.  
</p>
<p>51. In order to ensure that children can effectively participate throughout the whole 
process, it is also important that decisions are explained to children in a way that they can 
understand. As emphasized by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, information and 
feedback about the weight given to their views should be made available to them.55  
</p>
<p><b> E. Measures to ensure access to justice for children at special risk 
</b>52. The right to equality and the prohibition of discrimination obliges States to eradicate 
discriminatory laws, policies and practices, and to take affirmative measures to ensure that 
all individuals, including children, are entitled to equal access to judicial and adjudicatory 
mechanisms without distinction of any kind. In addition, States are required to ensure that 
all parties in judicial or legal proceedings are treated without any discrimination. The 
Committee on the Rights of the Child emphasized that the non-discrimination obligation

<p>requires States to identify actively individual children and groups of children the 
recognition and realization of whose rights may demand special measures, such as the 
collection of disaggregated data and changes in legislation, administration and resource 
allocation, as well as educational measures to change attitudes.56  
</p>
<p>53. Some States have reported on specific measures to ensure access to justice for 
certain groups of children. For instance, in Slovenia, children have the right to a refugee 
counsellor, who provides support and legal aid to them. Ukraine provides a right to free 
legal aid to children lacking parental care. The Greek General Secretariat for Youth is 
currently implementing a project aiming at providing free legal assistance to socially 
vulnerably groups of children and young people, such as underage offenders, victims of 
domestic violence or trafficking in persons, drug users and unaccompanied minors. 
However, some groups, such as children with disabilities, have not been specifically 
addressed by most contributions of States.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>54. <b>International and regional human rights norms and standards provide a 
comprehensive framework for ensuring access to justice for children, which is an 
essential prerequisite for the protection and promotion of all other human rights of 
children. However, due to their special and dependent status, children are still faced 
with a number of serious challenges in accessing justice. States should thus revise their 
laws, policies and procedures to ensure better compliance with international norms 
and standards, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and its 
Optional Protocols. The legislation should decriminalize status offences and survival 
behavior and include legal safeguards to protect the child&#8217;s best interests and 
protection from discrimination; the child&#8217;s right to freedom from violence and to free 
and safe participation in proceedings throughout the justice process, as well as the 
right to legal and other relevant assistance; and the right to a swift consideration of 
cases concerning children. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Independent, safe, effective, easily accessible and child-sensitive complaint and 
reporting mechanisms should be established by law in compliance with international 
human rights norms and standards, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. Where such mechanisms already exist, States should secure their availability 
and accessibility for all children, including children deprived of their liberty, without 
discrimination of any kind. In addition, States should ensure that complaint and 
reporting mechanisms act in an effective and child-sensitive manner and pursue the 
best interests of the child at all times. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Being aware of, and having access to, information about their rights and how to 
obtain a remedy is another key element of ensuring access to justice for children. 
Information should be age-appropriate and adapted to the needs of children. It should 
be presented in ways that children accept and understand. In addition, information 
should be made available to parents and other persons acting as legal representatives 
of children.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>States should develop and strengthen multi-disciplinary capacity-building and 
training initiatives to ensure that all persons working with, and for, children have the 
necessary knowledge and skills relating to children&#8217;s rights and needs. Children&#8217;s 
access to justice often faces significant barriers at the community level, where children 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b>may fail to be perceived as human rights holders. Training initiatives should therefore 
be promoted and complemented with awareness&#8211;raising and capacity&#8211;building to 
community, religious and traditional leaders, mediators, facilitators and other justice 
providers, to parents and to children themselves. </b></p>
<p>58. <b>Children should have the possibility to complain and initiate legal proceedings 
in cases of violations of their rights. As children are usually at a disadvantage when 
engaging with the legal system, they have a particularly acute need for legal 
assistance. States should provide legal or other appropriate assistance to children free 
of charge in all matters affecting them. Legal assistance should be of sufficient quality 
and be provided to all children within the State&#8217;s territory, including non-citizens. If 
children are represented by a parent, guardian or any other person, these persons 
should be required to always act in the best interest of the child. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>States must also ensure that the views of children, including children from the 
youngest age, even when they may be unable to express themselves verbally, are given 
due consideration. Moreover, in order to avoid (re-)victimization of children 
participating in judicial processes, States should make sure that their privacy and 
confidentiality are safeguarded at all times. States also must ensure that children are 
protected from all forms of violence when coming into contact with the justice system. 
</b>60. <b>States should take necessary measures to protect children from the risk of 
manipulation, harassment, reprisals or intimidation. To ensure access to justice for 
particularly vulnerable and socially excluded groups, including children in alternative 
care, children deprived of their liberty, children with disabilities, children living in 
poverty, children living in the streets, minorities, indigenous children, girls, asylum-
seeking and migrant children, States should address additional barriers for and adopt 
special protective measures that enable them to participate in proceedings and feel 
empowered, when needed and appropriate, to provide their informed consent to 
decisions affecting them.  
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Children and those acting on their behalf should also be provided access to 
international and regional mechanisms when domestic legal remedies fail to protect 
children. In particular, States should become parties to the Third Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and promote its effective implementation. 
Moreover, States should ensure that justice for children is integrated in the post-2015 
development agenda and children&#8217;s rights are an integral part of broader justice 
reforms and rule of law initiatives.</b>
