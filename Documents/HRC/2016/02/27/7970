<p><b>  Observations of the Government of Sri Lanka on the draft 
report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on advice and technical assistance for the Government 
of Sri Lanka on promoting reconciliation and accountability 
in Sri Lanka (A/HRC/22/38) 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>Reference to the UNSG&#8223;s PoE Report<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Report A/HRC/22/38 refers on several instances to the United Nations Secretary 
General&#8223;s Panel of Experts Report (hereafter called the PoE Report) on Sri Lanka.  The 
Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) would like to request the OHCHR to delete all references 
to the PoE Report for the following reasons: 
</p>
<p>(a) The PoE was not referred to in the resolution 19/2 on promoting 
reconciliation in Sri Lanka, and therefore allusion to it in the Report A/HRC/22/38 takes the 
Report beyond the scope and mandate of the resolution 19/2.  
</p>
<p>(b) The PoE Report on Sri Lanka which was commissioned by the UN Secretary 
General was the culmination of a private consultation that the latter sought to advise 
himself on, and is not the product or a request of the UN Human Rights Council, the UN 
General Assembly or any other UN body.  As it has not received the endorsement of the 
intergovernmental process, it has neither credence nor legitimacy within an 
intergovernmental fora.  The PoE&#8223;s mandate did not extend to fact finding or investigation.  
In its Report, the three-member Panel also makes it clear that the assertions set out therein 
remain unsubstantiated and require a higher standard of proof.  For these reasons, the GoSL 
does not extend any credence or legitimacy to the PoE Report.  
</p>
<p>2. The 6 specific references to the PoE Report are given below:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(i) <b>Paragraph 2</b> of the Report notes &#8222;<b>While the Secretary-General has offered 
the PoE as a resource to the Government and particularly to the LLRC, the PoE had 
</b></p>
<p><b>very limited engagement with the Government and did not meet with the LLRC.</b>&#8223; &#8211; 
This is a misrepresentation of what actually transpired, which is that the Panel of Experts 
were invited to make representation before the LLRC, whereas the Panel, for reasons best 
known to them, did not present themselves before the LLRC for this purpose.  If all 
allusions to the PoE in the Report are not deleted as requested above, the GoSL would 
request that this paragraph be suitably amended to accurately reflect reality bringing in 
reference to the fact that the PoE was invited to make representation before the LLRC, but 
did not do so. 
</p>
<p>(ii) <b>Footnote 1</b> contains extensive reference to the PoE Report.  If this footnote is 
not deleted, the GoSL would request that this be qualified with reference to the GoSL 
position on the PoE as reflected under Item (b) above. 
</p>
<p>(iii) <b>Footnote 5</b> refers to the PoE Report in reference to Paragraph 10 &#8222;concerns 
regarding its [LLRC&#8223;s] mandate, composition and methodology&#8223;.  The GoSL requests 
that this reference to the PoE be deleted, given that the PoE is a document which lacks 
credence and legitimacy, as elaborated above. 
</p>
<p>(iv) <b>Paragraph 26</b> and <b>corresponding footnote 32</b> make reference to the PoE.  
Paragraph 26 states, &#8222;Noting this Act [Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Act </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>No 19 of 2010), the PoE however stated that &#8222;&#8223;issuance of a death certificate following an 
administrative process is not a substitute for a bona fide investigation into the 
circumstances of an individual&#8223;s death, which meets international standards. &#8230;. any further 
legal recourse in the future&#8223;&#8223;&#8223;. The GoSL requests that this reference and corresponding 
footnote be deleted. 
</p>
<p>(v) <b>Footnote 49</b> refers to the PoE in relation to the study of cases of LTTE 
suspects in detention.  The GoSL requests that this reference to the PoE be deleted. 
</p>
<p>(vi) <b>Footnote 50 quotes a PoE reference to the rehabilitation of ex-
combatants.</b>  The GoSL requests that this reference to the PoE be deleted. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings in Sri Lanka by the OHCHR Technical Mission 
</b></p>
<p>3. <b>Paragraph 7</b> of the Report has omitted reference to the meeting between the 
OHCHR technical Mission led by Mr. Hanny Megally and Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, 
Minister of Plantation Industries and Special Envoy of the President on Human Rights.  It 
would be appreciated if this section is  updated and amended accordingly. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reference to the Response dated 17th December 2012 by the Minister of 
</b></p>
<p><b>External Affairs of Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>4. <b>Paragraph 7</b> of last sentence <b>refers to the letter by the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights dated 26
</b></p>
<p><b>th
 November 2012 addressed to the Minister of External 
</b></p>
<p><b>Affairs of Sri Lanka.</b>  However, the Report at this instance does not mention that the High 
Commissioner&#8223;s letter was responded to by the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka 
Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris by his letter of 17th December 2012 addressed to the High 
Commissioner, even though we note that reference to the letter by Hon. Prof. Peiris is made 
in Paragraph 61 of the Report.  We therefore request that the response by the Minister of 
External Affairs be referred to in <b>Paragraph 7</b> as well, in order to accurately reflect the 
course of events.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reference to Rule of Law and Administration of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>5. The content of <b>paragraph 15</b> expresses an unfounded fear in relation to the exercise 
of powers vested under Section 12 Part III of the Public Security (Amendment) Act, which 
empowers the members of the Armed forces to act within a limited scope to maintain public 
order. According to Section 20 of the Act, immediate steps should be taken to hand over 
any person arrested to the police authorities to deal with the said person under the 
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. Orders under Section 12 are issued based on 
objective criteria. The evaluation and assessment of the need to issue these orders are based 
on the recommendations of the State intelligence services which shall take all objective 
focus in making appropriate recommendations for the invoking of the powers under Section 
12 of the Act.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reference to Allegations of Extrajudicial Killings  
</b></p>
<p>6. <b>Paragraphs 17 &amp; 18</b> - Taking cognizance of the LLRC Report, the Commander of 
the Army appointed a Court of Inquiry to investigate the instances of civilian casualties that 
are mentioned in the LLRC Report and also to investigate the Channel 4 allegation.  The 
Commander of the Army&#8223;s direction to the Court of Inquiry was to investigate the alleged 
scenes of summary executions that are shown in the Channel 4 video footages <b>irrespective 
of the fact whether the video footages are authentic or not</b>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>7. The Court of Inquiry decided to investigate &#8220;civilian casualties allegation&#8221; first. 
With regard this inquiry to date 50 witnesses have been examined by the Court of Inquiry. 
These witnesses were examined on alleged incidents of shelling that are mentioned in the 
LLRC Report. The Court has to investigate more than 50 incidents mentioned in the LLRC 
Report that are alleged to have occurred at different localities, extending from the West 
Coast to the East Coast of Northern Sri Lanka, at different dates and times. The inquiry 
requires the identification of the Artillery Regiments, Formations and Infantry Battalions 
that are relevant to the incidents alleged and the examination of the commanders concerned. 
Such an inquiry is naturally time consuming. The inquiry will be concluded shortly, by mid 
January 2013. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>As regards an independent investigation into the Channel 4 Video to establish 
the truth or otherwise of the allegations arising from the video footage</b>, the Court of 
Inquiry aforesaid has been tasked to investigate this matter.  Once the 1st part of the 
investigation is over, the court will investigate the channel 4 allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reference to the Vavuniya Prison Riot in Paragraph 21 
</b></p>
<p>9. <b>Paragraph 21</b> - Excessive force had not been used in either of the incidents 
described in the paragraph. The Prison and Law Enforcement Officials have acted within 
the legal framework in responding to the situation that prevailed. Police Investigations into 
the two cases are currently in progress. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reference to Missing Persons and Enforced Disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>10. <b>Paragraph 22 </b>- The Government of Sri Lanka has on numerous occasions provided 
information to the UN Human Rights Council on the process adopted with regard to 
disappearances. An Inter-Ministerial Working Group to verify cases on alleged 
disappearances has been established to address cases brought to the attention by the 
WGEID.  In addition, any reported incident of disappearance to the Police is duly 
investigated and information on such cases was provided in the National Report of Sri 
Lanka to the UPR 2012.   
</p>
<p>11. The Government has taken measures to investigate all reported cases of alleged 
disappearances including those related to the last phase of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>12. The Government of Sri Lanka continues to clear the backlog of cases brought to its 
attention by the WGEID and has provided responses to 159 cases in the last two years.  
Further, investigations are being conducted on remaining allegations.  In addition to the 
Inter Ministerial Working Group, a Working Committee has been appointed headed by a 
Deputy Inspector General to conduct ground verifications to ascertain present facts.  
</p>
<p>13. <b>Paragraph 24</b> - Despite the non-inclusion of the LLRC recommendation related to 
cooperation with the ICRC on disappearances, the Ministry of Defence and the ICRC have 
held a series of discussions on the issue of the disappeared persons and continues to 
maintain a positive dialogue on possible areas of cooperation. The Ministry of Defence has 
also shared certain information with the ICRC and continues to work closely on cases of 
disappearances. Collaboration has included studying practical methodologies adopted by 
other countries in dealing with cases of alleged disappearances in cooperation with ICRC. 
</p>
<p>14. It may be noted that although the Family Tracing and Reunification Unit (FTR) 
established in collaboration with UNICEF which was primarily to trace missing children 
recorded 2,564 untraceable persons out of which 676 were children while 1,888 were 
adults. Nearly 75% of the tracing request received by the unit are related to adults. It is to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>be noted that 64% tracing requests were reported by parents as having been recruited by the 
LTTE.  
</p>
<p>15. <b>Paragraph 25 </b>- The Ministry of Defence has created a data base based on WGEID 
data and is in the process of cross checking information available with other institutions in 
order to establish centralized data base.    
</p>
<p>16. <b>Therefore the assertions made in the report in paragraphs 22, 24, and 25 that 
no mechanism has been established to trace the adults gone missing during the last 
</b></p>
<p><b>stage of war is inaccurate.</b>   
</p>
<p>17. <b>Paragraph 29</b> - The Government has already provided responses to 159 cases 
referred by the WGEID.  In addition another 5 urgent cases and 100 cases referred by the 
WGEID have been processed and will be communicated to the WGEID as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>18. The generalization made highlighting a few isolated incidents as a spike in reports of 
abductions and disappearance in the period last quarter of 2011 to mid 2012 is inaccurate. 
As a case in point, categorizing the case of a &#8220;diplomat&#8223;s child&#8221; is erroneous. Investigations 
</p>
<p>have revealed that this case cannot be categorized as either an enforced disappearance or 
abduction and the incident appears to be of a personal nature and the child has not been 
forthcoming in revealing the truth. 
</p>
<p>19. All other cases referred to in the report are under investigation by the Law 
Enforcement Agencies. 
</p>
<p>20. <b>Therefore the assertions made in the report indicating that spike of activities in 
the period last quarter of 2011 to mid 2012 is inaccurate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reference to Detention Policies 
</b></p>
<p>21. <b>Paragraph 31</b> - The need to strictly adhere to the existing powers under the law to 
arrest or detain a person has been emphasized by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka since its 
inception and any breach of such provisions would attract the infringement of the 
Fundamental Right enshrined in Article 13 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. <b>Under the 
Prison Ordinance as well as any other written law dealing with detention of persons, 
</b></p>
<p><b>no place of detention can be maintained without duly publishing it in a Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>Gazette that could be accessed by any member of the public.</b> It has always been 
considered as illegal to maintain places of detention without properly gazetting such places 
and giving publicity to them. <b>In the circumstances it would be superfluous to make as 
new recommendation to include this requirement in to the catalogue of new measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be adopted though NPOA.</b> 
</p>
<p>22. <b>Paragraph 32 </b>- <b>A centralized, comprehensive database of detainees has been 
established at the Terrorist Investigation Division of the Police.</b> This is a round the 
clock mechanism with units in Colombo, Vavuniya and Boossa where the details of 
detainees and those who are released from detention can be obtained by the NoK. It may be 
noted that this information is only provided to NoK as detainees have requested that such 
information not be released publicly due to the privacy concerns. <b>There have been no 
reported instances of hostile or uncooperative behavior of State Officials towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>family members who sought assistance at detention centers. Despite the assertion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>hostile or uncooperative treatment, 3,073 NoKs have accessed the above units and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sought the assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>Paragraph 35 </b>- The rehabilitation process undertaken by the Government has been 
completely transparent and was supported by international agencies including UNICEF and 
IOM. The main criterion for rehabilitation to be undertaken was decided on the extent of 
involvement with the LTTE. Due to the Government&#8223;s deep and abiding commitment to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>reconciliation and peace, a vast majority of cadres have been rehabilitated and reintegrated 
into the society, despite their involvement with the LTTE activities. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Therefore the assertions made in the report indicating that a criterion for 
rehabilitation has not been transparent is unfounded. 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>Paragraph 36 </b>- <b>The characterization of the legitimate rehabilitation process 
</b>undertaken by the Government, as &#8220;a rehabilitation regime <b>against alleged LTTE 
</b></p>
<p>sympathizes&#8221; is inaccurate.  At no time has the rehabilitation process been used against 
ex- combatants or LTTE sympathizes but have been used for their benefit and to ensure 
speedy reintegration into society.  Despite the sufficient evidence to take legal action on 
these individuals, as a part of reconciliation process, the Government chose the option of 
rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>26. The same procedure was adopted with regard to the 4 students from Jaffna 
University who were arrested on charges of  involvement in organising, canvassing for and 
actively taking part in an event of the LTTE which is a  banned terrorist organisation in Sri 
Lanka;  amounting to involvement in an unlawful activity under the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act (PTA). <b>Two(2) of these students have already been released on 22 
January 2013 and other 2 will be released in due course. 
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>Paragraph 37 </b>- There is no process in place or requirement for reintegrated ex- 
combatants to register regularly either with local civil affairs offices of the military or the 
local Army camps. Furthermore, military and intelligence agencies do not undertake visits 
to homes or workplaces of those who have been released for interrogation purposes.  The 
claim that women are subjected to stigma following contact with the military is without 
basis.   
</p>
<p>28. <b>Therefore, the content of the report on these matters are inaccurate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reference to Internal Displacement and Land Issues 
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>Paragraph 38 - </b>The GoSL took the responsibility upon itself to provide relief to the 
IDPs which was a result of the long conflict. Following the end of the conflict, a 180-day 
Action program was designed to quickly address the basic infrastructure with $3.2 billion at 
its disposal to take care of water, sewerage, electricity, health and education sector with 900 
schools now functioning with over 260,000 students and close to 14,000 teachers. 300,000 
people have so far benefitted from water supply in the Jaffna peninsula. Water supply and 
sanitation alone has cost $164 million. Resettlement package consisting 6 months dry 
rations, total shelter grant of Rs.25,000 per family, 40 perch land, non-food relief items has 
been provided to IDPs. 
</p>
<p>30. <b>Therefore, it is inaccurate for the OHCHR to state in its Report that Sri Lanka 
</b>&#8220;has no comprehensive national policy on IDPs&#8221;. The resettlement process is 
</p>
<p><b>comprehensive and the Government policy in this regard is reflected in the progress 
</b></p>
<p><b>made to date and has been commended by the wider international community. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ministry of Resettlement functions under a clear policy on resettlement.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Reference to Demilitarisation 
</b></p>
<p>31. <b>Paragraph 47 </b>- The contents of this paragraph negatively portrays the otherwise 
positive role of the military. <b>There is no institutionalisation of military authority over 
civilian matters as claimed in the report. The military has no involvement in civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration in the North and East. </b>The civil administration system in the North and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/38/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>East is fully functional with Government Officials at the District, Divisional and grassroots 
levels being appointed and discharging their functions.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>32. The military delivers development assistance as done in other parts of the country.  
In a post-conflict situation, it is normal for the armed forces to be involved in rebuilding the 
lives of civilians in the conflict affected areas in the absence of effective civilian 
institutions. This should be viewed as a temporary measure until the civilian institutions 
take over these functions. While the military is involved in the development activities in the 
former conflict areas, the capacity-building of the civilian institutions take place in parallel. 
Sri Lankan military&#8223;s assistance in the reconstruction and relief efforts has been welcomed 
by the people in the area, since the military has been effective in assisting these citizens. If 
it had not been for the military&#8223;s involvement, it would have been extremely difficult to 
</p>
<p>provide critical assistance required by the civilians, in the aftermath of the conflict. 
Delivery of such assistance serves to win the hearts and minds of the population 
traumatized of the conflict, and is also a confidence building measure.  
</p>
<p>33. <b>Paragraph 48 </b>- It is the prerogative of the Government of Sri Lanka to establish 
military zones in places the Government deems necessary, for valid security reasons, <b>and 
the GoSL rejects the claim of increasing militarisation of civilian functions, as the civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration has always been in the North, even during the conflict</b>.  
</p>
<p>34. With regard to observations of OHCHR technical mission, the areas described are a 
part of Civil Military Cooperation and is in no way intended to usurp the powers of civil 
administration, and is similar to activities of other militaries in the world. 
</p>
<p>35. <b>Paragraph 49 </b>- <b>All acquisition of land has been done according to the 
prescribed law and the Government has taken measures to pay compensation to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>owners of the property and provide alternate land to them. The claim that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>military is involved in economic activities is factually incorrect.</b> 
</p>
<p>36. <b>Paragraph 50 </b>- The content of this paragraph is inaccurate. The members of the 
general public are not required to give notice to local Army posts for activities referred to in  
the paragraph. In order for national development priorities to be implemented in an 
effective and coordinated manner, NGOs are required to provide information to the 
Government on activities that they intend to undertake. In addition, it is also important for 
purposes of accountability for NGOs to provide information on their activities and source 
funding. The need for NGOs to register with the NGO Secretariat is a requirement under 
the relevant legislation in Sri Lanka, namely the Voluntary Social Services Organisations 
(Registration &amp; Supervision) Act No 31 of 1980 as amended by Act No 8 of 1998. The 
requirement for authorisation to undertake activities and for disclosure of sources of 
funding is stipulated in the relevant Acts and applicable for the whole country, and not 
restricted to the North. The content of this paragraph convolutes this aspect.   
</p>
<p>37. <b>Paragraph 51</b> - The correlation between military presence and the points discussed 
in the paragraph is ambiguous. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
