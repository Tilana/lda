 <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of promoting the memory of victims of massive and 
systematic human rights violations and the importance of the right to truth and justice,  
 <i>Recognizing in particular</i> the important and valuable work of Monsignor Oscar 
Arnulfo Romero, of El Salvador, who was actively engaged in the promotion and protection 
of human rights in his country, and whose work was acknowledged internationally through 
his messages, in which he denounced violations of the human rights of the most vulnerable 
populations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the values of Monsignor Romero and his dedication to the service of 
humanity, in the context of armed conflicts, as a humanist dedicated to defending human 
rights, protecting lives and promoting human dignity, his constant calls to dialogue and his 
opposition to all forms of violence to avoid armed confrontation, which consequently led to
