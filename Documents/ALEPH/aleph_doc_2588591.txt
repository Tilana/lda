consolidated subsidiaries. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(“SEC”) “Plain English” guidelines, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been written in the
first person. In this document, the words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer only to HollyFrontier and
its consolidated subsidiaries or to HollyFrontier or an individual subsidiary and not to any other
person with certain exceptions. Generally, the words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” include Holly
Energy Partners, L.P. (“HEP”) and its subsidiaries as consolidated subsidiaries of HollyFrontier,
unless when used in disclosures of transactions or obligations between HEP and HollyFrontier
or its other subsidiaries. This document contains certain disclosures of agreements that are
specific to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries and do not necessarily represent obligations of
HollyFrontier. When used in descriptions of agreements and transactions, “HEP” refers to HEP
and its consolidated subsidiaries.
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements, other than statements of historical fact
included in this Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to, those under “Results of Operations,”
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Management” in Part I, Item 2 “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and those in Part II,
Item 1 “Legal Proceedings” are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements use
words such as “anticipate,” “project,” “expect,” “plan,” “goal,” “forecast,” “intend,” “should,” “would,”
“could,” “believe,” “may,” and similar expressions and statements regarding our plans and
objectives for future operations. These statements are based on management’s beliefs and
assumptions using currently available information and expectations as of the date hereof, are not
guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties. All statements
concerning our expectations for future results of operations are based on forecasts for our
existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we cannot assure you that our expectations will prove to be correct. Therefore, actual outcomes
and results could materially differ from what is expressed, implied or forecast in these statements.
Any differences could be caused by a number of factors including, but not limited to:
risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions of actual or potential competitive suppliers of
refined petroleum products in our markets;
•the demand for and supply of crude oil and refined products;
•the spread between market prices for refined products and market prices for crude oil;
•the possibility of constraints on the transportation of refined products;
•the possibility of inefficiencies, curtailments or shutdowns in refinery operations or pipelines;
•effects of governmental and environmental regulations and policies;
•the availability and cost of our financing;
•the effectiveness of our capital investments and marketing strategies;
•our efficiency in carrying out construction projects;
our ability to acquire refined product operations or pipeline and terminal operations on
acceptable terms and to integrate any existing or future acquired operations;
•the possibility of terrorist attacks and the consequences of any such attacks;
•general economic conditions; and
other financial, operational and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our
SEC filings.
•
•
•
Cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our expectations are set forth in this Form 10-Q, including without limitation, the
forward-looking statements that are referred to above. This summary discussion should be read
in conjunction with the discussion of the known material risk factors and other cautionary
statements under the heading “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form

Factors.” All forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q and all subsequent written or
oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements speak
only as of the date made and, other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

“Ethanol” means a high octane gasoline blend stock that is used to make various grades of
gasoline.
“FCC,” or fluid catalytic cracking, means a refinery process that breaks down large complex
hydrocarbon molecules into smaller more useful ones using a circulating bed of catalyst at
relatively high temperatures.
“Hydrodesulfurization” means to remove sulfur and nitrogen compounds from oil or gas in the
presence of hydrogen and a catalyst at relatively high temperatures.
“Hydrogen plant” means a refinery unit that converts natural gas and steam to high purity

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1:Description of Business and Presentation of Financial Statements
References herein to HollyFrontier Corporation (“HollyFrontier”) include HollyFrontier and its
consolidated subsidiaries. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(“SEC”) “Plain English” guidelines, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been written in the
first person. In these financial statements, the words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer only to
HollyFrontier and its consolidated subsidiaries or to HollyFrontier or an individual subsidiary and
not to any other person, with certain exceptions. Generally, the words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us”
include Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (“HEP”) and its subsidiaries as consolidated subsidiaries of
HollyFrontier, unless when used in disclosures of transactions or obligations between HEP and
HollyFrontier or its other subsidiaries. These financial statements contain certain disclosures of
agreements that are specific to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries and do not necessarily
represent obligations of HollyFrontier. When used in descriptions of agreements and
transactions, “HEP” refers to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are principally an independent petroleum refiner that produces high-value light products such
as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, specialty lubricant products, and specialty and modified asphalt.
We own and operate petroleum refineries that serve markets throughout the Mid-Continent,
Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. As of June 30, 2016, we:
owned and operated a petroleum refinery in El Dorado, Kansas (the “El Dorado Refinery”), two
refinery facilities located in Tulsa, Oklahoma (collectively, the “Tulsa Refineries”), a refinery in
Artesia, New Mexico that is operated in conjunction with crude oil distillation and vacuum
distillation and other facilities situated 65 miles away in Lovington, New Mexico (collectively, the
“Navajo Refinery”), a refinery located in Cheyenne, Wyoming (the “Cheyenne Refinery”) and a
refinery in Woods Cross, Utah (the “Woods Cross Refinery”);
owned and operated HollyFrontier Asphalt Company LLC (“HFC Asphalt”) which operates
various asphalt terminals in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma; and
owned a 39% interest in HEP, a consolidated variable interest entity (“VIE”), which includes our
2% general partner interest.

•
We have prepared these consolidated financial statements without audit. In management’s
opinion, these consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position as of June 30, 2016, the
consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and consolidated cash flows for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Although certain notes
and other information required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted, we believe that the disclosures in these consolidated
financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 that has been filed with the SEC.
Our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results of operations to be realized for the year ending December 31, 2016.
Accounts Receivable: Our accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers that are
primarily companies in the petroleum industry. Credit is extended based on our evaluation of the
customer’s financial condition, and in certain circumstances collateral, such as letters of credit or
guarantees, is required. We reserve for doubtful accounts based on our historical loss experience
as well as specific accounts identified as high risk, which historically have been minimal. Credit
losses are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed
uncollectible. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.3 million at both June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method
for crude oil, unfinished and finished refined products and the average cost method for materials
and supplies, or market. In periods of rapidly declining prices, LIFO inventories may have to be
written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to LIFO layers in prior periods. In
addition, the use of the LIFO inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of
sales in years that inventory volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with LIFO
inventory costs generated in prior periods. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO
method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels at that time. Accordingly,
interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory
levels and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
Goodwill and Long-lived Assets: As of December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, our goodwill
balance was $2.3 billion, with $1.7 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion allocated to our El Dorado
Refinery, Cheyenne Refinery and HEP reporting units, respectively. Goodwill represents the
excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually or more frequently if an
event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our goodwill impairment testing first entails a
comparison of our reporting unit fair values relative to their respective carrying values. If carrying
value exceeds fair value for a reporting unit, we measure goodwill impairment as the excess of
the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill based
on estimates of the fair value of all assets and liabilities in the reporting unit. Prior to the second
quarter of 2016, there had been no impairments to goodwill.
Our long-lived assets principally consist of our refining assets that are organized as refining asset
groups. These refinery asset groups also constitute our individual refinery reporting units that are
used for testing and measuring goodwill impairments (El Dorado and Cheyenne). Our long-lived
assets are evaluated for impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and if
so, assessing whether the long-lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted
cash flows. The actual amount of impairment loss measured, if any, is equal to the amount by
which the asset group’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments
During the second quarter of 2016, we performed interim goodwill impairment testing of our El
Dorado and Cheyenne Refinery reporting units after identifying a combination of events and
circumstances which were indicators of potential goodwill impairment, including lower than
typical gross margins during the summer driving season, a current outlook of lower future gross
margins, and the recent decline in our common share price which has resulted in a decrease in
our market capitalization. In conjunction with our interim goodwill impairment testing performed,
we first assessed the carrying values of our refining long-lived asset groups for recoverability.
Our interim goodwill impairment and related long-lived asset impairment testing was performed
as of April 30, 2016. The estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and long-lived asset
groups were derived using a combination of both income and market approaches. The income
approach reflects expected future cash flows based on estimates of future crack spreads,
forecasted production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. Our market approaches
include both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Both methods
utilize pricing multiples derived from historical market transactions of other like-kind assets.
These fair value measurements involve significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). See
Note 3 for further discussion of Level 3 inputs.
As a result of our impairment testing, we determined that the carrying value of the long-lived
assets of the Cheyenne Refinery had been impaired and recorded long-lived asset impairment
charges of $344.8 million. Additionally, the carrying value of the Cheyenne Refinery’s goodwill
was fully impaired and a goodwill impairment charge of $309.3 million was also recorded. Our
testing did not identify any other impairment; however, the fair value of our El Dorado reporting
unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15%. A reasonable expectation exists
that further deterioration in gross margins could result in an impairment of goodwill and the long-
lived assets of the El Dorado reporting unit at some point in the future. Such impairment charges
could be material.
Income Taxes: Provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes resulting from temporary
differences in income for financial and tax purposes, using the liability method of accounting for
income taxes. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on deferred income
taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely
than not that the assets will be realized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) Continued
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $15.7 million
compared to expense of $336.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease
was due principally to a pre-tax loss during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
pre-tax earnings in the same period of 2015. Our effective tax rates, before consideration of
earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, were 4.3% and 35.3% for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax
rate is due principally to the effects of the second quarter $309.3 million goodwill impairment
charge, a significant driver of our $364.8 million loss before income taxes for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, that is not deductible for income tax purposes.
Inventory Repurchase Obligations: We periodically enter into same-party sell / buy transactions,
whereby we sell certain refined product inventory and subsequently repurchase the inventory in
order to facilitate delivery to certain locations. Such sell / buy transactions are accounted as
inventory repurchase obligations under which proceeds received under the initial sell is
recognized as an inventory repurchase obligation that is subsequently reversed when the
inventory is repurchased. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we received
proceeds of $29.8 million and $50.0 million, respectively, and repaid $30.2 million and $51.0
million, respectively, under these sell / buy transactions.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In February 2016, Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases,” was issued requiring
leases to be measured and recognized as a lease liability, with a corresponding right-of-use
asset on the balance sheet. This standard has an effective date of January 1, 2019, and we are
evaluating the impact of this standard.
Consolidation
In February 2015, ASU 2015-02, “Consolidation,” was issued to improve consolidation guidance
for certain legal entities. It modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar
legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general
partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting
entities involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party
provisions and provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for certain reporting
entities that comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those
included in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.
We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, which did not affect our financial position or
results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” was issued requiring
revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an
amount that reflects the expected consideration for these goods or services. This standard has an
effective date of January 1, 2018, and we are evaluating the impact of this standard.
NOTE 2:Holly Energy Partners
HEP, a consolidated VIE, is a publicly held master limited partnership that owns and operates
logistic assets consisting of petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminals, tankage,
loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that principally support our refining and
marketing operations in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United
States and Alon USA, Inc.’s (“Alon”) refinery in Big Spring, Texas. Additionally, HEP owns a 75%
interest in UNEV Pipeline, LLC (“UNEV”), the owner of a pipeline running from Woods Cross,
Utah to Las Vegas, Nevada (the “UNEV Pipeline”) and associated product terminals; a 50%
interest in Frontier Aspen LLC, the owner of a pipeline running from Wyoming to Frontier Station,
Utah (the “Frontier Pipeline”); a 50% interest in Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC, the owner of a
pipeline running from Cushing, Oklahoma to El Dorado, Kansas (the “Osage Pipeline”); a 50%
interest in Cheyenne Pipeline, LLC, the owner of a pipeline running from Fort Laramie, Wyoming
to Cheyenne, Wyoming (the “Cheyenne Pipeline”); and a 25% interest in SLC Pipeline LLC, the
owner of a pipeline (the “SLC Pipeline”) that serves refineries in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned a 39% interest in HEP, including the 2% general partner interest.
As the general partner of HEP, we have the sole ability to direct the activities that most
significantly impact HEP’s financial performance, and therefore we consolidate HEP.

HOLLYFRONTIER CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) Continued
HEP has two primary customers (including us) and generates revenues by charging tariffs for
transporting petroleum products and crude oil through its pipelines, by charging fees for
terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons, and storing and providing other services at
its storage tanks and terminals. Under our long-term transportation agreements with HEP
(discussed further below), we accounted for 82% of HEP’s total revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2016. We do not provide financial or equity support through any liquidity
arrangements and / or debt guarantees to HEP.
HEP has outstanding debt under a senior secured revolving credit agreement and its senior
notes. HEP’s creditors have no recourse to our assets. Furthermore, our creditors have no
recourse to the assets of HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries. See Note 9 for a description of
HEP’s debt obligations.
HEP has risk associated with its operations. If a major customer of HEP were to terminate its
contracts or fail to meet desired shipping or throughput levels for an extended period of time,
revenue would be reduced and HEP could suffer substantial losses to the extent that a new
customer is not found. In the event that HEP incurs a loss, our operating results will reflect HEP’s
loss, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in HEP at that point
in time.
Cheyenne Pipeline
On June 3, 2016, HEP acquired a 50% interest in Cheyenne Pipeline LLC, owner of the
Cheyenne Pipeline, in exchange for a contribution of $42.5 million in cash to Cheyenne Pipeline
LLC. Cheyenne Pipeline will continue to be operated by an affiliate of Plains All American
Pipeline, L.P. (“Plains”), which owns the remaining 50% interest. The 87-mile crude oil pipeline
runs from Fort Laramie, Wyoming to Cheyenne, Wyoming and has an 80,000 BPD capacity.
Tulsa Tanks
On March 31, 2016, HEP acquired crude oil tanks located at our Tulsa Refineries from Plains for
$39.5 million. Previously in 2009, we sold these tanks to Plains and leased them back, and due
to our continuing interest in the tanks, we accounted for the transaction as a financing
arrangement. Accordingly, the tanks remained on our balance sheet and were depreciated for
accounting purposes, and the proceeds received from Plains were recorded as a financing
obligation and presented as a component of outstanding debt.
In accounting for HEP’s March 2016 purchase from Plains, the amount paid was recorded
against our outstanding financing obligation balance of $30.8 million, with the excess $8.7
million payment resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt.
Magellan Asset Exchange
On February 22, 2016, we acquired a 50% membership interest in Osage Pipe Line Company,
LLC (“Osage”) in exchange for a 20-year terminalling services agreement, whereby a subsidiary
of Magellan Midstream Partners (“Magellan Midstream”) will provide terminalling services for all
of our products originating in Artesia, New Mexico that require terminalling in or through El Paso,
Texas. Under the agreement, we will be charged tariffs based on the volumes of refined product
processed. Osage is the owner of the Osage Pipeline, a 135-mile pipeline that transports crude
oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to our El Dorado Refinery in Kansas and also has a connection to
the Jayhawk pipeline that services the CHS refinery in McPherson, Kansas. This exchange was
accounted for at fair value, whereby the 50% membership interest in the Osage Pipeline was
recorded at appraised fair value and an offsetting residual deferred credit in the amount of $38.9
million was recorded, which will be amortized over the 20-year service period. No gain or loss
was recorded for this exchange.
Also on February 22, 2016, we contributed the 50% membership interest in Osage to HEP, and
in exchange received HEP’s El Paso terminal. Pursuant to this exchange, HEP agreed to build
two connections to Magellan Midstream’s El Paso terminal. In addition, HEP agreed to become
operator of the Osage Pipeline. This exchange was accounted for at carry-over basis with no
resulting gain or loss.
HEP’s acquisitions from us are eliminated upon consolidation and have no impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

HEP Common Unit Continuous Offering Program
On May 10, 2016, HEP established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue
and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an
aggregate gross sales amount of $200 million. As of June 30, 2016, HEP has issued 444,799
units under this program, providing $14.9 million in gross proceeds. In connection with this
program and to maintain the 2% general partner interest, we made capital contributions totaling
$0.3 million as of June 30, 2016.
HEP intends to use the net proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include
funding working capital, repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures. Amounts
repaid under HEP’s credit facility may be reborrowed from time to time.
As a result of this transaction and resulting HEP ownership changes, we adjusted additional
capital and equity attributable to HEP's noncontrolling interest holders to reallocate HEP's equity
among its unitholders.
Transportation Agreements
HEP serves our refineries under long-term pipeline, terminal and tankage throughput agreements
and refinery processing tolling agreements expiring from 2019 through 2030. Under these
agreements, we pay HEP fees to transport, store and process throughput volumes of refined
products, crude oil and feedstocks on HEP’s pipeline, terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities
and refinery processing units that result in minimum annual payments to HEP including UNEV (a
consolidated subsidiary of HEP). Under these agreements, the agreed upon tariff rates are
subject to annual tariff rate adjustments on July 1 at a rate based upon the percentage change in
Producer Price Index or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission index. As of July 1, 2016, these
agreements result in minimum annualized payments to HEP of $263.6 million.
NOTE 3:Fair Value Measurements
Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable
securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt and derivative instruments. The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value. HEP’s outstanding credit agreement borrowings and HFC’s term loan also
approximate fair value as interest rates are reset frequently at current interest rates on both debt
instruments.
Fair value measurements are derived using inputs (assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk). GAAP categorizes inputs
used in fair value measurements into three broad levels as follows:
•
•(Level 1) Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
(Level 2) Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, similar assets and liabilities in markets that are
not active or can be corroborated by observable market data.
(Level 3) Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes valuation techniques that
involve significant unobservable inputs.

Level 1 Instruments
Our NYMEX futures contracts are exchange traded and are measured and recorded at fair value
using quoted market prices, a Level 1 input.
Level 2 Instruments
Investments in marketable securities, derivative instruments consisting of commodity price swaps
and forward sales and purchase contracts and HEP’s interest rate swaps are measured and
recorded at fair value using Level 2 inputs. The fair values of the commodity price and interest
rate swap contracts are based on the net present value of expected future cash flows related to
both variable and fixed rate legs of the respective swap agreements. The measurements are
computed using market-based observable inputs, quoted forward commodity prices with respect
to our commodity price swaps and the forward London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) yield
curve with respect to HEP’s interest rate swaps. The fair value of the marketable securities and
senior notes is based on values provided by a third-party, which were derived using market
quotes for similar type instruments, a Level 2 input.
Level 3 Instruments
We at times have forward commodity sales and purchase contracts for which quoted forward
market prices are not readily available. The forward rate used to value these forward sales and
purchase contracts are derived using a projected forward rate using quoted market rates for
similar products, adjusted for regional pricing and grade differentials, a Level 3 input.

NOTE 4:Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier
stockholders divided by the average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted

NOTE 5:Stock-Based Compensation
As of June 30, 2016, we have two principal share-based compensation plans (collectively, the
“Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan”).
The compensation cost charged against income for these plans was $6.0 million and $6.1 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $8.6 million and $12.5
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our accounting policy for
the recognition of compensation expense for awards with pro-rata vesting is to expense the costs
ratably over the vesting periods.

Table of Contents
HOLLYFRONTIER CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) Continued
Additionally, HEP maintains a share-based compensation plan for Holly Logistic Services,
L.L.C.’s non-employee directors and certain executives and employees. Compensation cost
attributable to HEP’s share-based compensation plan was $0.5 million and $0.9 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.2 million and $1.8 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
Under our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, we grant certain officers and other key
employees restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards with awards generally vesting over a
period of one to three years. Restricted stock award recipients are generally entitled to all the
rights of absolute ownership of the restricted shares from the date of grant including the right to
vote the shares and to receive dividends. Upon vesting, restrictions on the restricted shares lapse
at which time they convert to common shares. In addition, we grant non-employee directors
restricted stock unit awards, which typically vest over a period of one year and are payable in
stock. The fair value of each restricted stock and restricted stock unit award is measured based
on the grant date market price of our common shares and is amortized over the respective
vesting period.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, restricted stock and restricted stock units vested having
a grant date fair value of $16 thousand. As of June 30, 2016, there was $16.6 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock unit
grants. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years.
Performance Share Units
Under our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, we grant certain officers and other key
employees performance share units, which are payable in stock upon meeting certain criteria
over the service period, and generally vest over a period of three years. Under the terms of our
performance share unit grants, awards are subject to “financial performance” and “market
performance” criteria. Financial performance is based on our financial performance compared to
a peer group of independent refining companies, while market performance is based on the
relative standing of total shareholder return achieved by HollyFrontier compared to peer group
companies. The number of shares ultimately issued under these awards can range from zero to
200% of target award amounts. As of June 30, 2016, estimated share payouts for outstanding
non-vested performance share unit awards averaged approximately 80% of target amounts.
A summary of performance share unit activity and changes during the six months ended June 30,
2016 is presented below:

NOTE 6:Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments in Marketable Securities
Our investment portfolio at June 30, 2016 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and investments in
marketable securities.
We currently invest in marketable debt securities with the maximum maturity or put date of any
individual issue generally not greater than one year from the date of purchase, which are usually
held until maturity. All of these instruments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at
fair value. Interest income is recorded as earned. Unrealized gains and losses, net of related
income taxes, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon
sale or maturity, realized gains on our marketable debt securities are recognized as interest
income. These gains are computed based on the specific identification of the underlying cost of
the securities, net of unrealized gains and losses previously reported in other comprehensive
income. Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities are due to changes in
market prices and are considered temporary.
The following is a summary of our marketable securities as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,

Inventories, which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market, reflect a valuation reserve of
$429.9 million and $624.5 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The
December 31, 2015 market reserve of $624.5 million was reversed due to the sale of inventory
quantities that gave rise to the 2015 reserve. A new market reserve of $429.9 million was
established as of June 30, 2016 based on market conditions and prices at that time. The effect of
the change in lower of cost or market reserve was a decrease to cost of goods sold totaling
$138.5 million and $135.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $194.6 million and $142.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
NOTE 8:Environmental
Environmental costs are charged to operating expenses if they relate to an existing condition
caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. We have
ongoing investigations of environmental matters at various locations as part of our assessment
process to determine the amount of environmental obligation we may have, if any, with respect to
these matters for which we have recorded the estimated cost of the studies. Liabilities are
recorded when site restoration and environmental remediation, cleanup and other obligations are
either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are
undiscounted and require judgment with respect to costs, time frame and extent of required
remedial and cleanup activities and are subject to periodic adjustments based on currently
available information. Recoveries of environmental costs through insurance, indemnification
arrangements or other sources are included in other assets to the extent such recoveries are
considered probable.
We expensed $0.5 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $1.3 million and $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, for environmental remediation obligations. The accrued environmental liability
reflected in our consolidated balance sheets was $95.8 million and $98.1 million at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, of which $81.7 million and $83.5 million,
respectively, were classified as other long-term liabilities. These accruals include remediation
and monitoring costs expected to be incurred over an extended period of time (up to 30 years for
certain projects). The amount of our accrued liability could increase in the future when the results
of ongoing investigations become known, are considered probable and can be reasonably
estimated.
NOTE 9:Debt
HollyFrontier Credit Agreement
We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in July 2019 (the
“HollyFrontier Credit Agreement”), which may be used for revolving credit loans and letters of
credit from time to time and is available to fund general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under
the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement is recourse to HollyFrontier. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we received advances totaling $315.0 million and repaid $315.0 million under the
HollyFrontier Credit Agreement. At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants,
had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit totaling $3.3 million under
the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement.
HEP Credit Agreement
In March 2016, HEP amended its senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in November
2018 (the “HEP Credit Agreement”), increasing the size of the facility from $850 million to $1.2
billion. The HEP Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments,
acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital and for general partnership purposes. It is
also available to fund letters of credit up to a $50 million sub-limit. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, HEP received advances totaling $239.0 million and repaid $165.0 million under
the HEP Credit Agreement. At June 30, 2016, HEP was in compliance with all of its covenants,
had outstanding borrowings of $786.0 million and no outstanding letters of credit under the HEP
Credit Agreement.
HEP’s obligations under the HEP Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of
HEP’s assets. Indebtedness under the HEP Credit Agreement involves recourse to HEP
Logistics Holdings, L.P., its general partner, and is guaranteed by HEP’s wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Any recourse to the general partner would be limited to the extent of HEP Logistics
Holdings, L.P.’s assets, which other than its investment in HEP are not significant. HEP’s
creditors have no recourse to our other assets. Furthermore, our creditors have no recourse to the
assets of HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries.

HollyFrontier Senior Notes
In March 2016, we issued $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes (the
“HollyFrontier Senior Notes”) maturing April 2026. The HollyFrontier Senior Notes are unsecured
and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
In June 2015, we redeemed our $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior
notes maturing November 2018 at a redemption cost of $155.2 million at which time we
recognized a $1.4 million early extinguishment loss consisting of a $5.2 million debt redemption
premium, net of an unamortized premium of $3.8 million.
HollyFrontier Financing Obligation
In March 2016, we extinguished a financing obligation at a cost of $39.5 million and recognized
an $8.7 million loss on the early termination. The financing obligation related to a sale and lease-
back of certain crude oil tankage that we sold to an affiliate of Plains in October 2009 for $40.0
million.
HollyFrontier Term Loan
In April 2016, we entered into a $350 million senior unsecured term loan (the “HollyFrontier Term
Loan”) maturing in April 2019. The HollyFrontier Term Loan is fully drawn and may be used for
general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under the HollyFrontier Term Loan is recourse to
HollyFrontier.
HEP Senior Notes
HEP has $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% senior notes maturing March 2020.
In July 2016, HEP issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.0% HEP senior notes
maturing in 2024 in a private placement. HEP used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness
under the HEP Credit Agreement.
The 6.5% and 6.0% HEP senior notes (collectively, the “HEP Senior Notes”) are unsecured and
impose certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on HEP’s ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, pay distributions, enter into
transactions with affiliates, and enter into mergers. At any time when the HEP Senior Notes are
rated investment grade by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s and no default or event of default
exists, HEP will not be subject to many of the foregoing covenants. Additionally, HEP has certain
redemption rights under the HEP Senior Notes.
Indebtedness under the HEP Senior Notes is guaranteed by HEP’s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
HEP’s creditors have no recourse to our assets. Furthermore, our creditors have no recourse to
the assets of HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries.

NOTE 10: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Commodity Price Risk Management
Our primary market risk is commodity price risk. We are exposed to market risks related to the
volatility in crude oil and refined products, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in
our refining operations. We periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of commodity
price swaps, forward purchase and sales and futures contracts to mitigate price exposure with
respect to:
•our inventory positions;
•natural gas purchases;
•costs of crude oil and related grade differentials;
•prices of refined products; and
•our refining margins.
Accounting Hedges
We have swap contracts serving as cash flow hedges against price risk on forecasted purchases
of natural gas. We also periodically have forward sales contracts that lock in the prices of future
sales of crude oil and refined product and swap contracts serving as cash flow hedges against
price risk on forecasted purchases of WTI crude oil and forecasted sales of refined product.
These contracts have been designated as accounting hedges and are measured at fair value
with offsetting adjustments (gains/losses) recorded directly to other comprehensive income.
These fair value adjustments are later reclassified to earnings as the hedging instruments
mature. On a quarterly basis, hedge ineffectiveness is measured by comparing the change in fair
value of the swap contracts against the expected future cash inflows/outflows on the respective
transaction being hedged. Any hedge ineffectiveness is also recognized in earnings.

In 2013, we dedesignated certain commodity price swaps (long positions) that previously
received hedge accounting treatment. These contracts now serve as economic hedges against
price risk on forecasted natural gas purchases totaling 14,400,000 MMBTU’s to be purchased
ratably through 2017. As of June 30, 2016, we have an unrealized loss of $1.6 million classified
in accumulated other comprehensive income that relates to the application of hedge accounting
prior to dedesignation that is amortized as a charge to operating expenses as the contracts
mature.
Economic Hedges
We also have swap contracts that serve as economic hedges (derivatives used for risk
management, but not designated as accounting hedges) to fix our purchase price on forecasted
purchases of WTI crude oil, and to lock in basis spread differentials on forecasted purchases of
crude oil and natural gas. Also, we have NYMEX futures contracts to lock in prices on forecasted
purchases of inventory. These contracts are measured at fair value with offsetting adjustments
(gains/losses) recorded directly to income.

Interest Rate Risk Management
HEP uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
As of June 30, 2016, HEP had two interest rate swap contracts with identical terms that hedge its
exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of LIBOR changes on $150.0 million in credit
agreement advances. The swaps effectively convert $150.0 million of LIBOR based debt to fixed
rate debt having an interest rate of 0.74% plus an applicable margin of 2.25% as of June 30,
2016, which equaled an effective interest rate of 2.99%. Both of these swap contracts mature in
July 2017 and have been designated as cash flow hedges. To date, there has been no
ineffectiveness on these cash flow hedges.

At June 30, 2016, we had a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $24.7 million classified in accumulated
other comprehensive income that relates to all accounting hedges having contractual maturities
through 2017. Assuming commodity prices and interest rates remain unchanged, an unrealized
loss of $16.2 million will be effectively transferred from accumulated other comprehensive
income into the statement of income as the hedging instruments contractually mature over the
next twelve-month period.

(1) Includes 124 shares withheld under the terms of stock-based compensation agreements to
provide funds for the payment of payroll and income taxes due at the vesting of share-based
awards.
In May 2015, our Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program, which
replaced all existing share repurchase programs, authorizing us to repurchase common stock in
the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of stock
repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate, regulatory and other relevant
considerations. This program may be discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors. As of
June 30, 2016, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $178.8 million under this
stock repurchase program. In addition, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase
shares in an amount sufficient to offset shares issued under our compensation programs.
During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement
with a large financial institution to repurchase $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In
May 2015, we repurchased 5.5 million shares, representing 80% of the amount paid based on
then-market prices. For the remaining shares to be repurchased, we recorded a forward contract
indexed to our own common stock in the amount of $60.0 million at June 30, 2015. The
agreement was completed in September 2015, at which time we acquired an additional 1.2
million shares upon settlement of the forward contract.

NOTE 14:Contingencies
We are a party to various litigation and legal proceedings which we believe, based on advice of
counsel, will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE 15:Segment Information
Our operations are organized into two reportable segments, Refining and HEP. Our operations
that are not included in the Refining and HEP segments are included in Corporate and Other.
Intersegment transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements and are
included in Consolidations and Eliminations.
The Refining segment represents the operations of the El Dorado, Tulsa, Navajo, Cheyenne and
Woods Cross Refineries and HFC Asphalt (aggregated as a reportable segment). Refining
activities involve the purchase and refining of crude oil and wholesale and branded marketing of
refined products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. These petroleum products are
primarily marketed in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United
States. Additionally, the Refining segment includes specialty lubricant products produced at our
Tulsa Refineries that are marketed throughout North America and are distributed in Central and
South America. HFC Asphalt operates various asphalt terminals in Arizona, New Mexico and
Oklahoma.
The HEP segment includes all of the operations of HEP, which owns and operates logistics and
refinery assets consisting of petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminals, tankage,
loading rack facilities and processing units in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain
regions of the United States. The HEP segment also includes a 75% ownership interest in UNEV
(a consolidated subsidiary of HEP); a 50% ownership interest in each of the Frontier Pipeline,
Osage Pipeline and the Cheyenne Pipeline and a 25% ownership interest in the SLC Pipeline.
Revenues from the HEP segment are earned through transactions with unaffiliated parties for
pipeline transportation, rental and terminalling operations as well as revenues relating to pipeline
transportation services provided for our refining operations. Due to certain basis differences, our
reported amounts for the HEP segment may not agree to amounts reported in HEP’s periodic
public filings.
The accounting policies for our segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

(1) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded goodwill and long-lived
asset impairment charges of $309.3 million and $344.8 million, respectively, that relate to our
Cheyenne Refinery, which is included in our Refining segment.
(2) HEP acquired the crude oil tanks at our Tulsa Refineries in March 2016. As a result, we have
recast our 2015 HEP segment information to include these assets and related capital
expenditures that were previously presented under the Refining segment.
HEP segment revenues from external customers were $15.7 million and $15.2 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $34.9 million and $32.7 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
NOTE 16:Additional Financial Information
Borrowings pursuant to the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement are recourse to HollyFrontier, but not
HEP. Furthermore, borrowings under the HEP Credit Agreement are recourse to HEP, but not to
the assets of HFC with the exception of HEP Logistics Holdings, L.P., HEP’s general partner.
Other than its investment in HEP, the assets of the general partner are insignificant.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Item 2 contains “forward-looking” statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” at the
beginning of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. References herein to HollyFrontier
Corporation (“HollyFrontier”) include HollyFrontier and its consolidated subsidiaries. In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) “Plain English” guidelines,
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been written in the first person. In this document, the
words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer only to HollyFrontier and its consolidated subsidiaries or to
HollyFrontier or an individual subsidiary and not to any other person with certain exceptions.
Generally, the words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” include Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (“HEP”) and
its subsidiaries as consolidated subsidiaries of HollyFrontier, unless when used in disclosures of
transactions or obligations between HEP and HollyFrontier or its other subsidiaries. This
document contains certain disclosures of agreements that are specific to HEP and its
consolidated subsidiaries and do not necessarily represent obligations of HollyFrontier. When
used in descriptions of agreements and transactions, “HEP” refers to HEP and its consolidated
subsidiaries.
OVERVIEW
We are principally an independent petroleum refiner that produces high-value refined products
such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, specialty lubricant products, and specialty and modified
asphalt. We own and operate refineries having a combined nameplate crude oil processing
capacity of 443,000 barrels per day that serve markets throughout the Mid-Continent, Southwest
and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Our refineries are located in El Dorado,
Kansas (the “El Dorado Refinery”), Tulsa, Oklahoma (the, “Tulsa Refineries”), which comprise
two production facilities, the Tulsa West and East facilities, Artesia, New Mexico, which operates
in conjunction with crude, vacuum distillation and other facilities situated 65 miles away in
Lovington, New Mexico (collectively, the “Navajo Refinery”), Cheyenne, Wyoming (the,
“Cheyenne Refinery”) and Woods Cross, Utah (the “Woods Cross Refinery”).
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, net loss attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders
was $(409.4) million compared to net income of $360.8 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net loss attributable to HollyFrontier
stockholders was $(388.1) million compared to net income of $587.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. Included in our financial results for the second quarter of 2016 were non-
cash items consisting of goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, offset by an inventory
reserve adjustment. The non-cash impairment charges of $654.1 million relate to our Cheyenne
Refinery and the $138.5 million non-cash benefit is attributable to our second quarter lower of
cost or market inventory reserve adjustment. Combined, these non-cash items reduced second
quarter earnings attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders in the amount of $493.0 million, after
tax. Second quarter earnings reflect weak refining margins across the industry, with overall gross
refining margin per produced barrel decreasing 49% compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2015.
Pursuant to the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (“RFS2”) regulations, which
increased the volume of renewable fuels mandated to be blended into the nation’s fuel supply.
The regulations, in part, require refiners to add annually increasing amounts of “renewable fuels”
to their petroleum products or purchase credits, known as renewable identification numbers
(“RINs”), in lieu of such blending. Compliance with RFS2 significantly increases our cost of
products sold, with RINs costs totaling approximately $57.0 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016. Year-over-year increased costs of ethanol blended into our petroleum products,
which exceeded the cost of crude oil, also contributed to lower refining margins for the quarter.
OUTLOOK
Our profitability is affected by the spread, or differential, between the market prices for crude oil
on the world market (which is based on the price for Brent, North Sea Crude) and the price for
inland U.S. crude oil (which is based on the price for WTI). We expect continued volatility in the
pricing relationship between inland and coastal crude, currently averaging in the range of $1.00
to $(1.00) per barrel, and based on market forecasts, expected to average $2.00 to $5.00 per
barrel over the next few years.
Despite strong demand fundamentals, summer gasoline margins have been disappointing due to
supply outpacing demand. The combination of a higher industry-wide refinery utilization rate, a
2% increase in gasoline yield across the U.S. refining system, and rising imports have driven
gasoline inventories 11% above last year.
Our RINs costs are material and represent a cost of products sold. The price of RINs may be
extremely volatile due to real or perceived future shortages in RINs. As of June 30, 2016, we are
purchasing RINs in order to meet approximately half of our renewable fuel requirements.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as “EBITDA”,
is calculated as net income plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax
provision, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation provided for
under GAAP; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from
amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA should not be considered
as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating
performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is
not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA is
presented here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by investors and analysts
to measure performance. EBITDA is also used by our management for internal analysis and
as a basis for financial covenants. EBITDA presented above is reconciled to net income under
“Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
following Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-Q.
Our operations are organized into two reportable segments, Refining and HEP. See Note 15
“Segment Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on our reportable segments.
Refining Operating Data (Unaudited)
Our refinery operations include the El Dorado, Tulsa, Navajo, Cheyenne and Woods Cross
Refineries.The following tables set forth information, including non-GAAP performance
measures, about our consolidated refinery operations. The cost of products and refinery gross
and net operating margins do not include the non-cash effects of goodwill and asset impairments
charges, lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments and depreciation and
amortization. Reconciliations to amounts reported under GAAP are provided under
“Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”

Results of Operations – Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended
June 30, 2015
Summary
Net loss attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was
$(409.4) million ($(2.33) per basic and diluted share), a $770.2 million decrease compared to net
income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders of $360.8 million ($1.88 per basic and diluted
share) for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Net income decreased due principally to
goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of $309.3 million and $344.8 million,
respectively, and a year-over-year decrease in second quarter refining margins. For the three
months ended June 30, 2016, lower of cost or market inventory reserve adjustments increased
pre-tax earnings by $138.5 million compared to $135.5 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. Collectively, the impairment charges, net of the lower of cost or market valuation
benefit, reduced net income by $493.0 million, after tax, for the three months ended June 30,
2016. Refinery gross margins for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $8.88 per
produced barrel from $17.42 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Sales and Other Revenues
Sales and other revenues decreased 27% from $3,701.9 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 to $2,714.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 due to a year-over-
year decrease in second quarter sales prices and lower refined product sales volumes. The
average sales price we received per produced barrel sold was $80.41 for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 compared to $60.92 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Sales and
other revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include $15.7 million and
$15.2 million, respectively, in HEP revenues attributable to pipeline and transportation services
provided to unaffiliated parties.

Table of Content
Cost of Products Sold
Total cost of products sold decreased 23% from $2,752.0 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 to $2,109.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, due principally to
lower crude oil costs and lower sales volumes of refined products. Additionally during second
quarter of 2016, we recognized a $138.5 million lower of cost or market inventory valuation
benefit, a $3.0 million increase compared to 2015, resulting in a new $429.9 million inventory
reserve at June 30, 2016. The reserve at June 30, 2016 is based on market conditions and prices
at that time. Excluding this non-cash adjustment, the average price we paid per barrel for crude
oil and feedstocks and the transportation costs of moving finished products to market decreased
17% from $62.99 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $52.04 for the three months ended
June 30, 2016.
Gross Refinery Margins
Gross refinery margin per produced barrel decreased 49% from $17.42 for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 to $8.88 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. This was due to the
effects of a decrease in the average per barrel sales price for refined products sold, partially offset
by decreased crude oil and feedstock prices during the current year quarter. Gross refinery
margin does not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation
adjustments, goodwill and asset impairment charges or depreciation and amortization. See
“Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
following Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for a reconciliation to the income statement of prices of
refined products sold and cost of products purchased.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased 2% from $246.2
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $251.3 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016. This increase is principally due to higher maintenance costs compared to the
same period of 2015.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased 14% from $26.1 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 to $29.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 due principally
to increased costs attributable to professional services.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization increased 3% from $87.8 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 to $90.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was due
principally to depreciation and amortization attributable to capitalized improvement projects and
capitalized refinery turnaround costs.
Goodwill and Asset Impairment
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset
impairment charges of $309.3 million and $344.8 million, respectively, that relate to our
Cheyenne Refinery. See Note 1 “Description of Business and Presentation of Financial
Statements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the
Cheyenne impairment.
Interest Income
Interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.5 million compared to $0.8
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was due to lower investment
levels in marketable debt securities during the current year quarter.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $14.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $10.6
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is due to interest attributable to
higher debt levels during the current year quarter relative to the same period of 2015. For the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expense included $11.3 million and $9.1
million, respectively, in interest costs attributable to limited recourse debt that finances HEP
operations.
Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt
In June 2015, we redeemed our $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior
notes maturing November 2018 at a redemption cost of $155.2 million, at which time we
recognized a $1.4 million early extinguishment loss consisting of a $5.2 million debt redemption
premium, net of an unamortized premium of $3.8 million.

Income Taxes
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $38.0 million
compared to an expense of $207.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This
decrease was due principally to a pre-tax loss during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to pre-tax earnings in the same period of 2015. Our effective tax rates, before
consideration of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, were 8.8% and 35.7% for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the
effective tax rate is due principally to the effects of the second quarter $309.3 million goodwill
impairment charge, a significant driver of our $430.5 million loss before income taxes for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, that is not deductible for income tax purposes.
Results of Operations – Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended
June 30, 2015
Summary
Net loss attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was
$(388.1) million ($(2.20) per basic and diluted share), a $975.8 million decrease compared to net
income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders of $587.7 million ($3.03 per basic and diluted
share) for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net income decreased due principally to non-
cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of of $309.3 million and $344.1 million,
respectively, and a year-over-year decrease in refining margins and sales volumes, net of the
effects of a year-over-year change in lower of cost or market inventory reserve adjustments. For
the six months ended June 30, 2016, lower of cost or market inventory reserve adjustments
increased pre-tax earnings by $194.6 million compared to $142.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. Collectively, the impairment charges, net of the lower of cost or market
valuation benefit, reduced net income by $439.0 million, after tax, for the six months ended
June 30, 2016. Refinery gross margins for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to
$8.25 per produced barrel from $17.07 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Sales and Other Revenues
Sales and other revenues decreased 29% from $6,708.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $4,733.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to a year-over-
year decrease in sales prices and lower refined product sales volumes. The average sales price
we received per produced barrel sold was $75.16 for the six months ended June 30, 2015
compared to $53.83 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Sales and other revenues for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include $34.9 million and $32.7 million, respectively,
in HEP revenues attributable to pipeline and transportation services provided to unaffiliated
parties.
Cost of Products Sold
Total cost of products sold decreased 26% from $4,996.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $3,678.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, due principally to
lower crude oil costs and lower sales volumes of refined products. Additionally, this decrease
also reflects a $194.6 million benefit that is attributable to a reduction in the lower of cost or
market reserve for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a $52.6 million increase compared to a
benefit of $142.0 million for same period of last year. The reserve at June 30, 2016 is based on
market conditions and prices at that time. Excluding this non-cash adjustment, the average price
we paid per barrel for crude oil and feedstocks and the transportation costs of moving the finished
products to the marketplace decreased 22% from $58.09 for the six months ended June 30, 2015
to $45.58 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Gross Refinery Margins
Gross refinery margin per produced barrel decreased 52% from $17.07 for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $8.25 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. This was due to the effects of a
decrease in the average per barrel sales price for refined products sold, partially offset by
decreased crude oil and feedstock prices during the current year-to-date period. Gross refinery
margin does not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation
adjustments, goodwill and asset impairment charges or depreciation and amortization. See
“Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
following Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for a reconciliation to the income statement of prices of
refined products sold and cost of products purchased.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 1% from $509.8
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $503.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 due principally to lower natural gas fuel costs compared to the same period of
2015.

Table of Content
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased slightly from $55.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015 to $55.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 due principally to
lower incentive compensation costs for the current year compared to the same period of 2015,
net of an increase in costs attributable to professional services.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization increased 6% from $167.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $178.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was due
principally to depreciation and amortization attributable to capitalized improvement projects and
capitalized refinery turnaround costs.
Goodwill and Asset Impairment
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset
impairment charges of $309.3 million and $344.8 million, respectively, that relate to our
Cheyenne Refinery. See Note 1 “Description of Business and Presentation of Financial
Statements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the
Cheyenne impairment.
Interest Income
Interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.6 million compared to $1.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was due to lower investment
levels in marketable debt securities during the year-to-date period.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $26.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $20.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was due to interest attributable to
higher debt levels during the current year relative to the same period of 2015. For the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expense included $21.8 million and $17.8 million,
respectively, in interest costs attributable to limited recourse debt that finances HEP operations.
Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt
In March 2016, we recognized an $8.7 million loss on the early retirement of a financing
obligation, a component of outstanding debt, upon HEP’s purchase of crude oil tanks from an
affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline L.P. (“Plains”). See Note 9 “Debt” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this financing obligation.
In June 2015, we recognized a $1.4 million early extinguishment loss on the redemption of our
$150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes maturing November 2018.
Income Taxes
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $15.7 million
compared to expense of $336.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease
was due principally to a pre-tax loss during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
pre-tax earnings in the same period of 2015. Our effective tax rates, before consideration of
earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, were 4.3% and 35.3% for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax
rate is due principally to the effects of the second quarter $309.3 million goodwill impairment
charge, a significant driver of our $364.8 million loss before income taxes for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, that is not deductible for income tax purposes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
HollyFrontier Credit Agreement
We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in July 2019 (the
“HollyFrontier Credit Agreement”), which may be used for revolving credit loans and letters of
credit from time to time and is available to fund general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under
the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement is recourse to HollyFrontier. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we received advances totaling $315.0 million and repaid $315.0 million under the
HollyFrontier Credit Agreement. At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants,
had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit totaling $3.3 million under
the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement.
HollyFrontier Senior Notes
In March 2016, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes (the
“HollyFrontier Senior Notes”) maturing April 2026. The HollyFrontier Senior Notes are unsecured
and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
45
Table of Content
HollyFrontier Term Loan
In April 2016, we entered into a $350 million senior unsecured term loan (the “HollyFrontier Term
Loan”) maturing in April 2019. The HollyFrontier Term Loan is fully drawn and may be used for
general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under the HollyFrontier Term Loan is recourse to
HollyFrontier.
HEP Credit Agreement
In March 2016, HEP amended its senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in November
2018 (the “HEP Credit Agreement”), increasing the size of the facility from $850 million to $1.2
billion. The HEP Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments,
acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital and for general partnership purposes. It is
also available to fund letters of credit up to a $50 million sub-limit. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, HEP received advances totaling $239.0 million and repaid $165.0 million under
the HEP Credit Agreement. At June 30, 2016, HEP was in compliance with all of its covenants,
had outstanding borrowings of $786.0 million and no outstanding letters of credit under the HEP
Credit Agreement.
HEP Debt Offering
In July 2016, HEP issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.0% HEP unsecured
senior notes maturing in 2024 in a private placement. HEP used the net proceeds to repay
indebtedness under the HEP Credit Agreement.
See Note 9 “Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
on our debt instruments.
HEP Common Unit Continuous Offering Program
On May 10, 2016, HEP established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue
and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an
aggregate gross sales amount of $200 million. As of June 30, 2016, HEP has issued 444,799
units under this program, providing $14.9 million in gross proceeds. In connection with this
program and to maintain the 2% general partner interest, we made capital contributions totaling
$0.3 million as of June 30, 2016.
HEP intends to use the net proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include
funding working capital, repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures. Amounts
repaid under HEP’s credit facility may be reborrowed from time to time.
Liquidity
We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, along with future internally generated cash
flow and funds available under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient resources to fund
currently planned capital projects and our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. In addition,
components of our growth strategy include construction of new refinery processing units and the
expansion of existing units at our facilities and selective acquisition of complementary assets for
our refining operations intended to increase earnings and cash flow.
As of June 30, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities totaled
$533.3 million. We consider all highly-liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates market value. These primarily consist of investments in conservative, highly-rated
instruments issued by financial institutions, government and corporate entities with strong credit
standings and money market funds.
In May 2015, our Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program, which
replaced all existing share repurchase programs, authorizing us to repurchase common stock in
the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of stock
repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate, regulatory and other relevant
considerations. This program may be discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors. As of
June 30, 2016, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $178.8 million under this
stock repurchase program. In addition, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase
shares in an amount sufficient to offset shares issued under our compensation programs.
Cash and cash equivalents increased $385.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Net cash provided by operating and financing activities of $310.3 million and $344.5 million,
respectively, exceeded the net cash used for investing activities of $269.3 million. Working
capital increased by $482.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Cash Flows – Operating Activities
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $310.3 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $569.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of
$259.6 million. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $349.1 million, a decrease
of $964.9 million compared to net income of $615.8 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. Non-cash adjustments to net income consisting of depreciation and amortization, goodwill
and asset impairment, lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, net loss of equity
method investments, inclusive of distributions, gain on sale of assets, gain or loss on
extinguishment of debt, deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, fair value
changes to derivative instruments and excess tax expense from equity based compensation
totaled $661.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $91.2 million for the
same period in 2015. Changes in working capital items increased cash flows by $67.2 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a decrease of $104.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. Additionally, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, turnaround
expenditures increased to $72.4 million from $38.1 million for the same period of 2015.
Cash Flows – Investing Activities and Planned Capital Expenditures
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Net cash flows used for investing activities were $269.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $233.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $35.9
million. Cash expenditures for properties, plants and equipment for the first six months of 2016
decreased to $290.0 million from $316.9 million for the same period in 2015. These include HEP
capital expenditures of $32.7 million and $69.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. In addition, in 2016, HEP purchased a 50% interest in Cheyenne
Pipeline for $42.5 million. We received proceeds of $0.4 million and $2.2 million from the sale of
assets during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we invested $86.8 million and $246.0 million,
respectively, in marketable securities and received proceeds of $149.6 million and $327.3
million, respectively, from the sale or maturity of marketable securities.
Planned Capital Expenditures
HollyFrontier Corporation
Each year our Board of Directors approves our annual capital budget, which includes specific
projects that management is authorized to undertake. Additionally, when conditions warrant or as
new opportunities arise, additional projects may be approved. The funds appropriated for a
particular capital project may be expended over a period of several years, depending on the time
required to complete the project. Therefore, our planned capital expenditures for a given year
consist of expenditures appropriated in that year’s capital budget plus expenditures for projects
appropriated in prior years which have not yet been completed. During 2016, we expect to spend
approximately $450.0 million to $500.0 million in cash for capital projects appropriated in 2016
and prior years. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $110.0 million to $120.0 million on
refinery turnarounds. Refinery turnaround spending is amortized over the useful life of the
turnaround. This expected capital and turnaround cash spending is comprised of $75.0 million to
$85.0 million at the Woods Cross Refinery, $45.0 million to $55.0 million at the El Dorado
Refinery, $160.0 million to $175.0 million at the Tulsa Refineries, $125.0 million to $135.0 million
at the Cheyenne Refinery, $135.0 million to $145.0 million at the Navajo Refinery and $20.0
million to $25.0 million for miscellaneous other projects.
A significant portion of our current capital spending is associated with compliance-oriented
capital improvements. This spending is required due to existing consent decrees (for projects
including FCC unit flue gas scrubbers and tail gas treatment units), federal fuels regulations
(particularly Tier3, which mandates a reduction in the sulfur content of blended gasoline), refinery
waste water treatment improvements and other similar initiatives. Our refinery operations and
related emissions are highly regulated at both federal and state levels, and we invest in our
facilities as needed to remain in compliance with these standards. Additionally, when faced with
new emissions or fuels standards, we seek to execute projects that facilitate compliance and also
improve the operating costs and / or yields of associated refining processes.
El Dorado Refinery
Capital projects at the El Dorado Refinery include the completion of an FCC gasoline
hydrotreater to meet Tier 3 gasoline requirements and a new tail gas treating unit to provide
spare capacity to the existing unit. Growth projects include an upgrade project to improve
reformer operation, yield and reliability. A project to improve Coker yield and capacity is currently
being evaluated.
47
Table of Content
Tulsa Refineries
Capital spending for the Tulsa Refineries includes a project to improve FCC yields that will be
implemented during a turnaround that started in February 2016. In conjunction with our Tier 3
strategy at the Tulsa Refineries, we are installing a new naphtha fractionation unit that improves
both yield and octane enhancements to the gasoline pool.
Navajo Refinery
The Navajo Refinery capital spending in 2016 is primarily directed towards the installation of an
FCC gasoline hydrotreater unit to address Tier 3 compliance. Additionally, the Navajo Refinery
plans to increase crude capacity through targeted upgrades to several processing units that is
expected to provide greater diesel and gasoline flexibility and increased diesel production.
Cheyenne Refinery
The Cheyenne Refinery capital spending in 2016 includes the completion of wastewater
treatment plant improvements and a project to improve FCC yield and reliability to be
implemented during a turnaround that started in April 2016. An expansion to the heavy oil rack
will allow an increase of asphalt and gas oil exports, and work progresses on a study to provide a
redundant tail gas unit associated with the sulfur recovery process.
Woods Cross Refinery
We have completed construction on our existing Woods Cross expansion project, increasing
crude processing capacity to 45,000 BPSD, and providing greater crude slate flexibility, which
we believe will increase capacity utilization and improve overall economic returns during periods
when wax crudes are in short supply. The project also included construction of new refining
facilities and a new rail loading rack for intermediates and finished products associated with
refining waxy crude oil.
On November 18, 2013, the Utah Division of Air Quality issued a revised air quality permit (the
“Approval Order”) authorizing the expansion. On December 18, 2013, two local environmental
groups filed an administrative appeal challenging the issuance of the Approval Order and
seeking a stay of the Approval Order. Following an extended appeal process, the Executive
Director of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality issued a final order in favor of Woods
Cross on all claims on March 31, 2015, and dismissed the project opponents’ arguments with
prejudice. On April 27, 2015, the opponents filed a petition for review and notice of appeal with
the Utah Court of Appeals challenging the agency’s decision to uphold the permit and dismiss
the project opponents’ arguments. This appeal is now pending before the Utah Court of Appeals.
The final legal briefs were submitted in December 2015. Oral argument has been set for August
30, 2016. Our continued use of the expansion project facilities is subject to the Woods Cross
Refinery successfully defending the Approval Order on appeal at the Utah Court of Appeals.
Regulatory compliance items or other presently existing or future environmental regulations /
consent decrees could cause us to make additional capital investments beyond those described
above and incur additional operating costs to meet applicable requirements, including those
related to recently promulgated Federal Tier 3 gasoline standards.
HEP
Each year the Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. board of directors approves HEP’s annual capital
budget, which specifies capital projects that HEP management is authorized to undertake.
Additionally, at times when conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise, special projects
may be approved. The funds allocated for a particular capital project may be expended over a
period of several years, depending on the time required to complete the project. Therefore,
HEP’s planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures approved for capital
projects included in its current year capital budget as well as, in certain cases, expenditures
approved for capital projects in capital budgets for prior years. The 2016 HEP capital budget is
comprised of $13.0 million for maintenance capital expenditures and $57.0 million for expansion
capital expenditures.

Cash Flows – Financing Activities
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $344.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to cash flows used for financing activities of $671.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $1,015.7 million. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we received $246.7 million in net proceeds upon issuance of the HollyFrontier
Senior Notes, received $350.0 million in net proceeds from issuance of a term loan, received
$315.0 million and repaid $315.0 million under the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement, purchased
$133.4 million in common stock and paid $116.8 million in dividends. In addition, we
extinguished our financing obligation with Plains for $39.5 million. Also during this period, HEP
received $239.0 million and repaid $165.0 million under the HEP Credit Agreement, received
$13.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common units and paid distributions of $43.8
million to noncontrolling interests. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased
$320.1 million in common stock, paid $155.2 million to redeem our 6.875% senior notes and paid
$125.2 million in dividends. In addition, we paid $60.0 million to a large financial institution
pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement for a forward contract to purchase
additional shares of our common stock. During this period, HEP received $254.1 million and
repaid $221.1 million under the HEP Credit Agreement and paid distributions of $41.6 million to
noncontrolling interests.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
HollyFrontier Corporation
In March 2016, we issued $250 million in aggregate principal amount of the HollyFrontier Senior
Notes maturing April 2026, and extinguished $30.8 million principal balance related to a long-
term financing obligation.
In April 2016, we entered into a $350 million senior unsecured term loan maturing April 2019.
There were no other significant changes to our long-term contractual obligations during this
period.
HEP
In March 2016, HEP amended its credit agreement, increasing the size of the credit facility from
$850 million to $1.2 billion. The HEP Credit Agreement matures in November 2018. During the
six months ended June 30, 2016, HEP received net borrowings of $74.0 million resulting in
$786.0 million of outstanding borrowings in the HEP Credit Agreement at June 30, 2016.
In July 2016, HEP issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes
maturing 2024.
There were no other significant changes to HEP’s long-term contractual obligations during this
period.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are described in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies” in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain critical
accounting policies that materially affect the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial
statements include the assessment and consolidation of variable interest entities, the use of the
last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of valuing certain inventories, the amortization of deferred costs
for regular major maintenance and repairs at our refineries, assessing the possible impairment of
certain long-lived assets and goodwill, accounting for derivative instruments and assessing
contingent liabilities for probable losses.
49
Table of Content
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the LIFO method for crude oil, unfinished and
finished refined products and the average cost method for materials and supplies, or market. In
periods of rapidly declining prices, LIFO inventories may have to be written down to market value
due to the higher costs assigned to LIFO layers in prior periods. In addition, the use of the LIFO
inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years that inventory
volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with LIFO inventory costs generated in
prior periods. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each
year based on the inventory levels at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based
on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and are subject to the final
year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
At June 30, 2016, our lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve was $429.9 million.
This amount, or a portion thereof, is subject to reversal as a reduction to cost of products sold in
subsequent periods as inventories giving rise to the reserve are sold, and a new reserve is
established. Such a reduction to cost of products sold could be significant if inventory values
return to historical cost price levels. Additionally, further decreases in overall inventory values
could result in additional charges to cost of products sold should the lower of cost or market
inventory valuation reserve be increased.
Goodwill and Long-lived Assets: As of December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, our goodwill
balance was $2.3 billion, with $1.7 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion allocated to our El Dorado
Refinery, Cheyenne Refinery and HEP reporting units, respectively. Goodwill represents the
excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually or more frequently if an
event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our goodwill impairment testing first entails a
comparison of our reporting unit fair values relative to their respective carrying values. If carrying
value exceeds fair value for a reporting unit, we measure goodwill impairment as the excess of
the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill based
on estimates of the fair value of all assets and liabilities in the reporting unit.
Prior to the second quarter of 2016, there had been no impairments to goodwill.
Our long-lived assets principally consist of our refining assets that are organized as refining asset
groups. These refinery asset groups also constitute our individual refinery reporting units that are
used for testing and measuring goodwill impairments (El Dorado and Cheyenne). Our long-lived
assets are evaluated for impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and if
so, assessing whether the long-lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted
cash flows. The actual amount of impairment loss measured, if any, is equal to the amount by
which the asset group’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments
During the second quarter of 2016, we performed interim goodwill impairment testing of our El
Dorado and Cheyenne Refinery reporting units after identifying a combination of events and
circumstances which were indicators of potential goodwill impairment, including lower than
typical gross margins during the summer driving season, a current outlook of lower future gross
margins, and the recent decline in our common share price which has resulted in a decrease in
our market capitalization. In conjunction with our interim goodwill impairment testing performed,
we first assessed the carrying values of our refining long-lived asset groups for recoverability.
Our interim goodwill impairment and related long-lived asset impairment testing was performed
as of April 30, 2016. The estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and long-lived asset
groups were derived using a combination of both income and market approaches. The income
approach reflects expected future cash flows based on estimates of future crack spreads,
forecasted production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. Our market approaches
include both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Both methods
utilize pricing multiples derived from historical market transactions of other like-kind assets.
These fair value measurements involve significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). See
Note 3 “Fair Value Measurements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of Level 3 inputs.
As a result of our impairment testing, we determined that the carrying value of the long-lived
assets of the Cheyenne Refinery had been impaired and recorded long-lived asset impairment
charges of $344.8 million. Additionally, the carrying value of the Cheyenne Refinery’s goodwill
was fully impaired and a goodwill impairment charge of $309.3 million was also recorded. Our
testing did not identify any other impairment; however, the fair value of our El Dorado reporting
unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15%. A reasonable expectation exists
that further deterioration in gross margins could result in an impairment of goodwill and the long-
lived assets of the El Dorado reporting unit at some point in the future. Such impairment charges
could be material.

RISK MANAGEMENT
We use certain strategies to reduce some commodity price and operational risks. We do not
attempt to eliminate all market risk exposures when we believe that the exposure relating to such
risk would not be significant to our future earnings, financial position, capital resources or liquidity
or that the cost of eliminating the exposure would outweigh the benefit.
Commodity Price Risk Management
Our primary market risk is commodity price risk. We are exposed to market risks related to the
volatility in crude oil and refined products, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in
our refining operations. We periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of commodity
price swaps and futures contracts to mitigate price exposure with respect to:
•our inventory positions;
•natural gas purchases;
•costs of crude oil and related grade differentials;
•prices of refined products; and
•our refining margins.
As of June 30, 2016, we have the following notional contract volumes related to all outstanding
derivative contracts used to mitigate commodity price risk:

Interest Rate Risk Management
HEP uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
As of June 30, 2016, HEP had two interest rate swap contracts with identical terms that hedge its
exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of LIBOR changes on $150.0 million in credit
agreement advances. The swaps effectively convert $150.0 million of LIBOR based debt to fixed-
rate debt having an interest rate of 0.74% plus an applicable margin of 2.25% as of June 30,
2016, which equaled an effective interest rate of 2.99%. Both of these swap contracts mature in
July 2017. These swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The market risk inherent in our fixed-rate debt is the potential change arising from increases or
decreases in interest rates as discussed below.
51
Table of Content
For the fixed rate HollyFrontier Senior Notes and HEP Senior Notes, changes in interest rates
will generally affect fair value of the debt, but not earnings or cash flows. The outstanding
principal, estimated fair value and estimated change in fair value (assuming a hypothetical 10%
change in the yield-to-maturity rates) for this debt as of June 30, 2016 is presented below:
Outstanding

HEP Senior Notes
 $ 300,000  $301,500  $ 6,410
(In thousands)
For the variable rate HollyFrontier Term Loan and HEP Credit Agreement, changes in interest
rates would affect cash flows, but not the fair value. At June 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings
under the HEP Credit Agreement were $786.0 million. By means of its cash flow hedges, HEP
has effectively converted the variable rate on $150.0 million of outstanding principal to a
weighted average fixed rate of 2.99%. For the remaining unhedged HEP Credit Agreement
borrowings of $636.0 million and the HollyFrontier Term Loan, a hypothetical 10% change in
applicable interest rates would not materially affect cash flows.
Our operations are subject to hazards of petroleum processing operations, including fire,
explosion and weather-related perils. We maintain various insurance coverages, including
business interruption insurance, subject to certain deductibles. We are not fully insured against
certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable, coverage is unavailable, or premium
costs, in our judgment, do not justify such expenditures.
Financial information is reviewed on the counterparties in order to review and monitor their
financial stability and assess their ongoing ability to honor their commitments under the
derivative contracts. We have not experienced, nor do we expect to experience, any difficulty in
the counterparties honoring their commitments.
We have a risk management oversight committee consisting of members from our senior
management. This committee oversees our risk enterprise program, monitors our risk
environment and provides direction for activities to mitigate identified risks that may adversely
affect the achievement of our goals.

Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Reconciliations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) to
amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA, is
calculated as net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders plus (i) interest
expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax provision, and (iii) depreciation and amortization.
EBITDA is not a calculation provided for under GAAP; however, the amounts included in the
EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements.
EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as an
indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure
of liquidity. EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies. EBITDA is presented here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by
investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA is also used by our management for
internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants.

Reconciliations of refinery operating information (non-GAAP performance measures) to amounts
reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements.
Refinery gross margin and net operating margin are non-GAAP performance measures that are
used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other
companies in our industry. We believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in
evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis.
Refinery gross margin per barrel is the difference between average net sales price and average
cost of products per barrel of produced refined products. Net operating margin per barrel is the
difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per barrel of produced
refined products. These two margins do not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or
market inventory valuation adjustments, goodwill and asset impairment charges or depreciation
and amortization. Each of these component performance measures can be reconciled directly to
our consolidated statements of income.
Other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same
manner.
Refinery Gross and Net Operating Margins
Below are reconciliations to our consolidated statements of income for (i) net sales, cost of
products (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment) and operating
expenses, in each case averaged per produced barrel sold, and (ii) net operating margin and
refinery gross margin. Due to rounding of reported numbers, some amounts may not calculate
exactly.

We purchase finished products to facilitate delivery to certain locations or to meet delivery

We purchase crude oil that at times exceeds the supply needs of our refineries. Quantities in
excess of our needs are sold at market prices to purchasers of crude oil that are recorded on a
gross basis with the sales price recorded as revenues and the corresponding acquisition cost
as inventory and then upon sale as cost of products sold. Additionally, at times we enter into
buy/sell exchanges of crude oil with certain parties to facilitate the delivery of quantities to
certain locations that are netted at cost.
Other refining segment revenue includes the incremental revenues associated with HFC
Asphalt, product purchased and sold forward for profit as market conditions and available
storage capacity allows and miscellaneous revenue.
Other refining segment cost of products sold includes the incremental cost of products for HFC
Asphalt, the incremental cost associated with storing product purchased and sold forward as

Item 4.Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules
and forms. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1.Legal Proceedings
Commitment and Contingency Reserves
We periodically establish reserves for certain legal proceedings. The establishment of a reserve
involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment
of management. While management believes these reserves to be adequate, future changes in
the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of
loss and amounts accrued.
While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, based on advice of
counsel, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or
adverse judgment will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Environmental Matters
We are reporting the following proceedings to comply with SEC regulations which require us to
disclose proceedings arising under federal, state or local provisions regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such
proceedings may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. Our respective subsidiaries
have or will develop corrective action plans regarding these disclosures that will be implemented
in consultation with the respective federal and / or state agencies. It is not possible to predict the
ultimate outcome of these proceedings, although none are currently expected to have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Cheyenne
HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining LLC (“HFCR”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, completed certain
environmental audits at the Cheyenne Refinery regarding compliance with federal and state
environmental requirements. By letters dated October 5, 2012, November 7, 2012, and January
10, 2013, and pursuant to the EPA’s audit policy to the extent applicable, HFCR submitted
reports to the EPA voluntarily disclosing non-compliance with certain emission limitations,
reporting requirements, and provisions of a 2009 federal consent decree. By letters dated
October 31, 2012; February 6, 2013; June 21, 2013; July 9, 2013 and July 25, 2013, and
pursuant to applicable Wyoming audit statutes, HFCR submitted environmental audit reports to
the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) voluntarily disclosing non-
compliance with certain notification, reporting, and other provisions of the refinery’s state air
permit and other environmental regulatory requirements. No further action has been taken by
either agency at this time.
Tulsa
HollyFrontier Tulsa Refining LLC (“HFTR”) manufactures paraffin and hydrocarbon waxes at its
Tulsa West facility. On March 11, 2014, the EPA issued a notice to HFTR of possible violations
of certain provisions of the federal Toxic Substances Control Act in connection with the
manufacture of certain of these products. HFTR and the EPA met and are working productively
towards a settlement of this matter.
Other
We are a party to various other litigation and proceedings that we believe, based on advice of
counsel, will not either individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse impact on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Item 1A.Risk Factors
Except for the additional risk factor information described below, there have been no material
changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part 1, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. You should carefully
consider the risk factors discussed below and in our 2015 Form 10-K, which could materially
affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not
currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition or future results.

Table of Content
An impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could reduce our earnings or negatively
impact our financial condition and results of operations.
An impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could reduce our earnings or negatively
impact our results of operations and financial condition. We continually monitor our business, the
business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has
occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset or goodwill may be impaired. If a triggering event
occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow
projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value based on the ability to generate
future cash flows. We may also conduct impairment testing based on both the guideline public
company and guideline transaction methods. Our long-lived assets and goodwill impairment
analyses are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, estimates of future
crack spreads, forecasted production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. If the
assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible a material impairment charge
may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any
additional impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill in the future.
As market prices for refined products and market prices for crude oil continue to fluctuate, we will
need to continue to evaluate the carrying value of our refinery reporting units. During the quarter
ended June 30, 2016, we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of $309.3
million and $344.8 million, respectively on the carrying value of our Cheyenne Refinery.
Additionally, the fair value of our El Dorado reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by
approximately 15%. A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in gross margins
could result in an impairment of goodwill and the long-lived assets of the El Dorado reporting unit
at some point in the future. Any additional impairment charges that we may take in the future
could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.
