<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report contains my findings following the official visit to the Republic of 
Moldova conducted from 4 to 11 July 2008 together with the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p> I wish to extend my appreciation to the Government of the Republic of Moldova for its 
excellent cooperation. 
</p>
<p> The transformation of the Republic of Moldova to a political democracy and market 
economy following the break-up of the Soviet Union resulted in economic and social difficulties, 
placing a heavy burden on women. Although the economy has resumed positive growth since 
2000, structural imbalances and weak institutions pose challenges to the socio-economic stability 
of the country.  
</p>
<p> Gender equality is ensured by law; however, in practice women&#8217;s subordination is 
exacerbated by high levels of unemployment and/or low paid jobs. Parallel to this, patriarchal 
and discriminatory attitudes are increasing women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence and abuse. In this 
context, domestic violence in particular is widespread, largely condoned by society and does not 
receive appropriate recognition among officials, society and women themselves, thus resulting in 
insufficient protective infrastructure for victims of violence.  
</p>
<p> The need to escape an abusive environment, including domestic violence, prejudice and 
increased economic deprivation are factors motivating women to seek work abroad. As a result, 
notably in the context of irregular/illegal migration, many women fall victim to slave-like work 
conditions and/or to trafficking networks, and experience situations that amount to torture and 
ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p> The Republic of Moldova has come a long way in terms of institution building and human 
rights protection since independence, reflecting its commitment in this regard. The entry into 
force of the Law on preventing and combating family violence is most promising. This Law, 
along with the Law on ensuring equal opportunities for women and men, shall contribute 
towards improved prevention, protection against and prosecution of incidents of violence against 
women. However, many gaps remain between the normative framework and practice.  
</p>
<p> The report ends with a number of specific recommendations with respect to the elimination 
of violence; empowerment and equality of women; the set-up of gender sensitive database 
systems; institutional and public sector reforms; and international cooperation. I call for shared 
responsibility of States for developing bilateral and transnational solutions to the problem of 
trafficking in women and girls. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 4 to 11 July 2008, I undertook an official mission to the Republic of Moldova at the 
invitation of the Government. The visit was carried out jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Mr. Manfred Nowak, 
which allowed both mandate holders to benefit from each other&#8217;s experience in assessing the 
situation of human rights and its gendered dynamics in the country.  
</p>
<p>2. Consultations were held with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Ministers 
for Foreign Affairs and European Integration, Health, Interior, Justice, Social Protection, Family 
and Child, the Deputy Minister of Economy and Trade, representatives of the Ministry of 
Education and Youth and the Prosecutor General. In addition, we met with members of the 
Supreme Court of Justice and of Parliament, representatives of the Governmental Committee for 
Gender Equality, of the Bureau for Inter-ethnic Relations, and of local governmental institutions, 
as well as the Head of the Penitentiary Administration. 
</p>
<p>3. Meetings were also held with the following: the chairperson and representatives of the 
National Preventive Mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (&#8220;the Convention against 
Torture&#8221;); international organizations, including the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (OSCE), the Delegation of the European Commission and other members of the 
diplomatic and donor community; and civil society representatives from women&#8217;s organizations, 
ethnic minorities and religious groups. We had the opportunity to visit prisons, police precincts 
and institutions providing services to survivors of violence in different parts of the country and 
speak with persons in detention and victims of violence, trafficking and ill-treatment. We also 
conducted a one-day visit to the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, where I visited 
women in a penitentiary institution and met with civil society actors dealing with gender issues.  
</p>
<p>4. I would like to express my gratitude to the Government of Moldova for its excellent 
cooperation and receiving the mission at the highest level. I would also like to thank the UNCT 
and the Resident Coordinator for the assistance extended prior to and during the mission, and the 
IOM and the OSCE for their support throughout the visit. I am particularly grateful to the women 
who shared their experiences with me.  
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENDERED DIMENSIONS OF TRANSITION 
</b></p>
<p>5. After independence on 27 August 1991, the Republic of Moldova experienced one of the 
sharpest economic declines in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), coupled with a 
conflict in the Transnistrian region of the country.<b>1</b> These resulted in a decline of real gross 
domestic product (GDP) growth by around 10 per cent yearly, a sharp erosion of living 
standards, an increase in poverty and a dramatic deterioration of education and social services.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Transnistrian region is self-proclaimed as independent of the Republic of Moldova. See 
</p>
<p>O. Protsyk, &#8220;Moldova&#8217;s Dilemma in Democratizing and Reintegrating Transnistria&#8221;. <i>Problems of 
Post-Communism</i>, vol. 53, No. 4, July-August 2006, pp. 29-41. </p>

</p>
<p>6. Today, although still volatile, structural reforms have enabled the Republic of Moldova 
to reach a degree of macroeconomic stability and a cumulative rise in real GDP of around 
50 per cent since 2000.<b>2</b> However, the human development index (HDI) has fallen drastically 
over the years, going from eighty-first place in 1992, to 111 out of 177 countries in terms of 
economic and social development, and 135 in terms of GDP per capita, which are significantly 
below the averages for Eastern Europe and the CIS.<b>3</b> Important structural imbalances, weak 
institutions, expansion of the informal economy and proliferation of corruption<b>4</b> continue to 
challenge the country&#8217;s political, social and economic stability.  
</p>
<p>7. Once a middle-income country, the Republic of Moldova has become the poorest country 
in Europe,<b>5</b> with adverse implications for women&#8217;s status and gender relations. In this respect, as 
the socio-economic status of women declines, their vulnerability to exploitation, violence and 
ill-treatment increases. Particularly alarming is the trafficking of women and girls for 
exploitation in domestic labour and the commercial sex industry. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Status of women 
</b></p>
<p>8. During the Soviet period, although within a paternalistic framework,<b>6</b> women&#8217;s education 
and their participation in public life and the workforce was supported as part of official State 
policy.<b>7</b> As a result, women faired relatively well in terms of basic development indicators.  
</p>
<p>9. In the process of post-Soviet transformations, while many of the policies supportive of 
women&#8217;s public sphere participation were abandoned,<b>8</b> the reassertion of traditional patriarchal

</p>
<p>although women remained largely underrepresented in decision-making positions. See

unemployment figures for 2007 were provided by the Ministry of Economy and Trade, 
in correspondence dated 3 April 2009, and 2003-2006 figures are available at 
http://www.indexmundi.com/moldova/unemployment_rate.html. It is noteworthy that an 
estimated 25 per cent of working age Moldovans are employed abroad. </p>

</p>
<p>values and gender stereotypes further restricted women&#8217;s opportunities in public life. Moreover, 
the liberalization of the economy led to high levels of unemployment, with significant 
implications for women. Unemployment rates have dropped from about 8 per cent during 
2003-2006 to 5.1 per cent in 2007, and now appear to be lower among women than men, both in 
urban and in rural areas.<b>9</b> After a steady decline in female employment as a percentage of total 
number of employed persons between 1990 and 2000, it appeared to hold at about 49 per cent in 
2006 and 2007. However, these figures may not reflect the full picture. The share of inactive 
population (i.e. persons not considered economically active) in the country has remained high at 
between 40-50 per cent (plus) throughout 2003-2007, rates which increased in 2006 and 2007, 
especially for women.<b>10</b> It is also the employment rate of adult women (ages 25-54) that has 
decreased the most, by almost 10 per cent between 2003-2007.<b>11</b> Moreover, while unemployment 
figures for women in rural areas appear to have almost halved in 2007, this may be due to their 
increased inactivity in these areas, with more women becoming housewives, being confined to 
the informal sector, or reaching the retirement age.<b>12</b> These factors, together with the overall 
impoverishment of the country, hitting the countryside particularly hard, have severely 
marginalized women, constrained their options and increased their dependency on men. 
</p>
<p>10. Poverty is said to have a distinct female face. The Government of Moldova noted in its 
second and third periodical report presented to the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women in 2004,<b>13</b> that while only 10.7 per cent of women were 
financially secure, 54.6 per cent had modest incomes, 25.6 per cent were at the absolute poverty 
line and 8.4 per cent were below the absolute poverty line. The report further pointed to the 
discrepancy between women&#8217;s high level of education and their economic marginalization, 
which is reflected in the unemployment and inactivity figures aforementioned and the wage gap 
between women and men in both the public and private sectors. With respect to wage 
remuneration, in 2006 women earned only 68 per cent of the average salary of men, a figure 
which increased slightly in 2007 to 72.64 per cent. This discrepancy affected all economic 
fields.<b>14</b> A major area of concern is the worsening social and economic status of women in rural 
areas, who are directly affected by the crisis in the agricultural sector.

</p>
<p>11. On the other hand, since the 2005 parliamentary elections, encouraging progress has been 
achieved in women&#8217;s representation in decision-making positions. Women gained 21.8 per cent 
of the seats in the Parliament, representing an impressive increase from the 3.8 per cent in 1990. 
The Prime Minister, for the first time ever in Moldovan history, is a female and five women hold 
cabinet ministerial positions. Women&#8217;s representation in local government, however, has shown 
a downward trend,<b>15</b> with only 3.1 per cent of district (<i>rayon</i>) presidents, and 17.5 per cent of 
mayors of municipalities, towns and villages being women, as of April 2008.<b>16</b> Given the 
fluctuation of these figures between 1980 and 2008, it is not possible to ascertain whether 
women&#8217;s political participation has entered a positive upward trend. The situation therefore 
warrants close monitoring and a firm State commitment to ensure a sustained equal 
representation of women in leadership positions at all levels of political and public life.  
</p>
<p>12. On the whole, however, poverty and lack of opportunities characterize the reality for the 
vast majority of women in Moldova, for whom migration abroad is the only viable option to 
secure a livelihood. Ironically, the feminization of migration may hold more risks than 
opportunities for these women. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Feminization of migration  
</b></p>
<p>13. The Republic of Moldova is one of the largest net emigration countries in the world, with a 
steadily increasing number of its population migrating to find work either as seasonal/temporary 
or permanent migrants, sending home remittances that provide one of the most important sources 
of survival for many households and represent a significant component of the national 
economy.<b>17</b>  
</p>
<p>14. Although the numbers of migrants vary by source, according to the National Bureau of 
Statistics, migrant outflows had grown from less than 100,000 in 1999 to more than 400,000 
in 2005, representing approximately one quarter of the economically active population of the 
country. Other sources estimate that the figure is likely to be close to 1 million when illegal 
migrants are also considered.  
</p>
<p>15. IOM, based on figures from 2006, distinguished four distinct groups of Moldovan 
migrants: (a) construction workers in the CIS (33 per cent), mainly Russia, and predominantly 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  In 1980 women in local government was 49.8 per cent, the figure systematically declined over 
</p>
<p>the years. See Ala Mindicanu, loc. cit., p. 8. Some improvement was noted for a period however, 
as a result of the &#8220;Women can do it&#8221; project (2001-2004). 
<b>16

<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  In 2006, remittances constituted 36.2 per cent of GDP, among one of the highest ratios in the 
world. The volume of remittances to the Republic of Moldova increased gradually since the late 
1990s, from US$ 87 million in 1996 to US$ 1,182 million in 2006. World Bank, Development 
Prospects Group, 2008. <i>Migration and Remittances Factbook</i>; World Development Indicators 
database. </p>

</p>
<p>rural men with low levels of education; (b) those employed in sectors other than construction 
(25 per cent) in the CIS, almost half being rural women with higher levels of education; 
(c) migrants to the European Union and Israel (33 per cent), over half being female mainly from 
rural areas; and (d) others, such as migrants to Turkey and Romania (12 per cent), two thirds 
being women, predominantly from rural areas with low levels of education.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>16. As these figures indicate, seasonal or temporary migration is a way of life especially for 
rural Moldovans in their strategy to cope with the pressures of the economic crisis of the late 
1990s, which resulted in declining standards of living and unemployment. The overall rural 
migrant stock is composed of 64 per cent men and 61 per cent of women.<b>19</b> While men appear to 
make up the majority of overall migrants, women&#8217;s migration has become a salient feature of the 
phenomenon. With formal channels lacking, many women rely on informal networks, some of 
which may be linked to illegal operators that lure young women and girls into risky forms of 
employment, as discussed below. 
</p>
<p>17. Different estimates situate female migration from Moldova between 40 and 60 per cent of 
the overall migrant population. Many of my interlocutors, especially in rural areas, referred to an 
increasing number of women going to work abroad, often illegally, without legal protection or 
insurance, and leaving their children and husbands behind, with the prospect of earning an 
income to improve the family&#8217;s living conditions.<b>20</b> However, particularly within irregular/illegal 
forms of migration, many Moldovan women fall victim to trafficking networks and experience 
situations that amount to torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>18. Although remittances have contributed to improved standards of living of migrant 
households, the negative impact of mass migration on the lives of individual migrant women and 
those left behind, and on household stability has been dramatic. While women left behind 
become overburdened with increased responsibilities for household subsistence, child care and 
care of the elderly, the migration of women more often than not results in the disarray of the 
family, as the husband left behind tends to neglect or abuse the children or abandon them 
altogether to start a family elsewhere. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN  
</b></p>
<p>19. Moldovan women suffer from all forms of violence. However, domestic violence and 
trafficking are major areas of concern. The two are intimately connected and are linked to 
women&#8217;s overall subordinate position in society. Particularly in the context of irregular/illegal 
migration, women who fall victim to slave-like work conditions and/or to trafficking networks 
are extremely vulnerable to torture and extreme forms of degrading treatment in countries of 
destination and stigmatization upon return to the Republic of Moldova.

the Republic of Moldova, IOM, 2006. </p>

</p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic violence  
</b></p>
<p>20. While reliable data and a systematic registering of cases on the nature and extent of the 
phenomenon is lacking, domestic violence is said to be widespread. According to a Ministry of 
Labour, Social Protection and Family report: &#8220;[&#8230;] At present, the frequency of domestic 
violence, whose victims are women and children, is acquiring alarming proportions. 
Unfortunately, it is very difficult for the State to control domestic violence since in most of the 
cases it is reported only when there are severe consequences of the violence, the other cases 
being considered just family conflicts.&#8221;<b>21</b> 
21. Despite this acknowledgement, unless it results in serious injury, domestic violence is not 
perceived as a problem warranting legal intervention. As a result, it is experienced in silence and 
receives little recognition among officials, society and women themselves.  
</p>
<p>22. According to a survey conducted in 2005, 41 per cent of women interviewed reported 
encountering some form of violence within the family at least once during their lifetime.<b>22</b> The 
survey revealed that psychological violence, followed by physical violence, is the most widely 
reported form of abuse in the family. Almost a third of the women interviewed indicated having 
been subjected to multiple forms of violence. The study notes that domestic violence runs across 
lines of class and education; however, women with a higher level of education or economic 
status may tend not to disclose incidents of violence. Sexual violence remains the least reported 
form of violence. This may be due to lack of recognition of sexual abuse within the family as a 
wrongdoing or the fear among victims that they will be held responsible and become outcasts. 
</p>
<p>23. The perpetrators of violence against women are often family members, overwhelmingly 
husbands or former husbands (73.4 per cent), followed by fathers or stepfathers (13.7 per cent) 
and mothers or stepmothers (7 per cent).<b>23</b> Staff at the shelter in Chisinau indicated that husbands 
of many of the women who seek help at the shelter are either police officers or from the military, 
which makes it far more difficult for these women to escape the violent environment and seek 
divorce. For example, Natalie [assumed name], whom I met at the shelter, a university graduate 
working as a secretary, escaped from her abusive husband who is a retired policeman. She filed a 
divorce case in court and rented an apartment but, due to her husband&#8217;s aggression, had to 
remain in the shelter with her two children. Although she has complained about his violence 
repeatedly, she believes that due to his police connections, he is able to manipulate the system. 
</p>
<p>24. Research shows that although higher levels of violence are found among women aged 
between 25 and 35 years, violence in the family starts at a very early age, with 27 per cent of 
</p>

conducted the same year revealed this figure to be higher, at 68.7 per cent.

<p>women encountering violence from the age of 15 or earlier.<b>24</b> Violence against children is widely 
tolerated, including by civil servants and health professionals. A 2007 study reported of the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) that while 21 per cent of parents believe that children 
are &#8220;frequently exposed to serious violence by their parents&#8221;, 40 per cent admit that beating a 
child is a justifiable and an effective corrective measure. The survey also shows that 20 per cent 
of parents feel that family doctors, social workers and police officers avoid helping abused 
children.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Migration takes a particular toll on children left behind or those in fractured families, 
making them more vulnerable to violence and exploitation. Studies show that the number of 
children who do not live with both parents has nearly doubled in recent years from 16 per cent 
in 2000 to 31 per cent in 2005.<b>26</b> The situation is particularly worrisome for the children whose 
mothers have migrated. 
</p>
<p>26. Some parents departing to work abroad entrust their children to orphanages, boarding 
schools or other institutions, where conditions are generally poor. In its 2006 report, the Centre 
for Human Rights of Moldova<b>27</b> stated that 85 per cent of the 10,350 institutionalized children in 
the country were not orphans but had one or both parents alive who had placed them in 
institutions because of poverty or migration. The report further attributed the decrease in 
secondary school attendance, particularly in rural areas, to the absence of parents.<b>28</b> Girls who 
suffer from abandonment and neglect or have been taken out of school are particularly at risk of 
falling victim to violence, abuse and trafficking. 
</p>
<p>27. Heightened risk of suicide among abused women is also said to be an issue of concern. In 
some cases, women have resorted to killing their abusers as the only way out of the oppressive 
life they are enduring. Several of the detainees I met in the Rusca penitentiary for women and 
penitentiary institution No. 3 in Tiraspol were convicted of murdering or inflicting severe bodily 
injuries on their husbands. These women, who were serving harsh sentences,<b>29</b> resorted to such

<p>violent acts after living under abusive conditions for years. In Rusca, I received allegations that 
women had been subjected to corporal punishment by prison guards and were made to perform 
forced labour. On these, the Government has responded that complaints of corporal punishment 
by inmates are examined individually by specialists in the field, and that the 68 inmates in Rusca 
that were working in 2008, had voluntarily enrolled in paid work programmes for which they 
received an income of 41.81 lei/day.<b>30</b> Given the seriousness of these allegations however, a 
thorough investigation on the part of the authorities is encouraged. 
</p>
<p>28. Economic marginalization and unemployment exacerbate women&#8217;s dependency and 
constrain their options to leave an abusive relationship. During my visit, I met women who, even 
after a divorce, had returned to their abusers because of sheer economic dependence, especially 
in cases where the couple had children. With the dramatic increase in housing prices due to 
privatization, finding alternative housing appears to be a serious problem, to the extent that in 
divorce cases, courts are increasingly ordering the family dwelling to be physically partitioned. 
On the other hand, the personal testimonies I received from women living under abuse revealed 
that the lack of confidence in law enforcement agencies and the high cost of legal assistance are 
major constraints for women in seeking help. 
</p><p>29. There are also a number of widely held misconceptions about violence against women 
which treat the problem as isolated cases concerning a particular group. These misconceptions 
are: (a) violence against women is a phenomenon that takes place in poor and broken homes; 
(b) victims of violence are inherently vulnerable women needing special protection; (c) violent 
men are deviants who use alcohol and drugs or have personality disorders; (d) domestic violence 
involves all members of the household, including men. It has been my experience that such 
misunderstandings often result in misguided and partial solutions, such as rehabilitation 
programmes for abusers, restrictions over women in order to protect them or gender neutral 
solutions that overlook the causes of gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Trafficking in women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Republic of Moldova is said to be a major source for trafficked persons, particularly 
women and girls, 14 per cent of whom are under the age of 18 and more than half are between 19 
and 24 years old.<b>31</b> Trafficked children are subjected to sexual exploitation (77 per cent), forced 
into begging (5 per cent), perform auxiliary work at construction sites (5 per cent) or work in 
homes (7 per cent).<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>31. According to IOM and La Strada data, at least 70 per cent of trafficking victims come from 
families described as &#8220;poor&#8221; or &#8220;very poor&#8221;, 65 per cent declare unemployment as their main

</p>
<p>reason for going abroad, and between 70 and 95 per cent had experienced violence at home prior 
to being trafficked.<b>33</b> Several of my interlocutors, including victims, described the need to escape 
an abusive family and community environment as a factor being intimately linked to trafficking. 
Women escaping domestic violence and girls leaving or running away from institutional care are 
most vulnerable to being trafficked. According to IOM, 80 per cent of the women and girls 
trafficked from Moldova were victims of domestic violence before being trafficked and after 
their return. 
</p>
<p>32. From 2000 to 2008 the IOM assisted 2,443 victims of trafficking, overwhelmingly for 
sexual exploitation (85.8 per cent), followed by labour exploitation (6.5 per cent) and begging 
(3.1 per cent).<b>34</b> Moldovan women and girls have been trafficked to more than 30 destination 
countries in Western Europe, South Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the United States of 
America and the former Soviet Union, primarily Russia. Although exploitation patterns 
reportedly differ from region to region, sexual exploitation is most common and particularly 
pronounced in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Balkan countries.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Most victims of trafficking are recruited by individuals, often female kin or friends who in 
many cases have themselves been victims of trafficking. In fact, many of the convicted women I 
spoke to in Rusca penitentiary were serving sentences based on trafficking charges. It is reported 
that recruiters are mainly Moldovan citizens, with connections in other countries, who deceive 
the girls and women with promises of well-paid jobs abroad.<b>36</b> 
34. The experience of Irene [assumed name], who was offered a job in Russia by a female 
acquaintance, is illustrative. The woman provided her with a ticket to Istanbul where she was 
told she had to change planes. In Istanbul she was met by two Turkish men who took her to a 
house where other women and girls were being involuntarily kept and marketed in the sex sector. 
Irene was forced into prostitution for a month and a half, until a client helped her to escape. She 
contacted the police and on the basis of her testimony several of the traffickers were arrested. 
Irene was placed in a shelter for trafficked victims before being returned to the Republic of 
Moldova. She was not met by anyone at the airport in Chisinau and had to beg for money to 
return to her village. Despite the complaint she filed to the police, no action was taken against 
the woman who had lured her.

<p>35. Internal trafficking in the Republic of Moldova, particularly in the Transnistrian region, is 
also a problem. Alina [assumed name], at the age of 15, was sold by her brother to the owner of a 
bar in Tiraspol. For a year, she was sexually exploited by many men, both within the premises of 
the bar and in private homes where she was driven in the trunk of a car. Alina was often beaten 
and subjected to various forms of ill-treatment by her abusers. She and 11 other girls, including 
7 minors, were rescued as a result of a police operation. Four people were arrested in the police 
raid. When I met her, Alina was about to leave the shelter where she had stayed for the last 
three months and was eager to go back to her parents in Tiraspol and return to school. She was 
not, however, willing to tell her parents that it was her brother who sold her. Therefore, Alina 
runs the risk of being resold by her brother. 
</p>
<p>36. A study conducted by La Strada revealed that 11 per cent of the victims of trafficking have 
been recruited repeatedly.<b>37</b> In 90 per cent of cases of repeated recruitment, women come back to 
Moldova independently after having been deported from the country of destination, without 
receiving any assistance in terms of rehabilitation or reintegration. In addition, for the mere fact 
of having been abroad, many of them face stigmatization and are regarded as &#8220;prostitutes&#8221; by 
their own family, the community and potential employers, thus hindering their chances of 
successful reintegration. Many women, who are traumatized, opt to run away from home and 
become vulnerable to further exploitation and abuse, and easy targets for traffickers. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur on torture, in his report (A/HRC/7/3), concluded that certain cases 
of trafficking can amount to torture and/or ill-treatment, if the State fails to fulfil its due 
diligence and rehabilitation obligations in terms of the prevention of trafficking and the 
protection of individual victims. He further stressed that the social exclusion resulting from past 
trafficking experiences can lead to revictimization and may also amount to inhuman and 
degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>38. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in reviewing the 
periodic report of the Republic of Moldova (CEDAW/C/MDA/2-3) in 2006 expressed concern 
over whether victims of trafficking for the purposes of prostitution risked prosecution for 
violating immigration, labour and prostitution laws. The State party assured me that this was not 
the case,<b>38</b> and moreover, that new provisions were in place to protect victim confidentiality and 
provide free legal, health and social rehabilitation services.<b> </b>However,<b> </b>there are reports that 
breach of confidentiality of data concerning victims of trafficking and the services offered to 
them is a problem.<b>39</b> It was noted that the Anti-Trafficking Law, despite having a provision on 
protection of confidentiality of victims, does not foresee any sanctions for breach of 
confidentiality.<b>40</b> Government authorities have explained that this is because sanctions for this

</p>
<p><b>III.  RESPONSES TO THE PROBLEM 
</b></p>
<p>40. This section focuses on the responses by government and non-governmental actors to 
violence against women and girls, highlighting existing gaps in laws and practices as well as 
recent initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Republic of Moldova is party to the major United Nations human rights instruments, 
including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
its Optional Protocol,<b>42</b> all of which form an integral part of the legal system of the Republic.<b>43</b> 
Relevant regional human rights instruments ratified by the Republic of Moldova, a member State 
of the Council of Europe, include the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Social Charter, and the Council of Europe Convention 
on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. 
</p>
<p>42. Important steps have been taken to integrate these international and regional standards into 
the national legal framework through the adoption of numerous laws, action plans and 
programmes which are relevant for the advancement of women and the promotion of their rights 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>41
</b>  Government correspondence received 30 March 2009. In this correspondence, specific 
</p>
<p>reference is made to: article 7 of Law No. 06-XIII of 17 May 1994 on State Secrets; and 
articles 334, 315, and 344 of the Criminal Code. 
<b>42
</b></p>
<p>  The Republic of Moldova has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p>  Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Constitution provides that human rights and freedoms 
guaranteed in the Constitution shall be understood and implemented according to the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights as well as conventions and treaties ratified by Moldova. Article 4, 
paragraph 2, further provides that, wherever discrepancies appear between conventions and 
treaties on human rights and Moldovan national laws, priority shall be given to international 
regulations. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.4

</p>
<p>in various fields.<b>44</b> However, due to the lack of a centralized database on sex-disaggregated 
data and indicators on violence against women and on gender-based discrimination in 
general, the monitoring and evaluation of the impact of measures put in place for the 
achievement of women&#8217;s de facto equality and the elimination of violence against women 
remains difficult.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Republic of Moldova has undertaken commendable legislative reforms to achieve 
gender equality. This principle is recognized in article 16, paragraph 2, of the Constitution and 
under many laws, such as the Civil and Criminal Codes, the Criminal and Civil Procedure 
Codes, the Family Code and the Labour Code. The entry into force in February 2006 of the Law 
on ensuring equal opportunities for women and men established the country&#8217;s first legal 
framework for prohibiting gender-based discrimination. 
</p>
<p>44. In accordance with international treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is a party, in 
particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
this Law introduces the concepts of gender mainstreaming, direct and indirect sex-based 
discrimination, affirmative action, gender equality and sexual harassment. To ensure equal 
opportunities, the Law creates a new governmental Commission on Equality, defines the 
competences of both central and local specialized public entities and requires the Ombudsperson 
to ensure the observance of gender equality as an integral part of constitutional human rights and 
liberties. 
</p>
<p>45. However, many consider the Law as declarative in nature, as it lacks enforcement 
mechanisms and does not provide for procedures for submitting and examining gender-based 
discrimination complaints nor for legal remedies in cases of violations. In addition, adequate 
financial and human resources for its implementation have not been allocated. 
</p>
<p>46. The Law is partly the result of the National Plan for Promoting Gender Equality 
for 2003-2005, which called for the development of a legal framework on gender equality, the 
elimination of gender-based discrimination in the labour market, the increase of public 
awareness and education on gender-related problems, and the elimination of violence against 
women. A new Plan for Promoting Gender Equality was adopted for 2006-2009, with specific 
provisions in the field of violence against women, including the development of institutional 
structures and services for victims of violence. Significant provisions on gender equality and

</p>
<p><b>44
</b>  Representatives of women&#8217;s organizations with whom I met indicated that these international 
</p>
<p>standards are not observed in the Transnistrian region of the country; therefore, there is a major 
gap in monitoring gender issues. 
<b>45
</b></p>
<p>  The Ministry of Social Protection, the Family and the Child informed me of future initiatives, 
including the setting up of two national information systems to monitor respectively domestic 
violence and child abuse cases. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.4

</p>
<p>women&#8217;s empowerment, particularly in decision-making positions and in employment, have also 
been included in the National Human Rights Action Plan for 2004-2008<b>46</b> and the National 
Development Strategy for 2008-2011.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>47. In April 2008, the Government, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Fund 
for Women (UNIFEM), started an initiative that led to the development of a National Strategy on 
Gender Equality, the first ever umbrella strategy on gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment. 
Among its main areas of focus are violence and trafficking, employment and migration, political 
participation of women, awareness-raising and gender budgeting and financing. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>48. The entry into force, on 18 September 2008, of the Law on preventing and combating 
violence in the family<b>48</b> marks a very important step in the country&#8217;s efforts to establish the 
framework and mechanisms for preventing and combating domestic violence as well as 
identifying the public authorities and specific institutions responsible for its elimination. 
</p>
<p>49. The Law defines what constitutes domestic violence, applicable both to cases of 
cohabitation and separate habitation, distinguishing, inter alia, among physical violence, sexual 
violence - including marital rape - or psychological violence. Clearly specified in the Law are 
not only the competencies of the central and local administration authorities, but also those of the 
centres and services of rehabilitation for victims. In addition, it contains a number of important 
provisions, such as on the security of the victim as a human rights principle, the possibility for 
third party complaints and granting of protective orders within 24 hours of receipt of the 
complaint, obliging the perpetrator to stay away from the victim, her children or other 
dependants. 
</p>
<p>50. Although it is too early to assess the impact of the Law, most of my interlocutors praised 
its timeliness and importance in helping to bridge many of the current gaps in the field of 
domestic violence. A recurrent issue which was raised related to the proper implementation of 
the Law, notably given the lack of a plan of action and of clear provisions concerning budget 
allocation, and bearing in mind the insufficient infrastructure to support victims of violence in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>46
</b>  Chapter 11, &#8220;Ensuring of Women&#8217;s Rights&#8221; provides for, inter alia: review of national 
</p>
<p>legislation; creation of mechanisms ensuring equal representation at all levels of State bodies; 
developing training materials to promote gender equality, including in schoolbooks; drafting a 
Code of Principles on Combating Domestic Violence obliging public officials to respond to 
domestic violence; and strengthening the police system in combating domestic violence. 
<b>47
</b></p>
<p>  Goal 3 &#8220;Promote Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women&#8221; includes increasing 
representation of women in decision-making positions and reducing gender inequality in 
remuneration.

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.4 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>51. Other recent noteworthy developments in responding to violence against women are the 
inclusion of provisions in the Criminal Code on: new aggravating circumstances for severe 
physical or health damage committed against a spouse; deprivation of liberty for average 
physical or health harm to a spouse; the offence of &#8220;deliberate small physical or health damage&#8221;, 
which was previously classified as an administrative infringement.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>52. One of the most significant advances in the field of trafficking was the adoption in 2005 of 
the Law on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings (hereafter referred to as the 
Anti-Trafficking Law). The Law constitutes the culmination of the National Plan to Prevent and 
Combat Trafficking in Human Beings (2002-2006), which called for the creation of a legislative 
framework, including the passage of new laws, the modification of existing codes and the 
ratification of relevant international conventions. The Plan established the National Committee 
for Combating Human Trafficking for its monitoring. In March 2008, a new Plan for 2008-2009 
was approved by the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>53. The Anti-Trafficking Law brings national legislation into closer compliance with the 
international standards set forth in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings. The 2003 Criminal Code has also been brought into line 
with the Anti-Trafficking Law by establishing criminal responsibility for trafficking in human 
beings, trafficking in children, illegal border crossing of children, and pimping.<b>50</b> The Code also 
improves the protection of the participants in criminal proceedings and increases penalties 
prescribed for human traffickers up to life imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>54. In the field of international cooperation, the Republic of Moldova has signed collaboration 
agreements with Slovakia and Italy on combating criminality, including trafficking in human 
beings, and talks for such agreements have been initiated with the United Arab Emirates and 
Israel. In addition, the Ministry of Interior has developed cooperation with entities such as 
InterPol, EuroPol, Frontex, the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and 
Ukraine (EUBAM) and the Southeast European Regional Center for Combating Trans-border 
Crime (SECI Center). 
</p>
<p>55. Despite these measures, implementation is said to lag far behind the legal framework. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Migration 
</b></p>
<p>56. The prospects of accession to the European Union have created the need for the Republic 
of Moldova to review its migration policy and reorganize public institutions responsible for its 
implementation. In this context, the intimate link between irregular/illegal forms of migration 
and human trafficking, in particular of women and girls, has also gained greater recognition.

</p>
<p>57. Measures put in place in the past few years include the adoption of resolutions and new 
laws in line with international standards, the introduction in the Criminal Code of a provision 
criminalizing the organization of illegal migration,<b>51</b> the development of a policy framework for 
promoting and protecting the rights of Moldovan migrant workers abroad,<b>52</b> and the 
strengthening of the role and capacity of the governmental bodies in charge of migration issues. 
Currently, the Ministries of Interior and of Economy and Trade deal with the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>58. An important recent initiative in the field of migration is the Mobility Partnership signed 
between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on 5 June 2008. The purpose of this 
Partnership, which expressly refers to the respect of human rights and the need to take into 
account the labour market and the economic situation of the country, is to facilitate legal 
migration, in particular for development purposes; establish cooperation on migration and 
development; prevent and combat illegal immigration and trafficking/smuggling of human 
beings; and promote an effective readmission and return policy. 
</p>
<p>59. On 10 July 2008, the Parliament adopted the Law on labour migration regulating both 
labour activities by immigrant workers in the Republic of Moldova and the terms for temporary 
employment of Moldovan citizens abroad. According to this Law, employment of Moldovan 
citizens abroad shall be carried out on the basis of individual employment contracts concluded 
with the employer before departure, through licensed employment agencies that are registered 
with the National Employment Agency or in accordance with bilateral agreements. Particularly 
encouraging are the provisions regulating the issuance of licences to employment agencies, 
providing for their withdrawal when there is proven involvement in trafficking, and requiring 
migrants to register their underage children who will remain in the country with the competent 
body. The mechanisms for supervision and control established in the Law, including the regular 
monitoring of the activities of private employment agencies and the cooperation with diplomatic 
missions, are also encouraging. 
</p>
<p>60. These commendable initiatives, together with the assurances I was given that the 
Government would soon ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, shall set solid legal ground for 
strengthened prevention of illegal migration and trafficking and the protection of victims.

<p>  The Republic of Moldova has signed labour and social security agreements with 11 countries,

<p><b>B.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>61. Gender-related policies and programmes are supervised by the governmental Committee 
on Gender Equality, an advisory and coordinating body created in 2006 in accordance with the 
Law on ensuring equal opportunities for women and men. It is chaired by the Deputy 
Prime Minister in charge of social affairs and comprises key ministries, employers associations, 
trade unions, the Academy of Public Administration, the Academy of Economic Studies, and 
non-profit organizations. Major duties of the Committee include gender mainstreaming and 
promotion of equal opportunities for men and women, coordinating the activity of central and 
local public administration authorities, and developing cooperation between State entities and 
civil society on gender equality issues.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>62. Women&#8217;s national machinery, which is said to be understaffed and underresourced, is 
within the Ministry of Social Protection, the Family and the Child, which is vested with the duty 
to develop and promote policies in the field of combating domestic violence, promoting gender 
equality and providing social assistance. 
</p>
<p>63. Lack of capacity within various ministries to address issues related to violence against 
women constitutes a major challenge for the implementation of legislation and action plans in 
the field. This is particularly relevant with regard to the implementation of the new Law to 
prevent and combat violence in the family. The Ministries of Social Protection, the Family and 
Child; Education and Youth; Health care; Interior; Justice; and Local Public Administration are 
the central authorities responsible for the administration of the Law. The procedure for its 
implementation and details on budget allocation, however, are not specified.  
</p>
<p>64. Regarding trafficking, several institutional initiatives have taken place since 2001, 
including the creation of a special anti-trafficking unit within the Office of the General 
Prosecutor and the establishment of an ad hoc National Committee to Combat Trafficking in 
Human Beings. Local multidisciplinary anti-trafficking committees have also been established in 
all districts of the country. In 2003, the National Committee established four sub-working groups 
on prevention, protection and direct assistance, legislation, and child trafficking, each co-chaired 
by a deputy minister and an international organization, namely IOM, OSCE and UNICEF.  
</p>
<p>65. The main State institution dealing with combating trafficking in human beings is the 
Centre for Combating Trafficking in Persons (CCTP). Established in 2005 within the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs as a task-force body, it has criminal investigative competences integrating 
specialists from the Border Guards Service, Customs Service, Information Security Service, 
Centre for Combating Economic Crimes and Corruption, and the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.  
</p>
<p>66. In spite of these measures, allegations of corruption among public officials are repeatedly 
raised as a major constraint to combating trafficking in human beings. Particularly striking is the 
fact that the Government has not prosecuted or criminally punished any of the government 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>53
</b>  Article 18 of the Law on ensuring equal opportunities for women and men. </p>

</p>
<p>investigators, prosecutors and senior officials - including the deputy director of the CCTP - that 
in August 2006 were dismissed from their posts on allegations of corruption in connection with a 
criminal trafficking ring operating in the country.<b>54</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Reporting and prosecution of violence 
</b></p>
<p>67. Incidence of violence against women and girls, particularly within the family, remains 
largely underreported due to: shame; fear of social stigma; lack of knowledge about existing 
laws, judicial procedures and services; or simply because of lack of confidence in the system. 
Women who attempt to access the legal system report that they often face significant obstacles 
and re-victimization. Unless violence results in serious physical injuries, police, prosecutors and 
judges are said to often trivialize the matter and discourage women from pursuing the case and 
an investigation. The lack of specialized female units within the police dealing with cases of 
violence also deters women from reporting cases. In many instances, domestic violence cases are 
treated as administrative offences rather than being criminally prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>68. Law enforcement agents I spoke with attributed the low number of prosecutions of 
domestic violence cases to the withdrawal of claims by the victims themselves, without 
questioning why this is so. Although the Criminal Code provides for the prosecution of cases 
involving serious injuries without the consent of the victim, in practice, law enforcement agents 
rarely pursue the prosecution of a domestic violence case without the victim&#8217;s cooperation. 
Importantly, the new Law to prevent and combat violence in the family addresses these issues by 
calling on the administrative bodies of the Ministry of Interior to: identify, record and report 
cases of family violence; ensure basic records of aggressors; visit families with records of family 
violence and undertake preventative activities to avoid repeated acts of violence; ensure the 
administrative arrest of the aggressor; in emergency cases, obtain a protective order from the 
court; inform victims of their rights, including the right to free legal counsel; and provide 
assistance with placement in rehabilitation centres.  
</p>
<p>69. The requirement of forensic evidence of injury has also been indicated as a deterrent to 
bringing cases to court. Consequently, the role of forensic doctors, who will grade the injuries as 
light, medium or severe based on criteria set forth in the Criminal Code, is of extreme 
importance in determining the charges that may be brought against the perpetrator. The cost of a 
forensic certificate, although small, coupled with the reluctance of many women to seek medical 
attention in domestic violence cases and lack of training of health professionals on how to 
address such cases may also act as deterrents to pursuing criminal prosecution. The role of 
medical institutions is recognized in the new Law, which calls on them to: report cases of family 
violence to the authorities; ensure medical counselling and assistance to victims; and contract 
medical services to be provided by centres/services for victim and aggressor rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

<p>on charges of corruption.  </p>

</p>
<p>70. Regarding trafficking cases, a significant increase in the number of prosecutions and 
convictions has been reported in the past years. The discrepancy in the response shown in 
trafficking cases versus domestic violence cases reflects the emphasis recently placed on the 
former as a priority issue. Given the intimate connection between the two, a coordinated and 
comprehensive system for the protection and assistance to victims of both domestic violence and 
trafficking is needed. 
</p>
<p>71. According to the Ministry of Interior, in 2007, 528 criminal cases of human trafficking 
were registered,<b>55</b> of which 350 were brought to court and resulted in 287 convictions. The 
remaining 178 were mainly pimping cases with no factual connection to human trafficking.<b>56</b> 
The CCTP and regional units of the Ministry of Interior identified 40 international networks 
involved in trafficking in human beings and the organization of illegal migration. Furthermore, 
the CCTP brought to court five cases of corruption and abuse of influence (including four cases 
involving CCTP staff) and four cases of involvement or complicity of civil servants in migration 
cases. Figures for the first semester of 2008 indicate that 352 cases of human trafficking were 
registered,<b>57</b> of which 173 were brought to court and resulted in 119 convictions. During this 
period, the CCTP and the Ministry of Interior identified 16 international networks dealing with 
trafficking in human beings and the organization of illegal migration. 
</p>
<p>72. Despite this progress, the reporting and prosecution of trafficking cases has yet to 
overcome a number of obstacles. In many cases, prosecutions are initiated long after the victim is 
recruited, making it difficult to gather evidence. Often times, law enforcement agents lack 
training on victim identification and interviewing techniques and subject the victim to repeated 
interviews during the investigation, thus increasing the possibility of re-traumatization. On many 
occasions, victims change their mind about participating in criminal proceedings in order not to 
endure further stigmatization or because of pressure and intimidation from traffickers. 
Reportedly other problems linked with prosecutions include: violation of legal procedures during 
in-court proceedings, in particular regarding witness protection and confidentiality; the failure to 
seek forfeiture of criminally derived assets; and the failure to award compensation to victims.  
</p>
<p>73. As previously mentioned, progress in the number of trafficking investigations and 
prosecutions is largely offset by the Government&#8217;s lack of follow-up on allegations against 
government officials, police officers and police guards for involvement in trafficking cases. Poor 
quality investigations and corruption are said to have resulted in light or suspended sentences for 
traffickers. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>55
</b>  Of these, 254 were linked to trafficking in human beings, 51 to children trafficking, 154 were 
</p>
<p>cases of sexual procurement and 69 of organization of illegal migration. 
<b>56
</b></p>
<p>  Reportedly, in many instances, prosecutors file trafficking charges in pimping cases because 
the Anti-Trafficking Law is more permissive on searches and wire tapping. 
<b>57
</b></p>
<p>  Of these, 154 of them concerned trafficking in human beings, 28 were cases of children 
trafficking, 102 of sexual procurement and 68 of organization of illegal migration. </p>

</p>
<p><b>D.  Support services 
</b></p>
<p>74. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) manage most of the essential support services for 
women victims of violence and abuse in the country. Many of them offer psychological, medical 
and legal assistance but, due to lack of financial resources, they cannot offer shelter facilities. 
These centres are largely insufficient in number, lack human and material resources, and are 
almost exclusively concentrated in urban areas. In addition, the lack of a clear mapping or a 
comprehensive database on the existing infrastructure for women subjected to violence renders 
the identification of support services extremely difficult for victims in the Republic of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>75. There is one main shelter in the country - Casa Mariorarei - where domestic violence 
victims and their children can take refuge. This shelter, located in Chisinau, offers psychological, 
social and legal counselling and operates a hotline for actual and potential victims of violence 
and abuse. It presently offers 24 beds for women and their children, who stay on average one 
month in the shelter. Despite the fact that the building has been provided by the Mayor&#8217;s Office 
free of charge, the shelter operates with insufficient material and human resources and is largely 
dependant on donor support. Five other centres providing more limited assistance to victims of 
domestic violence also exist, including two day centres which offer counselling and support to 
victims of domestic violence and three maternity centres which offer temporary/crisis shelter and 
counselling services. Article 10 of the Law to prevent and combat violence in the family defines 
the actors that can create centres for rehabilitation of victims of family violence and sets out the 
modalities for their operation. 
</p>
<p>76. Support services to victims of trafficking are mostly provided through NGOs with the 
support of international organizations. However, the Government of the Republic of Moldova 
has taken an important role in the development and implementation, in partnership with the 
IOM, of the National Referral System for the Protection of Victims of Trafficking and Persons 
at Risk (NRS), which at the time of reporting was being implemented in 16 regions and 
2 municipalities in the country.<b>58</b> The main goal of NRS is to combat trafficking in human beings 
by coordinating the efforts of national and local state institutions and civil society, and provide 
comprehensive short- and long-term assistance to actual and potential victims through a series of 
measures. These measures include: (a) raising awareness and reducing vulnerability through 
different initiatives, particularly in the fields of housing and employment; (b) prosecution/special 
assistance programmes for witnesses in legal proceedings through a strong partnership with the 
CCTP; and (c) identification, repatriation, rehabilitation and long-term reintegration services for 
victims of trafficking. Proposals to expand NRS throughout the country, including to victims of 
domestic violence, and to make it sustainable are currently under way.<b>59</b>

</p>
<p>77. There is one major shelter for victims of trafficking in the country - Rehabilitation Centre 
for Victims and Potential Victims of Human Trafficking - located in Chisinau with a capacity 
for 24 victims who stay on average three to four weeks. This shelter, operated by IOM with the 
support of various donors, provides medical, psychological, social and legal counselling to 
victims of trafficking. The adoption of Government Decision No. 847 on 11 July 2008 foresees 
an increased Government involvement and eventual ownership of the Centre. 
</p>
<p>78. In addition to other projects run by private donors, the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) has established a network of youth and maternal centres that provide social 
assistance, job training and develop entrepreneurship activities for women and youth who have 
been victims of trafficking and other forms of violence, including domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>79. In the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, while there is no specific 
infrastructure for responding to domestic violence cases, IOM has implemented a comprehensive 
counter-trafficking prevention and protection programme in cooperation with a local NGO 
partner. In addition to a hotline that provides confidential information on migration and 
trafficking, which has received almost 3,000 calls since its launch in 2006, the project also 
provides legal assistance, vocational training, support with job placement and start-up grants for 
small businesses to victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Republic of Moldova, since its independence in 1991, has encountered a 
multitude of difficulties in its transformation to a political democracy and market 
economy. While many of the related challenges hold commonalities with other post-Soviet 
countries, this mission has enabled me to identify some of the salient features of the 
Moldovan transition, which have significant implications for women&#8217;s status and the 
violation of their rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>One of the most common gendered outcomes of the post-Soviet transition is the dual 
burden of economic exclusion and patriarchal transgression in women&#8217;s lives. In the 
Republic of Moldova, while violence within the private sphere has been found to be the 
most prevalent form of abuse confronting women, the risk of torture and ill-treatment is 
particularly manifest in the context of irregular migration which often intersects with 
trafficking for purposes of sexual and labour exploitation. Migration of Moldovan women, 
which is initially motivated by economic pressures, is strongly linked to violence and 
ill-treatment within private life. </b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>While trafficking has gained greater recognition in society and by authorities as a 
public policy issue, domestic violence still remains largely invisible and legitimated as a 
normal aspect of primary relations. The link between the two is rarely questioned. 
Consequently, despite the commendable legal and policy developments, particularly in the 
fields of gender equality, domestic violence, trafficking and migration, the discrepancy 
between the normative framework and the reality on the ground is a major concern. </b> 
83. <b>Furthermore, the predominant approach to crimes against women is a punitive one 
rather than preventive, protective and corrective. Reporting of such crimes continues to be 
low and their investigation, prosecution and conviction are poor. Given that crimes against </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b>women are largely hidden or socially condoned, combating the problem is challenging, as it 
is both difficult and costly, and has minimal political returns in the short term. However, 
the Government is obligated under international and domestic law to embrace this 
challenge with strong political will and determination. This requires first and foremost: a 
recognition of the link between women&#8217;s status and the diverse forms of violence against 
them; fundamental shifts in mentality and effective policies and programmes, including 
vigorous public awareness campaigns, training programmes for law enforcement and 
judicial staff, as well as health professionals; promoting and supporting women&#8217;s 
empowerment; and partnership with civil society in building a strong and reliable 
infrastructure for the protection of victims of violence. </b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>While the Government of the Republic of Moldova is primarily responsible in 
ensuring that women living under its jurisdiction live a life free of violence, it is important 
to emphasize that combating trafficking in women and girls is also the joint responsibility 
of the international community, requiring transnational solutions and cooperation. </b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>In light of the above, I would like to make the following recommendations to the 
Government, which are also applicable to the Transnistrian region of the Republic of 
Moldova. They will require the support and assistance of donor agencies in their 
implementation. </b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>Regarding the elimination of violence against women and girls, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Elaborate a Plan of Action for the implementation and monitoring of the Law 
on preventing and combating violence in the family, including through appropriate 
mechanisms and the allocation of adequate budgetary and human resources for its 
implementation to relevant State bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure adequate funding to improve the existing infrastructure, including 
long-term rehabilitation programmes, to support victims of domestic violence and 
trafficking and create new centres that provide psychosocial, legal and residential services 
throughout the country, paying special attention to the increased vulnerability of women 
and girls in rural areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Expand the framework of the National Referral System for the Protection of 
Victims of Trafficking and Persons at Risk to children left behind and victims of domestic 
violence; and bearing in mind the intimate link between trafficking in women and domestic 
violence, institute a comprehensive, coordinated Government-led system for protection and 
assistance to all victims;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Enact internal regulations and protocols defining the roles, responsibilities, 
procedures and codes of conduct of each relevant sector; develop reporting and monitoring 
mechanisms and provide skills training for the efficient performance of all these functions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Establish specialized female law enforcement units; </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/11/6/Add.4 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b> (f) Develop training modules on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol, the Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women and relevant national legislation on violence within 
the family, gender equality and trafficking for training of all law enforcement personnel, 
judges and prosecutors, health-care providers and social workers to ensure that they 
adequately respond to cases of violence against women; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Address the root causes of domestic violence and trafficking of women and girls, 
and their inter-linkages in all policies, plans and programmes;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure that all those who are involved in the trafficking and sexual exploitation 
of women and girls are duly prosecuted and punished to the full extent of the law, while 
guaranteeing the victims&#8217; right to protection and confidentiality; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Promptly and thoroughly investigate all allegations which may constitute forms 
of violence against women; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Consider legislative reforms recognizing the effects and trauma of domestic 
violence on women, with a view to ensuring that this is taken into account as mitigating 
circumstances, in the case of women who murder or inflict severe bodily injuries on their 
husbands/partners because of domestic violence.</b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Regarding gender equality and empowerment of women, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Institute a mechanism located within the highest level of Government - a 
national rapporteur or observatory on gender issues - to observe and monitor trends in 
gender equality and ensure the consistency of progress achieved;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure full implementation and monitoring of the Law on equal opportunities 
for women and men, including through the allocation of adequate financial resources, and 
the guarantee of legal remedies in case of violations;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that all job-generation and poverty-alleviation strategies and 
programmes are gender sensitive, and that women, particularly those from rural areas, 
have full access to vocational training programmes, including through the implementation 
of temporary special measures in accordance with article 4 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and General Recommendation 
No. 25 (2004) of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; 
 (d) Conduct awareness-raising campaigns on violence against women and women&#8217;s 
rights targeted at women, particularly in rural areas, to enhance their awareness of their 
human rights and to ensure that they can avail themselves of procedures and remedies for 
violation of their rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Integrate a gender equality perspective into school textbooks and curricula and 
provide gender training for teachers, with a view to changing patriarchal attitudes and 
stereotypes regarding the role of men and women in the family and society;  </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.4

</p>
<p><b> (f) Consider reintroducing the &#8220;life skills education&#8221; programme into elementary 
and secondary school curricula; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Encourage the media to play a more active role in promoting women&#8217;s status in 
society, and not to project gender stereotypes or discriminatory attitudes towards women. </b> 
88. <b>Regarding gender-sensitive information and knowledge base, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Enhance national level collection, analysis and dissemination of 
sex-disaggregated data on the prevalence of different forms of violence against women 
and girls, including through the classification of domestic violence as a separate crime in 
police and prosecution records, and introduce specific modules on violence against women 
and trafficking in national surveys;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Set up a centralized database to map out the support services and institutions 
for women and girls subjected to violence within the National Referral System; 
 (c) Collaborate with academic and research institutions to carry out periodic 
research on the impact of economic restructuring on women, migratory trends and their 
affect on the family; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strengthen exchange of data between government bodies, crisis centres and 
international and non-governmental organizations</b>. 
</p>
<p>89. <b>Regarding institutional and public sector reforms, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government:

<p><b> (b) Monitor, through measurable gendered indicators, the impact of laws, policies 
and action plans in order to evaluate progress achieved towards the elimination of violence 
against women and girls;
