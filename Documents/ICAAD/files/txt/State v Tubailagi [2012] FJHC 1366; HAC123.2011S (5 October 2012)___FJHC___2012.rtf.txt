1.      
The 3 assessors have unanimously found the accused guilty of committing incest against his 21 year old daughter, on 31st May 2010, at Laucala Island in the Central Division, contrary to section 223 of the Crimes Decree 2009.

2.      
Obviously, the assessors have accepted the prosecution's version of events, which is fundamentally based on the complainant's evidence. 

3.      
I have reviewed the evidence called in this trial and have directed myself in accordance with the Summing Up I gave the assessors today.
