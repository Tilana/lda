<p>14. During the period under review, UNJHRO continued to make frequent visits to prisons throughout 
the country, including joint visits with the Minister for Human Rights in some provinces, and documented 
crumbling cells, lack of food and medical care, corruption and unqualified prison staff. UNJHRO 
continued to carry out its awareness-raising activities and to promote the adoption of a law criminalizing 
torture. In the context of the celebration of the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture on 
26 June 2009, UNJRHO organized a number of activities. Furthermore, in partnership with Avocats sans 
fronti&#232;res (ASF), UNJHRO facilitates the implementation of decisions by the United Nations Trust Fund 
for Victims of Torture. In October 2009, in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and the judicial 
authorities, UNJHRO organized a workshop on the theme &#8220;the judiciary and the problem of torture and 
death in prison&#8221;. At the workshop, participants asked the Procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral de la R&#233;publique pr&#232;s la Cour 
supr&#234;me (Prosecutor General of the Republic to the Supreme Court) to draft a directive for the prosecutors 
on the need to effectively investigate cases of torture and death in custody. The directive is currently being 
developed with the assistance of UNJHRO. UNJHRO has actively continued to advocate for making 
prisons more self-sufficient.
