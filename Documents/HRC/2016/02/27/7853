<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur reports on his visit to Azerbaijan at the 
invitation of the Government from 16 to 23 May 2012. The purpose of the mission was to 
ascertain, in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, how the country has endeavoured to 
implement the right to health, as well as the measures taken for successful realization of the 
right to health. 
</p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur focused on the following issues: the 
health system and health financing; tuberculosis and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis 
(MDR-TB); and health care in prisons and detention centres. The Special Rapporteur 
visited Baku, Ganja, Yevlakh, Ujar and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. 
</p><p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with senior Government officials from the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs; Health; Labour and Social Protection; Finance; and Justice; 
the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs; Parliament Committees, the 
Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights; as well as with senior officials from the 
Supreme Assembly and Ministry of Health of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. He 
also held meetings with the representatives of civil society, international organizations, 
development partners, academics, legal experts and health professionals. The Special 
Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Azerbaijan for its invitation and full 
cooperation during his visit. He also would like to thank all those who met with him, gave 
their time and extended cooperation to him during the mission.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Right to health  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan experienced considerable political 
turmoil, including several military coups and rampant corruption. At the same time, the 
country was embroiled in a territorial armed conflict which ended with a 1994 ceasefire, 
which to date, remains in place. Social and economic development was effectively stalled 
during that tumultuous period. Over the last decade, however, Azerbaijan has experienced 
impressive economic growth, driven primarily by its oil and mineral wealth. The country&#8217;s 
gross domestic product (GDP) increased from USD 7.3 billion in 2003 to 63.4 billion in 
2011.1 GDP per capita increased during the same period from USD 884 to 6,916.2 Poverty 
in the country has been reduced significantly during this time, from 49.6 per cent in 20013 
to 7.6 per cent in 2011.4  
</p>
<p>5. A number of health indicators also improved during this time. Maternal mortality 
rates decreased considerably, from 81 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 43 in 2010.5

<p>Additionally, the percentage of people using improved drinking-water sources has 
increased from 70 per cent in 1990 to 80 per cent in 2010, and the percentage of people 
using improved sanitation has increased from 62 per cent in 2000 to 82 per cent in 2010.6 
However, health-related challenges and inequalities continue to persist. Infant and under-5 
mortality rates remain high at 39 and 45 deaths per 1,000 live births respectively.7 
Disparities in health indicators between the lowest and highest wealth quintiles in 
Azerbaijan are also of concern. For example, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunization 
coverage among 1-year-olds in the lowest quintile (21 per cent) is less than half the 
coverage in the highest quintile (56 per cent).8 The disparity in children under 5 who are 
stunted in the lowest and highest quintiles is also a concern, at 33 and 15 per cent 
respectively.9 The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to direct a greater portion of 
its growing wealth toward addressing these health-related challenges and other 
socioeconomic inequities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International and national legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. Azerbaijan is a party to a number of international human rights treaties that 
recognize the right to health, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the two 
Optional Protocols thereto, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, including the Optional Protocol thereto, the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, including the two Optional Protocols thereto, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including the Optional 
Protocol thereto. In accordance with article 148 of the Constitution, international treaties 
are recognized as an integral part of the legislative system of Azerbaijan. 
</p><p>7. The Constitution of Azerbaijan contains a number of provisions relating to the right 
to health. Article 41 establishes the right of protection of health, including the right to 
medical care, and requires the Government to take all necessary measures for the 
development of all forms of health services, to guarantee sanitary-epidemiological safety, 
and to create possibilities for various forms of health insurance. Article 27 protects the right 
to life; article 31 provides for the right to live in safety; article 39 establishes the right to 
live in a healthy environment; article 35 protects the right to work in safe and healthy 
conditions; article 46 establishes the right to be free from torture and humiliating 
punishment and prohibits non-consensual medical, scientific and other experimentation; 
article 17 prohibits children&#8217;s involvement in activities that threaten their lives or health.  
</p>
<p>8. Legislation in Azerbaijan related to the realization of the right to health include the 
Law on Protection of the Health of the Population (1997), Law on Prevention of HIV and 
AIDS (1997), Law on Medical Insurance (1999), the Law on Private Medical Practice

</p>
<p><b> III. Health system and financing 
</b></p>
<p>9. An effective and integrated health system, encompassing health care and the 
underlying determinants of health, which is responsive to national and local priorities and 
accessible to all, is fundamental to the realization of the right to health.10 Full realization of 
the right to health is further contingent upon the availability of adequate, equitable and 
sustainable financing for health.11 States should therefore take all necessary steps to raise 
adequate revenue and mobilize resources for health and ensure that health financing is 
correspondingly prioritized in national and subnational budgets.12  
</p>
<p>10. The Government of Azerbaijan has increased expenditures on health significantly in 
recent times. The budget for health has increased to more than fifteen times the size of the 
budget at the time of independence, including an 18 per cent increase from 2011 to 2012.13 
Capital investment in the health sector has also increased: allocations for government 
investment in health in 2012 rose by 40 per cent since 2011, 400 health facilities have been 
renovated or newly built, and 53 additional facilities have been identified for renovation.14 
Per capita government expenditure on health has also risen substantially, from USD 6 in 
2000 at average exchange rate to 65 in 2009.15 Per capita spending on health is thus in line 
with World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, according to which low-income 
countries will need to spend more than USD 60 per capita by 2015 in order to reach the 
health-related Millennium Development Goals and to ensure access to critical interventions, 
including for non-communicable diseases.16 The Special Rapporteur commends the 
Government on these advances. 
</p>
<p>11. Although current Government expenditure on health is increasing, expenditure on 
health in Azerbaijan has not kept pace with the country&#8217;s economic growth, much of which 
has been spent on large capital investment projects.17 Azerbaijan currently spends only 1.5 
per cent of the country&#8217;s GDP on health,18 down from almost 6 per cent in 2010.19 This is 
very low by international standards: lower than the 2010 averages in the Americas (8.1 per

<p>cent), Europe (7.4 per cent), the former Soviet republics (5.7 per cent), and Africa (3 per 
cent).20 Moreover, in 2012 only 3.9 per cent of Azerbaijan&#8217;s State budget was allocated to 
health.21 By contrast, the European average was 15.3 per cent in 2010.22 During meetings 
with the Special Rapporteur, the Government acknowledged that spending on health is still 
low. Increasing expenditure on health to meet international standards should be of the 
utmost priority in order to ensure that the country&#8217;s considerable wealth is used to 
improving the health of its people and to meet the country&#8217;s obligations under the right to 
health.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Primary health care 
</b></p>
<p>12. Like the other former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan inherited what is known as the 
Semashko health system model from the former Soviet Union. The model relies on input-
based financing and aims to provide a comprehensive set of health services. It traditionally 
focuses on infectious diseases and epidemic preparedness, which require large numbers of 
hospital beds and inpatient facilities staffed by specialized health workers. This model thus 
prioritizes inpatient hospital care, investment in physical health infrastructure, financing 
based on inputs, such as hospital beds and staffing, and specialized secondary and tertiary 
care. This leads to an inefficient allocation of health funds and resources throughout the 
health system, as investment is directed toward specialized health facilities, leading to 
excess capacity at the secondary and tertiary-care levels and the underdevelopment of the 
primary health-care sector.  
</p>
<p>13. In Azerbaijan, this has resulted in a considerable excess of hospital beds and an 
underutilization of health facilities throughout the country. In meetings with the Special 
Rapporteur, the Government acknowledged the problem and indicated that it was taking 
steps to address it, including through a proposed 40 per cent decrease in the number of 
health facilities and a 50 per cent decrease in the number of hospital beds in the country. 
However, Government spending on health continues to be directed towards investment in 
large-scale physical health infrastructure, specialized secondary and tertiary care, and 
advanced medical equipment. This was evident during meetings with experts and visits to 
health facilities throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>14. States have a core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of minimum essential levels 
of the right to health, including available and accessible primary health care.23 Primary 
health care is customarily defined as essential health care based on practical, scientifically 
sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to 
individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that 
the community and country can afford.24  
</p>
<p>15. As a result of its continued reliance on the Semashko health system model, the 
primary health-care system in Azerbaijan remains underdeveloped and underfunded. This is 
especially acute in rural and remote areas, where clinics are often inaccessible and

<p>understaffed and the quality of services is low. Individuals living in rural and remote areas 
affected by poverty face the greatest challenges in accessing quality primary health-care 
services. The Government has acknowledged this problem and, in cooperation with 
development partners, has begun to invest in the construction and improvement of primary 
health-care facilities in rural areas. However, in order to ensure access to and availability of 
primary and preventative health-care facilities, goods and services for all, particularly 
groups living in rural or remote areas, the Special Rapporteur urges Azerbaijan to increase 
its efforts and funding substantially to strengthen the country&#8217;s primary health-care system. 
This should include, among other things, the training and utilization of general medical 
practitioners (e.g., family doctors), the continued construction and improvement of primary 
health-care facilities throughout the country, and the use of preventative health-care 
campaigns to address hygiene, sanitation, and communicable and non-communicable 
diseases. Strengthening the primary health-care system is necessary for full realization of 
the right to health in Azerbaijan and will ensure Government expenditures on health are 
more efficiently spent in directly improving the population&#8217;s health. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Input-based and alternative financing models 
</b></p>
<p>16. Input-based financing allocates funds throughout the health system based on 
overhead expenses incurred by health-care providers, such as the number of hospital beds, 
health worker salaries and medical equipment. Input-based financing provides incentives 
for health facilities to increase their capacity in order to obtain more budgetary funds 
without consideration of actual needs of the populations they serve. As a result, health 
facilities maintain excess staff, expensive medical equipment and a large number of 
hospital beds, which often go unused. Such facilities offer expensive curative care, but do 
not provide affordable primary and preventative health-care goods and services. Input-
based financing also leads to rigid budgetary allocation between health facilities, as 
authorities may not be able to transfer funds between facilities without transferring physical 
resources, such as hospital beds and staff.25 
</p>
<p>17. Shifting to a system of financing based on populations&#8217; health needs, demographic 
and socioeconomic indicators and performance outputs will promote a more equitable and 
efficient allocation of health funds and resources in Azerbaijan, as required under the right 
to health. Such financing systems often rely on capitation funding, which focuses on 
individuals and allocates funds based on certain characteristics, such as age, sex, health 
status, economic circumstances, geographic location and employment status. Funding may 
thus be scaled to provide more financial support to health-care facilities and providers that 
service groups needing the most assistance. This in turn would increase equity throughout 
the health system. Health financing may also be performance-based, whereby funds are 
allocated to health facilities and providers in accordance with the quantity and quality of the 
health care they provide.26 Performance-based financing increases levels of accountability 
among health workers because they must monitor the quality of the services they provide 
and respond to patients&#8217; needs, encouraging patients to utilize available health services.27 
Capitation and performance-based financing models allow Governments to allocate funds 
for health with greater sensitivity to regional differences and local needs. This in turn

<p>promotes efficiency throughout the health system because health budgets are more closely 
tailored to the needs of communities rather than based upon health inputs.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that the Government has begun to reform 
the country&#8217;s health financing system. He encourages the Government to continue to 
implement financing reforms in order to promote the equitable and efficient use of health 
funds and resources and to ensure that health facilities, goods and services meet the needs 
of the community and are available and affordable within the community. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Out-of-pocket payments and compensation for health workers 
</b></p>
<p>19. Health services are legally required to be provided free of charge in public health 
facilities in Azerbaijan. Despite this, out-of-pocket payments, or payments for health goods 
and services made at the point of service delivery, including informal or so-called 
&#8220;envelope&#8221; payments, are pervasive throughout the health system. In 2010, out-of-pocket 
payments accounted for up to 70 per cent of the total spending on health in the country.28 
The actual percentage, however, is likely to be considerably higher, given the difficulty in 
measuring informal payments and incomplete reporting from the private sector, including 
private health-care providers and pharmacies.29 A large percentage of out-of-pocket 
payments comprise expenditures on outpatient pharmaceuticals.30 The cost of 
pharmaceuticals is particularly high due to the absence of a comprehensive regulatory 
regime to regulate prices and facilitate the introduction of more affordable medicines, such 
as generic medicines, into the market. 
</p>
<p>20. The prevalence of out-of-pocket payments is due in part to extensive corruption 
throughout the health system. It is also a consequence, however, of the low salaries paid to 
doctors and other health workers. According to Government data, the average monthly 
salary for health workers in 2011 (164 manats) was less than half the average salary for all 
workers in the country (364 manats).31 Moreover, during his visit, the Special Rapporteur 
learned that doctors&#8217; salaries are often just above the national minimum wage (93.50 
manats). In order to supplement insufficient salaries, doctors and health workers, as a 
matter of uniform practice, collect informal payments from patients in return for health 
goods and services. The result is an informal, unregulated system of fee-for-services. The 
cost of health care under a system that relies on unregulated fee-for-services paid out-of-
pocket is likely to be regressive. Out-of-pocket payments for health goods and services thus 
disproportionately impact the poor, who must spend considerably larger proportions of their 
income on health care than wealthy patients. As a result, poor households may experience 
financial catastrophe and impoverishment due to out-of-pocket payments, resulting in a 
chilling effect that discourages many from seeking health care in the first place (A/67/302, 
para. 2). This in turn leads to the underutilization of health services throughout the health 
system.32

<p>21. Low salaries for health workers also contribute to low quality of health services, 
which erodes the population&#8217;s confidence in the health system. During meetings with the 
Special Rapporteur, the Government acknowledged that salaries for health workers are too 
low, contributing to high out-of-pocket payments and low confidence in the health system 
among the population. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to substantially 
increase salaries and reconsider existing incentive structures for health workers.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Mandatory health insurance 
</b></p>
<p>22. In order to address excessive out-of-pocket payments and increase funding for 
health, the Government enacted the Law on Medical Insurance in 1999. Among other 
things, the law provides a legal framework for a mandatory health insurance programme.33 
The implementation of the programme, however, was initially delayed in order to avoid 
increased taxation of individuals and businesses during the economic reconstruction. In 
2007, the State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance was established by a presidential 
decree.34 The following year, the Concept for Health Financing Reforms and Introduction 
of Mandatory Health Insurance was introduced.35 A coordinating council of senior 
government officials was also established by the order of the Cabinet of Ministries. 
However, the mandatory health insurance programme has not yet been implemented, 
despite the fact that funding for the programme has been made available. Regrettably, 
during meetings with officials from relevant agencies, the Special Rapporteur was unable to 
ascertain how and when the programme will be implemented.  
</p>
<p>23. In order to ensure adequate, equitable and sustainable funding for health as required 
by the right to health, the Special Rapporteur encourages Azerbaijan to pool health funds 
collected through prepayment schemes. The mandatory health insurance programme 
represents one such scheme. Pooling allows for the cross-subsidization of financial risks 
associated with health care among different groups across large populations and reduces 
out-of-pocket payments for health goods and services. Cross-subsidization of financial risks 
protects the sick and the poor from catastrophic health expenditures and promotes universal 
access to good quality health facilities, goods and services that may otherwise be 
financially inaccessible. Prepayment schemes for health should be funded progressively 
through universal mandatory contributions, based on individuals&#8217; and families&#8217; ability to 
pay, with absolute exemptions for the poor.  
</p>
<p>24. The mandatory health insurance programme should ensure that a minimum set of 
health goods and services are available and universally accessible based on need under the 
programme. Benefits packages should be responsive to the disease burden and health needs 
of the population. At a minimum, they should contain effective, community-based primary 
health-care goods and services and safe, effective and affordable drugs, including essential 
medicines and generic drugs. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges the Government to 
prioritize the implementation of the mandatory health insurance programme in line with the 
right to health.

<p>which therefore includes an obligation to prevent, treat and control tuberculosis. The 
control of tuberculosis includes efforts to make available relevant technologies, using and 
improving epidemiological surveillance and data collection on a disaggregated basis, and 
implement or enhance immunization programmes and other strategies of infectious disease 
control.36 The right to health also requires States to ensure good-quality health facilities, 
goods and services are available and accessible to all on a non-discriminatory basis, 
particularly for vulnerable or marginalized groups.37 People living with tuberculosis are 
vulnerable as a result of stigmatization and discrimination, the high levels of poverty 
amongst those affected by the disease, and the greater likelihood that people living with 
tuberculosis are members of groups that are otherwise vulnerable or marginalized, such as 
prisoners and detainees and persons living with HIV. The right to health further requires the 
participation of affected individuals and communities in all decision-making processes 
impacting their health during the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation 
of health-related laws and policies.   
</p>
<p>26. Over the last two decades, Azerbaijan has taken a number of important steps toward 
combating tuberculosis in the country. In accordance with WHO recommendations, in 1995 
the Ministry of Health adopted the Directly Observed Treatment, Shortcourse (DOTS) 
programme, later expanding it to cover all provinces and districts. In the same year, the 
Ministry of Justice, in cooperation with International Committee of the Red Cross, 
instituted a pilot tuberculosis programme in the central penitentiary hospital in Baku. The 
programme was later expanded to cover all prisoners and detainees in the penitentiary 
system, in part through funding from international donors, including the Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In 2000, Azerbaijan adopted the Law on the Control 
of Tuberculosis, which forms the basis for the national tuberculosis control programme. In 
2005, the Ministry of Health initiated the programme &#8220;Management of Drug-Resistant 
Tuberculosis&#8221;. In 2008, the Research Institute for Lung Diseases of Azerbaijan began 
developing a network of diagnostic laboratories responsible for sputum microscopy of 
suspected tuberculosis cases with the Institute&#8217;s central laboratory in Baku acting as a 
reference laboratory responsible for drug-sensitivity testing. In 2010, the Government 
adopted a new national tuberculosis programme for 2010&#8211;2015, under which the Strategic 
Action Plan for 2011&#8211;2015 was adopted.  
</p>
<p>27. However, tuberculosis, multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely 
drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) continue to pose a serious threat to health and human 
rights in Azerbaijan. WHO has designated Azerbaijan a high tuberculosis priority country 
within the European region. While the tuberculosis prevalence rate (177 per 100,000)38 is 
only slightly above the global average (170 per 100,000), it is more than three times the 
WHO regional average (56 per 100,000).39 More alarmingly, Azerbaijan has amongst the 
highest burdens of MDR-TB in the world. WHO has categorized Azerbaijan as one of 27 
high MDR-TB burden countries. The estimated rate of new tuberculosis cases with MDR-
TB is 22 per cent, the sixth highest in the world, and it is estimated that over half of 
previously treated tuberculosis cases have MDR-TB, again one of the highest proportions in 
the world.40 The gap between current diagnostic capacity and available MDR-TB and 
XDR-TB treatment is as high as 56 per cent, which means that treatment is unavailable for

<p>over half of people diagnosed with MDR-TB or XDR-TB in the country.41 Azerbaijan also 
has one of the highest proportions of MDR-TB cases with XDR-TB in the world in the 
Baku city subnational area.42 Moreover, it is one of only six countries that still rely on drug 
resistance surveillance information collected from a small set of subnational areas, despite 
plans to begin nationwide surveys in 2013.43  
</p>
<p>28. Commendably, tuberculosis notification rates increased between 2001 and 2010 
from 59.8 to 69.5 per 100,000 people, which suggests improved detection and 
registration.44 National detection of MDR-TB began in 2005 and data from the reference 
laboratory in Baku gained acceptance within the international community, following its 
inauguration in 2009. From 2010 to 2011, as the accessibility of MDR-TB and XDR-TB 
diagnosis increased, the number of MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases diagnosed rose 
dramatically from 584 to 987.45 However, such a drastic increase may instead indicate an 
increase in the number of MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases in absolute terms. This 
interpretation is further supported by the fact that detection and treatment success rates, 
only 62 and 77 per cent, respectively, remain below both WHO targets and global 
averages.46  
</p>
<p><b> A. High prevalence of tuberculosis, MDR-TB and XDR-TB 
</b></p>
<p>29. A number of factors contribute to the high prevalence of tuberculosis, MDR-TB and 
XDR-TB in Azerbaijan: a lack of availability and accessibility of diagnostic and treatment 
services; interrupted or discontinued treatment regimes, particularly for former prisoners; 
inconsistent quality of diagnostic and treatment services under the DOTS programme; 
inadequate infection control; incomplete integration of tuberculosis services into the 
primary health-care system; a lack of validated epidemiological data; and stigmatization 
and discrimination of people living with tuberculosis. 
</p>
<p>30. The right to health requires good-quality health facilities, goods and services to be 
physically and economically accessible to everyone without discrimination, especially for 
vulnerable or marginalized groups.47 Diagnostic and treatment services and medicines for 
tuberculosis are required by law to be available free-of-charge. However, during his visit, 
the Special Rapporteur learned that in practice informal payments for health goods and 
services, including for tuberculosis treatment and medicines, are pervasive. As a result, 
health goods and services remain financially inaccessible for many. The inability to afford 
or physically access appropriate and uninterrupted treatment for tuberculosis has been 
shown to lower detection and adherence rates.48 Improper or interrupted treatment also 
leads to the development of drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, such as MDR-TB and 
XDR-TB. This is particularly a concern for prisoners living with tuberculosis who may 
experience interruptions in their treatment after release, as discussed below. As compared 
to tuberculosis, treatment services and medicines for MDR-TB and XDR-TB are more 
costly and less readily available, the duration of treatment is significantly longer, treatment

<p>side effects are more severe, and treatment success rates are substantially lower.49 The 
increased financial burden associated with the treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB further 
reduces financial accessibility and increases overall system costs to the Government. 
</p>
<p>31. Although the DOTS programme achieved 100 per cent coverage in 2005,50 the 
Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the quality of testing and treatment available 
under the programme. For example, while protocols on detection, treatment, prophylaxis, 
childhood tuberculosis, surgical interventions and treatment side effects are in place, some 
have been approved without meeting international standards as defined by WHO.51 
Additionally, some tuberculosis medicines procured by Government funds are loose and 
incomplete single-drug formulations, which may contribute to the development of MDR-
TB and XDR-TB.52 Infection control guidelines have also not been updated according to 
international recommendations, and criteria for the hospitalization and discharge of people 
living with tuberculosis do not adequately consider infection control.53  
</p>
<p>32. The integration of tuberculosis prevention, treatment, and care into the primary 
health-care system is very limited. Primary health care provided in a community setting, in 
small clinics or in homes, by general practitioners and nurses may be administered in a 
more socially and culturally acceptable manner. Patient-centred primary health-care 
services are especially important for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis because 
appropriate methods of prevention and treatment of the disease are often misunderstood and 
people living with tuberculosis are frequently stigmatized. There are many health-care 
workers with specialized knowledge of tuberculosis in Azerbaijan, but very few of them are 
trained in primary health-care delivery.54 The skills of many health-care workers working 
on tuberculosis have also not been updated and some workers do not follow diagnostic 
protocols or apply incorrect treatment regimes, contributing to the inconsistent 
implementation of DOTS in primary health care.55  
</p>
<p>33. The prevention and control of tuberculosis is impeded by a lack of validated 
epidemiological data, which is a major problem throughout the health system in Azerbaijan. 
Dissonance between Government statistics and data from independent sources makes it 
difficult to ascertain the true extent of progress made toward combating tuberculosis. This 
lacuna was evidenced during the visit of the Special Rapporteur and further demonstrated 
by the incomplete information available on tuberculosis in Azerbaijan in the WHO <i>Global 
Tuberculosis Report</i> <i>2012</i>. Data from the country is unavailable for many of the indicators 
in the report.56 In particular, data concerning the prevalence of HIV/tuberculosis co-
infection as well as information regarding the treatment of HIV/tuberculosis co-infection is 
notably unavailable. This is despite the fact that tuberculosis is a leading cause of death 
globally for people living with HIV.57 During official meetings, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that the rate of new tuberculosis cases with MDR-TB in 2011 was 11 per cent. 
This is half the official rate reported by WHO for the same year (22 per cent), illustrating 
the substantial dissonance between Government and independent data. The use of

<p>epidemiological surveillance and data collection is critical to the control of tuberculosis and 
necessary to the realization of the right to health. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the 
Government to improve its epidemiological surveillance of tuberculosis and to make the 
data available and accessible for all, as required by the right to health.58   
</p>
<p>34. The stigmatization of people living with tuberculosis in Azerbaijan is a serious 
concern. Stigmatization is partly rooted in low public awareness about the prevention and 
transmission of tuberculosis. In some instances, even health-care workers have adopted 
practices that contribute to stigmatization, such as disinfecting surfaces in the homes of the 
people living with tuberculosis, which is unnecessary to prevent the transmission of the 
disease.59 Stigmatization infringes upon the dignity of affected individuals and often leads 
to discrimination, interfering with the realization of their right to health. Stigmatization 
discourages people from being tested for tuberculosis and inhibits people living with 
tuberculosis from seeking treatment. The magnitude of stigmatization in Azerbaijan is often 
so great that people living with tuberculosis hide that fact even from their loved ones. The 
Special Rapporteur also learned during his visit that some individuals obtain medicines 
illicitly from private pharmacies and discretely engage in self-treatment in order to avoid 
registration on the national tuberculosis programme. Self-treatment lowers cure rates and 
increases chances of acquiring MDR-TB.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur was pleased with efforts to use the media to reduce stigma 
surrounding tuberculosis and to encourage testing for the disease. In particular, he notes a 
campaign to promote awareness and reduce stigma through a national television advertising 
campaign.60 The programme produced two public service announcements for television and 
a variety of other educational materials, including a video.61 The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to continue its support for these activities. However, the 
participation of affected communities, including people living with tuberculosis and people 
formerly affected by tuberculosis, in such activities is still limited. The Special Rapporteur 
would like to emphasize that the participation of people living with tuberculosis and former 
tuberculosis patients is necessary to ensure sustainable and effective interventions toward 
eliminating the stigmatization of tuberculosis in Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Tuberculosis in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>36. In contrast to the prevention, treatment and control of tuberculosis in the general 
population, Azerbaijan has achieved notable success combating tuberculosis in the 
penitentiary system. As mentioned above, the Government established a pilot programme in 
1995 to address tuberculosis and later MDR-TB in prisons. The programme rigorously 
implemented DOTS and later DOTS-Plus, increased access to diagnostics and treatment, 
improved infection control and trained and employed local staff.62 Through technical and 
financial assistance from external partners, the initiative has since been expanded to cover 
all prisoners and detainees. Treatment and medicines for tuberculosis and MDR-TB are 
provided free-of-charge under the programme. As a result, the penitentiary system in

</p>
<p>Azerbaijan has one of the highest tuberculosis cure rates globally.63 The number of deaths 
due to tuberculosis in prisons has been reduced dramatically from 465 in 1998 to 25 in 
2010,64 and the number of prisoners with tuberculosis has decreased by almost 50 per cent 
from 1,012 in 2001 to 521 in 2010.65 The Special Rapporteur commends the Government 
for these achievements. 
</p>
<p>37. The administration of the tuberculosis programme in prisons was transferred to the 
Ministry of Justice in March 2011. In order to carry on the programme&#8217;s success and ensure 
continued realization of the right to health for prisoners and detainees, the Government 
should: maintain universal availability and accessibility of diagnostics and treatment for 
tuberculosis and MDR-TB in prisons; ensure transparent monitoring and evaluation of the 
programme; and preserve existing compensation and incentive structures to retain and 
recruit qualified medical professionals. The Special Rapporteur, however, is concerned that 
the Government has not made sufficient plans to ensure adequate and sustainable funding 
for the programme is available following the cessation of grants from external partners. A 
significant decrease in funding would impact the availability of medicines, particularly for 
MDR-TB, and threaten the programme&#8217;s ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel, 
which is critical to maintaining high-quality testing and treatment for tuberculosis and 
MDR-TB in the penitentiary system. 
</p>
<p>38. The interruption or cessation of tuberculosis treatment for prisoners after their 
release is a significant concern. Interruption and discontinuation of tuberculosis treatment 
negatively impacts infection control and leads to the development of MDR-TB and XDR-
TB. A lack of coordination between prison and civilian authorities increases the incidence 
of MDR-TB and XDR-TB amongst former prisoners and contributes to the spread of 
tuberculosis and the development of MDR and XDR-TB in the general population. In order 
to address this problem, in 2009 the Government concluded a tripartite agreement between 
the Red Cross, the Ministry of Justice and the Research Institute for Lung Diseases aimed 
at ensuring the continued treatment of prisoners living with tuberculosis after their release 
from prison. Upon the departure of the Red Cross in 2011, a domestic non-governmental 
organization (Support to Health) was designated to continue these activities.66 The Special 
Rapporteur is encouraged by these developments and the involvement of civil society in 
particular. However, in order to ensure continued treatment for prisoners living with 
tuberculosis after their release, the Government should develop and implement a 
coordinated national strategy involving close cooperation between prisons, national and 
province-level tuberculosis hospitals and laboratories, and district-level polyclinics. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Financing for tuberculosis  
</b></p>
<p>39. Government funding for tuberculosis is increasing, in part due to the establishment 
of the Tuberculosis Action Fund in 2010. However, the large majority of funding for 
tuberculosis in Azerbaijan comes from international donors, including the Global Fund, the 
United States Agency for International Development and UNITAID. Dependence on 
external funding sources threatens the sustainability of the national tuberculosis 
programme. Since 2011, the Government has procured first-line tuberculosis drugs for use 
in the civilian sector. However, the Global Fund currently provides virtually all funding for

well as all funding for first-line drugs in prisons.67 According to WHO, little external 
funding will be available for the national tuberculosis programme beyond 2013.68 During 
his visit, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that plans are in place to account 
for decreases in external funding. However, the Special Rapporteur heard concerns that 
these plans were not fully developed. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take 
measures to ensure adequate and sustainable domestic funds are available for tuberculosis 
upon the departure of international funders. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Right to health of prisoners and detainees 
</b></p>
<p>40. The right to health of prisoners and detainees is protected and elaborated upon in a 
number of international instruments. General comment No. 14 of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, interpreting article 12 of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, establishes the obligation of States to refrain from 
denying or limiting prisoners&#8217; and detainees&#8217; access to preventive, curative and 
palliative health services (para. 34). The 1955 Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment 
of Prisoners provide for standards related to the availability and accessibility of health care 
in prisons as well as the underlying determinants of health, such as food, sanitation and 
hygiene. The 1990 Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners and the 1988 Body of 
Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment 
provide for free and non-discriminatory access of prisoners to the health services available 
outside the penitentiary system in the place of detention or imprisonment. And the 1982 
Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly 
Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment declare that health workers in prisons 
have a duty to provide prisoners with treatment of the same quality and standard that is 
afforded to those who are not imprisoned or detained (principle 1). 
</p><p>41. The Human Rights Committee has stated that States&#8217; obligations under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights include &#8220;the provision of adequate 
medical care during detention&#8221;.69 The Committee against Torture has declared that 
allegations that prisoners were not provided medical treatment amount to cruel and 
degrading treatment under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment.70  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Government, as part of reforms in the 
judicial system, has replaced the medical service of the Ministry of Justice with the newly 
established General Medical Department. According to information received from the 
Government following the visit, the Department carries out regular sanitary and 
epidemiological assessments in places of detention and imprisonment, and every prisoner 
has a right &#8220;to consult a doctor of his/her own choice&#8221; and &#8220;to be examined in one of the 
leading, fully equipped hospitals of the Ministry of Health&#8221;. Despite this, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that these policies have not been fully implemented in places of 
detention and imprisonment.

<p>43. In 2010, the penitentiary system in Azerbaijan housed approximately 37,000 
individuals, amounting to a prison population rate of approximately 407 prisoners per 
100,000 people.71 The prison population has grown considerably over the past decade, 
almost doubling during the last five years.72 Because the penitentiary system in Azerbaijan 
remains largely opaque, however, making an accurate assessment of the health status of the 
prison population presents a challenge. Based on available information, overcrowding in 
prisons and detention facilities throughout the country remains a significant problem and 
should be of concern to the Government. Prisons are operating at over 30 per cent above 
over their capacity,73 which impacts negatively on prisoners&#8217; health, especially as relates to 
the spread of infectious and communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis.  
</p>
<p>44. The Government has taken steps to renovate and build new prison facilities, such as 
Baku Remand Prison, in an effort to alleviate overcrowding and increase prisoners&#8217; access 
to health services. In the last six years, the Government has also built two new medical-
sanitary units in two prisons and renovated 12 Soviet-era prisons in order to meet modern 
standards. Following the visit, the Government reported that a number of new laboratory 
units had been established and old laboratories repaired and equipped with new diagnostic 
and surgical equipment. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for these 
initiatives, but cautions against focusing too narrowly on investments in physical 
infrastructure and medical equipment, as it may lead to an inefficient allocation of funding, 
underutilization of health facilities and neglect of other financing concerns, such as 
compensation for health workers in the penitentiary system.  
</p>
<p>45. The understaffing of medical units in the penitentiary system is a concern in 
Azerbaijan. It negatively impacts the health of prisoners and detainees because it reduces 
the availability and accessibility of health goods and services. It further indicates that the 
penitentiary health system does not provide the same quality and standard of health care as 
is provided to the general population, as required under the right to health. Understaffing in 
prisons is due in large part to the insufficient compensation and incentive structure 
available for health workers. The recruitment and retention of qualified personnel is made 
more difficult by the fact that many prisons and detention centres are located in remote and 
difficult-to-access areas. This is compounded by the poor conditions that prevail in the 
penitentiary system generally. The Special Rapporteur advises the Government to increase 
salaries for health workers in the penitentiary system and to develop incentive structures, 
including education subsidies and paid living expenses, to encourage qualified personnel to 
enter into the field. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Mental health care  
</b></p>
<p>46. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
recognizes that enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of mental health is central to 
realization of the right to health. The 1991 Principles for the Protection of Persons with 
Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care reiterate that all persons, 
including persons serving sentences of imprisonment, have the right to the best available 
mental health care and that there shall be no discrimination on the grounds of mental illness

<p>(principle 20). States should therefore ensure equal and timely access to appropriate mental-
health treatment and care for prisoners and detainees.74  
</p>
<p>47. WHO has reported that mental disorders and suicide are highly prevalent in prisons 
and multiple factors associated with imprisonment are harmful to the mental health of 
prisoners.75 Mental health care in prisons in Azerbaijan, however, is virtually non-existent. 
When prisoners require mental health care, they must be transferred to external facilities or 
obtain care through the Ministry of Health. On two separate occasions during the mission, 
high-level prison administrators informed the Special Rapporteur that mental health was not 
a concern in prisons because inmates in their facilities do not suffer from mental illness. 
Moreover, during a visit to a prison, the Special Rapporteur was informed that mental-
health workers were employed only as part-time staff. 
</p>
<p>48. Many factors contribute to the heightened need for mental health care in prisons: the 
tendency to incarcerate people with mental disorders based on a misconception that they are 
a danger to the public; the failure of treatment and rehabilitation or the lack of mental 
health care outside of prisons; and conditions within the prison environment, including 
experiences of violence and lack of meaningful activity, that negatively affect mental 
health.76 The lack of qualified mental-health-care professionals in prisons leads to mental 
illnesses remaining undiagnosed and untreated. This reduces the likelihood that prisoners 
suffering from mental illness will be successfully integrated into the prison population and 
reintegrated into the community after their release. 
</p>
<p>49. The Ministry of Health allocates only 3 per cent of its budget to mental health, of 
which 85 per cent is allocated to mental-health hospitals.77 This leaves very little funding 
for mental health in the penitentiary system. Moreover, there is no governing authority on 
mental health in Azerbaijan, which leads to a lack of coordination and oversight of the 
provision of mental-health care in the country.78 However, non-governmental organizations 
have recently been contracted to provide psychological consultations as part of a pilot 
programme in the main prison in Baku. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
scale up such activities and develop a comprehensive mental-health strategy to enhance its 
understanding of and capacity to respond to the mental-health needs of prisoners in 
Azerbaijan. Such a strategy should involve close cooperation with community-based 
organizations to ensure continuity of treatment and facilitate the reintegration of prisoners 
into the community after their release. 
</p>
<p><b> B. External health facilities 
</b></p>
<p>50. The lack of mental health services in prisons is demonstrative of a more systemic 
problem within the penitentiary system: the acute need for improved access to specialized 
treatment for prisoners. The Special Rapporteur learned during his visit that prisoners often 
face difficulties in obtaining transfers to external health facilities in order to receive 
specialized treatment, even though the law in Azerbaijan requires such transfers under 
many circumstances. In some instances, prisoners in need of specialized treatment must

transportation and accommodation.  
</p>
<p>51. Prisoners and detainees are especially vulnerable due to their complete reliance on 
the State for food, shelter and access to health goods and services. The right to health 
requires States to ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-
discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable groups.79 General comment No. 2 (2007) of 
the Committee against Torture on implementation of article 2 by States parties also declares 
the right of all persons deprived of their liberty to promptly receive independent medical 
assistance (para. 13). The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to guarantee 
compliance with existing laws and policies in order to ensure that prisoners and detainees in 
need of specialized treatment unavailable in prison health facilities receive such treatment 
in external facilities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Hygiene and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>52. In spite of investments in physical infrastructure, poor sanitation and unhygienic 
conditions in prisons generally, and in prison health facilities in particular, remain key areas 
of concern in Azerbaijan. The obligation to fulfil the right to health requires States to 
ensure access to the underlying determinants of health, such as food and nutrition, safe 
water and adequate sanitation and living conditions.80 Prisoners and detainees are at 
particular risk in this regard because they lack control over their environment and must rely 
exclusively on the State to ensure access to underlying determinants of health. The 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners recognize the importance of good 
hygiene and sanitation in prisons and directs health workers to regularly inspect and advise 
prison officials upon the hygiene, cleanliness and sanitation of the institution (para. 26 (1)). 
Poor sanitation and hygiene, particularly in the light of overcrowding, negatively impacts 
the health of prisoners and detainees, contributing to the spread of communicable and 
infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Clean water supply, effective sewage and 
waste disposal, hygienic food preparation and general hygiene practices are all essential to 
a clean, healthy prison environment and to preventing and controlling the spread of disease.  
</p>
<p>53. During visits to a number of prisons, the Special Rapporteur observed that health 
facilities lacked basic provisions for hygiene and sanitation. Many prison latrines, including 
those in medical units, were unclean and in a state of disrepair, with soaps or disinfectants 
often absent. Poor cleanliness in prison dormitories and common areas was observed along 
with inadequately ventilated medical units and living spaces. Appropriate and clearly 
marked waste disposal protocols, including those for medical waste, were not observed in 
some prisons and prison health facilities. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to develop and implement comprehensive plans to ensure and monitor hygiene 
and sanitation in prisons. This should include regular inspections undertaken in a 
transparent way by appropriately trained personnel. Prison health workers should be 
utilized in this regard to inform and advise prison management on matters of hygiene and 
sanitation.81 In addition, prisoners and detainees should have access to education and basic 
information on hygiene and sanitation and be encouraged to report on such matters, as they 
are best situated to monitor and report on their own living conditions.

<p><b> D. Drug use and treatment  
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur learned during meetings with Government officials that 35 
per cent of prisoners in Azerbaijan are incarcerated on drug-related charges. Treatment 
services are available for some, but a comprehensive treatment programme has not been 
implemented. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that in one prison in Baku a 
needle exchange pilot programme for injecting drug users had been developed. The 
programme, however, had not yet been implemented at the time of his visit. The Special 
Rapporteur was also encouraged to learn during the visit that a draft law on HIV prevention 
and harm-reduction in prisons was in circulation. Harm-reduction interventions, including 
needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy or maintenance 
programmes, aim to reduce the adverse health, social and economic harms associated with 
the use of psychoactive drugs.82 WHO acknowledges the strength of evidence in favour of 
opioid substitution therapy in reducing drug use, criminal activity, HIV risk behaviours and 
transmission, as well as overall mortality.83 The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to make harm-reduction services, such as needle and syringe programmes and 
opioid substitution therapy, available within the penitentiary system. 
</p>
<p>55. According to the national legislation, a court may order, on the basis of a report from 
an expert on drugs, compulsory treatment for a person who is found guilty of a crime and 
requires treatment for drug dependence. Such treatment is imposed in addition to penal 
sentence, rather than as an alternative to imprisonment, and is provided in a specialized 
medical institution in prison.84 According to the 2000 Penal Code, if drug dependency is 
discovered during imprisonment, the penitentiary institution may seek a court order for 
compulsory treatment.  
</p>
<p>56. As there is no specific regulation on voluntary drug dependence treatment in prisons, 
all drug dependence treatment in prisons appears to be carried out on a compulsory basis.85 
Moreover, internal regulations provide for the possibility of compulsory drug testing of 
prisoners.86 According to the Medical Department of the penitentiary system, 2,865 
prisoners were registered as receiving compulsory treatment for drug dependency in 2010.87 
The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the right to health includes the right to be free from 
non-consensual medical treatment and requires the informed consent of all who possess 
legal capacity be obtained prior to the administration of medical treatment.88 In addition, he 
notes that while drug dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder that involves psychosocial 
and biological factors, including altered brain function,89 drug use alone, by contrast, is not 
a medical condition and may not require treatment at all. The Special Rapporteur calls on
