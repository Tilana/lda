<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, submitted to the Human Rights Council in accordance with 
Council resolution 13/4, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food addresses the links 
between health and malnutrition. In the report, he shows why undernutrition, micronutrient 
deficiency and overnutrition are different dimensions of malnutrition that must be 
addressed together through a life-course approach. Existing food systems have failed to 
address hunger, and at the same time encourage diets that are a source of overweight and 
obesity that cause even more deaths worldwide than does underweight. A transition 
towards sustainable diets will succeed only by supporting diverse farming systems that 
ensure that adequate diets are accessible to all, that simultaneously support the livelihoods 
of poor farmers and that are ecologically sustainable. Women, the principal caregivers of 
young children, must be enabled to make informed and autonomous decisions about food 
and feeding so that young children can enjoy the right to a level of nutrition that supports 
adequate growth, health and development. The adoption of a human rights framework can 
serve to ensure that short-term answers do not preclude the chances of identifying long-
term solutions.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The right to food cannot be reduced to a right not to starve. It is an inclusive right to 
an adequate diet providing all the nutritional elements an individual requires to live a 
healthy and active life, and the means to access them. States have a duty to protect the right 
to an adequate diet, in particular by regulating the food system, and to fulfil the right to 
adequate food by proactively strengthening people&#8216;s access to resources, allowing them to 
have adequate diets.1 Consistent with this requirement, the Voluntary Guidelines to Support 
the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food 
Security (Right to Food Guidelines) recommend that States ensure that changes in the 
availability of and accessibility to food supply do not negatively affect dietary composition 
and intake, and that States support dietary diversity and healthy eating patterns, including 
breastfeeding.2 Agrifood companies also have a responsibility to respect the right to 
adequate food. They must avoid infringing upon this right, and seek to prevent any adverse 
impact their activities might have on the enjoyment of this right.3 And the United Nations 
system itself must ensure that nutrition is taken into account in all relevant policy areas.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur clarifies the content of these 
obligations, and explores the implications of the adequacy element of the right to food for 
agricultural policies and for the reshaping of the food systems. Nutrition, of course, is not 
only about access to food at the household level. It is also intimately linked to the health 
status of each individual within the family, power relationships within the household, and 
education about nutrition. The focus here, however, will be on one set of determinants of 
nutritional outcomes that are related to food production, transformation, marketing, retail 
and consumption&#8212;to agrifood systems, broadly conceived. This is only one part of the 
broader issue of nutrition, but it is a crucial part, and one that currently is undergoing deep 
transformations.  
</p>
<p>3. The report was prepared through a range of expert meetings and consultations. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to express his gratitude to the World Health Organization 
(WHO) as well as to the participants in the expert meeting convened in Geneva on 9 May 
2011 and in the seminar convened on 20 May 2011 by the Gender and Nutrition 
Department of the University of Hohenheim. He also held meetings with the Standing 
Committee on Nutrition secretariat, with representatives of the Global Alliance on 
Improved Nutrition, including the chair of its board, and received regular updates on the 
Scaling Up Nutrition initiative, including by taking part in the High-Level Meeting on 
Nutrition in New York on 20 September 2011. He received briefs from various 
stakeholders and scientists from all regions, including the Harvard Law and International 
Development Society and Oxford Pro Bono Publico. What follows are his main conclusions 
as to how food systems can be made to ensure the right to an adequate diet for each 
individual.

<p><b> II. The triple challenge  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The role of agrifood systems: from increasing production to ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable diets 
</b></p>
<p>4. Since the 1960s, food security has been linked largely to production, while the links to 
nutrition were often neglected. Hunger and malnutrition were equated with a lack of calorie 
intake. In the face of widespread global hunger, this focus was perhaps understandable. But 
this prompted an overemphasis on increasing agricultural outputs and lowering food prices, 
while scant attention was paid to ensuring the availability of and accessibility to a wide range 
of diverse foods containing the micronutrients necessary for the full physical and mental 
development of children, and for adults to lead healthy and productive lives. In other words, 
because addressing protein-calorie malnutrition was seen as the major challenge, the 
requirement of dietary adequacy was neglected. In addition, beyond making foodstuffs 
available at low prices, the other functions of agriculture&#8212;to ensure decent incomes to food 
producers and to maintain the ecosystems&#8212;were not considered.  
</p>
<p>5. This is changing. Experts now agree that food systems must ensure the access of all to 
&#8213;sustainable diets&#8214;, defined as &#8213;diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to 
food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable 
diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, 
accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while 
optimizing natural and human resources&#8214;.4 This definition recognizes the need to gear 
agrifood systems away from an exclusive focus on boosting production and towards 
integrating the requirements of the adequacy of diets, social equity and environmental 
sustainability. All these components are essential to achieving durable success in combating 
hunger and malnutrition, as emphasized by the Special Rapporteur in past reports.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency 
</b></p>
<p>6. The world is now paying a high price for having focused almost exclusively on 
increasing production over the past half-century. Undernutrition remains considerable, 
largely because agrifood systems have not contributed to the alleviation of rural poverty. 
One in seven people on a global level are still hungry. About 34 per cent of children in 
developing countries, 186 million children in total, have a low height for age, the most 
common symptom of chronic undernutrition.5 Although the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Food Price Index, adjusted for inflation, 
indicates that food costs declined from the early 1960s until 2002 (apart from a peak in 
1973&#8211;1974), the poorest are still too poor to feed themselves in dignity because agriculture 
has not been designed to support the livelihoods of the most vulnerable and marginalized 
groups.  
</p>
<p>7. Additionally, a large number of people (with children and women being affected 
disproportionately) suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. Vitamin A deficiency affects at 
least 100 million children, limiting their growth, weakening their immunity and, in cases of 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Definition adopted by consensus by the participants in the International Scientific Symposium on 
</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Sustainable Diets, held from 3 to 5 November 2010 in Rome. See the final report of 
the Symposium, p. ix, available from www.fao.org/ag/humannutrition/29186-
021e012ff2db1b0eb6f6228e1d98c806a.pdf. 
</p>

<p>acute deficiency, leading to blindness and to increased mortality. Between four billion and 
five billion people suffer from iron deficiency, including half of the pregnant women and 
children under 5 in developing countries, and an estimated two billion are anaemic. Iron 
deficiency impairs growth, cognitive development and immune function, and it leads 
children to perform less well in school and adults to be less productive. Iodine and zinc 
deficiencies also have adverse impacts on health and reduce the chances of child survival. 
About 30 per cent of households in the developing world do not consume iodized salt, and 
children born to highly iodine-deficient mothers are likely to experience learning 
disabilities or cretinism. Finally, lack of certain vitamins and minerals may also affect 
physical and mental development and the immune system.<footnote name="6">4 In the United States, a pilot study funded under the 2008 Food, Conservation, and Energy Act (&#8213;Farm 
Bill&#8214;) showed that a 10 per cent reduction in the price of fruits and vegetables would increase 
purchases by 7.0 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively. </footnote>  
</p>
<p>8. Like undernutrition, micronutrient deficiency or &#8213;hidden hunger&#8214; is a violation of a 
child&#8216;s right to a standard of living adequate for the child&#8216;s physical and mental 
</p>
<p>development, and to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, recognized 
under article 6, paragraph 2, and article 24, paragraph 2 (c), of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. The environment, not genetics, explains differences in child 
development between regions. The WHO Child Growth Standards demonstrate that infants 
and children from geographically diverse regions of the world experience very similar 
growth patterns when their health and nutrition needs are met, so that all children have in 
principle the same development potential.<footnote name="7">8 Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly (footnote 22 above), paras. 
61-62 (defining the role of WHO in the establishment of a comprehensive global monitoring 
framework). </footnote> States, therefore, have a duty to support 
exclusive breastfeeding for six months and continued breastfeeding, combined with 
adequate complementary foods, until the second birthday of the child; and to establish food 
systems that can ensure each individual&#8216;s access not only to sufficient caloric intake, but 
also to sufficiently diverse diets, providing the full range of micronutrients required.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Overweight and obesity 
</b></p>
<p>9. An additional nutritional challenge concerns people whose caloric intakes exceed their 
needs. Today, more than one billion people worldwide are overweight (with a bodily mass 
index (BMI) &gt;25) and at least 300 million are obese (BMI &gt;30). Overweight and obesity 
cause, worldwide, 2.8 million deaths, so that today 65 per cent of the world&#8216;s population live 
in a country (all high-income countries and most middle-income countries) where overweight 
and obesity kills more people than underweight.8 In a country such as the United States of 
America, this means that today&#8216;s children could have shorter life expectancies than their 
parents.9 But obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) linked, in particular, to 
unhealthy diets are no longer limited to rich countries (see figures 1 and 2). It is estimated that 
by 2030, 5.1 million people will die annually before the age of 60 from such diseases in poor 
countries, up from 3.8 million today.10 Obesity and overweight affect 50 per cent or more of 
the population in 19 of the 34 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) countries,11 but they have become public health challenges in all regions (see figure 
2). Death and disease from NCDs now outstrip communicable diseases in every region except 
Africa, and it is expected that NCD deaths will increase globally by 15 per cent between 2010

<p>and 2020&#8212;and by over 20 per cent in Africa, South-East Asia and the Eastern 
Mediterranean.12 Moreover, NCDs are more rapidly fatal in poorer countries. In both South-
East Asia and Africa, 41 per cent of deaths caused by high BMI occur under age 60, 
compared with 18 per cent in high-income countries.13 For society, the costs are huge, directly 
in medical care and indirectly in lost productivity.14 An important time lag exists between the 
onset of obesity and the increase in health-care costs, but it has been estimated for instance 
that the costs linked to overweight and obesity in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland in 2015 could increase by as much as 70 per cent relative to 2007 and could 
be 2.4 times higher in 2025.15 In countries such as India or China, the impact of obesity and 
diabetes is predicted to surge in the next few years.16 On average, a 10 per cent increase in 
NCDs results in a loss of 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).17

<p>10. The health impacts of bad diets are well known.18 Diets rich in salt and alcohol, 
combined with a lack of exercise,19 often result in higher blood pressure, which in turn 
increases the risks of stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. About 51 per cent of strokes 
worldwide and 45 per cent of ischaemic heart diseases are attributable to high blood 
pressure, which affects particularly middle-income European and African countries. Diets 
high in saturated fats and physical inactivity can increase cholesterol levels, also a risk 
factor for cardiovascular diseases and responsible for 2.6 million deaths each year.20 
Changed diets and lack of physical exercise may cause resistance to insulin or otherwise 
increase blood glucose, which is responsible for 6 per cent of deaths globally, as this 
exposes the individuals affected to diabetes, heart disease or stroke. A predisposition to 
diabetes could be caused by infant formulas that are much higher in advanced glycation end 
than milk.21 Finally, unhealthy diets increase the risks of cancers of the breast, colon, 
prostate and other organs. Low intake of fruits and vegetables, for instance, increases the 
risks not only of cardiovascular diseases, but also that of gastrointestinal cancers.

 19 In the present report the Special Rapporteur will not discuss the lack of physical exercise resulting 
</p>
<p>from urbanization and changes in modes of transport, an important risk factor that operates in 
combination with energy-rich diets to cause NCDs. It is estimated to cause around 21&#8211;25 per cent of 
breast and colon cancer, 27 per cent of diabetes and about 30 per cent of ischaemic heart disease 
burdens.

<p>11. The fight against NCDs is underfunded, in part, because it was not included in the 
Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000. Less than 3 per cent of development 
assistance for health goes to combating NCDs, even though they cause more than one third 
of all premature deaths.22 The poorest segments of the population are affected 
disproportionately.23 Poor families may be unable to afford the increased health-care 
expenditures that result from NCDs. Annually, 100 million people are pushed into poverty 
because they cannot afford the necessary health services.24 In India for example, treatment 
for diabetes costs an affected person on average 15&#8211;25 per cent of household earnings,25 
and cardiovascular disease leads to catastrophic expenditure for 25 per cent of Indian 
families and drives 10 per cent of families into poverty.26 Furthermore, people who are 
affected may not be able to work, and their family members may have to provide care, 
resulting in lost revenues. Poor families may be less educated, on average, about the risks 
of unhealthy diets, and they lack the resources to improve their diets.

<p>12. The agrifood systems must be reshaped to address these challenges of 
malnutrition&#8212;undernutrition, micronutrient deficiency, and overnutrition&#8212;not in isolation, 
but concurrently. Malnutrition in all its forms cannot be addressed only by a food sciences 
approach, such as through the provision of ready-to-use therapeutic foods or micronutrient-
enriched &#8213;health foods&#8214; to combat micronutrient deficiency or the negative health impacts 
</p>
<p>of foods high in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, sodium and sugar (&#8213;HFSS&#8214; foods). 
Ensuring adequate availability of and accessibility to fruits and vegetables and diets that are 
sufficiently diverse and balanced across food groups requires the rebuilding of agrifood 
systems. This means prioritizing access to adequate diets that are socially and 
environmentally sustainable over the mere provision of cheap calories. Any intervention 
seeking to address the diverse forms of malnutrition described above should be assessed 
against the requirement that it favour, and does not create obstacles to, such a 
reprioritization.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Addressing micronutrient deficiency 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recent nutrition-focused initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>13. A number of recent efforts have sought to address micronutrient deficiency, moving 
beyond the classic focus on low calorie intake. The World Food Programme and the United 
Nations Children&#8216;s Fund (UNICEF) launched in 2006 the Ending Child Hunger and 
Undernutrition Initiative. In 2008, FAO, WHO and UNICEF launched the Renewed Efforts 
against Child Hunger and Undernutrition (REACH) initiative, which aims to scale up 
interventions addressing child undernutrition through the coordinated action of United 
Nations agencies, civil society, donors and the private sector, under country-led plans. The 
Secretary-General&#8216;s 22-member High-Level Task Force on Food Security has now updated 
the Comprehensive Framework for Action so that it explicitly addresses food and nutrition 
security with a focus on links between agriculture, food systems and nutritional outcomes. 
Finally, the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) multi-stakeholder initiative, which was launched in 
2009 and has gained momentum since the presentation of the SUN Framework in April 
2010, seeks to promote targeted action and investment to improve nutrition for mothers and 
children in the 1,000-day period from pregnancy to age 2, when better nutrition can have a 
life-changing impact on a child&#8216;s future.  
</p>
<p>14. In addition to encouraging Governments to adopt national plans to scale up nutrition 
in their various sectoral policies, SUN includes the establishment of partnerships linking 
business, civil society and Government to foster scaling up nutrition through nutrition-
sensitive interventions along the value chain at the country level. Private-sector 
interventions include the production of fortified food products, the promotion of 
nutritionally healthy behaviour, the shaping of work environments allowing women to 
ensure good nutrition for themselves and their children, ensuring that lower-income groups 
can access nutritionally valuable products, and building local capacity through the transfer 
of knowledge and technology. Some of these partnerships are supported by the Global 
Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN). A public-private partnership, GAIN was launched 
at the 2002 special session of the General Assembly on children. It has since established  </p>
<p>links with 600 companies across 36 large projects in more than 25 countries to improve  </p>
<p>access to missing micronutrients in diets. According to GAIN promoters, it reaches nearly 
400 million people with nutritionally enhanced food products. </p>


<p><b> B. The challenge of sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>15. Assessments of these various nutrition promotion initiatives and the projects under 
the umbrella of the SUN initiative fall outside the scope of the present report. The 
increasing international profile of nutrition should be welcomed. It is positive too that SUN 
acknowledges the need for efforts to scale up nutrition to be driven by national authorities 
with a cross-sectoral approach, and that it brings together commitment and support from 
developing country Governments, donors, civil society, development agencies and the 
private sector. In providing assistance however, these actors must not overlook the 
entitlements that have been established under international law for women, children, 
minorities, refugees and internally displaced persons, and other groups that may be 
subjected to marginalization and discrimination. The Special Rapporteur, while welcoming 
the progress made through SUN, calls for an explicit alignment of its initiatives with human 
rights, including the right to food. A number of observations should be made in this regard. 
</p>
<p>16. First, it is troubling that the 1981 International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk 
Substitutes27 and subsequent World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions remain under-
enforced, despite the wide recognition that exclusive breastfeeding for the six first months 
and continued breastfeeding, combined with safe and adequate complementary foods, up to 
2 years old or beyond is the optimal way of feeding infants, and reduces the risk of obesity 
and NCDs later in life.28 Countries committed to scaling up nutrition should begin by 
regulating the marketing of commercial infant formula and other breast-milk substitutes, in 
accordance with WHA resolution 63.23, and by implementing the full set of WHO 
recommendations on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes and of foods and non-
alcoholic beverages to children, in accordance with WHA resolution 63.14. 
</p>
<p>17. Second, the focus on pregnant and lactating women and infants in some recent 
nutrition initiatives, while understandable, should not lessen the need to address the 
nutritional needs of others, including children, women who are not pregnant or lactating, 
adolescents and older persons. The right to adequate food, which includes adequate 
nutrition, is a universal right guaranteed to all. This pleads in favour of broad-based 
national strategies for the realization of the right to food that address the full range of 
factors causing malnutrition, rather than narrowly focused initiatives that address the 
specific needs of a child&#8216;s development between conception and the second birthday.   
</p>
<p>18. Third, interventions aimed at improving nutrition and targeting pregnant or lactating 
women and children under 2 years old, while vital, do not substitute for addressing the 
structural causes of undernutrition or inadequate diets. The Special Rapporteur noted 
previously that chief among these structural causes are inequitable food systems that are not 
sufficiently inclusive of the poorest, small-scale farmers and that do not reduce rural 
poverty;29 and the priority given to monocropping of certain staples over more diverse 
farming systems that would help to ensure more adequate diets.30 The violations of 
women&#8216;s rights, gender inequality and the lack of women&#8216;s empowerment are another 
major factor explaining poor nutritional outcomes. Improving women&#8216;s access to 
productive resources,31 allowing women to make decisions regarding the household

output by 2.5-4 per cent, thus reducing poverty and hunger (p. vi). </p>


<p>budget32 and protecting women from pressure, including economic pressure, to renounce 
optimal breastfeeding practices would contribute significantly to positive nutritional 
outcomes.  
</p>
<p>19. The efforts on these fronts must continue. Nutrition interventions should be but one 
part of broader-based strategies for the realization of the right to adequate food. For 
example, the provision of fortified foods (enriched to improve nutritional content) may be 
necessary, where local production is insufficiently diversified and incapable of supplying 
the full range of foods required for adequate diets. Rebuilding and strengthening local food 
systems through diversified farming systems to ensure the availability of and accessibility 
to adequate diets will be more sustainable in the long term. Food systems based on local 
knowledge and conditions, such as homestead or community gardens, can be a cost-
effective way to combat micronutrient deficiency, as demonstrated by examples in 
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, the Niger and South Africa;33 such alternative food systems 
present the additional advantage of increasing local incomes and resilience to price shocks, 
another pathway through which positive nutritional outcomes can be achieved.  
</p>
<p>20. Fourth, potential concerns exist regarding the relationship between solutions that 
rely on imported technologies and products and the local contexts in which these solutions 
are applied. Technology has a key role to play in improved nutrition. For instance, the 
iodization of salt is a cost-effective way to reduce iodine deficiency. Biofortification&#8212;the 
improvement at crop level of the micronutrient content of staples&#8212;can provide important 
benefits for rural populations, improving their access to micronutrient-rich foods produced 
locally at more affordable prices, as illustrated by the adoption of the orange-fleshed sweet 
potato in Mozambique that reduced vitamin A deficiency significantly.34 But such 
technologies could result in long-term dependency for the communities concerned if 
protected by intellectual property rights. Moreover, opportunities and market access for 
local farmers could be reduced if they result in the creation of new markets that are 
captured by the economic actors introducing such technologies.  
</p>
<p>21. The discussion surrounding the contributions made by GAIN provides an 
illustration. One reason companies partner with GAIN is to reach the &#8213;bottom of the 
</p>
<p>pyramid,&#8214; i.e., potential customers who are too poor to constitute a solvent market in the 
short term. GAIN-supported initiatives, however, should not bar the emergence of 
sustainable and equitable solutions in which people are served by local producers. Some 
GAIN projects do build the capacity of local partners and can continue in the long term 
without external support. But any such interventions should include a clear exit strategy to 
empower communities to feed themselves. In this regard, donors should make their support 
to GAIN conditional upon such a requirement of subsidiarity and upon the adoption of a

<p>clear exit strategy. In particular, as noted in the proposal for a draft code of conduct for 
sustainable diets, &#8213;when ecosystems are able to support sustainable diets, nutrition 
programmes, policies and interventions supporting the use of supplements, RUTF [ready-
to-use therapeutic foods], fortificants, and infant formulas are inappropriate and can lead to 
malnutrition, and ... the marketing of these food substitutes and related products can 
contribute to major public health problems&#8214;.35 
</p>
<p><b> C. The added value of a human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>22. The above-mentioned nutrition initiatives can be strengthened by adopting a human-
rights based approach (accountability, participation and non-discrimination) and by being 
integrated into broader national strategies for the realization of the right to food. Such an 
approach will increase effectiveness and the ability to contribute to sustainable, long-term 
solutions.  
</p>
<p>23. <i>Accountability</i> requires that, once commitments are made and targets set, progress is 
monitored, including progress in the delivery of resources, and a failure to achieve results 
will lead to redefine the means chosen. It is therefore essential that indicators be built to 
measure inputs, outcomes, and processes, and that corrective action be taken where the 
resources committed are not made available or when the results do not meet the 
expectations.36 
</p>
<p>24. The requirement of <i>participation</i>, consistent with guideline 10.3 of the Right to 
Food Guidelines, ensures that local agricultural and nutrition contexts be considered. It also 
means that solutions will be demand-driven, that local partners will be identified, and that 
country-led action will not be equated with government-led action. It also allows 
identifying alternative solutions based on local knowledge and conditions, such as 
homestead or community gardens. Participation requires that beneficiaries take part in the 
process of evaluation, and co-design the solutions that could benefit them most. This is not 
only empowering, but also enhances the effectiveness of interventions because it builds a 
feedback loop to facilitate ongoing learning and improvement of policies. 
</p>
<p>25. The requirement of <i>non-discrimination</i> ensures that interventions are targeted, with a 
focus on the most vulnerable and marginalized groups, and that they are gender sensitive. 
Finally, the adoption of <i>national strategies for the realization of the right to food </i>by 
Governments through participatory means should ensure that the needs of all groups are 
identified, including those of pregnant and lactating women and infants, and actions 
planned to address those needs. Such strategies should also link efforts to improve nutrition 
during early childhood with later life, adopting a life-course perspective as recommended 
by WHO,37 in order to take into account, for instance, that in contrast to breastfeeding, 
formula feeding may be a cause of obesity; they should facilitate inter-departmental 
coordination, recognizing that the right to adequate diets requires a collaborative effort

necessary conditions both for private investment and for a continued effort of government. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Addressing overweight and obesity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The role of agrifood systems 
</b></p>
<p>26. In section II, the Special Rapporteur described the considerable growth of non-
communicable diseases and preventable deaths in all regions. A wide range of factors 
explain this evolution. They include tobacco and alcohol use, reduced physical activity 
linked to urbanization and thus more sedentary lifestyles, and inadequate diets. These 
avoidable deaths are often attributed to &#8213;lifestyle choices&#8214;&#8212;choices to exercise less, 
choices to consume more salt, sugars and fats. But the problem is a systemic one. We have 
created obesogenic environments and developed food systems that often work against, 
rather than facilitate, making healthier choices.38 The transformation of agrifood systems 
plays a major part in this trend.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Agricultural policies 
</b></p>
<p>27. Agricultural production has risen dramatically over the past 40 years, the combined 
result of crop breeding, intensive fertilizer use, the mechanization of production on large 
plantations in new cultivated areas and, in countries that could afford it, subsidies 
supporting farmers and intense research and development efforts. But there was an 
imbalance in this development. Some basic cereals and soybean were promoted, and the 
subsidies they benefited from were partly responsible for overproduction and 
overconsumption.39 In comparison, too little was done to improve the availability and 
affordability of pulses such as lentils or pigeon peas, or of fruits and vegetables, for 
instance by reducing post-harvest losses and improving marketing through better transport 
infrastructure connecting farmers to consumers.  
</p>
<p>28. What was the result? Between 1961 and 2009, while fruit and vegetable production 
increased 332 per cent, world oilseed production increased by 610 per cent and meat 
production increased 372 per cent.40 This was associated with shifting diets. Over roughly 
the same period (1963&#8211;2003), developing countries increased the amount of calories they 
consumed from meat (119 per cent), sugar (127 per cent) and vegetable oils (199 per cent), 
and industrialized countries also increased vegetable oil consumption (105 per cent). 
Globally, diets became increasingly energy-dense and rich in sugar, salt and saturated fats, 
as many higher fibre foods were replaced by heavily processed foods.41  
</p>
<p>29. Agricultural policies led to these shifts in diets through two channels. First, maize 
and soybean have become a conveniently cheap input for the food processing and livestock 
industries. Most of the world&#8216;s soybean is processed into meal to feed animals and into 
vegetable oil. Increasingly larger quantities of cereals (primarily maize) are used to produce

<p>sweeteners derived from starch (high-fructose corn syrup), largely explaining the global 
increase in caloric sweetener consumed. In 2000, 306 kcal were consumed per person per 
day, about a third more than in 1962, and caloric sweeteners by then also accounted for a 
larger share of both total energy and total carbohydrates consumed.42 Because the prices of 
basic crops went through such a significant decline, the agrifood industry responded by 
&#8213;adding value&#8214; by heavily processing foods, leading to diets richer in saturated and trans-
fatty acids, salt, and sugars. This, combined with urbanization and higher employment rates 
for women, precipitated the rapid expansion for processed foods, both domestically and 
through exports dumped on foreign markets.  
</p>
<p>30. Another impact on diets was through the price channel, by changing the relative 
prices of foods in the consumer&#8216;s basket. In high-income countries, healthy diets including 
a wide range of fruits and vegetables are more expensive than diets rich in oils, sugars and 
fats.43 While this may not be <i>the</i> reason why overweight and obesity have been increasing 
over the years, it is certainly <i>one </i>factor among others responsible for this situation. And it 
leads to important socio-economic disparities in quality diets. Scientists show a strong 
correlation between low-education and -income levels and higher rates of obesity, type II 
diabetes and coronary heart disease.44  
</p>
<p>31. This should not be allowed to stand. Any society where a healthy diet is more 
expensive than an unhealthy diet is a society that must mend its price system. This is even 
more imperative where the poorest are too poor to feed themselves in a manner not 
detrimental to their health.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The globalization of food chains 
</b></p>
<p>32. The globalization of food supply chains affects nutrition in two ways. First, the 
general pattern has been for developing countries to export high-quality foods, tropical 
fruits and vegetables in particular, to rich countries, while importing refined grains. This 
means that while increased trade may have lowered the price of macronutrients in low-
income countries (although with a greater vulnerability to price shocks), the reverse has 
been true for micronutrient-rich products, leading poor families in developing countries to 
shift to monotonous, micronutrient-poor diets, relying mainly on starchy staples, as more 
diverse diets may become unaffordable or less affordable than diets comprised of staples.45 
Nutrition may thus be affected by this &#8213;price effect,&#8214; resulting from the shift in the relative 
</p>
<p>prices of food commodities. 
</p>
<p>33. Second, the globalization of food chains leads to a shift from diets high in complex 
carbohydrates and fibre to diets with a higher proportion of fats and sugars. As a result of this 
&#8213;nutrition transition,&#8214; disease patterns shift away from infectious and nutrient-deficiency 
diseases toward higher rates of coronary heart disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes, some

<p>types of cancer and obesity.46 This trend is particularly noticeable in emerging economies,47 
and the Special Rapporteur studied the mechanisms at work closely in his missions to 
Brazil,48 China,49 South Africa50 and Mexico.51 Nutrition transition is accelerated by the 
expansion of trade in food commodities and by the acceleration of vertical integration in food 
chains, both of which increase the availability of processed foods.  
</p>
<p>34. While the globalization of food chains has meant that a diversity of foods are 
available year-round to certain consumers, it has had negative impacts on local food 
systems and increased the ecological footprint of food systems. It has also led many 
consumers to shift towards an increased consumption of staple grains, meat and dairy 
products, vegetable oil, salt and sugar, and a lower intake of dietary fibre. For instance, the 
rapid increase in vegetable oil consumption (and thus of fats in diets) can be explained 
largely by the sudden availability of vegetable oil (particularly soybean oil) at low prices on 
the world market.52 Increased foreign direct investment in the processing industry and 
supermarket expansions have made processed foods, including in particular soft drinks, 
accessible to a larger range of consumers (albeit not to the poorest among them). For 
instance, following the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
United States companies massively increased investments in the Mexican food processing 
industry (from $210 million in 1987 to $5.3 billion in 1999) and sales of processed foods in 
Mexico soared at an annual rate of 5 to 10 per cent in the period from 1995 to 2003.53 The 
resulting rise in soft drink and snack consumption by Mexican children is at the source of 
the very high rates of child obesity in the country.  
</p>
<p>35. The impacts of increasingly globalized food chains and the uniformization of diets 
across the globe have disparate impacts across population groups. As a country transitions 
towards higher income levels, the burden of overweight and obesity shifts. The poorest 
segment of the population is at low risk of obesity in poor countries,54 but in upper-middle 
income developing economies (with a gross national product per capita of over about 
US$ 2,500) and in high-income countries, it is the poorest who are most negatively 
affected.55 In high-income countries, while the poor bear a disproportionate burden of

<p>overweight or obesity, women are particularly at risk because their incomes are on average 
lower than those of men, and because men in the low-income group often are employed on 
tasks that are physically demanding and require large expenses of energy. Overweight or 
obese women tend to give birth to children who themselves tend to be overweight or obese, 
resulting in lower productivity and discrimination. Thus, socio-economic disadvantage is 
perpetuated across generations by the channel of overweight or obesity.56

<p><b> 3. Marketing of foods and beverages 
</b></p>
<p>36. Significant concerns are expressed today about the marketing practices of the 
agrifood industry, particularly as regards marketing to children. The range of practices is 
wide: they include television advertising, product placement, promotional partnerships, 
sales promotions, and direct marketing in schools, among others. Most advertisements 
promote unhealthy foods, high in total energy, sugars and fats, and low in nutrients. A 
recent study covering television advertising in Australia, Asia, Western Europe, and North 
and South America, found that in all sampled countries, children were exposed to high 
volumes of television advertising for unhealthy foods, featuring child-oriented persuasive 
techniques, leading the authors to call for regulation of food advertising during children&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>peak viewing times.57 The ability of these marketing practices to change consumer 
behaviour is remarkable in developing countries, in part because brands of North-based 
global companies carry positive connotations.58  
</p>
<p><b> B. Reshaping agrifood systems 
</b></p>
<p>37. Governments have become aware of the adverse impacts of the spread of non-
communicable diseases, caused by suboptimal breastfeeding and young child feeding and 
unhealthy diets, and they recognize the urgent need to take action. In 2002 and 2004, 
respectively, WHA adopted the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding and 
the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. The latter recommends, inter 
alia, reducing energy intake from total fats, shifting fat consumption away from saturated 
fats to unsaturated fats, and eliminating trans-fatty acids; increasing the consumption of 
fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts; limiting the intake of free sugars; 
limiting salt consumption and ensuring that all salt is iodized.59 States are encouraged to 
adopt a national strategy on diets and physical activity; to provide accurate and balanced 
information to consumers; to align food and agricultural policies with the requirements of 
public health; and to use school policies and programmes to encourage healthy diets. Infant 
food manufacturers are expected to comply with provisions of the International Code of 
Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent relevant WHA resolutions and 
manufacture their products according to Codex Alimentarius standards. The agrifood 
industry is expected to reduce the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods and portion 
sizes, to increase nutritious and healthy choices, and to review their marketing practices. 
More recently, in 2011, Governments pledged to promote, protect and support 
breastfeeding and strengthen the implementation of the International Code and to &#8213;reduce 
the impact of the common non-communicable disease risk factors,&#8214; including unhealthy

<p>legislative, regulatory and fiscal measures.&#8214;60  
</p>
<p>38. These advances remain short of what the situation requires. The emphasis remains 
largely on demand-side measures, focused on consumers&#8216; choices, rather than on the supply 
side: the range of foods made available to consumers and the prices of different types of 
food. And commitments remain voluntary. States should protect the right to adequate food 
by adopting measures that reduce the negative impacts on public health of the existing food 
systems. Moreover, States should discharge their duty to fulfil the right to adequate food by 
taking immediate measures to progressively make a transition to more sustainable diets.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Protecting and promoting adequate diets 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Using taxation to encourage healthy diets 
</i></p>
<p>39. The WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health refers to the need 
to rethink fiscal and agricultural policies to align them with public health concerns (paras. 
41 (2) and (4)). The introduction of food taxes and subsidies to promote a healthy diet 
constitutes a cost-effective and low-cost population-wide intervention that can have a 
significant impact (A/66/83, para. 42). As acknowledged by the recent introduction of such 
taxes in Denmark, Finland, France and Hungary,61 the taxation of HFSS foods and 
beverages can be an effective tool. Price is an important determining factor in consumption 
levels, and demand elasticity is especially high for snacks and drinks consumed outside the 
home. Research shows that a 10 per cent tax on soft drinks, which have considerable 
negative health impacts,62 could lead to an 8 to 10 per cent reduction in purchases of these 
beverages.63 The standard concern raised when such taxes are discussed is that they could 
penalize the poorest segment of the population, who spend proportionally more of their 
incomes on food and often are pushed into adopting unhealthy diets. But that concern can 
be met by using the public revenue from the tax to make healthy foods more affordable, for 
it is relative prices that must change. The poor are penalized for being poor, both because 
HFSS foods and soft drinks are cheap and because healthy diets are expensive.64

 60 Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly (footnote 22 above), para. 43. 
 61 In Denmark, Law No. 247 of 30 March 2011 (Fat duty law) imposed, starting 1 October 2011, a new 
</p>
<p>duty on saturated fat in a range of foods, based on evidence that the substitution of saturated fat by 
polyunsaturated fatty acids reduces the risks of cardiovascular diseases (A. Astrup and others, &#8213;The 
role of reducing intakes of saturated fat in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: where does the 
evidence stand in 2010?&#8214;, <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i>, vol. 93, No. 4 (2011), pp. 684-
688). In Hungary, since 1 September 2011 a levy has been imposed on products containing &#8213;too 
much&#8214; salt, sugar, or fat &#8211; &#8213;junk food,&#8214; in effect &#8211; while taxes on soft drinks have increased by 10 per 
cent; the revenues shall contribute to meeting the costs of health care.

</p>

<p><i> (b) Revising the existing system of subsidies 
</i></p>
<p>40. Where subsidies are an agricultural policy instrument, they are often biased in 
favour of large grain and soybean producers, or of the livestock industry. The potential 
negative externalities on public health and the environment were never considered in 
shaping those subsidies.65 The existing subsidies must now be re-examined in order to align 
agricultural policies with the requirement of adequate diets.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Regulating marketing practices 
</i></p>
<p>41. States should implement fully in legislation the International Code of Marketing of 
Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent WHA resolutions. But the marketing practices of the 
food industry have impacts such that bolder action is required. Self-regulation by the agrifood 
industry has proven ineffective. As noted by the International Obesity Task Force Working 
Group experts when they developed the Sydney Principles for reducing the commercial 
promotion of foods and beverages to children, industry codes cannot &#8213;substantially reduce the 
large volume and high impact of marketing obesogenic foods and beverages to children&#8214;.66 It 
is one thing to prohibit advertising that &#8213;exploits the credulity of children,&#8214; but quite another 
to control the amount of advertising delivered and the appeal it creates for the products, 
influencing children&#8216;s diets.67 Even the best practices in the area, such as the EU Pledge 
initiated in December 2007 by a number of large agrifood companies, do not go as far as they 
should, namely, to prohibit all advertising that could encourage children to consume more 
HFSS foods.68 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. The General Assembly recognized the problem. It recommended further 
implementation of the WHO set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-
alcoholic beverages to children,69 and that States consider statutory regulation as the most 
effective way to reduce the marketing of HFSS foods to children (see para. 22 and 
recommendation 8 of the WHO recommendations). Indeed, the protection of the human 
right to adequate food requires nothing less. But efforts should not stop there. Children are 
not the only victims of marketing practices that promote HFSS foods and make 
questionable health claims. The power of the agrifood industry to influence diets has been 
well documented,<footnote name="7">9 Ibid., paras. 60-63. </footnote>0 and the public budgets for nutrition education are no match for the 
advertising budgets of fast food and sweet beverage companies.71 The Special Rapporteur 
sees no reason why the promotion of foods that are known to have detrimental health

the US,&#8214; <i>International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity</i>, vol. 1, No. (3) (2004), 
second page. In 2001, the budget of the United States Ministry for Agriculture for nutrition education 
was $333 million; for the same year, McDonald&#8216;s advertising budget was $635 million, Burger 
King&#8216;s $298 million, and advertising for Coke and Diet Coke cost $224 million. </p>


<p>impacts should be allowed to continue unimpeded: these products reduce the life 
expectancy, in particular, of the poorest segment of the population, who are also the least 
nutritionally literate, and to protect children only would be like reducing the WHO 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to its article 16, which deals with sales of 
tobacco products to minors. In addition, an international framework, in the form of an 
international code of conduct regulating marketing food and beverages in support of 
national efforts, might be desirable in order to take into account the international nature of 
commercial promotion of energy-dense, micronutrient-poor food and beverages.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The transition to sustainable diets 
</b></p>
<p>43. While the agrifood industry is encouraged to produce and develop more healthy 
foods, very little is said about the need to develop more healthy food systems that can 
deliver sustainable diets in the holistic sense referred to above. But it is high time to 
recognize the real tension that exists between a strategy that promotes processed foods, 
enriched with nutrients to the point that diets become medicalized, and a strategy that 
promotes local and regional food systems, as well as a shift towards foods that are less 
heavily processed and thus more nutritious.72 For reasons of logistics and seasonality, as 
well as the urbanization of lifestyles, these two strategies must sometimes be combined, as 
not all foods can be sourced locally or bought in farmers&#8216; markets. But priorities must 
nevertheless be set in public policies. The market for food products cannot expand 
infinitely, and choices must be made as to which food system to promote.  
</p>
<p>44. As noted by WHO, local food systems to improve urban consumers&#8216; access to fresh 
and nutritious foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, has a key role to play in making a 
shift towards healthier diets (A/66/83, para. 60). This begins by improving the links 
between local farmers and the urban consumers, although urban and peri-urban agriculture 
can also make a significant contribution. The urban and rural agendas both can gain by 
rebuilding local food systems that provide healthy and sustainable diets at affordable prices 
for consumers. Such diets also can be more easily achieved by shorter supply chains, 
because such chains are not controlled by large retailers or food processing companies and 
do not have to depend on national policies that respond to broader economic interests.73 In 
addition, shorter food chains can improve access to markets and incomes for small-scale 
local farmers, both in low-income and higher-income countries.74 They encourage the 
enhancement of agrobiodiversity because local food crops can expand, rather than being 
crowded out by homogenized commodities for the global markets. And they reduce the 
dependency of food systems on the considerable amounts of energy required for the 
packaging, processing and transport of food. 
</p>
<p>45. This shift can be brought about by adequate infrastructure investments&#8212;roads and 
transport facilities linking local food producers to urban consumers&#8212;and support for 
farmers&#8216; markets, but also by local sourcing of healthy foods for public institutions such as 
schools. In 2003, African Governments endorsed the Home Grown School Feeding 
component of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, and the 
</p>
<p>  
 72 See Lang and Heasman, <i>Food Wars</i>.  
 73 <i>Food, Agriculture and Cities: Challenges of food and nutrition security, agriculture and ecosystem 
</i></p>
<p><i>management in an urbanizing world</i>, FAO Food for the Cities multi-disciplinary initiative position 
paper, 2011, pp. 29 and 41.  
</p>

<p>2005 World Summit listed &#8213;the expansion of local school meal programmes, using home-
grown foods where possible&#8214; as part of the &#8213;quick-impact initiatives&#8214; for the realization of 
the Millennium Development Goals.75 In Brazil, where the National School Feeding 
Program (<i>Programa Nacional de Alimenta&#231;&#227;o Escolar</i>) is a major component of the Zero 
Hunger strategy, municipalities in charge of implementing the programme increasingly take 
into account the need to combat overweight and obesity in their sourcing policies.76 In the 
United States, the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act tasks the Department of Agriculture 
with developing nutritional guidelines for &#8213;all foods provided on each school campus&#8214; 
(sect. 9A (b)(2)). In 2008, WHO presented its School Policy Framework, providing useful 
guidance for the development of nutritional standards for school food. School gardens can 
also serve this objective.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. The role of a human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>46. Premature deaths resulting from non-communicable diseases linked to bad diets are 
deaths that can be avoided, and States have a duty to protect in this regard. By 
implementing the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding and the Global 
Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, as well as the Political Declaration of the 
High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-
communicable Diseases, States are not only making political commitments but also 
discharging their duty under international human rights law to guarantee the right to 
adequate food.  
</p>
<p>47. As such, States should set binding targets in pursuing a double-track approach: (a) 
protecting the right to adequate diets; and (b) ensuring a transition towards more sustainable 
diets. They should ensure accountability, in accordance with the WHO Global Strategy on 
Diet, Physical Activity and Health,77 by establishing independent monitoring mechanisms 
and allowing individual victims or organizations to file claims against any failures to take 
the measures required under the national strategy for the realization of the right to food; this 
is what distinguishes legal obligations from mere policy commitments. Among the 
indicators that should be used to monitor the implementation of national strategies to 
prevent non-communicable diseases,78 WHO should therefore include the existence of a 
binding legal framework, clearly allocating responsibilities, and including sanctions where 
the measures that are pledged are not adopted, and it should include the requirements of 
participation and non-discrimination that form part of an approach based on human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The Special Rapporteur concludes that current food systems are deeply 
dysfunctional. The world is paying an exorbitant price for the failure to consider health 
</b></p>
<p><b>impacts in designing food systems, and a change of course must be taken as a matter of 
</b></p>
<p><b>urgency. In OECD countries in particular, where farm subsidies remain at high levels,

<p><b>for unhealthy lives. Taxpayers pay for misguided subsidies that encourage the agrifood 
</b></p>
<p><b>industry to sell heavily processed foods at the expense of making fruits and vegetables 
</b></p>
<p><b>available at lower prices; they pay for the marketing efforts of the same industry to sell 
</b></p>
<p><b>unhealthy foods, which are deducted from taxable profits; and they pay for health-care 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems for which non-communicable diseases today represent an unsustainable burden. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In developing countries, the main burdens remain undernutrition and micronutrient 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>witnessing a rapid shift to processed foods, which are often imported, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>abandonment by the local population of traditional diets. This shift has reduced the 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities for local farmers to live decently from farming.  
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> Combating the different faces of malnutrition requires adopting a life-course 
approach guaranteeing the right to adequate diets for all, and reforming agricultural

<p><b>and food policies, including taxation, in order to reshape food systems for the

<p>50.<b>  States, in accordance with their obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right 
to adequate food for all, should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  Adopt a national strategy for the realization of the right to adequate food

<p><b>breast-milk substitutes and of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure their effective enforcement; 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>most effective way to reduce marketing of foods high in saturated fats, trans-fatty 
</b></p>
<p><b>acids, sodium and sugar (HFSS foods) to children, as recommended by WHO, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrict marketing of these foods to other groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d)  Impose taxes on soft drinks (sodas), and on HFSS foods, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsidize access to fruits and vegetables and educational campaigns on healthy diets; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e)  Review the existing systems of agricultural subsidies, in order to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>into account the public health impacts of current allocations, and use public 
</b></p>
<p><b>procurement schemes for school-feeding programmes and for other public institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>to support the provision of locally sourced, nutritious foods, with particular attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>to poor consumers;
