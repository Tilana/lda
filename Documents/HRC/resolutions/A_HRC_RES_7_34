</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>,  </p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 
</p>
<p>March 2006,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the relevant international human rights instruments, in particular 
</p>
<p>the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 2106 (XX) of 
</p>
<p>20 December 1965,  
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, in 2001, and

</p>
<p>scourges and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all the previous resolutions and decisions of the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Council on the elimination of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in 
</p>
<p>many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in 
</p>
<p>society at large, as a result, inter alia, of resurgent activities of associations established 
</p>
<p>on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of 
</p>
<p>those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need for maintaining continued political will and momentum at 
</p>
<p>the national, regional and international levels, in order to combat racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, taking into account the </p>

<p>commitments enshrined in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and 
</p>
<p>recalling the importance of enhancing national action and international cooperation to 
</p>
<p>this end,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>the urgency, more than ever, to combat and end impunity for acts 
</p>
<p>of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and to enable all 
</p>
<p>relevant human rights mechanisms to pay attention to this issue so as to prevent the 
</p>
<p>recurrence of such acts,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations
