2015 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Statoil delivered Adjusted earnings of NOK 22.4 billion and adjusted earnings after tax of
NOK 7.2 billion in the second quarter. Statoil reported Net income in accordance with IFRS of NOK 10.1 billion, including gains from
divestments.
“In the second quarter, Statoil delivered encouraging operational performance with good production growth and high regularity, whilst
continuing to reduce cost. Our financial results were characterised by gains from divestments and lower prices. Also in the second quarter,
we report a close to neutral free cash flow after dividend and proceeds", says president and CEO of Statoil ASA, Eldar Sætre.
Adjusted earnings were NOK 22.4 billion in the second quarter compared to NOK 32.3 billion in the same period in 2014. The reduction was
primarily a consequence of lower oil prices in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. Realised average liquids
prices in the quarter were down 28% measured in NOK compared to the second quarter last year. Adjusted earnings after tax were NOK 7.2
billion, compared to NOK 9.9 billion in the same period last year.
Statoil’s net income according to IFRS for the second quarter was NOK 10.1 billion, compared to NOK 12.0 billion in the same period in
2014. The gain from the divestment of the Shah Deniz project and the South Caucasus Pipeline was NOK 12.3 billion, impacting the IFRS
results. Earnings per share were NOK 3.15, down from NOK 3.75 in the same period last year.
“We continue to progress our effort to improve operational and capital efficiency, and reduce cost. Reduced underlying operational expenses
both on the Norwegian Continental shelf (NCS) and in our international operations, as well as reduced capital expenditures, demonstrate
that our initiatives are effective. In June we announced adjustments to the company’s structure and operating model to further strengthen our
competitiveness,” says Sætre.
Despite divestments, Statoil delivered production of 1,873 mboe per day in the second quarter, up 4% compared to the same period in 2014.
The underlying production growth, after adjusting for divestments, was 7% compared to the second quarter last year. The production from the
NCS grew 7% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year. The increase was mainly due to ramp-up of production on various fields,
higher gas sales from the NCS and lower maintenance compared to the second quarter of 2014. Expected natural decline and reduced
ownership shares from divestments partially offset the increase. Equity production outside of Norway was 724 mboe per day and represented
almost a 4% increase, adjusted for the Shah Deniz divestment.
In the quarter, Statoil made two discoveries on the NCS. In July, Statoil announced a discovery in the Julius prospect in the King Lear area in
the North Sea. Three wells are on-going, one on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf, one in the Gulf of Mexico and one in Canada. In
addition, Statoil has secured access to frontier acreages offshore Nicaragua and Myanmar. The adjusted exploration expense in the quarter
was NOK 4.1 billion, up from NOK 2.7 billion in the second quarter of 2014.
Cash flow from operations amounted to NOK 48.0 billion in the first half of 2015. Statoil maintained a strong capital structure, and net debt to
capital employed at the end of the quarter is reduced to 22.4%. Organic capital expenditure was USD 7.8 billion in the first half, and the
guidance has been revised downwards to USD 17.5 billion for 2015 due to effects of the on-going efficiency program and the USD/NOK
exchange rate.
With effect from first quarter of 2016, Statoil will change to USD as presentation currency. The change reflects the company’s underlying
exposure to the USD as well as better alignment of its reporting to peers. As a consequence of the change in presentation currency, Statoil
will also declare its quarterly dividend in USD. The change will be implemented from the second quarter of 2015 and Statoil is announcing
the second quarter dividend in both USD and NOK, based on the exchange rate on 27 July 2015. The change in dividends policy implies
that dividend will be announced in USD going forward.
The board of directors has decided to pay dividend of USD 0.2201 per ordinary share equivalent to NOK 1.80 for the second quarter and the
Statoil share will trade ex-dividend on Oslo Børs 13 November 2015.
The serious incident frequency (SIF) for the 12 months period ending 30 June 2015 was 0.6, compared to 0.7 the same period last year.

Statoil 2nd quarter 2015     3
SECOND QUARTER 2015 GROUP REVIEW
The second quarter results continued to be influenced by lower prices and foreign exchange rate developments. In the second
quarter there was high operational quality and the cost improvement program is on track. The lower liquids and gas prices were
partially offset by strong refining margins and increased production. Net operating income was impacted by gains from
divestments and net impairment charges.
Total equity liquids and gas production [4]  was 1,873 mboe per day, up 4% from 1,799 mboe per day in the second  quarter of 2014. The
increase was mainly due to start-up and ramp-up of production on various fields, higher gas sales from the NCS and lower maintenance
compared to the second quarter of 2014. Expected natural decline and reduced ownership shares as a result of divestments, partially offset
the increase.
Total entitlement liquids and gas production [3]  was 1,709 mboe per day, up 8% from 1,588 mboe per day in the second  quarter of 2014,
impacted by the increase in equity production and a lower negative effect from production sharing agreements (PSA effect) mainly as a result
of the decline in oil prices.
Net operating income  (IFRS) was NOK 31.5 billion in the second quarter, compared to NOK 32.0 billion in the second quarter of 2014,
impacted by gains from sale of assets of NOK 13.8 billion mainly related to the divestment of the Shah Deniz project and net impairments
charges of NOK 3.1 billion. In the second quarter of 2014, net operating income was positively impacted by gains from sale of assets of
     NOK 3.7 billion and negatively impacted by impairment charges of NOK 4.3 billion.
Adjusted earnings [5] were NOK 22.4 billion in the second quarter, down 31% compared to the second quarter of 2014 mainly as a result of
the significant drop in liquids prices and increased depreciation and exploration costs. Stronger refining margins and better trading results
partially offset the decrease.
Adjusted operating and administrative expenses were NOK 20.8 billion in the second quarter of 2015, at the same level as in the second
quarter of 2014. The positive development in underlying expenses as a result of the on-going cost initiatives was offset by the USD/NOK
exchange rate development.
The 19% increase in adjusted depreciation compared to the second quarter of 2014 was mainly due the USD/NOK exchange rate
development and the start-up and ramp-up of several fields. In addition, previously recorded negative revisions of proved reserves for certain
assets led to increased depreciation costs compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Adjusted exploration expenses increased by NOK 1.4 billion to NOK 4.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015, mainly due to higher drilling
costs because of the USD/NOK exchange rate development and a higher average equity share in wells drilled. A lower portion of current
exploration expenditures being capitalised, added to the increase.

Adjusted earnings after tax were NOK 7.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015, which reflects an effective tax rate on adjusted earnings of
67.8%, compared to 69.3% in the second quarter of 2014. The tax rate decreased mainly due to low tax rates on adjusted earnings from the
Development and Production Norway segment in the second quarter of 2015 because of a higher effect from deduction of uplift. Also, low tax
rates on adjusted earnings from the Marketing, Processing & Renewable Energy segment mainly caused by relatively higher adjusted
earnings from tax regimes with lower than average tax rates, added to the decrease.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were NOK 18.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015 compared to NOK 18.1 billion in the
second quarter of 2014. Excluding working capital movements and taxes paid, cash flows provided by operating activities were NOK 42.0
billion in the second quarter of 2015 compared to NOK 50.5 billion in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease of NOK 8.5 billion was
mainly due to falling liquid prices.
Cash flows used in investing activities were NOK 16.7 billion in the second quarter of 2015 compared to NOK 50.5 billion in the second
quarter of 2014. The decrease of NOK 33.8 billion was mainly due to lower investments in deposits with more than three months to maturity
of NOK 19.6 billion and increased proceeds from sale of assets of NOK 14.0 billion.
Cash flows used in financing activities were NOK 17.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015 compared to NOK 24.1 billion in the second
quarter of 2014, a decrease of NOK 7.0 billion, mainly due to payment of annual dividend in 2014 compared to quarterly dividend in 2015,
offset by repayment of collateral liabilities.
Free cash flow [10] in the second quarter of 2015 was negative NOK 1.2 billion compared to negative NOK 31.4 billion in the second quarter
of 2014. The change was mainly due to good financial performance in the current macro environment, lower taxes paid, higher proceeds from
sale of assets and businesses, and lower dividend.
First half 2015
Net operating income (IFRS) was NOK 5.9 billion compared to NOK 83.4 billion in the first half of 2014. Net operating income in the first half
of 2015, was negatively impacted by net impairment losses of NOK 49.1 billion and lower fair values of derivatives of NOK 3.0 billion. Gain
from sale of assets of NOK 14.3 billion mainly related to the divestment of the Shah Deniz project  impacted net operating income positively.
In the first half of 2014, net operating income was positively impacted by gains from sale of assets of NOK 5.5 billion and an award payment
related to a commercial dispute of NOK 2.8 billion. Net impairment losses of NOK 4.5 billion impacted net operating income negatively.
Adjusted earnings [5] were NOK 45.2 billion in the first half of 2015, down by 42% from NOK 78.3 billion in the first half of 2014. The
decrease was mainly due to the lower prices measured in NOK and the increase in depreciation costs. Higher volumes of both liquids and
gas sold and improved refinery margins, partially offset the decrease. Adjusted operating and administrative expenses was up 6% mainly as
a result of the USD/NOK exchange rate development. A positive development in underlying expenses as a result of the on-going cost
initiatives partly offset the increase. Adjusted depreciation increased by 26% in the first half of 2015 mainly due to the USD/NOK exchange
rate development and the start-up and ramp-up of production of several fields. In addition, negative revisions of proved reserves for certain
assets led to increased depreciation costs compared to the first half of 2014. Adjusted exploration expenses amounted to NOK 6.8 billion in
the first half of 2015, up NOK 0.8 billion compared to the first half of 2014 mainly due to the USD/NOK exchange rate development, increased
drilling costs due to higher well equity share and a lower capitalisation rate. Reduced exploration expenditures capitalised in previous
periods being expensed in the first half of 2015 partially offset the increase. Adjusted earnings after tax were NOK 14.2 billion in the first half
of 2015 compared to NOK 25.7 billion in the first half of 2014. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the first half of 2015 was 68.6%,
compared to an effective tax rate of 67.1% in the first half of 2014.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were NOK 48.0 billion in the first half of 2015 compared to NOK 73.1 billion in the first half of
2014. Excluding working capital movements and taxes paid, cash flows provided by operating activities were NOK 87.9 billion in the first half
of 2015 compared to NOK 118.0 billion in the first half of 2014. The decrease of NOK 30.1 billion was mainly due to reduced liquid prices.
Cash flows used in investing activities were NOK 81.4 billion in the first half of 2015 compared to NOK 58.3 billion in the first half of 2014.
The increase of NOK 23.1 billion was mainly due to increased investments in deposits with more than three months maturity of NOK 36.2
billion, partly offset by increased proceeds from sale of assets of NOK 15.0 billion.
Cash flows provided by financing activities were NOK 3.3 billion the first half of 2015 compared to negative NOK 22.9 billion in the first
half of 2014, an increase of NOK 26.2 billion mainly due to issuance of new debt of NOK 32.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015.
Free cash flow [10] in the first half of 2015 was negative NOK 0.9 billion compared to negative NOK 7.7 billion in the first half of 2014. The
change was mainly due to good financial performance in the current macro environment, lower taxes paid, higher proceeds from sale of
assets and businesses, and lower dividend.
OUTLOOK
Statoil 2nd quarter 2015     5
·       Organic capital expenditures for 2015 (i.e. excluding acquisitions, capital leases and other investments with significant different cash
flow pattern), are estimated at around USD 17.5 billion
·       Statoil intends to continue to mature the large portfolio of exploration assets and estimates a total exploration activity level at around
USD 3.2 billion for 2015, excluding signature bonuses
·       Statoil expects to deliver efficiency improvements with pre-tax cash flow effects of around USD 1.7 billion from 2016
·       Statoil’s ambition is to maintain RoACE  (Return on Average Capital Employed) at the 2013 level adjusted for price and foreign
exchange level, and to keep our unit of production cost in the top quartile of our peer group
·       For the period 2014 – 2016, organic production growth [7] is expected to come from new projects resulting in around 2% CAGR
(Compound Annual Growth Rate) from a 2014 level rebased for divestments
·       The equity production development for 2015 is estimated to be around 2% CAGR from a 2014 level rebased for divestments [7]
·       Scheduled maintenance activity  is estimated to reduce quarterly production by approximately 45 mboe per day in the third quarter of
2015, of which the majority is liquids. In total, the maintenance is estimated to reduce equity production by around 45 mboe per day for the full
fiscal year 2015, of which the majority is liquids
·       Indicative effects from Production Sharing Agreement (PSA-effect) and US royalties are estimated to be around 170 mboe per day
in 2015 based on an oil price of USD 60 per barrel and 200 mboe per day based on an oil price of USD 100 per barrel [4]
·       Deferral of gas production to create future value, gas off-take, timing of new capacity coming on stream and operational regularity
represent the most significant risks related to the production guidance
·        With effect from first quarter of 2016, Statoil will change to USD as presentation currency. As a consequence, Statoil will also declare
its quarterly dividend in USD. The change will be implemented from the second quarter of 2015
These forward-looking statements reflect current views about future events and are, by their nature, subject to significant risks and
uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. For further information, see section
Forward-Looking Statements.

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION NORWAY
Second quarter 2015 review
Average daily production of liquids and gas increased by 7% to 1,148 mboe per day in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the
second quarter of 2014. The increase was mainly due to ramp-up of new fields and increased production from several fields. Expected
natural decline on mature fields partially offset the increase.
Net operating income for Development and Production Norway (DPN) was NOK 13.3 billion compared to NOK 23.6 billion in the second
quarter of 2014. Impairment of assets of NOK 2.8 billion negatively impacted net operating income.
Adjusted earnings were NOK 17.9 billion, down 26% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The decrease was mainly due to drop in
liquids prices, partially offset by a positive USD/NOK exchange rate development and increased production.
Adjusted depreciation increased mainly due to new fields coming on stream and effect of lower proved reserves for certain assets. Adjusted
operating and administrative expenses decreased mainly due to cost improvements and reduced turnaround activity levels, partially offset by
Valemon coming on stream. The increase in adjusted exploration expenses was mainly due to higher drilling activity as a result of higher
well equity share.

Net operating income for DPN was NOK 29.2 billion in the first half of 2015 compared to NOK 57.6 billion in the first half of 2014, negatively
impacted by impairment of assets of NOK 3.9 billion and lower fair value of derivatives of NOK 2.2 billion.
Adjusted earnings [5] were NOK 36.8 billion in the first half of 2015, down 37%. Adjusted total revenues and other income decreased by
19% primarily driven by drop in liquids prices. Positive USD/NOK exchange rate development and increased volumes partially offset the
decrease in adjusted revenues and other income. Adjusted operating and administrative expenses decreased primarily driven by cost
improvements and reduced turnaround activity level, partially offset by new fields on stream. Adjusted depreciation increased primarily driven
by new fields on stream, reductions in proved reserves for some assets and increased organic investments. Adjusted exploration expenses
decreased primarily driven by lower activity.

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION INTERNATIONAL
Second quarter 2015 review
Average equity production of liquids and gas in the second quarter of 2015 was largely flat at 724 mboe per day compared to the second
quarter of 2014. Ramp-up on several fields, including CLOV (Angola) and Jack/ St. Malo (US), was offset by the divestment of Shah Deniz
project, expected natural decline on various fields and higher negative impact of planned turnarounds.
Average daily entitlement production of liquids and gas increased by 9% to 561 mboe per day compared to the second quarter of 2014.
The increase was due to lower negative effect of production sharing agreements (PSA effect), mainly driven by the decline in prices. The
PSA effect was 122 mboe per day in the second quarter of 2015 compared to 169 mboe per day in the second quarter of 2014.
Net operating income for Development and Production International (DPI) was NOK 13.1 billion compared to NOK 5.7 billion in the second
quarter of 2014. A gain of NOK 12.2 billion related to the divestment of the Shah Deniz project positively impacted net operating income. In
the second quarter of 2014 net operating income was negatively impacted by net impairment losses of NOK 4.3 billion. A gain on sale of
assets of NOK 3.6 billion partially offset the decrease.
Adjusted earnings were down from positive NOK 6.3 billion in the second quarter of 2014 to negative NOK 0.1 billion in the second quarter
of 2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower realised oil and gas prices in addition to increased depreciation, exploration expenses,
partially offset by higher entitlement production.
Adjusted depreciation increased primarily due to the USD/NOK exchange rate development in addition to higher production from start-up and
ramp-up on various fields. The increase was partially offset by reduced depreciation from increased reserves compared to the second quarter
of 2014, and from impairment of assets in 2014 and 2015. Adjusted operating and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the
USD/NOK exchange rate development in addition to the portfolio changes and start-up of the Jack/ St. Malo and CLOV fields. Lower
royalties, caused by reduced prices, and lower transportation, operation and maintenance costs partially offset the increase. Adjusted
exploration expenses increased, primarily driven by higher drilling activity and lower portion of current exploration expenditures being
capitalised this period, partially offset by less capitalised exploration expenditures from earlier years being expensed this quarter.

2014. Net impairment losses of NOK 44.9 billion negatively impacted net operating income, partially offset by a gain related to sale of assets
of NOK 12.2 billion. Net operating income in the first half of 2014 was positively impacted by gains related to sale of assets of NOK 5.3
billion. The positive impact was partially offset by impairment of assets of NOK 4.7 billion.
Adjusted earnings [5] were negative NOK 2.3 billion in the first half of 2015, down from positive NOK 13.2 billion in the first half of 2014.
Adjusted total revenues and other income decreased by 22%, primarily driven by lower realised oil and gas prices. Higher entitlement
production partially offset the decrease. Adjusted operating and administrative expenses increased by 12%, primarily driven by the
USD/NOK exchange rate development, in addition to portfolio changes. Production ramp-up in onshore North America and the start-up of the
offshore fields CLOV and Jack/St. Malo added to the increase. Lower royalties, caused by lower prices, and lower transportation costs
partially offset the increase. Adjusted depreciation increased by 26%, primarily driven by the USD/NOK development, in addition to higher
production from start-up and ramp-up on various fields. The increase was partially offset by reduced depreciation from increased reserves
and from impairment of assets in 2014 and 2015. Adjusted exploration expenses increased by 27%, primarily driven by increased drilling
expenses. Higher capitalised exploration and less earlier years capitalised cost being expensed partially offset the increase.

MARKETING, PROCESSING AND RENEWABLE ENERGY
Second quarter 2015 review
Natural gas sales volumes amounted to 11.3 billion standard cubic meters (bcm) in the second quarter of 2015, down 2% compared to the
second quarter of 2014. The decrease was mainly due to lower Statoil entitlement production related to the divestment of the Shah Deniz
project, partially offset by higher third party volumes sold. Of the total gas sales in the second quarter of 2015, entitlement gas was 9.6 bcm
compared to 9.9 bcm in the second quarter of 2014.
Average invoiced European natural gas sales price increased by 1%. Lower European gas prices and weakened LNG market were offset
by the USD/NOK exchange rate development. Average invoiced North American piped gas sales price decreased by 32%. The prices
have continued to be weak in the US during the quarter.
Net operating income for Marketing, Processing and Renewable Energy (MPR) was NOK 5.1 billion compared to NOK 2.6 billion in the
second quarter of 2014.
Adjusted earnings were NOK 5.3 billion, compared to NOK 2.4 billion in the second quarter of 2014. The increase was mainly due to
significantly higher refinery margins due to an oversupplied crude market with low spot prices combined with strong gasoline markets. In
addition, trading results were solid and the USD/NOK foreign exchange rate development added positively to the increase. As a result of the
on-going cost initiatives, the underlying development in Adjusted operating and administrative expenses were positive but was more than
offset by the negative USD/NOK foreign exchange rate development.

First half 2015
Net operating income for MPR was NOK 11.5 billion in the first half of 2015 compared to NOK 11.6 billion in the first half of 2014, negatively
impacted by change in fair value of derivatives of NOK 0.8 billion, periodisation of inventory and contract hedging effects of NOK 0.6 billion
and impairment of assets of NOK 0.4 billion. A gain on operational storage of NOK 0.9 billion partially offset the decrease. Net operating
income in the first half of 2014 was positively impacted by a gain due to an award payment related to a commercial dispute of NOK 2.8
billion.
Adjusted earnings [5] were NOK 12.2 billion in the first half of 2015, up 46%. The increase was mainly due to significantly higher refinery
margins due to an oversupplied crude market with low spot prices. Solid trading results added to the increase. Adjusted total revenues and
other income decreased by 20% primarily driven by significant decrease in US crude oil prices partially offset by the USD/NOK foreign
exchange rate development.  Adjusted purchases decreased by 24% due to the same factors as described above. Adjusted operating and
administrative expenses increased by 10%, negatively influenced by the USD/NOK foreign exchange rate development which more than
offset the effect of reductions in underlying expenses as a result of the on-going cost initiatives.

Notes to the condensed interim financial statements
1 Organisation and basis of preparation
General information and organisation
Statoil ASA, originally Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap AS, was founded in 1972 and is incorporated and domiciled in Norway. The address of
its registered office is Forusbeen 50, N-4035 Stavanger, Norway.
The Statoil group’s (Statoil's) business consists principally of the exploration, production, transportation, refining and marketing of petroleum
and petroleum-derived products. Statoil ASA is listed on the Oslo Børs (Norway) and the New York Stock Exchange (US).
All Statoil's oil and gas activities and net assets on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) are owned by Statoil Petroleum AS, a 100%
owned operating subsidiary of Statoil ASA. Statoil Petroleum AS is co-obligor or guarantor of certain debt obligations of Statoil ASA.
Statoil's condensed interim financial statements for the second quarter of 2015 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 27 July
2015.
Basis of preparation
These condensed interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial
Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU). The condensed
interim financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) for a complete set of financial statements, and these condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
annual financial statements. IFRSs as adopted by the EU differ in certain respects from IFRSs as issued by the IASB, but the differences do
not impact Statoil's financial statements for the periods presented. A description of the significant accounting policies applied is included in
the Statoil annual financial statements for 2014 and applies to these condensed interim financial statements. There have been no changes to
significant accounting policies in the first half of 2015 compared to the annual financial statements for 2014.
The condensed interim financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the dates and interim periods presented. Interim period results are not
necessarily indicative of results of operations or cash flows for an annual period.
The condensed interim financial statements are unaudited.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis,
considering the current and expected future market conditions. A change in an accounting estimate is recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current
and future periods.
2 Segments
Statoil's operations have in the most recent years been managed through the following operating segments: Development and Production
Norway (DPN), Development and Production North America (DPNA), Development and Production International (DPI), Marketing,
Processing and Renewable Energy (MPR) and Other.
From the third quarter of 2015, Statoil’s operations will be managed through the following operating segments: Development and Production
Norway (DPN), Development and Production USA (DPUSA), Development and Production International (DPI), Marketing, Midstream and
Processing (MMP), New Energy Solutions (NES) and Other.
Statoil reports its business through reporting segments which correspond to the operating segments, except for the operating segments DPI
and DPNA (DPUSA effective from the third quarter of 2015) which have been aggregated into one reporting segment, Development and
Production International. This aggregation has its basis in similar economic characteristics, the nature of products, services and production
processes, the type and class of customers and the methods of distribution. Also effective from the third quarter of 2015, the NES operating
segment will be presented in Other.
The Eliminations section includes the elimination of inter-segment sales and related unrealised profits, mainly from the sale of crude oil and
products. Inter-segment revenues are based upon estimated market prices.
Segment data for the second quarter and first half of 2015 and 2014 is presented below. The reported measure of segment profit is Net
operating income. Deferred tax assets, pension assets and non-current financial assets are not allocated to the segments. The line item
Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments excludes movements related to changes in asset retirement obligations.

Statoil 2nd quarter 2015     17
The segment data for DPI, MPR and Other has been influenced by divestments discussed in note 3 Disposals.
In the second quarter of 2015 Statoil recognised net impairment losses of NOK 3.1 billion, mainly related to impairment losses recognised in
DPN and DPI. In DPN an impairment loss of NOK 2.8 billion was recognised on an offshore asset, triggered by changes in cost and price
assumptions. Impairment losses of NOK 3.1 billion were recognised in the DPI segment, of which the most significant item relates to an asset
in the Gulf of Mexico triggered by project delays. In addition, DPI recognised a reversal of impairment of NOK 3.2 billion for an
unconventional onshore asset in North America as a result of improved operational performance. See also note 6 Property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets.
In the first quarter of 2015 Statoil recognised net impairment losses of NOK 46.1 billion, of which NOK 1.1 billion was recognised in the DPN
segment and NOK 45.0 billion in the DPI segment. Of the impairment losses in the DPI segment, NOK 30.4 billion, including goodwill of
NOK 4.2 billion, related to unconventional onshore assets in North America. Of the remaining NOK 14.6 billion, relating to conventional
upstream assets, NOK 11.2 billion related to assets in the Gulf of Mexico.

The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was primarily influenced by relatively high income from entities with lower than average tax rate,
including the tax exempted sale of interest in the Shah Deniz project as described in note 3 Disposals. This was partially offset by tax effect
of foreign exchange gains in entities that are taxable in other currencies than the functional currency.
The tax rate for the first half of 2015 was primarily influenced by impairments with lower than average tax rates. This was partially offset by
the tax exempted sale of interest in the Shah Deniz project and foreign exchange losses in entities that are taxable in other currencies than
the functional currency.
The tax rate for the second quarter and first half of 2015 was also influenced by write-off of deferred tax assets within Development and
Production International segment, due to uncertainty related to future taxable income.
The tax rate for the second quarter of 2014 and first half of 2014 was primarily influenced by relatively high income from companies with
lower than average tax rates, including a 2014 tax exempted sale of interest in the Shah Deniz project. The tax rate was also influenced by
impairment losses with lower than average tax rate. For the first half of 2014 the tax rate was also influenced by the recognition of a non-cash
tax income following a verdict in the Norwegian Supreme Court in February 2014. The Supreme Court voted in favour of Statoil in a tax
dispute regarding the tax treatment of foreign exploration expenditures.

Energy Ltd) from joint operation (pro-rata line by line consolidation) to joint venture (equity method) following from changes in the joint
operating agreements.
Impairments
The first half of 2015 is negatively impacted by net impairment losses of NOK 49.1 billion of which NOK 46.1 billion was recognised in first
quarter of 2015 triggered by reduced price forecasts. Due to the uncertainty in the commodity markets which is assumed to impact oil and gas
prices in the long term, Statoil’s management decided in the first quarter of 2015 to change Statoil’s long-term economic planning
assumptions. In the impairment calculations, Statoil generally use observed forward oil and gas price curves for the first two to three years
and the long term economic planning assumptions for the periods thereafter. The recently updated long term Brent crude price assumption is
USD 80/boe (real 2015 terms) for 2018, and gradually increasing.
In the second quarter of 2015 Statoil recognised impairment losses of net NOK 3.1 billion triggered by various operational issues. See also

The impairment losses have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment
losses and Exploration expenses based on the impaired assets’ nature of Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets, respectively.
Recoverable amounts in the impairment assessments have been based on value in use as well as fair value less costs of disposal. The fair
value estimates have been based on various market parameters derived from relevant transactions and assumed to be applied by market
participants in the current market environment.
7 Provisions, commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
In the second quarter of 2015, a significant part of the financial exposure related to long term gas sales price reviews has been resolved with
no significant impact on the condensed interim financial statements. At the end of the second quarter of 2015 the remaining exposure related
to on-going price review arbitration cases was approximately NOK 2.0 billion for gas delivered prior to quarter end. Statoil has provided for its
best estimate related to price review arbitration cases in these condensed interim financial statements, with the impact to the Consolidated
statement of income reflected as revenue adjustments.
During the normal course of its business Statoil is involved in legal and other proceedings, and several claims are unresolved and currently
outstanding. The ultimate liability or asset, respectively, in respect of such litigation and claims cannot be determined at this time. Statoil has
provided in its condensed interim financial statements for probable liabilities related to litigation and claims based on the company's best
judgement. Statoil does not expect that its financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be materially affected by the resolution of
these legal proceedings.

USE AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures are defined as numerical measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included
in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (i.e. IFRS).
For more information on our use of non-GAAP financial measures, see report section - Financial analysis and review - Non-GAAP measures
in Statoil's 2014 Annual Report on Form 20-F.
The following financial measures may be considered non-GAAP financial measures:
·       Adjusted earnings (including Adjusted revenues and other income, Adjusted purchases, Adjusted operating expenses and selling,
general and administrative expenses, Adjusted depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses and Adjusted exploration expenses)
·       Adjusted earnings after tax
·       Return on average capital employed after tax (ROACE)
·       Production cost per boe
·       Net interest-bearing debt adjusted
·       Net debt to capital employed ratio
·       Net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted
Adjusted earnings are based on net operating income and adjusts for certain items affecting the income for the period in order to separate
out effects that management considers may not to be specifically related to Statoil's underlying operational performance in the individual
reporting period. Management considers adjusted earnings to be a supplemental measure to Statoil's IFRS measures that provides an
indication of Statoil's underlying operational performance in the period and facilitates a better understanding of operational trends between
the periods. Adjusted earnings adjusts for the following items:
·         Certain gas contracts are, due to pricing or delivery conditions, deemed to contain embedded derivatives, required to be carried at fair
value. Certain transactions related to historical divestments include contingent considerations, carried at fair value. The accounting impacts
of the aforementioned are excluded in Adjusted Earnings. In addition, adjustments are also made for changes in the unrealised fair value of
derivatives related to some natural gas trading activities, where only the realised gains and losses on derivatives are reflected in adjusted
earnings. The gains and losses on derivatives are then reflected in the period in which they impact our cash flows and generally match the
associated cash flow of the exposure being managed.
·         Periodisation of inventory hedging effect: Commercial storage is hedged in the paper market. Commercial storage is accounted for
by using the lowest of cost and market price. If market prices increase over cost price, there will be a loss in the IFRS profit & loss statement
since the derivatives always reflects changes in the market price. An adjustment is made to reflect the unrealised market value on the
commercial storage. As a result, loss on derivatives is matched by a similar adjustment for the exposure being managed. If market prices
decrease under cost price, the write-down and the derivative effect in the IFRS profit & loss statement will offset each and no adjustment is
done.
·         Over/underlift  is accounted for using the sales method and therefore revenues are reflected in the period the product is sold rather
than in the period it is produced. The over/underlift position depends on a number of factors related to our lifting program and the way it
corresponds to our entitlement share of production. The effect on income for the period is therefore adjusted, to show estimated revenues and
associated costs based upon the production for the period which management believes better reflects operational performance.
·         Statoil holds operational storage which is not hedged in the paper market due to inventory strategies. Cost of goods sold is measured
based on the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method, and includes realized gains or losses that arise due to changes in market prices. These gains or
losses will fluctuate from one period to another and are not considered part of the underlying operations for the period.
·         Impairment and  reversal of impairment are excluded from adjusted earnings since they affect the economics of an asset for the
lifetime of that asset; not only the period in which it is impaired or the impairment is reversed. Impairment and reversal of impairment can
impact both the Exploration expenses and the Depreciation, amortization and impairment line items.
·         Gain or loss from sales is eliminated from the measure since the gain or loss does not give an indication of future performance or
periodic performance; such a gain or loss is related to the cumulative value creation from the time the asset is acquired until it is sold.
·         Internal unrealised profit on inventories: Volumes derived from equity oil on inventory will vary depending on several factors and
inventory strategies, i.e. level of crude oil in inventory, equity oil used in the refining process and level of in-transit cargoes. Internal profit
related to volumes sold between entities in the group, and still in inventory at period end, is eliminated according to IFRS (write down to
production cost). The proportion of realised versus unrealised gain will fluctuate from one period to another due to inventory strategies and
accordingly impact Net operating income. This impact is not assessed to be a part of the underlying operational performance, and elimination
of internal profit related to equity volumes is excluded in adjusted earnings.
·         Other items of income and expense are adjusted when the impacts on income in the period are not reflective of Statoil's underlying
operational performance in the reporting period. Such items may be unusual or infrequent transactions but they may also include transactions
that are significant which would not necessarily qualify as either unusual or infrequent. Other items can include transactions such as
provisions related to reorganisation, early retirement, etc.
The measure adjusted earnings after tax excludes net financial items (the principal line items impacted by the change in functional
currency) and the associated tax effects on net financial items. It is based on adjusted earnings less the tax effects on all elements included
in adjusted earnings (or calculated tax on operating income and on each of the adjusting items using an estimated marginal tax rate). In
addition, tax effect related to tax exposure items not related to the individual reporting period is excluded from adjusted earnings after tax.
Management considers adjusted earnings after tax, which reflects a normalised tax charge associated with its operational performance
excluding the impact of financing, to be a supplemental measure to Statoil's net income. Certain net USD denominated financial positions
are held by group
Statoil 2nd quarter 2015     26
companies that have a USD functional currency that is different from the currency in which the taxable income is measured. As currency
exchange rates change between periods, the basis for measuring net financial items for IFRS will change disproportionally with taxable
income which includes exchange gains and losses from translating the net USD denominated financial positions into the currency of the
applicable tax return. Therefore, the effective tax rate may be significantly higher or lower than the statutory tax rate for any given period.
Management considers that adjusted earnings after tax provides a better indication of the taxes associated with underlying operational
performance in the period (excluding financing), and therefore better facilitates a comparison between periods. However, the adjusted taxes
included in adjusted earnings after tax should not be considered indicative of the amount of current or total tax expense (or taxes payable) for
the period.
Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax should be considered additional measures rather than substitutes for net operating income
and net income, which are the most directly comparable IFRS measures. There are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted
earnings and adjusted earnings after tax compared with the IFRS measures since they do not include all the items of revenues/gains or
expenses/losses of Statoil which are needed to evaluate its profitability on an overall basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after
tax are only intended to be indicative of the underlying developments in trends of our on-going operations for the production, manufacturing
and marketing of our products and exclude pre and post-tax impacts of net financial items. We reflect such underlying development in our
operations by eliminating the effects of certain items that may not be directly associated with the period's operations or financing. However,
for that reason, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are not complete measures of profitability. The measures should therefore
not be used in isolation.
Adjusted earnings equal the sum of net operating income less all applicable adjustments. Adjusted earnings after tax equals the sum of net
operating income less income tax in business areas and adjustments to operating income taking the applicable marginal tax into
consideration. See the tables in the following section for details.
Production cost per barrel is based on operating expenses related to production of oil and gas. Statoil uses production cost per barrel
because it allows Statoil to evaluate the underlying development in product costs. The following is a reconciliation of overall operating
expenses to operating expenses exclusively related to production of oil and gas volumes:

Production cost per boe is calculated as Total operating expenses upstream for the last four quarters divided by the production volumes for
the corresponding period. Production cost per BOE in USD is calculated using the average USD/NOK exchange rate for the last 4 quarters.
The development in unit production cost is impacted by the USD/NOK exchange rate development.
Production costs for Statoil’s international upstream activities are mainly exposed to USD, while the production costs for Statoil’s activities in
Norway are exposed to NOK.
The calculated net debt to capital employed ratio is viewed by Statoil as providing a more complete picture of the Group's current debt
situation than gross interest-bearing debt. The calculation uses balance sheet items related to gross interest-bearing debt and adjusts for
cash, cash equivalents and current financial investments. Further adjustments are made for different reasons:
·       Since different legal entities in the group lend to projects and others borrow from banks, project financing through external bank or
similar institutions will not be netted in the balance sheet and will over-report the debt stated in the balance sheet compared to the underlying
exposure in the Group. Similarly, certain net interest-bearing debt incurred from activities pursuant to the Marketing Instruction of the
Norwegian government are off-set against receivables on the Norwegian state`s financial interest (SDFI)
·       Some interest-bearing elements are classified together with non-interest bearing elements, and are therefore included when calculating
the net interest-bearing debt
The table below reconciles net interest-bearing debt, capital employed and the net debt to capital employed ratio to the most directly
comparable financial measure or measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.

Dividend payment mechanism
Statoil announce the second quarter dividend in both USD and NOK, based on the effective exchange rate. The dividend for the second
quarter of 2015 is declared in USD in order to achieve exact NOK 1.80, using the official USD/NOK fixing rate from Norges Bank on 27 July
2015.
From and including the third quarter of 2015, dividend is declared in USD, the NOK dividend will be calculated and communicated four
business days after the record date for Oslo Børs shareholders. The NOK dividend will be based on average USD/NOK fixing rates from
Norges Bank in the period plus/minus three business days from record date, in total seven business days.
Record date is the date on which the company finalises the list of investors who qualify as "shareholders of record". Investors listed as
shareholders of record will receive the dividend payment. On Oslo Børs record date is ex-date plus one business day. On NYSE record date
is ex-date plus two business days.

governments (including the Norwegian state as majority shareholder); counterparty defaults; natural disasters and adverse weather
conditions, climate change, and other changes to business conditions; an inability to attract and retain personnel; relevant governmental
approvals; industrial actions by workers and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report. Additional information, including information on
factors that may affect Statoil's business, is contained in Statoil's Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found on Statoil's website at www.statoil.com.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our future
results, level of activity, performance or achievements will meet these expectations. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. Unless we are required by law to update these
statements, we will not necessarily update any of these statements after the date of this report, either to make them conform to actual results
or changes in our expectations.

END NOTES
1.    The Group's average liquids price is a volume-weighted average of the segment prices of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids
(NGL).
2.    The refining reference margin is a typical average gross margin of our two refineries, Mongstad and Kalundborg. The reference margin
will differ from the actual margin, due to variations in type of crude and other feedstock, throughput, product yields, freight cost, inventory, etc.
3.    Liquids volumes include oil, condensate and NGL, exclusive of royalty oil.
4.    Equity volumes represent produced volumes under a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) that correspond to Statoil's ownership
percentage in a particular field. Entitlement volumes, on the other hand, represent Statoil's share of the volumes distributed to the partners in
the field, which are subject to deductions for, among other things, royalty and the host government's share of profit oil. Under the terms of a
PSA, the amount of profit oil deducted from equity volumes will normally increase with the cumulative return on investment to the partners
and/or production from the license. As a consequence, the gap between entitlement and equity volumes will likely increase in times of high
liquids prices. The distinction between equity and entitlement is relevant to most PSA regimes, whereas it is not applicable in most
concessionary regimes such as those in Norway, the UK, the US, Canada and Brazil.
5.    These are non-GAAP figures. See report section "Use and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures" for details.
6.    Transactions with the Norwegian State. The Norwegian State, represented by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE), is the
majority shareholder of Statoil and also holds major investments in other entities. This ownership structure means that Statoil participates in
transactions with many parties that are under a common ownership structure and therefore meet the definition of a related party. Statoil
purchases liquids and natural gas from the Norwegian State, represented by SDFI (the State's Direct Financial Interest). In addition, Statoil is
selling the State's natural gas production in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk as well as related expenditures
refunded by the State. All transactions are considered to be at an arms-length basis.
7.    The production guidance reflects our estimates of proved reserves calculated in accordance with US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) guidelines and additional production from other reserves not included in proved reserves estimates.
8.    The Group's average invoiced gas prices include volumes sold by the Marketing, Processing and Renewable energy (MPR) segment.
9.    The internal transfer price paid from MPR to DPN.
10.  Free cash flow includes the following line items in the Consolidated statement of cash flows: Cash flows provided by operating activities
before taxes paid and working capital items, Taxes paid, Capital expenditures and investments, (Increase) decrease in other non-current
items, Proceeds from sale of assets and businesses, and Dividend paid.
