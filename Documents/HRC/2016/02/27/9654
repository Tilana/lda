</p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>

</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly Resolution 60/251, which affirms that the Human Rights Council

</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> further that General Assembly 60/251 affirms that the work of the Council shall 
be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, 
constructive international dialogue and cooperation with a view to enhancing the promotion of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that everyone has the right to an adequate standard of living for himself and his 
family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of 
living conditions, as reflected in article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social &amp; 
Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Committed</i> to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those 
contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major 
United Nations conferences and summits, as they contribute to the universal realization and 
effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including its provision that everyone 
has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and his family, 
including food, and recalling the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and 
Malnutrition and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the first Millennium 
Development Goal of eradication hunger and extreme poverty by 2015, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective 
enjoyment of human rights by all, its immediate alleviation and eventual elimination must 
remain a high priority for the international community,  
</p>
<p><i>Cognizant</i> that, as a result of globalization, domestic economies are now interwoven, and that 
good governance at the national and international levels, as well as fair effective, transparent and 
accountable financial, monetary and trading systems, are essential pre-requisites for attaining 
sustainable development and for the elimination of poverty,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing </i>serious concern at the negative impacts of the global economic and financial 
crises on economic and social development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights in all 
countries, and recognizing that developing countries, particularly least developed countries and 
small island developing states, are in a more vulnerable situation when facing these impacts, 
</p>
<p><i>Regretting</i> that the global economic and financial crises have resulted in the decline of 
exports, foreign direct investment, and remittances which are essential factors contributing to the 
growth of economies of developing countries, and have led to difficulties in foreign indebtedness 
and in the realization of all human rights, including the right to development,   </p>

</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that the state has a responsibility to ensure that an increase in unemployment 
does not exacerbate the potential for discrimination, in particular against migrants and other 
vulnerable groups, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the economic and financial crises are global in scope and require global 
concerted solutions, developed in partnership by the international community with a view to 
prevent and alleviate any of their impacts on the universal realization and effective enjoyment of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i>1.  Expresses</i> deep concern that the universal realization and effective enjoyment of human rights 
are challenged due to multiple and interrelated global economic and financial crises; 
</p>
<p><i>2.  Recognizes</i> the severe impacts that the global economic and financial crises are having on the 
ability of countries, particularly developing countries, to mobilize resources for development and to 
address the impact of these crises, and, in this context, calls upon all states and the international 
community to alleviate, in an inclusive and development oriented manner, any negative impacts of 
these crises on the realization and the effective enjoyment of all human rights; 
<i>3.  Underlines </i>the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and democratic international 
system to strengthen and broaden the participation of developing countries in international economic 
decision-making and norm-setting; </p>
<p><i>4.  Expresses </i>grave concern that these crises threaten to further undermine the achievement of the 
internationally agreed development goals including the Millennium Development Goals and calls upon 
all states to refrain from reducing official development assistance and from imposing protectionist 
measures, and to maintain their commitments to mobilize and sustain financial resources for 
development, in accordance with the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development, and to 
make concerted and sustained efforts to contribute to an early recovery; 
</p>
<p><i>5.  Stresses</i> that global economic and financial crises do not diminish the responsibility of 
national authorities in the realization of human rights, while recognizing that the crises have 
</p>
<p>greatly reduced their capacity to fulfill their responsibility in this regards; 
</p>
<p><i>6.  Calls</i> upon states, notwithstanding any possible impact of the global economic and financial 
crises, to respect their human rights obligations and to continue their efforts towards the universal 
realization and effective enjoyment of all human rights, particularly by assisting the most 
vulnerable, and in this context urges the international community to support national efforts to, 
<i>inter alia</i>, establish and preserve social safety nets for the protection of the most vulnerable 
segments of their societies; </p>

</p>
<p><i>7.  Calls </i>on states to ensure that those at risk of being most affected by the global economic and 
financial crises are protected in a non-discriminatory way; 
</p>
<p><i>8.</i>  <i>Reaffirms</i> that an open, equitable, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading 
system can substantially stimulate development worldwide, benefiting all countries, particularly 
developing countries, and thereby contributing to the universal realization and effective 
enjoyment of all human rights; 
<i>9.</i>  <i>Recognizes </i>the central role of the United Nations in the international system and <i>welcomes</i> 
the decision by the General Assembly to hold a High-level Conference on the world economic 
and financial crises and its impacts on development due to take place 1-4 June 2009; and in this 
context, recommends that an invitation be addressed by the General Assembly to the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to participate in this high level event and to 
present a report with suggested recommendations, building on the deliberations of this special 
session, so as to mainstream a human rights perspective in the analysis of the global economic 
and financial crises; 
</p>
<p><i>10.</i>  <i>Invites</i> relevant thematic Special Procedures, within their respective mandates, to consider 
any of the impacts of the global economic and financial crises on the realization and effective 
enjoyment of all human rights particularly economic social and cultural rights, and to integrate 
their findings in this regards in their regular reports presented to the Human Rights Council, with 
special attention to non-discrimination and to ways and means to ensure respect for and 
protection of the human rights of vulnerable and marginalized groups, particularly women, 
children, migrants, migrant workers and their families, indigenous peoples, and people living in 
poverty, and on the elimination of acts of racism and xenophobia and promoting greater harmony 
and tolerance in all societies; 
</p>
<p><i>11.</i>  <i>Invites</i> the treaty bodies, within their respective mandates, to consider any of the impacts of 
the global economic and financial crises on the realization and effective enjoyment of all human 
rights, and to consider presenting recommendations thereon; 
</p>
<p><i>12.  Calls</i> upon all states to continue their financial contributions to international organizations, 
particularly to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights; 
</p>
<p><i>13.</i>  <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the implementation of the present resolution.
