<p><b>  United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretary-General</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note was prepared in accordance with the arrangements approved by the 
Human Rights Council in its decision 2/102. It presents updated information on the 
activities of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. Given, however, 
that the thirty-fifth session of the Board of Trustees, originally planned for October 2011, 
was postponed to January 2012, no recommendations for grants for 2012 have been made. 
The present note will be complemented by the report of the Secretary-General on the 
activities of the Fund, to be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, 
detailing the outcomes of the thirty-fifth session of the Board of Trustees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Fund receives voluntary contributions from States, non-governmental 
organizations and private sources, including individuals. In accordance with the practice 
established by its Board of Trustees in 1982, the Fund provides grants to non-governmental 
organizations and other channels of assistance that submit projects involving medical, 
psychological, social, financial, legal and humanitarian or other forms of assistance to 
torture victims and their relatives. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General administers the Fund through the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with the advice of the Board of 
Trustees, composed of five members acting in a personal capacity and appointed by the 
Secretary-General with due regard to equitable geographical distribution and in 
consultation with their Governments. On 26 October 2011, the Secretary-General 
reappointed Mercedes Doretti (Argentina) for a final period of three years, and appointed 
Natasa Kandic (Serbia), Maria Cristina de Mendonca (Portugal), Morad el-Shazly (Egypt) 
and Anastasia Pinto (India) for a three-year term, renewable once. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Admissibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>4. Project admissibility criteria are outlined in the guidelines of the Fund. They require 
a project to be presented by a non-governmental organization or other channels of 
assistance. The beneficiaries must be direct victims of torture and/or direct family 
members. Priority is given to projects providing direct assistance to torture victims, which 
could consist of medical or psychological assistance, help with social or financial 
reintegration through vocational training for victims, and various forms of legal assistance 
for victims or members of their families, including assistance for seeking redress or 
applying for asylum. Depending on the funds available, the Fund may finance projects to 
organize training programmes, seminars or conferences to allow health-care professionals 
or other service providers to exchange best practices. Grant requests for projects involving 
investigation, research, studies, publications or similar activities are not admissible. The 
Fund may provide emergency assistance to individuals in countries where no project is 
receiving support. This type of request is examined according to a specific procedure 
outlined in the guidelines.  </p>


<p><b> II. Thirty-fifth session of the Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>5. Given that the new Board of Trustees was appointed on 22 October 2011, the thirty-
fifth session of the Board, originally planned from 17 to 21 October 2011, had to be 
postponed to 25 January to 3 February 2012. The thirty-fifth session will last longer in 
order to allow the Board to take policy decisions, which are normally taken during the 
February session. No additional session will be organized for the decisions and 
recommendations to be taken for 2012. The Board will hold its thirty-sixth session in 
October 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Financial situation of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>6. The table below shows the contributions received from 1 January to 
28 November 2011, including contributions received since the previous report of the 
Secretary-General on the activities of the Fund (A/66/276). All contributions will be 
allocated to grants to be recommended by the Board at its thirty-fifth session.

<p>7. In accordance with United Nations financial regulations, programme support costs 
will be charged to the Trust Fund at the rate of 13 per cent of total annual expenditure. In 
addition, the United Nations requires that an operating cash reserve of 15 per cent of annual 
estimated expenditure be maintained to cover exchange rate fluctuation, any shortfalls and 
to meet final expenditure, including any liquidating liabilities. The operating cash reserve 
will be left unallotted and carried forward from year to year, until required. Expenditure for 
non-grant activities include, inter alia, travel expenditure for Board members, expenditure 
for monitoring and evaluation of projects by United Nations staff and technical assistance 
for the further development of the grant management system.  
</p>
<p>8. The amount available for distribution to projects will be calculated after deducting 
programme support costs, operating cash reserve and expenditure for non-grant activities 
from the total amount of funds made available in the form of contributions received 
between the thirty-third session of the Board of Trustees, held in October 2010, and the 
thirty-fifth session of the Board, to be held in January 2012, and the operating cash reserve 
of the previous cycle. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Estimated needs for 2013 
</b></p>
<p>9. From 2006 to 2010, the Board progressively increased the amount awarded in grants 
to projects worldwide. This had been possible because the income used during this period 
included both the yearly voluntary contributions and unallocated amounts carried over from 
previous years. Those amounts resulted from more efficient management of the Fund, 
including the change in cycle, closer monitoring of grantees and stricter reporting 
requirements. The Board had decided to use the carry-overs to increase the level of funding 
to projects, particularly in priority regions. 
</p>
<p>10. In 2011, however, the Board faced a shortfall of US$3 million to continue to meet 
requests from grantees at the same level as in 2010, and therefore decided on strategic cuts 
for the 2011 grants cycle. As no significant additional contribution was received in 2011 for 
the 2012 grants cycle, the Board is still facing an important shortfall and will have to 
maintain or increase these strategic cuts for the 2012 grants cycle and further limit its 
support to new projects. If no additional contribution is received in 2012 for the 2013 grants 
cycle, these strategic cuts might have to be upheld or increased. 
</p>
<p>11. On the basis of the requests received for 2012, it is expected that approximately 
$22 million will be requested by organizations for 2013.  
</p>

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>13. <b>Pursuant to the appeals made by the General Assembly in its resolution 65/205 
and by the Board of Trustees of the Fund in the previous report of the Secretary-
</b></p>
<p><b>General (A/66/276), donors are invited to pay their contributions to the Fund before 
</b></p>
<p><b>the thirty-sixth session of the Board (October 2012) in order that the Board may take 
</b></p>
<p><b>them into account in October 2012. 
</b></p>
<p>14. <b>In the light of the difficult financial situation faced in 2010 and 2011, the 
General Assembly and the Board have also reiterated their call to regular donors to 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase, as much as possible, their contributions to the Fund in order to provide the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Board with the necessary resources to meet the growing needs of torture victims and 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of their families worldwide. 
</b></p>
<p>15. <b>The Board strongly encourages States that have not yet contributed to the Fund 
to do so, preferably before September 2012. 
</b></p>
