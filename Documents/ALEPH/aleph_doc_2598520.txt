Subsequent to the end of the 2016 financial year, Syntonic Limited (formerly Pacific Ore limited) (“Company” or

Syntonic is a leader in sponsored content services, and is transforming how consumers and businesses access 
applications and content across the mobile Internet. Syntonic created the Connected Services Platform™, which

Syntonic plans to aggressively expand its Syntonic DataFlex® solution in the U.S. and its Freeway by Syntonic® 
solution in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the United States.
Substantial news flow is expected over the next several months as Syntonic expands its worldwide operations and 
captures its growing sales pipeline in key markets, including:
 
 
 

broadening Freeway by Syntonic deployment in Southeast Asia; 
adoption of Freeway by Syntonic by Tier-1 content providers including gaming customers; 
wider industry deployment for Syntonic DataFlex in North America; and  
licensing of Syntonic Connected Services Platform to mobile carriers in the Americas.
After the Acquisition, the principal activity of the Company has been the provision of mobile technology services to

14.  Commentary on results for the period 
 
The Acquisition settled on 8 July 2016, so as a result, no part of the Syntonic Wireless, Inc. business is 
included in the financial results of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
The  net  loss  attributable  to  members  of  the  Company  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  was  $659,618  (2015: 
$210,846). The increase in the net loss from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 is largely attributable to business development 
expenses of $429,667 (2015: $62,400) incurred by the Company during the 2016 financial year relating to business 
development activities associated with the Acquisition, including the identification, assessment, and progression of 
the Acquisition, which was announced on 10 December 2015 and completed after the end of the 2016 financial 
year, on 8 July 2016. 
 
At 30 June 2016, the Company had net assets of $2.2 million (2015: $2.2 million).  
 
At  30  June  2016,  the  Company  had  cash  reserves  of  $3.8  million  (2015:  $2.1  million)  (not  including  any  cash 
acquired after year end as part of the Acquisition), leaving the Company fully funded to execute on its business 
expansion plans. The increase in cash is largely attributable to a public share offer by the Company pursuant to its 
prospectus dated 13 May 2016 and supplementary prospectus dated 16 June 2016 which closed on 30 June 2016 
after raising gross proceeds of $2,200,000.
15.  Audit report
This preliminary financial report is based on unaudited financial statements which are currently in the process of 
being audited. It is expected that an unmodified audit report will be issued.

13.  EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO BALANCE DATE
On 8 July 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of Syntonic Wireless, Inc. 
(“Acquisition”) after issuing 1,200,000,000 ordinary shares and 500,000,000 performance shares (“Consideration 
Securities”) to the vendors, following shareholder approval received at the Company’s general meeting held on 23 
May 2016; 
 
For accounting purposes, the Acquisition will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition under Australian Accounting 
Standard AASB 3 “Business Combinations” in the 2017 financial year. The acquirer has been identified as Syntonic 
Wireless,  Inc.  notwithstanding  that  the  Company  is  the  legal  parent  of  the  group.  Under  reverse  acquisition 
accounting, the consolidated financial statements are issued under the name of the legal parent (i.e. the Company) 
but are a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (i.e. Syntonic Wireless, Inc.), with the assets 
and liabilities of the legal subsidiary being recognised and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts 
rather than their fair values. Consequently, in the 2017 financial year, the Group will recognise an expense in its 
statement of comprehensive income, effectively representing the cost of the listing. This cost is calculated as the 
difference in the fair value of the equity instruments that Syntonic Wireless, Inc. is deemed to have issued to acquire 
the Company and the fair value of the Company’s identifiable net liabilities;
(iii)  On 8 July 2016, the Company completed its public share offer (“Public Offer”) pursuant to its prospectus dated 13 
May 2016 and supplementary prospectus dated 16 June 2016 after issuing 100,000,000 ordinary shares at an issue 
price of $0.022 per share to raise the maximum amount of A$2,200,000, following shareholder approval received 
at the Company’s general meeting held on 23 May 2016;
(iv)  On 8 July 2016, the Company appointed Mr Gary Greenbaum as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer 
(“CEO”) and Mr Rahul Agarwal as Executive Director, President and Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”). Mr David 
Parker resigned as Director;
(v)
On 12 July 2016, the Company changed its name to “Syntonic Limited” following shareholder approval received at 
the Company’s general meeting held on 23 May 2016;
(vi)  On 20 July 2016, the Company was reinstated to official quotation on the ASX under the new ASX ticker “SYT”
following the Company’s compliance with listing rule 11.1.3 and chapters 1 and 2 of the ASX Listing Rules; and
(vii)  On 1 August 2016, the Company announced that it had extended its strategic software licensing agreement with 
Tata Communications, a leading provider of a new world of communications. The two companies have agreed to 
enhance their partnership with a perpetual license of the Company’s technologies to more effectively capture the 
estimated US$23 billion sponsored data market opportunity, including expanding sponsored content services into 
Southeast Asia, U.S., and Latin America.
Other than as outlined above, there are no matters or circumstances which have arisen since 30 June 2016 that have 
significantly affected or may significantly affect:

