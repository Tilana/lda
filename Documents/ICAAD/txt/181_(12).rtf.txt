Hearing: 18th September 2003
Ruling: 18th September 2003

RULING

The photographs of the Post Mortem of the deceased are excluded. They have no probative value at all. Photograph 1 is not objected to. Photograph 2 has a caption which has no direct evidence to show that the deceased was squatting when speared. The photograph itself, subject to cross-examination has probative value because it will give the assessors an idea of the scene. The caption is excluded.

Photograph 3 is admissible. Photograph 4 is admissible. Photograph 5 is admissible. Photograph 6 is admissible without the caption which is disputed. Photograph 14 is admissible.
