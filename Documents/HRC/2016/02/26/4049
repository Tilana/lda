</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>

of person, 
</p>

Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on human rights and terrorism and on 
the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>all General Assembly resolutions on the United Nations

Strategy, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices 
of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever 
committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and 
renewing its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and 
combat terrorism,   
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms 
and manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, 
</p>
<p>

to prevent and combat terrorism,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming further </i>that the promotion and protection of human rights for all 
and the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, and recognizing that 
effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not 
conflicting goals, but are complementary and mutually reinforcing,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring </i>the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their families, 
expressing its profound solidarity with them, and stressing the importance of 
providing them with assistance, 
</p>

Victims of Terrorism of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, 
including its workshop in Siracusa, Italy, held on 2 and 3 December 2010, on best 
practices on supporting victims of acts of terrorism, and taking note of other efforts 
made by the United Nations in this field, including the meetings of the Expert Group

</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the work on victims of terrorism of the Special Rapporteur on 
Terrorism and Human Rights of the Subcommission for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights, </p>

victims of terrorist acts,
