<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
was established pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/58 and was 
recently extended by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 22/14. The present report, 
submitted pursuant to Council resolution 22/14 and General Assembly resolution 68/242, 
covers human rights developments in Myanmar since the reports of the Special Rapporteur 
to the Council in March 2013 (A/HRC/22/58) and to the Assembly in October 2013 
(A/68/397). The present report to the Council is the last by the current mandate holder 
before the end of his six-year term in May 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. From 14 to 19 February 2014, the Special Rapporteur conducted his ninth mission to 
Myanmar. He expresses his thanks to the Government for its cooperation during the visit. 
He visited Thailand from 10 to 13 February 2014 and also expresses his thanks to the 
Government of Thailand for its cooperation.1 
</p>
<p>3. He continued to engage with the Government of Myanmar through its Permanent 
Representatives in Geneva and New York. He sent nine joint communications between 1 
June and 30 November 2013 and, by 31 January 2014, the Government had replied to eight 
of those communications.2 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prisoners of conscience 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur highlights the release of prisoners of conscience as one of 
the most significant achievements of the Government of Myanmar. Since May 2011, there 
have been 15 presidential amnesties, resulting in the release of over 1,100 prisoners of 
conscience. The most recent amnesty, announced by the President on 30 December 2013, 
was aimed at fulfilling his pledge in July 2013 to release all political prisoners by the end of 
the year. The Special Rapporteur highlights that about 33 prisoners of conscience remain in 
detention, including Tun Aung, Kyaw Hla Aung and three international non-governmental 
organization (NGO) workers in Rakhine State. In Sittwe prison, he met with a Rohingya 
prisoner of conscience, Than Shwe, who had been detained because he had reportedly tried 
to meet with the Special Rapporteur during his visit to Buthidaung in August 2013. 
Furthermore, people are still being arrested and imprisoned for their peaceful political 
activities in Myanmar.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur notes that the presidential pardon of 30 December 2013 
included those convicted and being prosecuted under the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful 
Procession Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, articles 122, 124 (a) and 505 of the Penal 
Code, the Law to Safeguard the State from the Danger of Subversive Elements and the 
Emergency Provisions Act of 1950. However, the Special Rapporteur highlights that those

 Links to the communications referred to herein are contained in the communications reports of special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fourth 
(A/HRC/24/21) and twenty-fifth (A/HRC/25/74) sessions.  </p>


<p>laws remain on the books and new prosecutions are taking place under them, and urges the 
Government to expedite their abolition/amendment.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur commends the work of the prisoner review committee set up 
in February 2013 to identify remaining prisoners of conscience. He recommends that the 
Government continue to convene meetings of that committee and, furthermore, upgrade the 
status of the committee to enable it to investigate suspected cases of prisoners of 
conscience, including in Rakhine State, which entails access to prisons and the authority to 
question relevant state officials. 
</p>
<p>7. Referring to the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious 
Violations of International Humanitarian Law, the Special Rapporteur highlights the 
obligations of the State to former prisoners of conscience, which include equal and 
effective access to justice; adequate, effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered; and 
access to relevant information concerning violations and reparation mechanisms. 
Reparations involve restitution, including restoration of the enjoyment of human rights and 
of employment; compensation, including for economically assessable damage; 
rehabilitation, including medical and psychological care as well as legal and social services; 
satisfaction, including public disclosure of the truth, the restoration of the dignity, 
reputation and rights of the victim and a public apology; and guarantees of non-repetition, 
including ensuring effective civilian control of military and security forces and 
strengthening the independence of the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
former prisoners of conscience are required to declare criminal records when applying for 
jobs, education or vocational training. This has a detrimental effect on their right to work 
and their access to education. Other difficulties faced on release included access to 
passports.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Conditions of detention and treatment of prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the ongoing practice of torture in 
places of detention in Myanmar and the absence of accountability. He recently wrote to the 
Government regarding the emblematic cases of Myo Myint Swe and Than Htun; the 
Government has provided formal replies.3 During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur 
met with the family of Than Htun. Despite the extensive evidence to support the allegation 
that the police tortured Than Htun to death while he was in police custody, township and 
district level courts have refused to let the family file a criminal case against the police. The 
Special Rapporteur has also continued to receive allegations from Kachin State and 
northern Shan State that the military are arbitrarily detaining and torturing, during 
interrogation, young men suspected of belonging to ethnic armed groups. 
</p>
<p>9. Currently, prompt, effective and impartial investigations into allegations of torture 
against police and military personnel do not take place in Myanmar. For instance, no action 
has been taken on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous recommendation (A/68/397, para. 91 
(i)) for an investigation into allegations of torture in Buthidaung prison. Furthermore, 
military and police personnel who are found to be responsible for committing acts of torture 
are not being transparently held to account through the criminal justice system and 
punished in a manner commensurate with the gravity of the offence. In the case of Myo 
Myint Swe, the responsible police personnel were subjected only to internal disciplinary 
measures, involving transfers, dismissals and reduction of police service.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 See A/HRC/23/51, p. 10, and A/HRC/25/74, p. 46. </p>


<p>10. During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur noted some positive steps towards 
tackling the practice of torture, including, as reported by the Minister of Home Affairs, the 
use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in all city police stations. He was informed 
by the Chief Justice that district and high court judges were now utilizing their powers 
under the new Judiciary Act to conduct prison inspections and sending recommendations to 
the Cabinet. He also notes the Government&#8217;s continuing good cooperation with the 
International Committee of the Red Cross following the resumption of prison visits in 
January 2013.  
</p>
<p>11. On 2 January 2014, the President issued an order which commuted all death 
sentences to life imprisonment. The Special Rapporteur commends this move and 
recommends the abolition of the death penalty in Myanmar.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur notes the remarks made in December 2013 by the President, 
Thein Sein, that Myanmar would have an open and free society only if the ongoing political 
reforms continued.4 Since 2011, Myanmar has enjoyed a significant opening of space for 
people to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression. This has been seen in 
particular with the development of greater press freedom, which constitutes one of the 
cornerstones of a democratic society.  
</p>
<p>13. However, the Special Rapporteur highlights that there is a long way to go before 
Myanmar has a free, uncensored and unhindered press. During his latest visit, journalists 
described the prevailing climate of uncertainty, intimidation and fear of arrest, particularly 
if reporting dealt with issues too close to the interests of the military or other powerful 
elites. The Special Rapporteur underlines that this uncertainty is linked to the absence of the 
rule of law in Myanmar, in particular in the sense that the law is not accessible, intelligible, 
clear or predictable; the laws of the land do not apply equally to all; and the laws do not 
afford adequate protection to fundamental human rights, including freedom of opinion and 
expression.  
</p>
<p>14. On 17 December 2013, <i>Daily Eleven</i> reporter Ma Khaing, who was pursuing a story 
on corruption, was sentenced to three months in prison by a court in the Kayah State capital 
Loikaw (three months for trespassing, one month for defamation and one month for abusive 
language, to be served concurrently). In February 2014, an ethnic Rohingya Member of 
Parliament, Shwe Maung, was questioned over comments he reportedly made to the 
Democratic Voice of Burma news agency alleging police involvement in a fire that 
occurred in Maungdaw. Also in February, four journalists and the Chief Executive Officer 
of the <i>Unity</i> newspaper were arrested in connection with a report dated 25 January alleging 
the existence of a government chemical weapons factory in Magway Region and charged 
under article 3 (1) (a) of the 1923 State Secrets Act.  
15. The Special Rapporteur highlights that extreme care must be taken by States to 
ensure that laws relating to national security are applied in a manner that conforms to 
international human rights standards. For instance, laws should not be invoked to suppress 
or withhold information of legitimate public interest that does not harm national security, or 
be used to prosecute journalists or others for having disseminated such information. 
Furthermore, when a State invokes a legitimate ground for restriction of freedom of 
expression, it must demonstrate in specific and individualized fashion the precise nature of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4

<p>the threat, and the necessity and proportionality of the specific action taken, in particular by 
establishing a direct and immediate connection between the expression and the threat. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur highlights that the value of uninhibited expression is 
particularly high in the circumstances of public debate in a democratic society concerning 
figures in the public and political domain. Imprisonment for defamation is disproportionate 
to the offence and is never an appropriate penalty.  
</p>
<p>17. To help avoid resorting to criminal sanctions against journalists, the Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Ministry of Information to make greater use of the Interim Press 
Council to resolve disputes while ensuring that the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression is fully upheld. He also encourages reference to general comment No. 34 (2011) 
of the Human Rights Committee, which provides guidance on the implementation of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression that is particularly relevant to Myanmar at this 
point in its democratic transition.  
</p>
<p>18. The Media Bill, drafted by the Interim Press Council, and the Printing and 
Publishing Enterprise Bill, drafted by the Ministry of Information, have both been passed 
by the lower and upper houses of the parliament and are now with the Union Assembly. 
The Special Rapporteur received assurances from the Minister of Information that the 
Ministry&#8217;s bill had been amended to remove the power of a registration official, situated in 
the Ministry of Information, to grant and revoke publishing licences, and that the 
registration procedure with criminal penalties for violations had been replaced with a 
voluntary acknowledgement procedure which would play more of an enabling role for 
publishers, for example, in helping to resolve copyright disputes. While encouraged by 
those assurances, the Special Rapporteur is unclear on the details of the revisions and is still 
concerned about the remaining government licensing powers and content regulation in the 
draft law. He urges the Union Assembly to take into consideration his previous concerns 
regarding that bill (A/68/397, para. 16) when considering final amendments prior to 
adoption.  
</p>
<p>19. Laws that have previously been used to violate the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression remain on the books, including the 2004 Electronic Transactions Act and the 
1950 Emergency Provisions Act. The Special Rapporteur was assured by the Minister of 
Information that those laws were currently being reviewed by respective departments and 
the parliament to ensure they were &#8220;in conformity with the current situation&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur has yet to see the final outcome of the review of the laws or the passing of new 
laws relevant to media freedom, including a new broadcast media bill. He calls for 
continued monitoring and engagement in the process by national and international actors to 
help ensure those laws meet international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of developing a culture of ethical 
and responsible journalism. He is encouraged by the countrywide consultative process that 
the Interim Press Council, in collaboration with International Media Support, is currently 
engaged in to establish a code of ethics for journalists, which he hopes will include 
elements to counter hate speech. He was encouraged to learn from the Minister of 
Information of the work being done to promote professionalism in journalism, which 
includes the planned opening in July 2014 of a journalism school offering one-year diploma 
courses, as well as the development of other journalism courses for students and 
practitioners across the country. He highlights the importance of also training government 
departments&#8217; newly appointed spokespersons in ethical engagement with the media. 
</p>
<p>21. The relationship between the proscription of hate speech and the flourishing of 
freedom of expression should be seen as complementary. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that the Government is not fulfilling its international human rights obligation to </p>


<p>tackle incitement to violence based on national, racial or religious hatred. Community-
based, political and religious groups have been conducting, with impunity, well-organized 
and coordinated campaigns of incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence against 
Rohingya and other Muslim minorities. The Government has a duty, under international 
human rights law, to investigate the nature and extent of the harm caused to persons and 
groups as a result of hostility and violence incited on the basis of racial or religious hatred, 
and to hold the perpetrators to account with proportionate punishments. For further 
guidance on tackling hate speech in accordance with international human rights standards, 
the Special Rapporteur highlights general recommendation No. 35 (2013) of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association 
</b></p>
<p>22. On 30 November 2013, President Thein Sein spoke of the need to restore the &#8220;long-
weakened trust&#8221; between the Government and the people and of the Government&#8217;s 
intention to intensify its cooperation with civil society organizations. While acknowledging 
the important progress Myanmar has made since 2011 in upholding the rights of people to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, the Special Rapporteur remains 
concerned that important legislative changes have not yet taken place to allow the 
President&#8217;s vision of further progress to be realized.  
</p>
<p>23. The presidential pardon of 30 December resulted in the pardoning of hundreds of 
people prosecuted for participating in peaceful assemblies. However, the problematic laws 
remain on the books and continue to be used; in January 2014, 10 people were charged 
under article 18 of the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act. People involved in 
protests concerning business and development projects, including land confiscation, remain 
particularly vulnerable to arrest. In Kachin State, the Special Rapporteur met with Bauk Ja, 
who had recently been released from detention following spurious charges the Special 
Rapporteur believes stem from her outspoken campaign against land confiscations in 
Hukaung Valley, Kachin State. Furthermore, the law is being applied in an arbitrary way, 
with other demonstrations that appear to align with Government interests being allowed to 
take place.  
</p>
<p>24. In February, the Chair of the Bill Committee of the upper house informed the 
Special Rapporteur that an amendment of article 18 of the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful 
Procession Act was currently being discussed in the lower house and would later go to the 
upper house for consideration. The Special Rapporteur urges the parliament to ensure the 
amendment of article 18, including through the replacement of the permit system and 
criminal sanctions with a voluntary notification procedure (see A/68/397, para. 23). 
</p><p>25. The Attorney General informed the Special Rapporteur that discussions on repealing 
the Unlawful Associations Act and amending articles 143, 145, 152 and 505 of the Penal 
Code were ongoing in the parliament. The Special Rapporteur has been advocating for the 
amendment of those laws since the beginning of his mandate in 2008 and calls on the 
parliament to expedite their amendment.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur notes that a new associations law, to replace the 1988 Act 
relating to the Formation of Organizations, is still before the parliament. He welcomes the 
process of consultation with civil society and international organizations by the lower 
house&#8217;s Public Affairs Management Committee and Bills Committee on the bill and is, 
moreover, encouraged that the consultation led to significant improvements in the draft law 
which addressed some of the concerns raised in his previous report (A/68/397, para. 25). 
Most notably, criminal penalties (imprisonment for up to six months) for joining an 
unregistered organization and the compulsory registration requirement were reportedly </p>


<p>removed. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by updates received just prior to 
publication of the present report that some parliamentarians were trying to reinsert those 
provisions, and urges the parliament to ensure that the law meets international standards.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Human rights concerns in the context of development 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of establishing a system of 
individual titling and tenure rights for smallholders to protect people against land 
appropriation and forced evictions, as the process of economic development proceeds. He 
met with residents of a village in northern Yangon who had recently been forcibly evicted 
and their homes demolished after being told they were living in a military zone. Forced 
evictions constitute a gross violation of a range of human rights related to housing, health, 
education, livelihoods and security of person. Furthermore, a collective or communal tenure 
system for land, fisheries and forests should be put in place to protect the access of local 
communities to common goods and ensure that the land can be converted to new uses only 
with their free, prior and informed consent. Amendments to the Farmland Law and the 
Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Law are also required (see A/68/397, para. 29). The 
Special Rapporteur stresses that issues relating to land rights will be one of the primary 
challenges for the Government over the years to come, which can only be addressed by 
respecting human rights standards and principles. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, due to the absence of an independent 
judiciary and the rule of law, people are currently not able to challenge decisions on 
evictions or claim their rights to just compensation in a court of law. Furthermore, those 
trying to claim their rights by peacefully protesting forced evictions and land confiscations 
are being subjected to excessive use of force by the police, arbitrary arrest and detention 
and criminal prosecution. For example, in August 2013, 10 protestors were reportedly 
arrested by police while peacefully protesting with about 50 local villagers against the 
Letpadaung copper mine project in Monywa, and subsequently charged under article 18 of 
the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act. Nine of the protestors were reportedly 
released after having signed a declaration that they would not protest again. The remaining 
protestor, Naw Ohn Hla, was convicted by Monywa Court on 29 August 2013 under article 
505 (b) of the Penal Code and sentenced to two years of imprisonment. She was 
subsequently released on 25 November 2013 following the 15 November presidential 
amnesty.  
</p>
<p>29. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the copper mines of Monywa in the Sagaing 
Region, he met with local residents and listened to their grievances over the Letpadaung 
copper mine, including with regard to forced relocation, loss of livelihoods (in particular 
farmers who had lost the land they had worked for generations) and health problems related 
to the proximity of the project. He also met with two monks who had been left badly 
scarred following the use of incendiary devices by police in their attempt to clear a protest 
site in November 2012. He is concerned that many of the recommendations from the 
parliamentary commission set up to help address local grievances have not been 
implemented, and urges the Government to address that.  
</p>
<p>30. In Monywa, he met with youths from a local school in Kangone village, who 
described the detrimental effect on their health that they believed the sulphuric acid plant in 
nearby Mogyoe had caused. To help address those concerns, he urges the publication of the 
environmental and social impact assessment of the Letpadaung copper mine and prompt 
follow-up to the recommendations. Furthermore, he urges the Government to make 
environmental and social impact assessments a legal requirement for all large-scale 
development projects in Myanmar.  </p>


<p>31. The Special Rapporteur also met, in Monywa, with representatives from Wanbao, 
the Chinese company active in developing the copper mine at Letpadaung, who expressed 
their commitment to addressing the concerns of the local community. The Special 
Rapporteur highlights the responsibility of all investors and businesses to abide by the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations 
&#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework (A/HRC/17/31, annex). He recommends that 
human rights impact assessments be incorporated into the environmental and social impact 
assessments undertaken by large-scale development projects, which requires meaningful 
consultations with potentially affected groups before the start of the project. He also 
highlights the guiding principles on human rights impact assessments of trade and 
investment agreements (see A/HRC/19/59/Add.5) as providing pertinent guidance on how 
Myanmar can ensure that the trade and investment agreements it concludes are consistent 
with its international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the good progress Myanmar has made in 
recent months in preparing for Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative candidature. 
Membership will help to improve openness and the accountable management of revenues 
from natural resources. With the full disclosure of taxes and other payments made by oil, 
gas and mining companies, the public will be able to see how much the Government is 
receiving from the country&#8217;s natural resources. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Situation in ethnic border areas 
</b></p>
<p>33. Ceasefire agreements have now been signed between the Government and 14 ethnic 
armed groups, which is a major achievement. The Kachin Independence Army and the 
Ta&#8217;ang (Palaung) National Liberation Army are the two major ethnic armed groups not to 
have signed. During his meeting with the Minister of the President&#8217;s Office, U Aung Min, 
the Special Rapporteur learned of the efforts to secure a national ceasefire accord by April 
and the plans for subsequent political dialogue.  
</p>
<p>34. Fighting continues in Kachin State and northern Shan State, with military operations 
ongoing against the Kachin Independence Army, the Shan State Army-North and the 
Ta&#8217;ang (Palaung) National Liberation Army. During his drive from Myitkyina to Laiza, a 
non-Government controlled town in Kachin State, the Special Rapporteur witnessed the 
physical destruction the fighting had brought to villages since fighting restarted in June 
2011 following the breakdown of a 17-year ceasefire. Clashes in October and November 
2013 displaced more than 2,400 people in Mansi, southern Kachin State, including 1,600 
people from Nam Lim Pa who were displaced for the second time to internally displaced 
persons&#8217; (IDP) camps bordering Chin State and northern Shan State. In total, some 100,000 
people remain displaced in Kachin and northern Shan State. While in Laiza, the Special 
Rapporteur visited the Je Yang IDP camp to speak with people who had been violently 
displaced during military advances into their villages in August 2011, and listened to 
allegations of human rights violations suffered by their families and community members. 
This included more recent allegations of sexual violence against Kachin women and the 
arbitrary detention and torture, during interrogation, of young Kachin men. Since his 
previous report, the Special Rapporteur has continued to receive allegations of serious 
human rights violations accompanying military offensives. This includes allegations that 
more than 100 women and girls had been raped by army soldiers since 2010, and reports of 
47 cases of gang rape and 28 women dying as a result of their injuries. Most of the cases 
are linked to the military offensives in Kachin State and northern Shan State since 2011. 
</p>
<p>35. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has highlighted the widespread and 
systematic human rights violations that have accompanied the armed conflict in the ethnic </p>


<p>border areas and the absence of accountability. In advance of a national ceasefire accord 
that is implemented by all sides, he reiterates his call for military and non-State actors to 
abide by humanitarian and human rights law. Furthermore, he hopes to see included in the 
eventual nationwide ceasefire accord specific references to respect for human rights and 
humanitarian law, which could be incorporated into a code of conduct for the military and 
ethnic armed groups.  
</p>
<p>36. The ethnic armed groups the Special Rapporteur met during his latest visit retain 
high levels of mistrust towards the Government and the military. That is partly due to the 
poor implementation of ceasefire agreements. Establishing a comprehensive system of 
monitoring will need to form an integral part of the next stage of negotiations. Monitoring 
groups should be given freedom of movement and include representation from civil society 
and community-based groups. During his meeting with Aung Min, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomed the news that progress is being made with the establishment of local monitoring 
groups, and was encouraged by his openness to future international participation in such 
monitoring. The United Nationalities Federal Council in Chiang Mai, Thailand informed 
the Special Rapporteur that international participation in monitoring would play an 
important role in reassuring the ethnic armed groups that agreements were being 
implemented and, subsequently, help to build trust. 
</p>
<p>37. The Government has made clear that political dialogue will follow the signing of a 
national ceasefire agreement. However, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings with ethnic 
armed groups, there was deep-seated mistrust that this would happen, which finds its source 
in a long history of ceasefires which have not led to political dialogue on underlying 
grievances. The Government will therefore need to set a clear time frame for prompt 
progress towards political talks following the signing of a national ceasefire accord, and 
stick firmly to that timetable. 
</p>
<p>38. In October&#8217;s monthly radio address (2013), the President acknowledged that 
ceasefire agreements alone would not lead to lasting peace and that the root causes of the 
problems would have to be resolved through political means. He also stated that the peace 
process would only be successful if it was fully inclusive, which the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of political dialogue abiding 
by the human rights principles of participation, transparency, accountability, equality and 
non-discrimination. This will require greater participation and representation of local 
communities and women. Ceasefire talks have so far been limited mostly to male leaders on 
both sides. Addressing those flaws in the process will help to ensure that political talks 
forge agreements which address the underlying grievances of the ethnic minority groups, 
including their full range of human rights concerns.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes that, since his visit in August 2013, humanitarian 
access has improved to the over 50,000 IDPs in non-government controlled areas in Kachin 
State and northern Shan State. However, access is still granted on an ad hoc basis and he 
urges the state and national governments to ensure regular, systematic access for 
humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>40. About 400,000 people remain internally displaced in the south-east of Myanmar, 
with a further 120,000 refugees living in temporary sites along the Thai-Myanmar border. 
Some of the refugees have been residing in the Thai-Myanmar border camps for more than 
25 years. During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur heard from refugees about their 
feelings of insecurity when contemplating a return to Myanmar, which included uncertainty 
about access to land and livelihoods and concerns about how secure their land would be 
from confiscation by the military or the ethnic armed groups. The Special Rapporteur 
highlights the relevance of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the 
Principles on Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons. He </p>


<p>recommends that clauses which protect and promote the land rights of existing, displaced 
and returning ethnic populations be incorporated into ceasefire and political agreements, 
and that they include the restitution and recognition of land titles and tenure rights of 
villagers.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the continuing implementation of the joint action 
plan to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers signed by the Government and the 
United Nations in June 2012. On 18 January 2014, 96 children and young persons were 
released from the Myanmar Armed Forces. This follows earlier releases of 68 children and 
young people on 7 August 2013, 42 in July 2013, 24 in February 2013 and 42 in September 
</p><p>2012. He encourages the Government to accelerate the identification and release of all 
children in the national armed forces and border guard forces, including by providing 
unimpeded access to its military sites by the country task force. The Special Rapporteur 
commends the recent commitment of the Government of Myanmar to ratify International 
Labour Organization Convention No. 182 (1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate 
Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. He urges the Government 
to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict in order to further bolster those positive steps. To 
prevent future underage recruitment, he recommends the strengthening of recruitment 
procedures, age verification mechanisms and oversight of all recruitment sites in the 
country, as well as the bringing to justice of those responsible for child recruitment or use, 
including those with command responsibility and civilian brokers who assist in the 
unlawful recruitment of children. Furthermore, he highlights the need for child protection 
mechanisms to be fully incorporated into peace and ceasefire agreements, and calls for joint 
action plans to also be drawn up with non-State armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Situation in Rakhine State 
</b></p>
<p>42. During his latest visit to Rakhine State, the Special Rapporteur saw no 
improvements in the human rights situation. Instead, as time passes without clear action at 
the state and national level to address the widespread discrimination and human rights 
violations occurring there, the situation continues to worsen from an already dire state.  
</p>
<p>43. The Government has stated that Buddhist and Muslim communities are separated to 
maintain stability and protect the lives of the populations from both communities, and has 
publicly announced its intention to reintegrate communities once trust is rebuilt. In this 
regard, the Government is working with interfaith groups and is sending messages from the 
President&#8217;s Office which promote mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence.  
</p>
<p>44. The practice of separating communities continues to have a severe impact on the 
Muslim populations in Rakhine State, and in particular the Rohingya community. 
Discriminatory and stringent restrictions on freedom of movement for Muslim populations 
remain in place, which continue to affect a range of other human rights, including the right 
to life. In February, the Special Rapporteur again visited Aung Mingalar, the only 
remaining Muslim neighbourhood in Sittwe, which he described as a ghetto. In Aung 
Mingalar ward, he heard from residents that the population had fallen by around 1,600 
compared to his August visit. Many had left to risk their lives on rickety boats to reach 
neighbouring countries, where those who survived the journey were subjected to further 
human rights violations, including human trafficking. Residents are still prevented from 
leaving the quarter by armed guards and wire fencing, and are reliant on food being 
delivered from a nearby market. Only one medical assistant is provided, by an international 
NGO, for all 4,375 residents of the ward. In view of the limited access to hospitals, more 
outreach of medical assistance is required. A limited number of teachers are entering the </p>


<p>ward to provide education for the children. About 700 university students have been unable 
to gain access to education since May 2012. Working-age residents, many of whom are 
traders, remain unable to access their livelihoods. The Special Rapporteur also visited the 
Khoung Dote Khar Rohingya IDP camp in Sittwe. The violations of the rights to freedom 
of movement, access to health care, education, livelihoods and places of worship he saw in 
the IDP camp and Aung Mingalar represent a microcosm of the violations suffered by the 
140,000 people still in IDP camps and the 36,000 people living in crisis-affected villages 
across Rakhine State, the vast majority of whom are Rohingya. Of the six hospitals in 
Rakhine State, only two are currently accepting Muslim patients (with a limited number of 
beds provided).  
</p><p>45. Ordinary Rakhine Buddhists have a genuine and legitimate desire to have their 
economic, social and cultural rights respected, promoted and protected after years of 
neglect. The grievances of the Rakhine Buddhist community must be heard, including with 
regard to the regulation and management of borders and to immigration policy. Local 
communities under the poverty line and without electricity have voiced their grievances 
about not receiving the benefits from projects such as the Kyaukpyu&#8211;Kunming dual oil and 
gas pipeline in Rakhine State, and they need to be listened to. However, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that influential community, political and religious groups are 
propagating an agenda to rid Rakhine State of the estimated one million Rohingyas who 
live there. The organizers of hate campaigns (see para. 21 above) and the instigators of 
violence continue to act with impunity. The United Nations and international NGO actors, 
who are providing life-saving humanitarian assistance to all communities in Rakhine State, 
continue to be harassed and threatened by those groups, with some forced to terminate their 
operations. Local and central authorities are not intervening to fulfil their obligations under 
international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>46. Since the violence broke out in June 2012, the Special Rapporteur has highlighted 
the obligation of the State to hold those responsible for human rights violations to account. 
Yet up to this point, no credible investigation has taken place to uncover the human rights 
violations that have occurred there. The Government has prosecuted people from both 
communities accused of being involved in the violence. However, no State officials have 
been held to account and, in the absence of an independent and credible investigation, it 
remains unclear whether the main perpetrators have been prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>47. During his latest visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the chief of Rakhine State 
police. He informed the Special Rapporteur that in Du Chee Yar Tan village (in Maungdaw 
township) on 13 and 14 January 2014, the police conducted a large security operation 
involving over 100 police officers armed with live ammunition to search for a police officer 
who was taken by the villagers and reportedly killed. He stated that homes had been 
searched in the village and surrounding areas, but that no warrant had been secured to do 
that. He said that journalists and NGOs had been denied access to the village, but that the 
United Nations and diplomatic community had been on accompanied visits. He denied that 
there had been any incident that had compromised the physical integrity or property of the 
villagers. However, the Special Rapporteur has continued to receive allegations of serious 
human rights violations being committed during that police operation, which also involved 
Rakhine mobs, including allegations of the brutal killing of men, women and children, 
sexual violence against women and the looting and burning of properties.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that domestic investigations have so far failed 
to satisfactorily address these serious allegations. He recognizes that the Government has 
shown a willingness to engage with the international community on key issues such as 
forced labour, economic development and even training in international human rights 
standards for the police and military. He urges that cooperation to extend to one of the most </p>


<p>important challenges that Myanmar is facing, which is to address its long history of 
impunity. He therefore recommends that the Human Rights Council work with the 
Government on this latest incident to establish a credible investigation to uncover the truth 
of what happened in Du Chee Yar Tan and to hold anyone responsible for human rights 
violations to account. The Special Rapporteur believes that investigations conducted with 
the involvement and support of the international community, including in relation to 
technical assistance, represent an opportunity to turn the tide of impunity in Rakhine State.  
</p>
<p>49. In addition to tackling impunity, the other underlying issue that the Government is 
failing to address is the systematic discrimination against and marginalization of the 
Rohingya community. To tackle this requires key legislative changes. For more than 20 
years, holders of the special procedures mandate on the situation of human rights in 
Myanmar have been advocating reform of the 1982 Citizenship Act. Particularly 
problematic under international human rights law is the provision referring to certain 
&#8220;national&#8221; and &#8220;ethnic&#8221; groups as Myanmar citizens, specified by authorities in a list of 8 
&#8220;national&#8221; and 135 &#8220;ethnic&#8221; groups. The majority of Myanmar citizens have automatically 
acquired citizenship under this provision by virtue of belonging to one of those groups. In 
practice, that has led to &#8220;nationals&#8221; and &#8220;ethnic groups&#8221; not contained in those listings 
being discriminated against on the basis of race and ethnicity in their access to citizenship, 
including the Rohingya Muslims, as well as persons of Indian, Chinese and Nepali descent, 
which is in contravention of international human rights law. To bring the Citizenship Act 
into line with international standards, race and ethnicity cannot be determining factors in 
the granting of citizenship. Instead, the law needs to provide for objective criteria that 
comply with the principle of non-discrimination, such as birth in the territory and descent 
(with citizenship being passed through a parent who is a citizen). 
</p><p>50. The Government has stated that, &#8220;it is crucial for non-Rakhine community [sic] to 
accept the population verification process&#8221; that is being proposed as &#8220;an initial step for 
resettlement and access to livelihoods, freedom of movement and citizenship among 
others&#8221;.5 The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that if that exercise is conducted in 
accordance with international human rights standards, including with regard to consultation 
with affected communities and enabling ethnic groups to self-identify, it could be an 
important initiative to help address the issue of citizenship in Rakhine State.  
</p>
<p>51. Taking into consideration the information and allegations the Special Rapporteur has 
received throughout the course of his six years on this mandate,6 including during his five 
visits to Rakhine State, and in particular since the June 2012 violence and its aftermath, he 
concludes that the pattern of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Rakhine 
State may constitute crimes against humanity as defined under the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. He believes that extrajudicial killing, rape and other forms of 
sexual violence, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment in detention, denial of due 
process and fair trial rights, and the forcible transfer and severe deprivation of liberty of 
populations has taken place on a large scale and has been directed against the Rohingya 
Muslim population in Rakhine State. He believes that the deprivation of health care is 
deliberately targeting the Rohingya population, and that the increasingly permanent 
segregation of that population is taking place. Furthermore, he believes that those human 
rights violations are connected to discriminatory and persecutory policies against the

<p>Rohingya Muslim population, which also include ongoing official and unofficial practices 
from both local and central authorities restricting rights to nationality, movement, marriage, 
family, health and privacy. In the country&#8217;s ongoing process of democratic transition and 
national reconciliation, the human rights situation in Rakhine State will be a critical 
challenge for the Government of Myanmar and the international community to address.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Democratic transition and establishing the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>52. In assessing the reforms that have been initiated so far, the Special Rapporteur stresses 
that they can only be viewed as the start of a long process of reform that will be required to 
address the deep-seated human rights issues in Myanmar, which includes developing an 
independent judiciary and tackling impunity for human rights violations. In that regard, he 
notes President Thein Sein&#8217;s comment during his nationwide address on 1 December 2013 
that the level of achievement so far is &#8220;comparable to a sprout that has just come out of a 
seed&#8221;.7 The Special Rapporteur believes that looking back at the four core human rights 
elements that he specified at the start of his mandate in 2008 will help to objectively put into 
perspective how far reforms have progressed and how much further they need to go.  
</p>
<p>53. The judiciary was the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s fourth core human rights element. An 
independent, impartial and effective judiciary is essential for the transition to democracy to 
uphold the rule of law, ensure checks and balances on the executive and legislative 
branches of government, and to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms in 
Myanmar. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the President&#8217;s acknowledgement in 
September 2013 that the Government needed to work hard to strengthen an independent 
judiciary so that the rule of law could prevail in the country.  
</p><p>54. However, there has been little progress in introducing fundamental reforms to the 
judiciary, and the gist of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommended measures under the fourth 
core element remain pertinent: establish a judiciary that is impartial and independent, 
including from the direct control of the Government and the military; guarantee due process 
of law; refrain from charging individuals for alleged infringement of national laws that are 
in contravention of the international human rights obligations of Myanmar; establish 
mechanisms to investigate allegations of human rights violations; and seek international 
technical assistance with a view to establishing an independent and impartial judiciary that 
is consistent with international standards and principles. Most progress has been seen with 
this final recommended measure; during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s latest visit, the Attorney 
General and the Chief Justice outlined to him a range of trainings, seminars and technical 
assistance programmes that were taking place with the international community. 
</p>
<p>55. The required fundamental reforms to the judiciary will need to be initiated by the 
Government. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to muster the political will to 
instigate reforms which fulfil international standards, including the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary, the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, the Guidelines 
on the Role of Prosecutors, the Procedures for the Effective Implementation of the Basic 
Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and the Beijing Statement of Principles of 
the Independence of the Judiciary. He also encourages the Government to invite the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers to conduct a country visit to 
Myanmar in the near future to assist with the development of a programme of reform.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7

<p>56. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the role of lawyers in establishing the rule of law 
in Myanmar, including in upholding fair trial rights and in helping to ensure that laws are 
applied in line with international human rights standards. He remains concerned about the 
lack of protection of lawyers against reprisals, including violence, threats and 
discrimination, particularly for those involved in cases considered to be politically 
sensitive. He urges the parliament to amend the Bar Council Act to transform the Bar 
Council into a self-governing professional association to defend the integrity and 
independence of the profession and maintain professional standards in accordance with the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers and other international standards. He highlights the 
responsibility of all branches of government to ensure the protection of lawyers against 
reprisals and, furthermore, recommends that the parliament reform the contempt of court 
laws to ensure that lawyers cannot be subjected to sanctions because of their association 
with politically sensitive cases. 
</p>
<p>57. While the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission, established by Presidential 
decree in September 2011, has undertaken some good initiatives, the Special Rapporteur 
highlights that it is not an independent institution. Noting that the international community 
has provided technical advice on a new draft enabling law, he stresses the importance of the 
parliament passing a law which establishes a Commission in accordance with the principles 
relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights 
(the Paris Principles), including with regard to the selection of commissioners.  
</p><p>58. Regarding the review of national legislation referred to in the first core human rights 
element, the Special Rapporteur observes that, of the 16 laws and sections of the Penal 
Code originally identified as in need of reform (A/63/341, para. 93), only one has been 
repealed (the Law Protecting the Peaceful and Systematic Transfer of State Responsibility 
and the Successful Performance of the Functions of the National Convention against 
Disturbance and Oppositions); the rest are under consideration by the parliament or the 
relevant ministries (A/68/397, para. 67).  
59. Furthermore, for national reconciliation and the democratic transition to proceed, 
important changes to the Constitution are also needed. The 109-member joint committee for 
reviewing the 2008 Constitution, set up by the parliament on 25 July 2013, reported at the 
end of 2013 that it had received 28,247 letters of suggested reforms from the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches of Government. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
President&#8217;s remarks in January 2014 that a healthy constitution must be amended from time 
to time to address the national, economic and social needs of Myanmar society, to 
strengthen democratic attitudes and values and to facilitate national reconciliation and the 
peace process.  
</p>
<p>60. Reforms to the Constitution will be needed to embrace the aspirations of ethnic 
communities to have their human rights respected, to have a say in Government decisions and 
to benefit from the resources held within their lands. Furthermore, to ensure the accountability 
of all State institutions under the rule of law, it is necessary to bring the military under civilian 
control and oversight, which requires amendment of article 20 (b), which currently gives the 
military &#8220;the right to independently administer and adjudicate all affairs of the armed forces&#8221;, 
as well as of article 445, which currently states that &#8220;no proceeding shall be instituted against 
the said [previous] Councils or any member thereof or any member of the Government, in 
respect of any act done in the execution of their respective duties&#8221;. The following 
constitutional provisions require amendment for the overall transition to a democratic system 
of civilian governance to proceed: provisions which allow for military appointees to occupy 
25 per cent of seats in the parliament (arts. 74, 109 (b) and 141 (b)), thereby also providing 
them with an effective veto on constitutional changes; article 232 (b), which requires the 
President to appoint the ministers of Defence, Home Affairs and Border Affairs from lists of </p>


<p>nominees (who can include serving military officers) provided by the Commander-in-Chief; 
and article 40 (c), which authorizes the Commander-in-Chief to assume State sovereign 
power under a broad set of vague conditions related to a state of emergency. To allow the 
people of Myanmar to freely choose their Government, the constitutional provisions that 
currently disqualify persons from standing for election as President or Vice-President, 
including on grounds of the nationality and birthplace of their parents (art. 59 (b)), the length 
of time that they have resided in Myanmar before the election (art. 59 (e)) and the nationality 
of their spouse, their children and the spouses of their children (art. 59 (f)), also require 
amendment. Furthermore, the Constitution needs to affirm that the fundamental human 
rights of all people living in Myanmar need to be respected, and not just those of the citizens 
of Myanmar.  
</p>
<p>61. The third core human rights element concerns the armed forces. Important progress 
has been made in tackling the recruitment of child soldiers (see para. 41 above) and forced 
labour (A/67/383, para. 32), and engagement with the international community has begun 
on training programmes on human rights for members of the armed forces, as well as police 
and prison personnel (although the Special Rapporteur expresses his disappointment that 
the Commander-in-Chief did not agree to meet with him once during his entire six years on 
the mandate, and stresses the need for the military to engage with the international 
community on human rights). The use of landmines has decreased significantly, although 
there has been limited progress in mine surveying and clearance, marking or fencing, with 
an estimated 5.2 million people continuing to live in areas contaminated by landmines, and 
Myanmar has not ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, 
Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Furthermore, 
violations of international human rights and humanitarian law continue where military 
operations are ongoing (see para. 34 above), and there is no progress in tackling the 
impunity under which the military forces currently operate.  
</p>
<p>62. Most progress has been made with the second core human rights element: the 
progressive release of political prisoners (see para. 4 above). However, the releases have 
not been without conditions, with article 401, paragraphs 1, 3 and 4, of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure allowing the application of penalties, such as the imposition of the 
remaining sentence, if a condition of release is judged by the President to have been broken. 
</p><p>63. Reflecting on progress with the four core elements in mind reminds us how far the 
reforms still need to go. The Special Rapporteur believes that, in pursuing those reforms in 
line with international human rights standards, the Government would benefit greatly from 
the presence of an Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) country office with a full toolbox. He is therefore concerned that progress 
towards its establishment continues to be slow, nearly a year and a half since the invitation 
was made by the Government, and encourages more speedy progress.  
</p>
<p><b>  I. Truth, justice and accountability 
</b>64. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that a truthful account of past human rights 
violations is needed to inform the ongoing process of democratic reform and national 
reconciliation. He continues to encourage the parliament to take forward the initiative to 
establish a truth commission as a step towards ensuring truth, justice and accountability. He 
also encourages other initiatives, some of which have already begun, such as 
commemorations, memorials and documentation of the past.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur underlines that fulfilling the rights to truth, justice and 
reparation is an important step towards addressing impunity for human rights violations in 
Myanmar. Furthermore, justice contributes to lasting reconciliation. </p>


<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b>66. <b>Throughout his six years on the mandate, the Special Rapporteur has seen 
significant changes in Myanmar that have brought important improvements to the 
human rights situation, including the release of over 1,100 prisoners of conscience, the 
opening up of space for freedom of expression, the development of political freedoms 
and the holding of free and fair by-elections, and important progress in securing an 
end to fighting in the ethnic border areas. He believes that there is limited space for 
backtracking, although the democratic transition is still in its early stages and remains 
fragile.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>For the time being, the military retains a prevailing role in the life and 
institutions of Myanmar. State institutions in general remain unaccountable and the 
judiciary is not yet functioning as an independent branch of the State. Moreover, the 
rule of law cannot yet be said to exist in Myanmar. In that regard, tackling the 
impunity and systematic discrimination in Rakhine State represents a particular 
challenge which, if left unaddressed, could jeopardize the entire reform process.  
</b>68. <b>A change of mindset still needs to take place within all levels of Government to 
allow civil society, political parties and a free media to flourish beyond the limited 
freedoms that have currently been granted. The energy and enthusiasm of the 
younger generation and of women needs to be allowed to come through, which will, in 
turn, reinvigorate the reform process and ensure that Myanmar secures a successful 
transition. As part of the transition, addressing the past will also become increasingly 
important. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>A critical step will be to secure ceasefire and political agreements with ethnic 
minority groups, so that Myanmar can finally transform itself into a peaceful multi-
ethnic and multi-religious society.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The transition in Myanmar requires systematic support from the international 
community, including in the form of technical assistance and capacity development. It 
will also be essential for Myanmar to build on its progress of engagement on human 
rights, which should include the establishment of an OHCHR country office with a 
full mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur hopes that his time on this mandate has helped to 
improve the human rights situation of the people of Myanmar. After nine visits to the 
country, he is aware of the value that the people place on this mandate, and highlights 
the importance of it continuing to help keep human rights near the top of the reform 
agenda of Myanmar.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur praises the cooperation extended by the Government 
of Myanmar to this mandate. He believes that this cooperation represents a good 
example of how States can progress on human rights through engagement with the 
international community as envisioned in the Charter of the United Nations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Regarding prisoners of conscience, the Government should:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Continue to convene meetings of the prisoner review committee and 
upgrade the status of the committee to enable it to investigate suspected cases of 
prisoners of conscience, including in Rakhine State, which entails access to prisons 
and the authority to question relevant state officials; </b></p>


<p><b>(b) Remove all conditions attached to released prisoners of conscience and 
fulfil its human rights obligations towards former prisoners of conscience, including 
restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-
repetition. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The parliament should prioritize the amendment of laws that continue to be 
used to detain prisoners of conscience, including article 18 of the Peaceful Assembly 
and Peaceful Procession Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, the Emergency 
Provisions Act and article 505 (b) of the Penal Code. In the meantime, the relevant 
authorities, including the police and the courts, should cease to use those or other laws 
to arbitrarily detain and convict people. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>To tackle the continuing practice of torture in places of detention, the 
Government should:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Prioritize the ratification of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocol 
thereto; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that police and military officers alleged to have committed acts of 
torture and ill-treatment are held accountable through the criminal justice system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Expedite the passing of a new prisons law that meets international 
standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Abolish the death penalty.  
</b>76. <b>In relation to the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Government 
should:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that the Printing and Publishing Enterprise Bill and the 
Broadcast Media Bill meet international human rights standards, including with 
regard to government licensing powers and content regulation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Expedite the passing of the media law drafted by the Interim Press 
Council; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Expedite the abolition or review of the Electronic Transactions Act 
(2004), the Motion Picture Act (1996), the Computer Science Development Act (1996), 
the Television and Video Act (1985), the Printers and Publishers Registration Act 
(1962), the Wireless Telegraphy Act (1933), the Emergency Provisions Act (1950) and 
the State Protection Act (1975) to bring them into line with international human 
rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Remove provisions in defamation laws which provide for prison
