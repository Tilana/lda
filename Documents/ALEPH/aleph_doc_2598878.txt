FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
HORIZON MINERALS CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(EXPRESSED IN US DOLLARS)
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
 
Horizon  Minerals  Corp.  (the  “Company”)  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Delaware  on  May  11,  2011.  The
Company is currently seeking to acquire a business. 
 
The Company’s financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with US generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) which contemplate the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities and commitments in the normal course
of business. The Company has funded its operations through the issuance of capital stock and debt. Management intends to obtain
additional  funding  by  borrowing  funds  from  its  directors  and  officers,  issuing  promissory  notes  and/or  a  private  placement  of
common stock. There is no certainty that further funding will be available as needed. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
ability  of  the  Company  to  continue  operating  as  a  going  concern.  The  Company’s  ability  to  continue  its  operations  as  a  going
concern, realize the carrying value of its assets, and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent upon its
ability  to  raise  new  capital  sufficient  to  fund  its  commitments  and  ongoing  losses,  and  ultimately  on  generating  profitable
operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that
may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 
The unaudited interim financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. They do not include all information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the notes to the
financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the
opinion  of  management,  all  adjustments  (including  normal  recurring  accruals)  considered  necessary  for  a  fair  presentation  have
been included. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, these unaudited interim financial statements and
the related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015, included in the Company’s report on Form 10-K.  
 
NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company was indebted to Mr. Robert Fedun, the sole director, CEO and CFO of the Company, in the
amount of $82,359 (December 31, 2015 - $61,477).  Of this balance, $6,685 (December 31, 2015 - $3,803) was included in due to
related party, and $75,674 (December 31, 2015 - $57,674), associated with the services provided by Mr. Fedun, was included in
accounts payable. Amounts due to related party are due on demand, bear no interest, and are unsecured. 
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company accrued $18,000 (June 30, 2015 - $18,000) in consulting fees to
Mr. Fedun. The consulting fees were recorded as part of professional fees on the Statement of Operations.  
 
NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT 
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company did not enter into any transactions that resulted in the issuance of
its common stock.
7
NOTE 5 - NOTE PAYABLE 
 
On May 2, 2016, the Company received a $10,000 loan from a third party in exchange for a one-year promissory note accumulating
interest at 10% per annum compounded annually. At June 30, 2016, the Company accrued $97 in interest associated with the loan.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Plan of Operations 
 
Forward-Looking Statements 
 
This  Quarterly  Report  contains  forward-looking  statements  about  our  business,  financial  condition  and  prospects  that  reflect
management’s assumptions and beliefs based on information currently available.  We can give no assurance that the expectations
indicated by such forward-looking statements will be realized.  If any of our management’s assumptions should prove incorrect, or
if any of the risks and uncertainties underlying such expectations should materialize, our actual results may differ materially from
those indicated by the forward-looking statements. 
 
The key factors that are not within our control and that may have a direct bearing on operating results include, but are not limited to,
likelihood of us completing the transaction with Boomchat Inc., our managements’ ability to raise capital required to support our
day-to-day operations, the retention of key personnel and changes in regulatory requirements. 
 
There may be other risks and circumstances that our management may be unable to predict.  When used in this Quarterly Report,
words  such  as,   "believes,"   "expects,"  "intends,"   "plans,"   "anticipates,"   "estimates"  and  similar  expressions  are  intended  to
identify  forward-looking  statements,  although  there  may  be  certain  forward-looking  statements  not  accompanied  by  such
expressions. 
 
Overview 
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on May 11, 2011.  We currently have no business operations or significant assets.  We are a
development stage company and plan to identify and acquire a business. 
 
During  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  we  decided  to  terminate  our  Share  Purchase  Agreement  to
acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Boomchat Inc. and as such started evaluating other alternative business opportunities
within mining industry. In August 2016 we engaged Gold Exploration Management Inc. (“Gold Exploration”), a private corporation
controlled  by  David  A.  Bending,  M.Sc.,  P.  Geo.,  providing  mineral  exploration  project  management  services  to  assist  us  with
evaluation of several potential projects in Clayton Valley known for its potential to host lithium deposits.

Revenues 
 
We did not generate any revenue during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Due to the development
stage of our operations, we do not expect to have significant operating revenue in the foreseeable future. 
 
Operating Expenses 
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, our expenses decreased by $53,386 or 75.5% from $70,747 for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 to $17,361 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to $50,000 in project
investigation  costs  we  incurred  in  our  Fiscal  2015  which  were  associated  with  our  entry  into  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  to
acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Boomchat Inc. We did not have similar expenditures during the three month period
ended June 30, 2016. 
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our expenses decreased by $48,514 or 56.4% from $86,016 for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 to $37,502 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to $50,000 in project investigation
costs we incurred in our Fiscal 2015 which were associated with our entry into the Share Purchase Agreement to acquire all issued
and outstanding shares of Boomchat Inc. The decrease in project investigation costs was offset in part by increase in our filing and
regulatory fees of $2,264 from $2,871 we incurred during six month period ended June 30, 2015 to $5,135 during the six months
ended June 30, 2016. 
 
Net Loss 
 
Our  net  loss  for  the three month period  ended June  30, 2016  decreased by $52,839 from  $70,145  we incurred during the three
month period ended June 30, 2015 to $17,306 we incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Our net loss for the six
month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $52,440 from $85,057 we incurred during the six month period ended June 30,
2015 to $32,617 we incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016. These decreases were mainly associated with reduction of
our project investigation costs to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Boomchat Inc.  
 
We anticipate incurring ongoing operating losses and cannot predict when, if at all, we may expect these losses to plateau or narrow.

Cash used in operations 
Cash provided by financing activities 
Net increase (decrease) in cash during the period 
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we used $12,790 in our day-to-day operating activities. Our net loss of $32,617 was
offset by an increase in our accounts payable of $18,890, of which $18,000 was attributed to the increase in the amount due to our
sole director and officer for consulting services, and by an increase in our accrued liabilities of $509.  
 
Our operations during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 were supported by $10,000 loan we received from a third party and
by $2,727 in advances form our sole director and officer. 
 
In the comparable period ended June 30, 2015, we used $60,654 in our day-to-day operating activities. We used $85,057 to cover
our net loss and $2,440 to reduce our accrued liabilities. These uses of cash were offset by the increase in accounts payable of
$27,218. 
 
Our operations during the six months ended June 30, 2015 were supported by advances from a non-related party of $62,368. 
 
We do not have sufficient funds to maintain our operations for the next twelve months, as such, we continue with our ongoing
efforts  to  raise  additional  capital  by  conducting  additional  issuances  of  our  equity  and  debt  securities  for  cash.   The  sale  of
additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt
service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify
our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us
to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm
our overall business prospects.  We cannot assure you that any financing can be obtained or, if obtained, that it will be on reasonable
terms.  As such, our principal accountants have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we have
limited operations and have not fully commenced planned principal operations. 
 
There are no known trends, events or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our
revenues from continuing operations. 
 
We have not paid for expenses on behalf of our directors.  Additionally, we believe that this fact shall not materially change. 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
Plant and Equipment 
 
We currently do not own any significant plant or equipment that we would seek to sell in the near future.
11
Going Concern Consideration 
 
Our auditors have issued an opinion on our annual financial statements which includes a statement describing our going concern
status. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we
obtain  additional  capital  to  pay  our  bills  and  meet  our  other  financial  obligations.  This  is  because  we  have  not  generated  any
revenues and no revenues are anticipated in the near future. Accordingly, we must raise capital from sources other than the actual
sale of the product. We must raise capital to implement our project and stay in business. 
 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risks 
 
Not applicable. 
 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, it
was concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are
required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management,  including  our  principal  executive  and  principal  financial  officer,  or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
 
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting   
 
There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  
 
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  
 
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter  how  well  designed  and  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  the  desired  control  objectives.  In
addition,  the  design  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
