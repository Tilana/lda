<p><b>  25/&#8230;  Human rights situation in Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and affirming that these human rights 
instruments must be respected in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, </p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the recent reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, as well as of other relevant recent 
reports of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware</i> of the responsibility of the international community to promote human rights 
and ensure respect for international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice, and recalling also General Assembly resolutions ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-
10/17 of 15 December 2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting in particular</i> the Court&#8217;s reply, including that the construction of the wall 
being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated regime are contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
force, and deeply concerned at the fragmentation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, through the construction of settlements, settler roads, the wall and 
other measures that are tantamount to de facto annexation of Palestinian land, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and reaffirming the obligation of the States parties to the Fourth 
Geneva Convention under articles 146, 147 and 148 with regard to penal sanctions, grave 
breaches and responsibilities of the High Contracting Parties, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the failure by Israel, the occupying Power, to live up to its obligations as 
set forth in international law and as reaffirmed in all relevant United Nations resolutions 
and the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of Justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that all States have the right and the duty to take actions in conformity 
with international human rights law and international humanitarian law to counter deadly 
acts of violence against their civilian population in order to protect the lives of their 
citizens, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need for full compliance with the Israeli-Palestinian agreements 
reached within the context of the Middle East peace process, including the Sharm el-Sheikh 
understandings, and the implementation of the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State 
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing grave concern</i> about the continuing systematic violation of the human 
rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including that arising from 
the excessive use of force and military operations causing death and injury to Palestinian 
civilians, including children, women and non-violent, peaceful demonstrators; the use of 
collective punishment; the closure of areas; the confiscation of land; the establishment and 
expansion of settlements; the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949; the policies and practices that discriminate 
against and disproportionately affect the Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem; the discriminatory allocation of water resources 
between Israeli settlers, who reside illegally in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and the 
Palestinian population of the said Territory<i>; </i>the violation of the basic right to adequate 
housing, which is a component of the right to an adequate standard of living; the 
destruction of property and infrastructure; and all other actions by it designed to change the 
legal status, geographical nature and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> <i>in particular</i> about the critical humanitarian and security 
situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from the prolonged continuous closures 
and severe economic and movement restrictions that in effect amount to a blockade, and the 
military operations between December 2008 and January 2009 and in November 2012, 
which caused extensive loss of life and injury, particularly among Palestinian civilians, 
including children and women, widespread destruction and damage to Palestinian homes, 
properties, vital infrastructure and public institutions, including hospitals, schools and 
United Nations facilities and the internal displacement of civilians, as well as about the 
firing of rockets into Israel, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>deep concern</i> about the short- and long-term detrimental impact of such 
widespread destruction and the continued impeding of the reconstruction process by Israel, 
the occupying Power, on the human rights situation and on the socioeconomic and 
humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian civilian population, </p>


<p><i> Stressing </i>the need to end immediately the closure of the Gaza Strip and for the full 
implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access and the Agreed Principles for 
the Rafah Crossing, both of 15 November 2005, to allow for the freedom of movement of 
the Palestinian civilian population within and into and out of the Gaza Strip, taking into 
account Israeli concerns, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing deep concern</i> at the Israeli policy of closures and the imposition of 
severe restrictions and checkpoints, several of which have been transformed into structures 
akin to permanent border crossings, other physical obstacles and a permit regime, which are 
applied in a discriminatory manner affecting the Palestinian population only, and all of 
which obstruct the freedom of movement of persons and goods, including medical and 
humanitarian goods, throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, and impair the Territory&#8217;s contiguity, and deeply concerned also at the 
consequent violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and the negative impact 
on their socioeconomic situation and the efforts aimed at rehabilitating and developing the 
Palestinian economy,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deploring</i> all policies and practices whereby Israeli settlers, who reside illegally in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, are accorded preferential 
treatment over the Palestinian population in terms of access to roads, infrastructure, land, 
property, housing, natural resources and judicial mechanisms, resulting in widespread 
human rights violations of Palestinians, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the destruction of property and the permanent displacement of 
Palestinian communities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
from their initial locations constitute, in all but the most limited cases as specified under 
international law, violations of the prohibitions on destruction of property and forcible 
transfer, respectively, under articles 53 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention<i>, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Expressing deep concern</i> that thousands of Palestinians, including many children 
and women and elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, continue to be 
detained and held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under harsh conditions, including, 
inter alia, unhygienic conditions, solitary confinement, lack of proper medical care, denial 
of family visits and denial of due process, that impair their well-being, and expressing deep 
concern also about the ill-treatment and harassment of any Palestinian prisoner and all 
reports of torture, </p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> about the possible consequences of the enactment by Israel, the 
occupying Power, of military orders regarding the detention, imprisonment and deportation 
of Palestinian civilians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
and recalling in this regard the prohibition under international humanitarian law of the 
deportation of civilians from occupied territories, </p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> of the need for an international presence to monitor the situation, to 
contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population and to 
help the parties implement the agreements reached and, in this regard, recalling the positive 
contribution of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, </p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the continued efforts and tangible progress made in the security 
sector by the Palestinian Government, calling upon the parties to continue cooperation that 
benefits both Palestinians and Israelis, in particular by promoting security and building 
confidence, and expressing the hope that such progress will be extended to all major 
population centres, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the right of all people in the region to the enjoyment of human rights as 
enshrined in the international human rights covenants, </p>


<p> 1. <i>Reiterates</i> that all measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in violation of the relevant 
provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time 
of War, of 12 August 1949, and contrary to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council 
are illegal and have no validity; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with the provisions 
of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and cease immediately all measures and actions 
taken in violation and in breach of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the need for Israel, the occupying Power, to withdraw from the 
Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, so as to enable the 
Palestinian people to exercise its universally recognized right to self-determination; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all practices and actions that 
violate the human rights of the Palestinian people, and that it fully respect human rights law 
and comply with its legal obligations in this regard, including in accordance with relevant 
United Nations resolutions; </p>
<p>5<i>. Also demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, cease its imposition of 
prolonged closures and economic and movement restrictions, including those amounting to 
a blockade on the Gaza Strip, which severely restricts the freedom of movement of 
Palestinians within, into and out of Gaza and their access to basic utilities, housing, 
education, work, health and an adequate standard of living via various measures, including 
import and export restrictions, that have a direct impact on livelihoods, economic 
sustainability and development throughout Gaza, and, in this regard, calls upon Israel to 
implement fully the Agreement on Movement and Access and the Agreed Principles for the 
Rafah Crossing, in order to allow for the sustained and regular movement of persons and 
goods and for the acceleration of long overdue reconstruction in the Gaza Strip; </p>
<p> 6. <i>Reiterates</i> the need for respect for the territorial unity, contiguity and 
integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and for guarantees of the freedom of 
movement of persons and goods within the Palestinian territory, including movement into 
and from East Jerusalem, into and from the Gaza Strip, between the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip, and to and from the outside world; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the confiscation and damage by Israel of fishing 
nets in the Gaza Strip for which there is no discernible security justification; </p>
<p>8<i>. Condemns</i> the excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying forces against 
Palestinian civilians, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and in the context of peaceful protests 
in the West Bank, resulting in extensive loss of life and vast numbers of injuries; </p>
<p>9. <i>Also</i> <i>condemns </i>the firing of rockets against Israeli civilian areas resulting in 
loss of life and injury; </p>
<p>10. <i>Further condemns</i> all acts of violence, including all acts of terror, 
provocation, incitement and destruction, including the torching of places of worship and the 
destruction of olive trees and crops by Israeli settlers; </p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to cease all violations of the right to education of 
Palestinians, including those stemming from restrictions on movement and incidents of 
harassment and attacks on school children and educational facilities by Israeli settlers and 
as a result of Israeli military action; </p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to end any harassment, intimidation and reprisals against 
human rights defenders who peacefully advocate for the rights of Palestinians in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including by cooperating with United Nations human rights 
bodies; </p>


<p> 13. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the conditions of the Palestinian prisoners and 
detainees in Israeli jails and detention centres, demands that Israel, the occupying Power, 
fully respect and abide by its international law obligations towards all Palestinian prisoners 
and detainees in its custody, and also expresses its concern at the continued extensive use of 
administrative detention, calls for a full implementation of the agreement reached in May 
2012 for a prompt and independent investigation into all cases of death custody, and also 
calls upon Israel to release any Palestinian prisoner whose detention is not in accordance 
with international law; </p>
<p>14. <i>Demands</i> that Israel cease its policy of transferring prisoners from the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory into the territory of Israel, and respect fully its obligations 
under article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention; </p>
<p>15. <i>Urges</i> Israel to ensure that any arrest, detention and/or trial of Palestinian 
children is in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including by refraining 
from holding criminal proceedings against them in military courts that, by definition, fall 
short of providing the necessary guarantees to ensure respect for their rights and that 
infringe upon their right to non-discrimination; </p>
<p> 16. <i>Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all of its settlement 
activities, the construction of the wall and any other measures aimed at altering the 
character, status and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including in and around East Jerusalem, all of which have, inter alia, a grave and 
detrimental impact on the human rights of the Palestinian people and the prospects for a 
peaceful settlement; </p>
<p>17. <i>Also</i> <i>demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal 
obligations under international law, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 
July 2004 by the International Court of Justice and as demanded in General Assembly 
resolutions ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/13 of 21 October 2003, and that it 
immediately cease the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including in and around East Jerusalem, dismantle forthwith the structure situated therein, 
repeal or render ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto, and make 
reparation for all damage caused by the construction of the wall, which has had a grave 
impact on the human rights and the socioeconomic living conditions of the Palestinian 
people; </p>
<p>18. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to immediately cease any demolitions or plans for 
demolitions that would result in the forcible transfer or forced eviction of Palestinians, 
particularly in the vulnerable areas of the Jordan Valley, the periphery of Jerusalem and the 
South Hebron Hills, to facilitate the return of those Palestinian communities already 
subjected to forcible transfer or eviction to their original dwellings and to ensure adequate 
housing and legal security of tenure; </p>
<p>19. <i>Urges</i> Israel to ensure that water resource allocation in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory is not discriminatory and does not result in water shortages 
disproportionately affecting the Palestinian population of the West Bank, and to take urgent 
steps to facilitate the restoration of the water infrastructure of the West Bank, including in 
the Jordan Valley, affected by the destruction of the wells of local civilians, roof water 
tanks and other water and irrigation facilities under military and settler operation since 
1967; </p>
<p>20. <i>Deplores </i>the illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem, including 
home demolitions, evictions of Palestinian residents, excavations in and around religious 
and historic sites, and all other unilateral measures aimed at altering the character, status 
and demographic composition of the city and of the Territory as a whole; </p>


<p>21. <i>Expresses grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The restrictions imposed by Israel that impede access of Christian and 
Muslim worshippers to holy sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, and calls upon Israel to include guarantees for non-discrimination on grounds of 
religion or belief as well as for the preservation and peaceful access to all religious sites; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The increasing tensions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the wider region, 
including those stemming from attempts aimed at illegally changing the status quo of holy 
sites; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Expresses serious concern </i>at the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law 
adopted by the Knesset, which suspends the possibility, with certain rare exceptions, of 
family reunification between an Israeli citizen and a person residing in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, thus adversely affecting the lives of many 
families; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Urges </i>Member States to continue to provide emergency assistance to the 
Palestinian people to alleviate the financial crisis and the dire socioeconomic and 
humanitarian situation, particularly in the Gaza Strip; </p>
<p>24. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to preserve and develop the Palestinian institutions and 
infrastructure for the provision of vital public services to the Palestinian civilian population 
and the promotion of human rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights; </p>
<p>25. <i>Stresses</i> the need for Israel to abide by all relevant United Nations resolutions 
and to cooperate with the Human Rights Council, all special procedures and the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights;
