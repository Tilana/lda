<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 15/13, the Human Rights Council requested the independent expert 
on human rights and international solidarity to submit a report on the implementation of 
resolution 15/13 to the Council at its eighteenth session. By its decision 16/118, the Council 
decided to postpone the renewal of the mandate of the independent expert to its seventeenth 
session, and for that reason to extend the mandate of the independent expert until June 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>2. The above-mentioned report will therefore be submitted by the independent expert 
following the renewal of the mandate and the appointment of a new mandate holder by the 
Human Rights Council.
