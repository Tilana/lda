3. Criminal Case No. 933/2007 dated 8 November 2007 wherein the Applicant was charged with
murder. This Case eventually became Criminal Case No. 3 of 2009 dated 7 February 2009.
4. Criminal Case No.1027/2007 dated 16 April 2008 and the charge was armed robbery. This case
was withdrawn and eventually the case became Criminal Case No.883/2008 dated 2 December
7

2008 wherein the Applicant was charged with armed robbery and rape.
5. Criminal Case No. 1029/2007 which eventually became Criminal Case No. 712/2009 dated 21
December 2009 wherein the Applicant was charged with armed robbery. The original charge sheet
indicated that the alleged incident of armed robbery occurred on 12 September 2009 yet the
Applicant was already in custody at the time the alleged offence occurred. In the course of the
hearing of this easel the Applicant alerted the Magistrate's Court to the Prosecution's substitution of
the charge on 13 November 2012, to reflect the alleged incident of armed robbery.
6. Criminal Case No. 716/2009 dated 23 December 2009 wherein the Applicant was charged with
armed robbery, kidnapping with intent to do harm and rape, though he was not present in Court.
54. The Applicant's wife was charged with robbery and possession of stolen items under Criminal Case No.
799 of 2007. She was in remand from 12 September 2007 until her release on 25 October 2007.
55. There being no progress in the prosecutions against him, the Applicant corresponded severally with the
Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, the Attorney General's
Chambers', Public Prosecution Division and the Commission on Human Rights and Good Governance.
seeking their intervention in ensuring the prosecutions against him either proceeded or were withdrawn for
lack of evidence and that his seized property be restored to him
56. Having received no resolution of the issues he raised with the said authorities and institutions, the
Applicant informed the Director of the Attorney General's Chambers' Public Prosecution Division and the
Minister of Home Affairs that he would move to the High Court to have these issues resolved.
57. In 2007, the Applicant filed Miscellaneous Criminal Application No. 7 of 2007, Originating from Criminal
Case No. 933 of 2007, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, under Section 357(a) of the Criminal
Procedure Act, against the Attorney General of the Respondent. He sought orders for restitution of his
property seized on 12 September 2007 while he was in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and for any order the
Court deemed fit to grant. At the hearing of the Applicant's application, the Respondent therein contended
that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to order the restitution of the Applicant's property as the right Court to
issue such an order was the District Court where the Applicant was facing prosecution on a murder charge.
The Applicant argued that there was no connection between the murder charge he was facing and the
property that the Police had seized. The High Court stated that as the High Court had jurisdiction over
murder cases, it followed that the High Court had jurisdiction to order restitution of property in murder
cases. However, in the instant case, because there was no connection between the property seized by the
Police and the murder charge which the Applicant was facing, the High Court's jurisdi ction to order the
restitution of the property was ousted and the only avenue open to him was to approach the District Court
where he was charged, to seek orders for restitution of his property. The Court also stated that though the
Applicant could have applied for prerogative orders from the High Court, being the only court vested with
jurisdiction to issue such orders, such orders could only be granted if they would in no way prejudice the
interests of justice in respect of the murder charge the Applicant faced. In this regard therefore, the High
Court stated that since the murder charge the Applicant was facing in Criminal Case No. 933 of 2007 was
pending, the Applicant's application to the High Court was premature and that it had to be stayed until final
determination of the pending murder charge unless the seized properties had no connection with the
charge he facect
58 In addition. by the time the High Court heard the Application, the charges in the rest of the Criminal
Cases had been filed against the Applicant and the fact that there were additional criminal charges filed
against him was a reason for the High Court to decline jurisdiction, and to refer the Applicant back to the
District Court as the proper forum for adjudicating whether the property in dispute had a connection with the
Criminal Cases the Applicant was facing. The High Court stated that, indeed, the Applicant's property had
been seized and that the authorities were required to keep it in safe custody pending determination of the
Criminal Cases the Applicant was facing. For these reasons, on 14 December 2010, the High Court of
Tanzania at Arusha dismissed the application for the release of property, as being premature.
59 In the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, in 2009. the Applicant filed Miscellaneous Criminal Application
No. 54 of 2009 originating from Criminal Case No. 933 of 2007 under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure
Act for the charges preferred against him to be discharged. On 11 August 2010, The application was struck
8

out as it did not specify the subsection of Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act under which it was
made and that the Applicant's prayers were stated in the affidavit in support of the application rather than in
the Chamber Summons.
60. Again, in 2010, the Applicant filed, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Miscellaneous Criminal
Application No. 6 of 2010 in accordance with Section 90 (1) (c) (4) of the Criminal Procedure Act requesting
a discontinuance of the Criminal Cases under Section 90(1)(c ) of the Criminal Procedure Act as the
actions that the Police had taken were contrary to Sections 32, 33, 50(1), 51(1) and 52(1), (2) and (3)
thereof. The application was against the Attorney General of the Respondent. On 16 November 2010, the
application was struck out for being incompetent as it was filed under a repealed section of the law, that is
Section 90 (1) (c) (4) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which was repealed by Section 31 of the National
Prosecution Act No.27 of 2008 which had come into effect on 9 June 2008.
61. The Applicant also filed. in 2010, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Miscellaneous Civil
Application No. 47 of 2010, originating from the Criminal Cases, against the Respondent. The application
was on the basis of Articles 13(1), 15(1), (2) (a) and 30 (3) of the Constitution of the United Republic of
Tanzania guaranteeing equality before the law and the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one's freedom.
On 14 December 2010, the High Court struck out the application as it was not properly made since it had
been filed by way of Chamber Summons and supporting affidavit. According to the High Court, the matter
should have been brought in accordance with Section 5 of the Basic Rights and Duties Enforcement Act,
which sets out the appropriate procedure, namely, that the case be filed by way of a Petition and
Originating Summons. In addition. such an application must be determined by a three-Judge Bench and not
a single Judge, as was in the instant case.
62 On 8 December 2010, the Applicant filed, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Miscellaneous
Criminal Application No. 78 of 2010, originating from the Criminal Cases, against the Attorney General of
the Respondent, as First Respondent, and the Police Officer in Charge of Arusha, as Second Respondent,
on the basis of Articles 13(1), 15(1), (2) (a) and 30 (3) of the Constitution of the United Republic of
Tanzania. These provisions guarantee equality before the law and the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of
one's freedom. In the application, the Applicant alleged violation of his right to freedom and to live as a free
person. The Applicant alleged that the Second Respondent had arrested, detained and interrogated him in
respect of what would be the Criminal Cases, contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act and
that therefore the actions of the Second Respondent in that regard were vitiated by these irregularities. The
Applicant sought a decree under Part 111 of Chapter One of the Constitution of the United Republic of
Tanzania to this effect. On 18 May 2011, the High Court issued an order that the application was withdrawn
at the Applicant's instance.
