<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report, submitted in accordance with Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2005/68, contains a summary of proceedings and the Chairperson&#8217;s statement of the 
Conference on anti-corruption measures, good governance and human rights, organized in 
Warsaw on 8 and 9 November 2006 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) in collaboration with the Government of the Republic of Poland and 
with the financial support of the Government of Australia.  Participants included representatives 
of States, national human rights institutions, intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations, and invited experts and panellists.  The Conference was a follow-up to a joint 
OHCHR-UNDP Seminar on Good Governance Practices for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights, which took place in Seoul in September 2004 (E/CN.<footnote name="4">8. At the end of the second day, Mr. Archer noted the importance participants attributed to a 
range of issues.  He began by pointing to the repeated calls for greater international cooperation 
in anti-corruption efforts by tackling the &#8220;supply side&#8221; of corruption, assisting with asset 
recovery and implementing judgements in corruption cases in third countries.  Emphasizing the 
range of actors that need to be involved in anti-corruption work, Mr. Archer described the 
specific issues and concerns that were raised for each sector: </footnote>/2005/97). 
</p>
<p> The objective of the Conference was to deepen the understanding of good governance 
practices which contribute to the fight against corruption by focusing on human rights 
approaches.  The Conference identified, explored and clarified the linkages between corruption, 
human rights and good governance, and provided an opportunity for participants to share 
concerns and experiences. 
</p>
<p> The Conference heard from experts, anti-corruption and human rights practitioners, 
public officials, civil society and private sector actors.  Eleven panellists presented case studies 
and three experts provided overall perspectives during four substantive sessions on the impact of 
corruption on human rights; how human rights and good governance principles can help in 
fighting corruption; the role of civil society, the private sector and the media; and fighting 
corruption while safeguarding human rights. 
</p>
<p> Panellists, experts and participants recognized that corruption impedes the realization of 
human rights in multiple ways.  They stressed the importance of combating corruption in its 
various forms (petty and grand), as well as its motivations (need and greed) and impetus (supply 
and demand).  They also insisted that anti-corruption measures should be effective without 
compromising human rights. 
</p>
<p> Participants also identified various ways to improve and strengthen anti-corruption 
efforts, by developing better data and indicators; involving all sectors of society, not just 
governments; improving and expanding international collaboration to address the supply side of 
corruption, to support asset recovery and the implementation of judgements; providing technical 
assistance to strengthen the capacity of State agencies and institutions and the private sector to 
carry out anti-corruption work in a manner that is consistent with human rights; and developing 
new rules and clearer guidelines to inform efforts to curb corruption while protecting human 
rights. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/68, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) organized, in collaboration 
with the Government of the Republic of Poland, the Conference on anti-corruption, good 
governance and human rights, held in Warsaw on 8 and 9 November 2006 and chaired by 
Ms. Anna Fotyga, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland.  More than 240 participants from 
102 countries attended the Conference, including representatives of Member and Observer 
States, national human rights institutions (NHRI), intergovernmental organizations, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and invited experts and panellists. 
</p>
<p>2. The Conference built on the sharing of good practices and experiences to generate debate 
with a view to identifying and clarifying the main conceptual issues related to each of the four 
sessions (see annex I to the present report).  The approach was to start from the specific and to 
move on to the general, with experts drawing general observations from the presentations.  An 
open discussion at the conclusion of each session further illustrated and elaborated on the key 
elements debated by the panel.  At the end of each day, the Rapporteur presented conclusions 
and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report contains a summary of proceedings, expert comments and discussions, 
and the Chairperson&#8217;s statement (contained in annex II).  It also draws on remarks by the 
Rapporteur, Robert Archer.  Introductory statements on the relationship between anti-corruption 
measures, good governance and human rights are summarized in section II.  Section III deals 
with the impact of corruption on human rights.  Section IV explores how human rights and good 
governance principles can help in combating corruption.  Section V looks specifically at the role 
of civil society, the private sector and the media in efforts to stem corruption.  Section VI 
presents the possible conflicts between human rights principles and anti-corruption measures, 
and ways to safeguard human rights while fighting corruption.  Section VII contains the 
conclusions of the Conference in the form of recommendations and proposals for consideration 
by relevant agencies and bodies.  The list of participants to the Conference is contained in 
annex III. 
</p>
<p>4. OHCHR would like to thank the Government of Poland for hosting the Conference, the 
Government of Australia for its financial support, and the Governments of Chile, South Africa 
and Republic of Korea, the other cosponsors of resolution 2005/68 for their substantive support.  
OHCHR would also like to thank the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 
Poland for providing logistical and other local support for the Conference. 
</p>
<p><b>I. ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES, GOOD  
GOVERNANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>5. In her introductory remarks, the Chairperson, Anna Fotyga, stressed the importance 
Poland has attached to the fight against corruption since 1995.  She reviewed the major changes 
to the country&#8217;s legal system introduced by the former and current prime ministers, and the 
recent establishment of the Central Anti-Corruption Office. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>6. The statement of Sergei Ordzhonikidze, Director-General of the United Nations Office at 
Geneva, delivered on his behalf by David Chikvaidze, described the damaging effects of 
corruption, which drains resources needed for services and infrastructure, perverts the rule of 
law, discourages external investment and aid, undercuts public confidence, feeds inequality and 
disenfranchises large segments of the population.  He also noted the challenges corruption poses 
to security through trafficking, money laundering and illicit transfers that can be used to finance 
terrorism, and encouraged States to sign, ratify and implement the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption (UNCAC), which entered into force in 2005.  He concluded by noting that, 
because violations of human rights compromise anti-corruption efforts, eventually rendering 
them less effective, the principles and institutions of human rights promotion are indispensable 
elements in successful anti-corruption strategies.  
</p>
<p>7. In her opening remarks, Mar&#237;a Francisca Ize-Charrin, Director of Operations, Programme 
and Research Division at OHCHR, underscored the vital role played by other United Nations 
agencies, intergovernmental organizations and NGOs in anti-corruption efforts, and the 
contribution of UNCAC, which has been signed by 140 Member States and ratified by 70.  
Ms. Ize-Charrin acknowledged that, although the Convention does not directly refer to human 
rights, it includes several references to rule of law and &#8220;there can be no rule of law without 
protection of human rights&#8221;.  She observed that the anti-corruption movement can benefit from 
the experience of the human rights movement and, by removing impediments to the realization 
of human rights, contribute to it.  Although the international movement against corruption is 
relatively young, it has made important strides since the days when addressing corruption was 
seen as an improper intrusion into domestic affairs of sovereign States and foreign bribery was a 
tax-deductible expense for companies in certain developed countries.  She proposed that 
anti-corruption work, like rights-based development and poverty reduction strategies, should rely 
on principles of empowerment, transparency, participation, accountability, non-discrimination 
and rule of law.  She concluded by affirming that anti-corruption measures must be compatible 
with human rights and should not lead to violation of the rights of those involved, including the 
perpetrators, witnesses and whistleblowers.  
</p>
<p>8. Param Cumaraswamy, former Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers of the Commission on Human Rights, opened his keynote address by reaffirming that 
&#8220;good governance should be seen as a prerequisite for the protection and promotion of human 
rights&#8221;.  Central to good governance are ethics, the moral values and principles that guide 
conduct, and integrity, the correspondence between what is said and done.  Integrity of public 
officials requires that they fulfil their responsibilities to the public, refrain from using their 
power for personal gain, uphold the public&#8217;s interest as paramount when conflicts of interest 
appear, and maintain transparency and accountability.  He noted the concern expressed by the 
United Nations General Assembly in 1996 regarding the prevalence and seriousness of 
corruption around the world and welcomed the adoption of the International Code of Conduct for 
Public Officials.  Mr. Cumaraswamy denounced the pervasiveness of the problem across 
institutions - public administrations, corporations and professions throughout the world - from 
which neither the most developed countries nor the United Nations are immune.  He then 
reviewed the experience of South-East Asia where restrictions to civil and political rights were </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>often justified by government leaders as necessary for economic growth.  Although several 
countries did experience economic booms during the &#8220;Asian miracle&#8221;, they often did so at great 
cost to human rights and the rule of law.  Mr. Cumaraswamy observed that today there is both 
greater awareness of human rights in the region and greater respect for human rights by 
Governments than before.  Both public and private institutions are experimenting with structures 
and procedures to enhance good governance and since the Asian financial crisis, financial 
institutions are carefully monitored.  States in the region are responding to the United Nation&#8217;s 
call to establish NHRIs; whereas there were only 5 such institutions in the Asia Pacific region in 
1993, today there are 18.  Mr. Cumaraswamy credited civil society groups for their vigilance and 
commitment to accelerating the process of reforms in the region.  Towards that end, he noted the 
value of the right to access to information and whistleblower protection legislation, independent 
anti-corruption mechanisms, like ombudsman offices, and better resourced NHRIs.  However, he 
singled out the judiciary as the &#8220;pivotal institution&#8221; for dealing with both corruption and human 
rights and insisted that proper attention should be given to strengthening it. 
</p>
<p>9. The acting Mayor of Warsaw and former Prime Minister of Poland, 
Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, affirmed Poland&#8217;s commitment to preventing abuse in public 
institutions and described the steps taken by Warsaw.  In 2002 the Office of Internal Control 
and Audit was established to address corruption among municipal officials.  Resident Service 
Departments in each of the city&#8217;s 18 districts were established and mandated to receive residents&#8217; 
petitions.  As a result of those measures, a 2006 survey of Warsaw residents revealed that those 
&#8220;who believe that corruption among officials is frequent&#8221; fell by 20 per cent in just two years. 
10. In her statement, the Ambassador of South Africa in Poland, Ms. F.C. Potgieter-Gqubule, 
affirmed South Africa&#8217;s embrace of the values of good governance, rule of law and human rights 
following apartheid.  South Africa&#8217;s Constitution and the Bill of Rights (1996) safeguard the full 
spectrum of human rights and an array of policies, laws and programmes have been adopted to 
give effect to these rights.  Besides South Africa is party to a range of regional and international 
human rights and anti-corruption conventions and protocols.  In April 2007 it will host the 
Global Forum V on Fighting Corruption and Safeguarding Integrity, which will showcase the 
African anti-corruption experience and good practices, like the <i>izimbizo</i>, a form of unmediated 
community meeting that provides citizens direct interaction with government leaders.  As an 
emerging democracy, South Africa recognizes the immensity of the challenge of overcoming 
corruption to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights.  Aware that the Government cannot do 
it alone, South Africa is working with the country&#8217;s vibrant civil society, the media and the 
private sector to address the problem comprehensively through the National Anti-Corruption 
Forum. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>11. The moderator, Ms. Ize-Charrin, explained the objectives of the session which were 
to highlight the adverse effect of corruption on human rights and to identify the role of 
anti-corruption measures in protecting human rights and creating an environment conducive to 
the promotion of these rights. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>12. Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland Minister of Justice, showed that corruption tends to create 
illegitimate interest groups with informal mafia-like structures of power that operate against the 
interest of the general public.  To prevent or to counter corruption, legal mechanisms, 
transparency in the public arena and an efficient legal system are needed.  Mr. Ziobro described 
how immediately following the end of communism, Poland pursued mistaken measures based on 
mistaken assumptions, namely the &#8220;na&#239;ve belief&#8221; that the free market would operate well without 
effective State structures and institutions, and that State intervention would be harmful.  Polish 
citizens now recognize that the proper role of the State is to protect civil rights rather than the 
political order.  In 2002, following a scandal involving public officials, a number of practices 
were reclassified as crimes.  New measures that are proving effective in reducing corruption 
were introduced.  For example, impunity is granted to the briber who notifies the Government 
ahead of the act; such a mechanism works by arousing fear in those who might consider 
accepting a bribe.  Mr. Ziobro concluded by noting the need for international rules to allow for 
access to information about tax havens and the bribes being transferred there. 
</p>
<p>13. President Eduardo Rodriguez-Veltze, former President of Bolivia and former Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court, drew on his experience to elaborate on the impact of corruption on 
human rights.  Invoking the parallel debate on the relationship between rule of law and 
development, he questioned whether ending corruption was a prerequisite for or a product of the 
realization of human rights.  He attributed the difficulty in answering this question to the fact that 
they involve &#8220;human attitudes&#8221;.  Mr. Rodriguez-Veltze maintained that good governance can 
help provide solutions for both sources of corruption - people&#8217;s &#8220;needs&#8221; (for resources) and 
people&#8217;s &#8220;greed&#8221; (for power) - and that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
original human rights agreements should be the foundations of good governance.  Turning to 
Bolivia&#8217;s experience, he noted that, despite nearly two decades of democracy, the country 
still has problems in the areas of good governance, corruption and respect for human rights.  
Mr. Rodriguez-Veltze attributed this poor record to the difficulties of reconciling majoritarian 
democracy and universal values with the claims of interest groups.  He expressed concern 
regarding the collision of &#8220;claims by groups&#8221; and the way they make those claims 
(e.g.:  blockades, strikes) with the &#8220;rights of individuals&#8221; who must deal with the results.  
Mr. Rodriguez-Veltze concluded by expressing scepticism regarding the usefulness of indices 
that rank countries, like Transparency International&#8217;s index on perception of corruption, for 
challenging governments and suggested the need for indices that capture what countries have 
done well or best.  
</p>
<p>14. Fredrik Eriksson, Managing Director, Integrity Management and Programme for 
Accountability and Transparency, addressed the damage that clientelism in public administration 
does to human rights and how regulatory transparency can prevent it.  He observed that the 
experience of Scandinavian countries demonstrates that access to information and transparency 
can prevent corruption.  The centrality of access to information derives from the fact that it is a 
prerequisite for accountability.  Mr. Eriksson explained how, by undermining competence and 
control over resources, clientelism weakens the capacity of the public administration to 
formulate and implement policies, thereby depriving the public, particularly the weakest and 
most vulnerable, of the fulfilment of their needs.  Furthermore, when officials are promoted 
despite their lack of competence, they become beholden to their patrons whose interests they 
come to serve.  Mr. Eriksson then turned to two examples of regulatory transparency that address 
the problem of clientelism.  Following the end of communism, Poland had a weak and highly 
politicized public administration rife with clientelism.  The situation changed with the adoption </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>of Poland&#8217;s Civil Service Act (1998) which introduced clear criteria and a competitive procedure 
for the recruitment of civil servants, thus allowing scrutiny over appointments and accountability 
of public servants, while providing them with protection against pressure to follow a patron&#8217;s 
personal or illegal interests.  In New Zealand, a different approach was pursued.  The 
responsibility of appointing public service chief executives was given to the State Service 
Commission to reduce the risk of favouritism and conflicts of interest.  Mr. Eriksson concluded 
by noting that in both cases, open and competitive recruitment with transparent criteria reduced 
opportunities for clientelism and, in the process, contributed to stabilizing the public 
administration and strengthening the rule of law, which, in turn, contributed to developing the 
capacities needed to realize human rights. 
</p>
<p>15. Nihal Jayawickrama, Coordinator of the United Nations-sponsored Judicial Integrity 
Group, former Executive Director of Transparency International and former Permanent Secretary 
to the Ministry of Justice of Sri Lanka, acting as an expert, addressed the interconnection 
between corruption and human rights.  First, he noted the surprising absence of any reference to 
corruption in the principal human rights instruments (and the lack of mention of human rights in 
the treaties and resolutions on corruption) despite the fact that &#8220;practically every protected 
human right can be eroded by corruption and it is the already vulnerable who are victimized&#8221;.  
Mr. Jayawickrama distinguished between &#8220;petty corruption&#8221;, which takes the form of a lowly 
public official taking a bribe for doing something that is already required/prohibited by law, and 
&#8220;grand corruption&#8221;, which is carried out by well-placed officials who seek payment for 
exercising their discretionary powers.  Petty corruption originates in &#8220;human need&#8221; while grand 
corruption is rooted in &#8220;human greed&#8221;.  In the developing world, Mr. Jayawickrama maintains, 
&#8220;corruption caused by human greed at the highest levels of Government invariably leads to 
corruption dictated by human need&#8221;.  An example of the latter was noted in statistics from 
Bangladesh on the percentage of households that have paid bribes to secure basic services, such 
as admission into school, admission into hospital, a bank loan, and electricity connection.  
Mr. Jayawickrama noted that where corruption is pervasive, all human rights suffer:  the 
prevalence of corruption requires that civil and political rights be restricted, and when national 
resources are diverted from public use, Governments become unable to fulfil their social, 
economic, and cultural rights obligations.  Mr. Jayawickrama observed that corruption exists in 
one form or another in every State.  He added, however, that countries appear to be better able to 
contain corruption when they possess functioning legal and institutional mechanisms, enjoy 
governance that is participatory, transparent and accountable, and respect human rights.  
Welcoming the recent establishment of the Judicial Group on Strengthening Judicial Integrity, he 
noted their preference for human rights language (&#8220;right to a fair trial&#8221;) over &#8220;anti-corruption&#8221; 
language. 
</p>
<p>16. During the discussion, the difficulty encountered in implementing UNCAC and the stress 
it placed on State officials who struggle to deal with an ever-widening circle of officials that 
need to be held accountable, was noted.  A number of essential reforms to improve the capacity 
to carry out anti-corruption work were identified:  foremost among them is the reform of the 
legal system to ensure the independence of judges and transparency in their election.  There was 
a call for sharing of information and experience on how to establish an effective, independent 
and autonomous judiciary that is credible and accessible to citizens.  Participants insisted on the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>need to simultaneously move forward on four fronts - anti-corruption, good governance, human 
rights and economic development - and that a failure to do so might result in terrible distortions 
of the kind that had occurred in Rwanda.  The need for development to reduce corruption was 
echoed in several comments that pointed to poverty among poorly paid government officials as a 
reason for &#8220;petty corruption&#8221;.  It was noted, however, that development itself may also be part of 
the problem if international financial institutions and donor governments do not control the 
allocation of their funds which may be misused to pay off corrupt officials.  Therefore, any 
discussion of corruption should include the &#8220;corrupted&#8221;, the &#8220;corrupting&#8221;, and the 
&#8220;intermediaries&#8221;.  Donor countries need to be more transparent and to monitor more carefully the 
activities of their multinationals. 
</p>
<p>17. Another area that requires attention is the weakness of civil society in developing 
countries, which prevents them from fighting corruption.  A question was raised regarding what 
weak civil society organizations can do when the institutions that exist to fight corruption are 
appointed by or connected to the government.  Another question was how to improve the role of 
civil society in the fight against corruption in a country that gives importance to human rights, 
but where corruption remains.  It was observed that most government anti-corruption measures 
focus on &#8220;petty corruption&#8221; rather than &#8220;grand corruption&#8221;.  In his response to the questions 
raised, Mr. Rodriguez-Veltze noted the importance of ensuring full access to the judiciary, 
including in the rural areas where delivery is generally poor.  He also noted that many countries 
still need to update their legislative systems, often inherited from colonialism.  He welcomed a 
number of new trends, such as speedy trials, oral accounting, and others, but noted that there was 
still a long way to go.  Civil society has become an important actor that is getting the ear and 
attention of political parties, yet some unions and groups have corporatist rather than public 
interests and, in a representative democracy, the balance is crucial.  He concluded by noting that 
promoting democratic culture is the best practice on a day-to-day basis and for the long-term 
promotion of both &#8220;respect for the rule of law and respect for neighbours&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. The session moderator drew the following conclusions.  First, the human rights-based 
approach to fighting corruption appears to be very promising in addressing the complexity of the 
issues.  Second, a correlation exists between the level of corruption and violations of human 
rights, although more data is needed to assess it.  Third, corruption leads to violations of human 
rights, but the legal consequences need further elaboration.  The moderator suggested including 
as conference recommendations:  (a) the need to collect evidence to show the positive work that 
has been done in fighting corruption and its impact on human rights and to develop indicators to 
capture this correlation; and (b) the need to develop more rules regarding access to information 
and related areas. 
</p>
<p><b>III. HUMAN RIGHTS AND GOOD GOVERNANCE  
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION 
</b></p>
<p>19. Robert Archer, Executive Director of the International Council on Human Rights Policy, 
introduced the session on the usefulness of applying human rights principles and practice to 
strengthen, improve and reinforce anti-corruption policies. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>20. Sandra Coliver, Senior Legal Officer at the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI), 
stressed the importance of the right of access to information held by public authorities, and the 
need for the United Nations to further develop, codify, protect and promote this right.  She noted 
the growing recognition of the value of access to information laws since out of 68 countries 
currently with such laws, 56 have adopted them since 1992 and 36 since 2000.  Ms. Coliver cited 
the findings of OSJI&#8217;s recent survey of 14 countries.  The analysis of over 1,900 requests for 
information revealed that all governments provide information erratically:  in many cases the 
same request received a different answer when filed by a different requestor; 47 per cent of 
requests yielded no response at all; and requests from disadvantaged groups (e.g.:  Roma, the 
disabled, etc.) were ignored at a rate twice that of other requestors.  
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Coliver cited several examples where access to information produced significant and 
concrete results in addressing corruption around the world.  Following a 2003 Mexican law 
requiring that information be published automatically by certain institutions, the new director of 
a publicly-funded university made the payroll public, thus exposing rampant misappropriation, 
which resulted in dismissals and the recovery of 400 million pesos ($40 million).  In Japan, 
private lawyers used local government access to information laws to secure the release of local 
officials&#8217; expense accounts between 1995 and 1997; the disclosure resulted in cuts in the food 
and beverage budgets of Japan&#8217;s 47 prefectures by the equivalent of more than $100 million.  In 
the Indian State of Rajasthan, where no access to information law existed, public pressure was 
used by an NGO to force local government officials to provide an account of all expenditures 
made in relation to development work.  The revelations of fraud and diversion of monies led to 
the return of some misappropriated funds, one arrest, and a national campaign demanding an 
access to information law, which eventually was passed. Ms Coliver also cited examples where 
information was disclosed, despite objections on the grounds that the documents contained 
commercial secrets.  In the light of those examples of how the right to information has enabled 
informed and meaningful public participation and exposed corruption and mismanagement, she 
recommended greater United Nations attention to this right and noted that the Human Rights 
Committee has never addressed the right to information and that few United Nations bodies have 
taken up its content. Besides no norm-creating body has affirmed its existence.  She observed 
that although UNCAC affirmed the importance of access to information in promoting public 
participation and combating corruption, it does not refer to a &#8220;right of access&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. Anna Bossman, Acting Chair, Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice 
of Ghana, spoke about the Commission&#8217;s anti-corruption mandate.  Established in 1993, the 
Commission combines three institutions under one umbrella:  a human rights institution, the 
ombudsman and an anti-corruption agency.  Its anti-corruption mandate consists of investigating 
an array of complaints that include alleged abuses of power, unfair treatment and 
misappropriation of public monies by public officials.  Since it was established, the Commission 
has investigated over 125 corruption cases throughout the country, including very high profile 
cases.  In 2005 the country was rocked by two such cases, one involving the President of the 
Republic and the other the Minister of Transport.  The public outcry and debate that ensued were 
particularly strident as the Government had been elected on a platform of zero tolerance for 
corruption.  The Commission took up the cases on its own initiative.  By highlighting the 
principles of accountability and integrity in public service, and publicly affirming the principle </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>of equality before the law, the cases contributed to raising public awareness regarding 
corruption.  The President&#8217;s acceptance of the Commission&#8217;s jurisdiction to investigate further 
enhanced the Commission&#8217;s stature as an independent agency.  Summing up the challenges 
before the Commission in its fight against corruption, Ms. Bossman cited the need to upgrade the 
legal and institutional framework, political will on the part of Government, a responsible media, 
independent and adequate resourcing, and better retention of staff through improved working 
conditions.   
</p>
<p>23. Maina Kiai, Chair of Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, acting as an expert, 
reviewed human rights and good governance approaches that are effective for fighting 
corruption, and emphasized the value of &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; and &#8220;demand driven&#8221; strategies where 
citizens themselves advocate for change and hold political elites accountable.  Mr. Kiai 
recommended that similar approaches be used in anti-corruption efforts and pointed to human 
rights and good governance principles that are vital for such efforts:  access to information; 
equality under the law; asset recovery as a deterrent; a well resourced, independent and efficient 
judiciary; an accountable police force; effective electoral administration; an active civil society 
capable of counterbalancing the power of the State; effective oversight and ombudsman offices; 
and a free and pluralistic media that enjoys freedom of expression.  He suggested that a 
comprehensive system of accountability for combating corruption can be drawn from human 
rights.  For example, tackling the &#8220;circle of issues&#8221; in a holistic manner would call for 
addressing:  both users and suppliers; exposing the lawyers, accountants, bankers, and others 
who facilitate corruption and concealment of funds; exposing the international linkages that fuel 
and sustain corruption; and holding countries hosting the sources of money accountable.  Other 
components of a system of accountability rooted in human rights and good governance include:  
the principle of separation of powers; campaign finance laws to prevent the buying of votes; 
dealing with impunity for past human rights violations to signal that a new chapter has been 
opened; use of &#8220;smart&#8221; or &#8220;targeted&#8221; sanctions; and stringent corporate social responsibility. 
</p>
<p>24. In the discussion that followed the presentations, questions were raised regarding the best 
way to prevent petty corruption among inadequately paid public servants in poor countries; 
whether the return of money or a conviction is most important when pursuing a bribery case; and 
what can be done in response to Governments&#8217; refusal either to recognize the right to access to 
information or to implement existing access to information laws.  With regard to the level of 
income of civil servants, one panellist acknowledged that low pay was an important factor but 
cautioned against &#8220;bribing them to not take bribes&#8221;.  Another noted that a study that looked at 
salaries and judicial independence found that there is a minimum salary that employees need to 
live in dignity, but once that is reached, other incentives or opportunities, such as training or 
pensions, are equally valued.  The panellist added that because increasing salaries can also entail 
problems, each country has to find its own balance.  Similarly, with regard to the preference 
between getting the money back from corrupt officials or punishing them, a panellist ventured 
that ideally it should be both, if it can be done, otherwise each country must decide for itself.  
She cited an example of a country where everyone knew that corruption was illegal but did not 
know they would be prosecuted, so prosecution became important in itself.  With regard to what 
can be done to secure access to information, another panellist insisted on the need of having </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>good law on paper and good implementation.  Since the adoption of access to information laws 
around the world is quite recent, greater attention should be paid to the provision of resources, 
political will and institutions to ensure their implementation.  The same panellist injected a note 
of optimism by saying that as more support is obtained from Governments, better 
implementation may follow.  She added that some of the best advocates for access to information 
are found in health and education ministries which have discovered that, as they make more 
information available, citizens become more engaged, which in turn helps them secure more 
resources (larger budgets), in the process of building an important partnership around access to 
information.   
</p>
<p>25. The session moderator highlighted the emphasis participants placed on calls for 
international support, action and cooperation if national strategies are to succeed.  He noted the 
specific call for greater international work to set a standard regarding what access to information 
implies.  A third recommendation was to give attention to the usefulness of borrowing the 
&#8220;bottoms-up activism&#8221; from the human rights experience for anti-corruption work.  Similarly, 
the need to engage civil society in the drive for change and to raise awareness regarding 
Governments&#8217; accountability and to do it with imagination was noted.  Mr. Archer pointed out 
the value of sanctions for certain purposes.  Finally, the issue of impunity and transitional justice 
was raised and the example was given of action taken after corruption had occurred on a large 
scale, in order to compensate for the damage it had caused.   
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY, PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE MEDIA   
</b></p>
<p>26. The session moderator, Victoria Jennett, Research Coordinator, Transparency 
International, introduced the session on the role of civil society, the private sector and the media 
in fighting corruption.  She explained that panellists would provide examples of how these three 
sectors draw on human rights principles in their anti-corruption efforts, describe how those 
efforts can serve to protect human rights and how Governments can learn from and support their 
anti-corruption initiatives. 
</p>
<p>27. Colm Allan, Director of the Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM) spoke about 
how PSAM has used social accountability to curb corruption in South Africa, particularly in the 
Eastern Cape Province.  PSAM promotes social accountability, the right of citizens to obtain 
justifications and explanations for the use of public resources from those entrusted with their 
management, in order to tackle corruption and achieve the realization of social and economic 
rights.  Mr. Allan emphasized the importance of a right to social accountability even in countries 
like South Africa that enjoy excellent constitutional provisions and a legislative framework, 
because of problems that occur in implementation.  He described the methodology PSAM 
developed for monitoring five social accountability systems:  (a) planning and resource 
allocation, (b) expenditure, (c) performance, (d) integrity, and (e) oversight.  By monitoring the 
performance of four Government departments between 2000 and 2006, PSAM determined that 
corruption and ineffective use of resources start at the planning and resource allocation stage 
when an accurate analysis of citizens&#8217; needs is missing.  Without such an analysis, proper 
planning cannot be done and over- and under-spending become common.  PSAM&#8217;s civic 
empowerment and advocacy in the Eastern Cape has, inter alia, resulted in greater awareness of 
the importance of accurate financial reporting by government departments, improved civil </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>society participation in governance processes, and strengthened Parliamentary oversight 
committees.  Mr. Allan highlighted the need to support multipronged approaches to rights-based 
monitoring and advocacy and to develop corresponding advocacy strategies at the national, 
provincial and local levels.  He added that attention must be given to strengthening both the 
capacity of duty-bearers to provide the information, explanations and justifications and of 
rights-holders to request, to access and to analyse information.  Mr. Allan concluded by 
emphasizing the importance of securing United Nations recognition of social accountability as a 
right, with the long-term objective of rendering it justiciable.   
28. Dejan Anastasijevic, a journalist, addressed the possible contribution of the media to the 
fight against corruption.  First, he suggested that the role the media can play has been highly 
overstated, particularly in contexts where organized crime is rampant.  He contended that the 
power of the media is an illusion nurtured by journalists, who like to believe they can influence 
events, and by politicians, who like to blame the media when things go wrong.  As evidence of 
the press&#8217;s powerlessness, he cited a number of examples, including disregard for calls from the 
international press for military intervention to stop the war in Bosnia in its early stages.  
Mr. Anastasijevic observed that if prosecutors refuse to prosecute or courts refuse to hear cases, 
and if no real consequences follow the exposure of corrupt officials, all the press can do is to 
inform audiences about the situation.  Shedding some light on matters does help, because 
organized crime fears exposure.  Under these circumstances, it is particularly important that law 
enforcement agencies be devoid of corruption and not infiltrated by organized crime.  He 
observed that many Governments have difficulties accepting the media as watchdogs, because 
they have a tendency to perceive those who are not directly tied to them as enemies, 
which is rather unfortunate given that both the media and Government are intended to serve the 
public. 
</p>
<p>29. Roy Snell, chief executive officer, Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE), 
proposed that the &#8220;supply side&#8221; of corruption be also addressed by including the private sector in 
efforts to tackle corruption.  Engaging the private sector is advisable both because it is often 
involved in corruption and human rights violations, and because it can contribute to fighting 
corruption, supporting good governance and promoting human rights.  He introduced the work of 
SCCE, one of several compliance and ethics programmes designed to fight corruption and 
human rights violations &#8220;from within&#8221;.  While compliance programmes help organizations to 
conform to the rule of law, ethics programmes help them to achieve a higher standard than the 
rule of law.  Mr. Snell described the professional certification that prepares compliance and 
ethics officers to provide oversight and to exercise their authority to investigate, to correct 
misconduct and to facilitate discipline in order to accomplish the change required to meet (or 
surpass) the law.  He noted that this level of authority distinguishes compliance programmes 
from corporate social responsibility programmes, which can influence change but rarely have the 
authority to make it happen.  He pointed out a variety of international compliance and ethics 
programmes, such as those of the Security and Exchange Board of India, the Global Compact, 
Transparency International and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Mr. Snell urged support for 
these programmes, because, among other things, change often comes easier when &#8220;the request 
for change comes from those who need to change&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>30. Maina Kiai highlighted the need for political will to move the anti-corruption agenda 
forward and the role of various linkages in order to do so.  He observed that Governments 
sometimes have to be enticed to tackle corruption, and the media and civil society can help make 
this happen.  Political will is important even in the corporate world where markets can be used to 
get companies to do the right thing.  Where markets are not capable of doing this, the human 
rights practice of adopting international standards is necessary.    Other important linkages 
include those between human rights and anti-corruption efforts; the media, which can push the 
agenda forward, and civil society, which may pick up from there and pursue the issues; NHRIs 
and civil society; and the North, the locus of supply, and South, where demand is located. 
Mr Kiai observed that close linkages between anti-corruption bodies and civil society are 
particularly important, because the work of anti-corruption agencies need to involve and be 
complemented by the civil society to be effective; besides, a close relationship between 
anti-corruption agencies and the executive compromises the agencies&#8217; watchdog role.  With 
regard to the media, Mr. Kiai emphasized the need for internal self-regulation to eliminate 
corruption, because the media cannot demand accountability and transparency from others if the 
same does not apply to them.  Turning to lessons to be drawn from the human rights movement, 
&#8220;one of the most consistent and persistent movements&#8221;, Mr. Kiai emphasized the value of 
persistence - in pushing the agenda forward, being creative, repeating the message, etc. - for 
anti-corruption work.  A final linkage which according to Mr. Kiai needs attention is the one 
between armed conflict, human rights and corruption.   
</p>
<p>31. In the discussion that followed, participants contributed a range of illustrative examples 
and formulated recommendations focused on the contribution of civil society, the media and the 
private sector to anti-corruption efforts.  Beginning with the private sector, one participant 
pointed to the part businesses can play in the field of workers&#8217; rights (e.g.:  working conditions, 
fair pay) specifically.  Another participant emphasized the need for corporate accountability and 
for the countries of the North to prosecute Northern companies and individuals involved in 
bribing officials in the South.  The speaker cited examples of Northern governments that ignored 
convictions and did not enforce judgements, and recommended that this issue be raised at the 
meeting of the Conference of the States Parties to UNCAC.  The importance of engaging civil 
society directly was repeatedly noted.  Ecuador&#8217;s anti-corruption commission was presented as 
an example in which the full spectrum of civil society organs are represented and which has 
made good progress in the fight against corruption as a result.  Citing the case of bribery related 
to Tsunami relief in Sri Lanka, one participant stressed the need to develop a methodology to 
ensure the public&#8217;s participation in speaking up about corruption and to adopt legislation that 
protects the rights of witnesses.  A related point was made regarding the focus of the Sri Lankan 
media on &#8220;petty&#8221; corruption and relative neglect of the &#8220;grand&#8221; corruption by high-level 
government officials involved in diverting Tsunami aid for other purposes.   
</p>
<p>32. A number of additional comments were made in relation to the role of the media in the 
fight against corruption.  Agreement was expressed regarding the importance of access to 
information and transparency in ending the impunity of corrupt officials, and the important role 
of the media in this regard.  Echoing two of the panellists who referred to the powerful negative 
role the media can sometimes play, one participant described how the media rehabilitate the &#8220;old 
corrupt&#8221; as &#8220;new business people&#8221; and noted that it is as important not to write favourably about </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>them today as it was to write critically of them before.  Also in relation to the limited power of 
the media, another participant noted that while Bangladesh enjoys a free media, the country is 
not free of corruption.  The speaker cautioned against the illusion that the media and civil society 
alone can solve the problem of corruption and urged that attention be given to the supply side, 
particularly donors.  Similarly, several participants highlighted the importance of the 
international community&#8217;s concerted action in supporting efforts within specific countries to 
fight corruption.  Because of the importance of international pressure in sustained efforts against 
corruption, a recommendation was made to convene recurring regional conferences to follow up 
on progress.   
</p>
<p>33. Other comments addressed a range of additional issues.  The need to define corruption 
was raised, with one participant noting that this is necessary to enable people &#8220;to recognize it&#8221;. 
Such recognition cannot be assumed as in some cultures people may not understand their 
practices as being corrupt.  A related point is the need to develop indices of corruption that go 
beyond &#8220;perception&#8221;, otherwise countries can simply hire public relations firms to improve their 
image without making real changes.  Finally, a question was raised regarding how political will 
can be sustained in the face of repeated setbacks. 
</p>
<p>34. The moderator concluded the session by highlighting six additional recommendations:   
(a) international standards should be adopted to tackle private sector corruption; (b) there should 
be more international collaboration to support governments to penalize corruption-related crime; 
(c) the media, civil society and the private sector should themselves be accountable, particularly 
if they are asking Governments to be; (d) we should learn from each other on the issues of 
corporate compliance, media practices and civil society initiatives and share those experiences 
between our countries; (e) we should simplify the definition of corruption, make it 
understandable to everyone by drawing on approaches adopted by human rights activists, and 
develop indices offering clear measurements of corruption; and (f) we need to consider the use of 
information and communication technologies in enabling transparency and holding public 
authorities accountable. 
</p>
<p><b>V. FIGHTING CORRUPTION WHILE SAFEGUARDING 
HUMAN RIGHTS   
</b></p>
<p>35. The session moderator, Juan Martabit, Permanent Representative of Chile to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva, explained the panel&#8217;s objective as highlighting the potential 
tensions between anti-corruption measures and the protection of human rights.  Additionally, the 
panel would identify areas of potential conflict, solutions to avoid tension between the two areas, 
and remedies in case of violations of rights as a result of anti-corruption measures. 
</p>
<p>36. Drawing on his experience, Mr. McMillan, Commonwealth Ombudsman of Australia, 
described how ombudsman offices can help curb corruption in Governments while safeguarding 
human rights.  Ombudsman offices handle complaints from members of civil society about 
shortcomings in government decision-making and service delivery, and occasionally investigate 
systemic problems occurring either within the Government or in specific agencies.  Because it 
lacks intrusive powers and adequate resources, the fight against corruption is not the main role of 
the ombudsman office.  Nevertheless, Mr. McMillan noted a number of ways in which the 
ombudsman office&#8217;s impact on corruption &#8220;is subtle but significant over time&#8221;.  The very 
existence of ombudsman offices is a constant reminder to public officials to act legally and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>ethically because their action can be complained about and investigated.  Government agencies 
often establish their own internal procedures for handling public complaints that ombudsman 
offices address, thereby adding another layer of scrutiny and transparency within the 
Government.  The possibility of an adverse finding by an ombudsman, which would damage a 
person&#8217;s career and financial prospects, acts as a deterrent.  Moreover, ombudsman offices often 
view themselves as champions of improving and strengthening Government and as such act as 
barriers to corrupt practices.   
</p>
<p>37. Mr. Romaszewski, member of the Polish Senate, maintained that the fight against 
&#8220;pathologies&#8221; like corruption always involves limiting, in one way or another, the human rights 
and freedoms of citizens.  The challenge, according to Mr. Romaszewski, is &#8220;proportionality&#8221; 
between the anti-corruption measures and the hazards created by the corruption.  He emphasized 
the importance of good laws and the need for ordinary citizens to understand and to know how to 
use them.  He noted that often laws limit rights and liberties in some way.  For example, Poland 
adopted an act that permits and regulates lobbying.  Mr. Romaszewski noted, however, that 
lobbying per se is a violation of civil rights in a sense, because it permits those with financial 
means to hire professional lobbyists to seek more influence on parliament&#8217;s decisions on the law.  
Another mechanism that has been instituted and which entails limits to rights is the obligatory 
declaration of incomes by public officials, which can be seen as violating the &#8220;presumption of 
innocence&#8221;.  A policy that Mr. Romaszewski believes Poland &#8220;got right&#8221; is the electoral 
campaign financing law, which, by placing caps on monetary contributions and requiring that 
they be proportionate to income, is aimed at preventing the purchase of influence over 
government policies.  Noting that corruption takes a variety of forms, Mr. Romaszewski 
distinguished between high-level and low-level corruption, active and passive corruption, and the 
giver and taker of bribes and recommended that sanctions and measures correspond to the nature 
of the act.  He further argued that, because it is rooted in greed, corruption should be subject to 
material sanctions and penalties should involve forfeiture of assets.  As for the means used to 
detect corruption, Mr. Romaszewski observed that the privatization of enforcement techniques 
(e.g.:  wire-taps, surveillance), which has made them available for use by others (e.g.:  the media, 
employers), makes it difficult to limit Governments&#8217; use of these techniques. 
</p>
<p>38. Phil Matsheza, from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which is 
mandated with implementing UNCAC and supporting Member States in their anti-corruption 
efforts, began by posing two questions:   (a) whether the relationship between fighting corruption 
and protecting human rights is necessarily complementary, and (b) whether any inherent 
contradictions exist between them.  Mr. Matsheza affirmed that corruption undermines human 
rights, particularly the principles of non-discrimination and the rule of law, and that it is rife 
where the rule of law is weak.  He pointed to the many principles that human rights, good 
governance and anti-corruption work share:  transparency, accountability, citizen participation, 
rule of law, freedom of expression, right to information, separation of powers, equality and 
non-discrimination, equity and fairness.  Mr. Matsheza noted, however, the persistence of abuses 
despite consensus regarding the relationship between corruption and human rights, and the 
existence of shared principles.  The question he then tackled was whether these abuses were a 
result of flaws inherent in the norms and standards, or whether they were produced during 
implementation by States.  To answer this question he turned to State practices and the 
normative framework.   </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>39. Mr. Matsheza began by identifying ways in which corruption is the outcome of State 
practices:  the politicization of anti-corruption measures by government officials who level false 
charges against their predecessors or rivals; law enforcement agents who seek and then abuse 
special investigation powers.  Mr. Matsheza then reviewed UNCAC for weaknesses that might 
create a potential for human rights abuses and concluded that its provisions provide for human 
rights protections.  Mr. Matsheza continued, however, that UNCAC is considerably more 
complex than most human rights treaties, making it difficult for States to understand their 
obligations, to recognize that anti-corruption and human rights are not mutually exclusive, and to 
implement its provisions.  He added that since the Convention came into force, UNODC has 
been inundated with requests for technical support in a variety of areas and that the requests 
indicated that some Member States are seeking quick fixes, while others are attempting to do too 
much in too short a time without developing necessary oversight and supervisory mechanisms.  
Mr. Matsheza cautioned that hastily developed legislation and national strategies have the 
potential to provide loopholes that could lead to human rights violations.  He concluded by 
noting that UNODC is aware of these potential pitfalls and is developing a legislative and 
technical guide to assist Member States to unpack UNCAC&#8217;s requirements.  
</p>
<p>40. Roberto Saba, Executive Director, Association for Civil Rights, acting as an expert, 
cautioned that anti-corruption measures that undermine the rule of law and violate human rights 
can be counterproductive.  Although Governments and civil society complain about human 
rights and civil rights protections limiting anti-corruption policies, Mr. Saba believes that some 
of the best tools for fighting corruption are found in these very protections.  By nature, 
corruption occurs in secret and while the measures used to penetrate that secrecy (e.g.:  
surveillance, wire-tapping) arguably inherently violate human rights, more often they do so 
because they are selectively applied, entailing discrimination and profiling.  Mr. Saba identified 
four rights violations that are likely to be involved:  (a) freedom of expression (of critics); 
(b) freedom of information (held by Government); (c) freedom from State interference in private 
life; and (d) due process of law.  He contended that although they may be effective against 
corruption, in the long run even &#8220;minor&#8221; restrictions of rights can subvert the rule of law and, as 
a result, efforts to eliminate corruption.  As such, disregard for rights in the name of combating 
corruption is both morally and strategically wrong.  Drawing from Argentina&#8217;s experience, 
Mr. Saba noted the significance of fair trials in the country&#8217;s transition to democratic rule in 
1983.  By holding trials widely recognized as just, the Government demonstrated to the people 
that the rule of law had been re-established and would apply to everyone.  This was vital as the 
selective application of law is the essence of corruption.  Moreover, to do otherwise undermines 
the moral authority, credibility and effectiveness of the fight against corruption, and provides to 
those who commit corrupt acts the opportunity to present themselves as victims of discrimination 
and persecution.   
</p>
<p>41. The discussion that followed affirmed that corruption compromised human rights.  The 
appropriation of public money impairs a country&#8217;s development and welfare and, as a result, the 
human rights of its citizens.  However, participants expressed the need to protect human rights in 
the course of combating corruption.  One participant emphasized the need to prevent the 
victimization of innocent people via entrapment, surveillance and other special investigative 
techniques.  Another participant commented that although UNCAC addressed this issue there 
was a need for detailed guidelines on how to protect human rights while working against 
corruption.  A related point was raised regarding the implications of a weak judiciary that is poor 
at achieving a balance between protecting the rights of the accused and carrying out justice, and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>that becomes bogged down for many years, in the process feeding the cynicism of the public 
who see nothing happening to individuals they believe to be guilty.  This view was echoed by 
another participant who noted courts becoming mired in procedural matters which result in 
lengthy and costly delays.  The need to build the capacity of the judiciary to effectively 
implement anti-corruption legislation while upholding human rights was affirmed.  In this regard 
the international community also has responsibilities.  Referring to the case of the Philippines, 
one participant observed that thousands of human rights victims of the Marcos era have filed 
cases in United States courts but have yet to receive redress.  He noted that the international 
community has an obligation to help recover the wealth amassed by dictators and stashed in the 
financial institutions of developed countries and called upon the United Nations to institute 
measures to accomplish this.  Participants were briefed about the Helsinki Process&#8217;s joint 
initiative between Finland and Tanzania, involving 20 countries in reviewing and discussing 
UNCAC prior to the December meeting of the Conference of the States Parties in Jordan.  
Participants were also briefed on developments in Cameroon, Cambodia, Jordan, UNDP Liberia, 
Nepal and Nigeria.   
</p>
<p>42. Panellists took up the questions and issues raised by the participants as follows:  
Mr. McMillan noted the tension and need for a balance between the desires to suppress 
corruption and to safeguard human rights.  One way to strike the balance is to have efficient and 
effective oversight agencies and a judicial process &#8220;that are marked by fairness and integrity&#8221;.  
Mr. Romaszewski concurred regarding the difficulty of finding the point of balance and 
suggested that it is likely to vary according to the conditions and history of each country.  
Mr. Matsheza observed that the instruments on human rights and law enforcement provide for 
such balance.  He noted the problem of law enforcement agencies seeking a &#8220;blank cheque&#8221; for 
dealing with corruption and the need for capacity-building programmes to enable investigators 
and prosecutors to observe human rights while combating corruption.  Mr. Saba attributed the 
weakness of the judicial system in addressing corruption to the decades-long process of erosion 
of the legitimacy of the judiciary in Latin America, where a survey revealed that approximately 
85 per cent of the people do not trust the judiciary.  He observed the need to strengthen the 
judicial system to enable it to resist the multiple pressures from the Government, the indictees, 
and the people who clamour for punishment.  Mr. McMillan noted that there are times when 
those on trial use human rights claims &#8220;to cloak, avoid or delay prosecution&#8221;, requiring that each 
human rights claim be tested for substance.  Mr. Matsheza emphasized that claims for human 
rights protection should not be treated as an &#8220;irritation&#8221; for law enforcement; legitimate human 
rights claims are a valid basis for throwing cases out.  He added that the solution is for law 
enforcement officials to do their jobs without resorting to extraordinary measures.  Echoing this 
position, Mr. Saba noted the importance of framing:  if anti-corruption work is framed with a 
view that human rights are an obstacle, then the result will be a betrayal of human rights values.  
He maintained that &#8220;we can do both&#8221; - fight corruption and protect human rights - and cautioned 
against presenting them &#8220;as either or&#8221;.  Mr. Saba also drew attention to the paradox of &#8220;saying 
that our Governments are often very corrupt and then also being willing to endow them with 
extraordinary powers to fight corruption&#8221;.  With regard to asset recovery, Mr. Romaszewski 
stressed the need for transparency of banking systems and tax havens but also noted that the 
recent recovery of Holocaust victims&#8217; assets indicated that it can be done.  Mr. Matsheza 
informed participants that UNODC has developed a training module on asset recovery and will 
be engaged in providing technical assistance in this area. </p>

</p>
<p>43. The moderator concluded the session by noting the prevalence of corruption despite the 
enormous differences and variety around the world.  He reaffirmed Mr. Saba&#8217;s contention that 
&#8220;Human rights are not a barrier to fighting corruption&#8221;.  He maintained that Governments should 
do all that is necessary to fight corruption but that human rights must not be compromised or 
treated as an obstacle.  He emphasized the importance of international cooperation in fighting 
corruption and in asset recovery, and the need to create international institutions that enjoy the 
support of civil society, government and the private sector.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Rapporteur&#8217;s feedback 
</b></p>
<p>44. At the conclusion of each day&#8217;s deliberations, the Rapporteur, Robert Archer, identified 
and discussed the principal issues and concerns raised by the panellists, experts and conference 
attendees.   
</p>
<p>45. Mr. Archer began by observing that participants spoke of corruption generally as &#8220;the 
misuse of public authority to pursue private benefits&#8221;, but had no consensual definition beyond 
this.  He noted that, while the lack of common definition did not appear to pose a problem during 
the deliberations, developing an international programme of work on this issue may, however, 
require a universally accepted definition.  Mr. Archer then turned to the importance that meeting 
participants placed on a range of issues to be taken into account for the development of effective 
anti-corruption measures:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; The need to involve many different institutions beyond Governments;  
</p>
<p>&#8722; The corresponding need for complex policy approaches that consider multiple 
participants and institutions; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The implications of context (social, political, historical); 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The vital importance of the law, both its nature and form, and its equal application to 
everyone; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The role of attitudes, both of the public and officials, and the impact of institutional 
cultures; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The necessity of reconciling different claims (e.g.:  public and private; human rights 
and efficient anti-corruption measures; interests of the accused and public interest; 
access to information and right to privacy). 
</p>
<p>46. Mr. Archer then pointed to the list of values and principles that had emerged in relation to 
different strategies: </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Human rights:  non-discrimination; access to information; need to develop 
participatory models that engage different actors; freedom of expression and other 
process rights, like freedom of association; and accountability and enforcement; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Governance:  transparency; accountability; participation; and access to information 
(with a link to administrative reform or practice); 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Ethical approaches:  public interest should override private interest; transparency; 
accountability; and enforcement; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Administrative reform:  separation of the political and administrative spheres; 
establish and promulgate ethical standards; develop effective lines of accountability 
within administrations; develop good rules of disclosure of information; and have 
competitive and transparent appointments; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct (although no explicit list cited) 
(E/CN.4/2003/65, annex). 
</p>
<p>47. While being mindful that different discourses use concepts differently, Mr. Archer 
suggested that at some point it may be useful to identify what those concepts have in common 
and to what extent they can be reconciled.  He concluded by identifying the following key 
challenges suggested by the meeting participants&#8217; interventions: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Recognizing &#8220;the slipperiness of language&#8221; and that different terms work for different 
audiences and institutions; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Addressing areas of tension between anti-corruption work and human rights, because 
a failure to do so &#8220;may prove demoralizing&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Being practical and providing the tools and means that can be applied directly to 
&#8220;make it real on the ground&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Addressing &#8220;issues of scale&#8221; and the possibility that institutions, particularly new 
ones, may be overwhelmed; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Securing adequate national and international resources to support programmes and 
Government departments. 
</p>
<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Business sector:  the inclusion of businesses in anti-corruption efforts is important 
because they are often involved in corruption.  Compliance programmes offer a 
promising approach by generating internal processes of accountability.  These 
programmes help create a culture of respect for human rights and anti-corruption that 
is parallel to, yet consistent with, external compliance mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The Media:  the &#8220;nuanced discussion&#8221; of the role of the media identified a range of 
issues requiring attention, including:  the powerlessness of the media under certain 
circumstances; their potential to do great harm (e.g.:  in Rwanda); respect for the rule 
of law and judicial independence as well as the existence of good laws for a free press 
to operate; ensuring that the media itself is accountable and free of corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Independent official monitoring authorities:  the unique contribution of monitoring 
authorities, such as national human rights institutions and ombudsmen offices, was 
noted, particularly their provision of a helpful interaction between civil society and 
government accountability agencies; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Parliament:  regarding the importance of the parliament&#8217;s role, a number of areas of 
concern were identified, such as direct bribery designed to influence the drafting of 
law; the potentially harmful influences of lobbying practices; and election abuses in 
the form of manipulation of results and campaign financing; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Public participation:  engaging the public and expanding its participation in 
anti-corruption efforts called attention to various issues such as the entitlement of all 
citizens to lodge complaints with an independent body and expect that they will be 
investigated; the importance of long-term education, advocacy and information in 
order to change attitudes; the need to cultivate a &#8220;culture of service rather than 
entitlement&#8221;; and the need to distinguish in gift cultures between acceptable sharing 
and acts of corruption. 
</p>
<p>49. Concerns regarding capacity and technical assistance accompanied discussions of each 
sector&#8217;s potential contribution to anti-corruption efforts.  Mr. Archer noted that participants 
called for building and strengthening the capacity of all those involved in bringing corruption 
cases to court (judges, prosecutors, law enforcement agents, etc.).  They pointed to the need for 
technically sophisticated judicial mechanisms to: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Enable courts and judicial officials to deal with the unique features of corruption 
cases (e.g.:  invisibility of victims, secrecy, no paper trail); and 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Ensure the successful prosecution of cases without violating human rights. 
</p>
<p>50. With regard to monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, Mr. Archer noted the 
importance of clear performance measures and objectives which should be appropriately 
designed (local, provincial, national, etc.) with similarly appropriate strategies for empowering 
communities to take action, and the long and complex process involved in building the capacity 
of both.  Ultimately, the public must be able to trust its institutions, therefore rebuilding trust is 
paramount and, in turn, requires that institutions not only be well constructed, transparent and 
independent, but also effective and efficient.  Finally, attention has been given to: </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The challenge of using technology to enhance anti-corruption work without infringing 
on human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The need to include armed conflict and war, which are associated with the worst 
abuses of power, in the global agenda on corruption and human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The importance of addressing the complex issue of access to information held by 
Governments. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Closing remarks 
</b></p>
<p>51. In the closing session Ambassador Juan Martabit from Chile and Mr. Hoonmin Lim from 
the Republic of Korea speaking on behalf of the participants thanked the Government of Poland 
and OHCHR for organizing the Conference. 
</p>
<p>52. In her concluding remarks Ms. Fotyga presented an introduction to the Chairperson&#8217;s 
statement and gave the floor to a member of the Secretariat of the Conference to present the 
various elements contained therein (attached in annex II to the present document).  Ms. Fotyga 
then indicated that a report of the Conference would be submitted to the Human Rights Council 
at its fourth session and thanked the participants and organizers and closed the Conference. </p>

<p><b>CHAIRPERSON&#8217;S STATEMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations Conference on Anti-Corruption Measures, 
Good Governance and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Warsaw, Republic of Poland, 8-9 November 2006 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p> The United Nations Conference on Anti-Corruption Measures, Good Governance and 
Human Rights was convened in Warsaw, Republic of Poland, from 8-9 November 2006.  It was 
organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
cooperation with the Government of the Republic of Poland.  The Conference had a practical 
orientation and was structured in a manner that could lead to the discussion of practical and 
concrete recommendations.  There were more than 240 participants from more than 
100 countries, including anti-corruption and human rights experts, Governments&#8217; 
representatives, public officials, civil society and private sector actors involved in leading 
national anti-corruption efforts.  The Chairman of the Conference was H.E. Anna Fotyga, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland. 
</p>
<p> The Conference was organized in response to the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 2005/68, which requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights &#8220;[...] to convene a seminar in 2006 [...] on the role of anti-corruption measures 
at the national and international levels in good governance practices for the promotion and 
protection of human rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The Conference was a follow-up to the joint OHCHR-UNDP Seminar on good 
governance practices for the promotion and protection of human rights, which took place in 
Seoul in September 2004.  The conclusions of that Seminar emphasized the mutually reinforcing, 
and sometimes overlapping, relationship between good governance and human rights.  It was 
also underlined that human rights and good governance are affected by corruption on the one 
hand and can contribute to the fight against corruption on the other hand.  
</p>
<p> There were opening addresses by H.E. Ms. Anna Fotyga, Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Republic of Poland, Ms. Maria Francisca Ize-Charrin, Director of Operations, Programme 
and Research Division from the OHCHR who delivered a statement on behalf of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. David Chikvaidze from the United Nations Office in 
Geneva who delivered the statement of the Director-General.  The keynote address on integrity 
and ethics was delivered by Mr. Dato Param Cumaraswamy, followed up by a welcome 
statement by the Acting Mayor of the City of Warsaw, Mr. Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz. 
</p>
<p><b>MAIN ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p> The main objective of the Conference was to identify concrete ways in which 
Governments&#8217; efforts to fight corruption are assisted by and contribute to human rights 
protection.  The Conference built on the increasing awareness within the international 
community about the detrimental impact of widespread corruption on human rights both through </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>the weakening of institutions and the erosion of public trust in government as well as through 
impairing the ability of Governments to fulfil human rights, particularly the economic and social 
rights of the most vulnerable and marginalized.  The Conference also addressed the abuses and 
derogations to human rights made in the name of the fight against corruption, limiting, inter alia, 
the rights to privacy, due process and freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p> Accordingly, the Conference focused on three themes: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Impact of corruption on human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; How human rights principles and approaches can help in fighting corruption - this 
theme was discussed in two panels: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; the first panel focusing on general issues related to this problem; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; the second panel focusing on the role of the private sector, civil society and 
media; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Fighting corruption while safeguarding human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Impact of corruption on human rights 
</b></p>
<p> The following problems were drawn from the presentations: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Violations of human rights are both a cause and an effect of corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is a need to reconcile private claims and public interests, right to privacy and 
efficient investigation and access to information, human rights principles and some 
anti-corruption work, etc.; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is a wide range of human rights that are affected by corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Civil service appointment system is especially important.  Although there is no 
perfect system - each has advantages and disadvantages - basic elements include:  
transparent procedure and criteria, competitive and non-political appointments, etc.; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For corruption to prevail, civil and political rights must be curtailed, and when it 
happens, enjoyment of economic and social rights decline; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Corruption is universal but it appears to be better controlled in countries that have 
adequate procedures, mechanisms and active public accountability; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The importance of language:  many values and principles are shared by people 
working on anti-corruption, good governance and human rights, but their use of the 
terms cannot be assumed to be the same.  There is a question how far practitioners in 
different sectors can use a single set of principles.  Another important issue is the 
sensitivity of terms, with an example of chief justice&#8217;s willingness to work on the 
right to a fair trial by an impartial tribunal rather than talk about corruption directly; </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Access to information is fundamental to the elimination of corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of bottoms-up efforts was emphasized. 
</p>
<p><b>2. How human rights and good governance principles 
can help in fighting corruption 
</b></p>
<p> The following points were raised during the presentations: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Potential positive role of national human rights institutions with anti-corruption 
mandates:  the experience of Ghana, which has incorporated anti-corruption into its 
mandate; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Value of human rights experience, methods, advocacy, etc., for anti-corruption 
efforts; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct (2003) was a valuable exercise and showed 
where use of human rights mechanisms can be useful; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of engaging different actors and building alliances between them on 
anti-corruption policies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of separating the political and administrative spheres to protect integrity 
and ensure accountability; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Poverty is caused by both &#8220;need and greed&#8221; that require different strategies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is also a need for judicial reforms:  extending number of acts that are criminal; 
replacing old laws that facilitate corruption; providing clear rules of evidence that 
allow prosecution to take place; developing effective sanctions (such as seizure of 
assets and prevention of travel).  Justice should be accessible, rapid and efficient, and 
the judicial system should be subject to public scrutiny; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Several examples of value and use of access to information laws around the world 
were presented.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Role of civil society, private sector and media 
</b></p>
<p> The presentations in relation to this theme focused on the following issues: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Crucial role of civil society in addressing corruption issues and its ability to use 
human rights principles in fighting corruption (e.g.:  through access to information 
laws); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to broaden anti-corruption efforts beyond governments to include focus on the 
supply side of corruption.  One way to do this is to look for and correct problems 
from &#8220;the inside&#8221; of companies; change is often easier if the request for change 
comes from those who need it as opposed to from outside (like the United Nations); </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of private sector in fighting corruption.  In private sector, corporate social 
responsibility and corporate compliance are separate methods within corporations.  
The first one deals with human rights and environmental protection issues while the 
second one is related to handling corruption issues; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Gap between excellent constitutional and legislative frameworks and weak 
implementation systems:  example of South Africa; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Monitoring public expenditures in provinces - site of actual service delivery; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Effective participation of citizens goes beyond mere consultation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Corruption and ineffective use of resources starts at the planning and resource 
allocation stage when there is a lack of accurate analysis of citizens&#8217; needs.  Without 
effective planning based on the assessment of needs effective reporting and 
monitoring are impossible; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to pursue multiple approaches to rights-based monitoring and accountability to 
service delivery, each with a corresponding advocacy strategy at the macro and 
microlevels; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to ensure a balance between supply and demand aspects of corruption and 
accountability; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to strengthen capacity of duty-bearers to provide the information, explanations 
and justifications as well as capacity of rights holders to demand, access and analyse 
information; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Media have a crucial role in exposing both human rights violations and corruption 
cases but there are also risks involved; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the context of absence of rule of law and accountability the potential role of the 
media is very limited and can even be negative unless internal self-regulation and 
accountability are applied.  In such cases the best that can be done is to shed light on 
these issues and make them known to citizens.  In some cases mass media may also 
help bring pressure to bear on politicians who lack political will to act; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of close linkages between a variety of sectors and actors:  national human 
rights institutions and civil society, civil society and anti-corruption agencies, 
pressure on supply side in North and demand side in South, etc.;   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to learn from human rights movements&#8217; notable persistence and consistency; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of cultivating a culture of transparency.  People do not necessarily see 
certain acts as corruption. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71

</p>
<p><b>4.  Fighting corruption while safeguarding human rights 
</b></p>
<p> The presentations raised the following points: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In his presentation Senator Zbigniew Romaszewski indicated that anti-corruption 
measures enhance good governance and human rights protection.  On the other hand, 
it is inevitable that while combating corruption certain rights and freedoms might be 
limited.  He also pointed out the importance of a coherent and stable legal system, as 
well as legal education and assistance in the context of preventing corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Rights which are in particular susceptible to violation as a result of anti-corruption 
measures: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Freedom of expression; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Freedom of information; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Freedom from State interference in private life; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Due process of law; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of the role of ombudsman institutions in ensuring protection of human 
rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Disregard for human rights in fighting corruption is a moral and strategic mistake; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Anti-corruption policies can use lessons from transitional justice against systematic 
and massive human rights violations experiences; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Risk of political use of anti-corruption measures in dealing with political opponents; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The collaboration between the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was emphasized.  Reference was 
made to the guidelines being prepared by UNODC to facilitate interpretation of the 
United Nations Convention Against Corruption with due attention to safeguarding 
human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p> The following recommendations emerged from the panel presentations and discussions:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Impact of corruption on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; States should sign, ratify and implement the United Nations Convention Against 
Corruption (UNCAC); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Government reforms are a necessary part of any strategy but many other actors must 
be involved; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/71 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Indicators need to be developed to clearly demonstrate the correlation of corruption 
and human rights to facilitate further legal analysis on the links between them; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need for transparency indices that show positive developments, not just negative; 
&#8226; Need to look at &#8220;grand&#8221; corruption also; most States, for political reasons, focus on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;petty&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to examine the role of actors abroad who participate in or incite corruption, 
including companies, third party governments, donors, lawyers who give legal cover, 
etc. 
</p>
<p><b>2. How human rights and good governance principles 
can help in fighting corruption 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Developing international rules covering access to information.  A potential leadership 
role for the United Nations; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Meaning of right to access to information needs to be explicated in more detail, and 
there may be a case for setting a new standard to define this right in more detail; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Importance of taking into account historical context when designing measures and 
reform programmes was underlined by Mr. Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice of 
the Republic of Poland.  He referred to the examples of former communist States 
reacting to the previous systems, where the State acted as the protector of a political 
order rather than its citizens, by taking steps to weaken State controls, resulting in the 
unintended consequence of unbridled corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Laws are not self-executing.  People and institutions must implement the laws to 
make them operational.  Institutions and staff need resources to implement the laws.  
Strong commitment from all stakeholders, especially from Government is important; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An independent national human rights institution, well resourced can effectively 
enhance and contribute significantly to the promotion and protection of human rights 
in combating corruption. 
</p>
<p><b>3.</b>  <b>Role of civil society, private sector and media 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Support implementation of corporate compliance programmes in fighting corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Expand rights-based understanding within the United Nations to include the 
recognition of social accountability as a right not merely as a constitutional principle; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Address link between armed conflict, human rights and corruption; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to develop common definitions; </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/71 
 page 33 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Need to develop a methodology to ensure participation of the public in 
anti-corruption efforts and holding government officials to account. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Fighting corruption while safeguarding human rights 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; UNCAC does not contain explicit human rights language.  This should be redressed 
in the follow-up, including the upcoming conference of States parties; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is very important to develop an implementation programme for UNCAC that 
ensures protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Institutions similar to ombudsman should be established. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p> Actions proposed by participants included: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Encourage States, international organizations and other actors to integrate the 
recommendations from this Conference into their work; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should present a 
report containing these conclusions to the United Nations Human Rights Council 
which may consider further steps in tackling this subject, including:  disseminate the 
conclusions of the Conference nationally and internationally and create a working 
group to focus on this question and make recommendations in relation to the role of 
OHCHR in dealing with the linkage between corruption and human rights. </p>
