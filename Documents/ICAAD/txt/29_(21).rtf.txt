Counsel: Mr. M. Tedechi QC, Mr. G. Allan & Ms A. Prasad for State;
Mr. M. Raza for 1st Accused;
2nd Accused in Person;
Mr. S. Naqase for 3rd and 6th Accused;
Mr. D. Sharma for 4th Accused;
No appearance for 5th Accused.

RULING

I rule that Mr. Vuataki cannot appear as counsel in these proceedings. I am aware that he was faced with this situation in the previous trial of Nata and Silatolu and am disappointed that this issue had to be raised at this stage.

In this case counsel for the 4th accused has declared his intention of calling Mr. Vuataki has a defence witness.

Alternative counsel for Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure and Mr. Peceli Rinakama must be ready for trial on the 15th of June. Mr. Rinakama is not present today and the court registry will inform him of this in writing.
