<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to the Human Rights Council resolution 8/12, the Special Rapporteur is 
mandated to respond effectively to reliable information on alleged human rights violations 
with a view to protecting the human rights of actual or potential victims of trafficking.  This 
addendum sets out summaries of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur from 1 
April 2010 to 15 March 2011. It also includes summaries of Government replies received 
from 11 May 2010 to 1 May 2011.  
</p>
<p>2. For reasons of confidentiality, privacy and protection, most names of the victims 
appear only in initials in this report.  The Special Rapporteur has also used initials for 
certain other persons concerned in order to minimise the risk of possible further 
victimization.  Moreover, with a view to preserve the presumption of innocence, only 
initials are used for the names of alleged perpetrators.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, a total of 10 communications were sent to 10 
countries.  The overview of these communications is provided in the table in Section II.  6 
of the communications were sent jointly with other Special Procedures mandate holders, 
including: the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions.  As of 1 May 2011, the Special Rapporteur received only 
3 replies to the communications and regrets that she still has not received replies to the 
remaining 7 communications.  The Special Rapporteur wishes to recall the obligations of 
the Governments under the Human Rights Council resolution 8/12 to provide her with all 
the necessary information related to the mandate to enable her to fulfill the mandate 
effectively, and urges the Governments concerned to submit replies to her communications 
in a timely manner.   
</p>
<p>4. In framing her interventions in these cases, the Special Rapporteur was guided by 
the legal framework and principles set out in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (&#8220;the Protocol&#8221;), international human 
rights instruments, and the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking, issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
July 2002 (&#8220;Recommended Principles and Guidelines&#8221;).   
</p>
<p>5. She frequently recalled article 6, paragraph 3 of the Protocol, which is the key 
provision in guaranteeing that trafficked persons are provided with adequate assistance in 
their recovery and reintegration.  It provides that: &#8220;Each State Party shall consider 
implementing measures to provide for the physical, psychological and social recovery of 
victims of trafficking in persons, including, in appropriate cases, in cooperation with non-
governmental organizations, other relevant organizations and other elements of civil 
society, and, in particular, the provision of: (a) Appropriate housing; (b) Counselling and 
information, in particular as regards their legal rights, in a language that the victims of 
trafficking in persons can understand; (c) Medical, psychological and material assistance; 
and (d) Employment, educational and training opportunities&#8221;.  Further, the Special 
Rapporteur frequently cited principle 2 of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines, 
which provides that: &#8220;States have a responsibility under international law to act with due 
diligence to prevent trafficking, to investigate and prosecute traffickers and to assist and 
protect trafficked persons&#8221;. In addition, the Special Rapporteur often stressed the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>importance of cooperation and coordination between States and regions.  In a few of the 
communications, she often recalled guideline 11, paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Recommended 
Principles and Guidelines, which respectively recommend States to consider: &#8220;developing 
cooperation arrangements to facilitate the rapid identification of trafficked persons 
including the sharing and exchange of information in relation to their nationality and right 
of residence&#8221; and &#8220;establishing mechanisms to facilitate the exchange of information 
concerning traffickers and their methods of operation&#8221;.

<p><b> A. Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 15 October 2010  
</b>7. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery, and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, sent a letter of allegation concerning an estimated 70,000 child bonded labourers 
who worked in the so-called &#171; rat mines &#187; of Jaintia Hills, which is located in the North 
Eastern State of Meghalaya, India. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received, an estimated 70,000 bonded child labourers 
from Nepal and Bangladesh worked at the so-called &#8220;rat mines&#8221; of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya 
State, India. The mines were reportedly known as such, because of the narrow and crude 
holes dug into the hills where only children can pass. It was estimated that about 40,000 
children from Bangladesh and 30,000 children from Nepal worked at the mines. In most 
cases, the children were allegedly purchased by middlemen or abducted or sold by gangs in 
Nepal and Bangladesh to the mining mafia in Meghalaya. The children were allegedly sent 
to the mines after their parents accepted money from middlemen engaged in child 
trafficking. The price for a child varied from 50 to 75 US dollars. It was claimed that 
everyday, trucks transporting coal to Bangladesh returned with children, who were lured 
into the mining industry with the promise of better wages and living conditions. The 
children were in debt bondage situations, as they were not paid for their work in some cases 
so that they repay with their labour the price for which they were bought.  In other cases, 
the children were given half wage compared to adults, which left them with very little 
money to survive on as expenses for their good are deducted from their wages.  
</p>
<p>9. The working conditions at the mines were allegedly hazardous, unhygienic, cruel 
and inhuman. The children were threatened not to disclose their identity to anyone they 
meet and they had no freedom to move from the premises of the mines. The working hours 
were long and the children had no rest from the day break to the nightfall. They had no 
means to communicate with the outside world, let alone their families. The children were 
not provided with any safety equipment and were only given shovels or pickaxes to extract 
coal or limestone. Further, it appeared that deaths of children were common due to the 
unsafe working conditions at Jaintia Hills and often remained unreported. According to the 
information received, human skeletons were recovered beneath a pile of coal in the mine in 
Jaintia Hills and it was verified that they were the remains of children who lost their lives 
due to suffocation in the mine shafts or in other accidents during the mining operations.  
</p>
<p>10. The information received also suggested that the children lived in very poor 
conditions. They reportedly lived in huts made with plastic sheets and there were no proper 
sanitary facilities. There was a lack of safe drinking water and proper sewage system. 
Although many people fell ill due to the poor living conditions, there were no medical 
facilities available near the mines.  
</p>
<p>11. It was alleged that girls were also often bought by the owners of the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and 
subject to sexual exploitation. They were exploited not only by mine owners, but also 
managers, other older workers and even truck drivers. There was also information 
suggesting that some children were trafficked further from the mines to the cities for sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteurs sought clarifications of the facts from the Government and 
requested information on: actions or investigations undertaken to identify the Bangladeshi 
children working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and to verify their working conditions; investigations </p>

</p>
<p>carried out in relation to individuals who were implicated in trafficking or selling the 
Bangladeshi children to the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and keeping them in bonded labour; policies and 
preventive and awareness-raising measures undertaken to prevent human trafficking, sale 
of children and sexual exploitation of children in Bangladesh; whether the victims or the 
families of the victims had access to adequate procedures of compensation for damages 
from those legally responsible for the trafficking in children, the sale of children, sexual 
exploitation of children, and the use of bonded labour; and any cooperation arrangements 
with the Indian authorities to facilitate the rapid identification of the Bangladeshi children 
working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Response and observations  
</b></p>
<p>13. On 29 October 2010, the Government informed that the contents of the 
communication had been duly noted and forwarded to the concerned authorities in 
Bangladesh for necessary inquiry and actions. Regrettably, the Special Rapporteur has not 
received any response since then.  She calls upon the Government to provide her with 
responses on the questions raised in the communication as soon as possible.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Czech Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 17 December 2010 
</b></p>
<p>14. On 17 December 2010, the Special Rapporter sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government concerning the possible negative impact of recent amendments to the Criminal 
Code on combating trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>15. According to the information received, section 368, paragraph 1 of the Criminal 
Code provides that any person who has received plausible information about another 
person having committed a crime and fails to report such a crime without delay to a 
prosecutor or a law enforcement body shall be liable to imprisonment for up to three years. 
This &#8220;duty to report&#8221; under section 368 applies to a wide range of crimes, including 
murder, grievous bodily injury, hostage taking, abuse of children for the production of 
pornographic material, currency counterfeiting and altering, development, production or 
possession of illegal military equipment, hijacking of an aircraft abroad, genocide, and 
apartheid or discrimination against a group of people. Pursuant to section 368, paragraph 3, 
there are two categories of professionals exempted from this &#8220;duty to report&#8221;. The first 
category is attorneys at law and their employees, who learned about the commitment of the 
designated crimes in connection with legal practice or representation. The second category 
is priests of registered churches and religious societies, who learned about the commitment 
of the designated crimes under the seal of the confessional or in the exercise of a similar 
right.  
</p>
<p>16. On 1 January 2010, section 368 of the Criminal Code was amended, so that the 
&#8220;duty to report&#8221; applies to the crime of human trafficking as defined under section 168 and 
the crime of depriving personal freedom as defined under section 170. However, non-
governmental organizations (&#8220;NGO&#8221;) and other service providers assisting trafficked 
persons are not exempted from the &#8220;duty to report&#8221; under section 368. 
</p>
<p>17. It was alleged that these amendments may have a negative impact on the work of 
such NGOs and service providers, as they may be prevented from building a relationship of 
trust and confidence with trafficked persons, given the duty to report the crime of human 
trafficking to law enforcement authorities. In many cases, trafficked persons may not wish 
to have the crime reported to the authorities due to a variety of factors, such as distrust in 
the authorities, fear of reprisals by traffickers, or fear of being deported to their countries of 
origin or facing other sanctions. Thus, respect for confidentiality and privacy is a crucial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>principle for NGOs and other service providers in reaching out to trafficked persons and 
providing them with necessary assistance.  
</p>
<p>18. Further, it was claimed that the &#8220;duty to report&#8221; may adversely affect relationships 
of trust with certain communities such as migrant communities or communities of sex 
workers, whose members may include trafficked persons or may be aware of potential 
cases of human trafficking. The information received suggested that possible cases of 
human trafficking were often reported to NGOs by third persons, particularly those from 
migrant communities. The &#8220;duty to report&#8221; may effectively discourage such third persons 
from reporting possible cases of human trafficking to NGOs, as they may wish to avoid 
contact with the law enforcement authorities for reasons related to their immigrant status.  
</p>
<p>19. In addition, it was alleged that the &#8220;duty to report&#8221; may jeopardize the safety and 
security of NGOs and service providers, as any person reporting a crime of human 
trafficking must provide his or her permanent address for the record. There was concern 
that NGOs and service providers and their family members may be exposed to risks of 
reprisals by traffickers, as the witness protection regime was allegedly inadequate in 
practice.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur sought clarifications of the amendments to the Criminal 
Code and requested information from the Government on: the rationale behind the 
amendments; whether or not their impact on the human rights of trafficked persons was 
fully considered prior to the introduction of the amendments; whether the Government 
intended to mitigate any negative impact by excluding the crime of human trafficking, or 
NGOs and service providers assisting trafficked persons, from the application of section 
368; and measures undertaken by the Government to ensure that the duty to report a crime 
does not jeopardize the confidentiality and privacy of trafficked persons, and that NGOs, 
service providers or any other persons who report a potential case of human trafficking to 
the law enforcement authorities are protected from harm, threats or intimidation by 
traffickers and associated persons.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Response of the Government of 3 March 2011  
</b></p>
<p>21. By letter dated 3 March 2011, the Government replied to the communication of 17 
December 2010.  The Government referred to the statement of the Legislative Security Unit 
concluding that it is possible to presume that social workers providing services to victims 
of trafficking or similar crimes will fall under the category of persons who are exempted 
from the &#8220;duty to report&#8221;, especially due to the nature of their work.  The statement also 
added that the &#8220;duty to report&#8221; does not always arise when the person obtains only vague 
information or suspicions.  In conclusion, the Government stressed that since the new 
Criminal Code came into effect, no single social worker has been prosecuted or even 
investigated pursuant to section 368 of the Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>22. The Government also informed the Special Rapporteur that the Ministry of Interior 
implements a wide range of measures to ensure the protection of victims of trafficking in 
full compliance with international and regional standards.  The Government referred to the 
Witness Protection Programme, the Programme for Support to Combat Illegal Migration, 
the Programme for voluntary returns, and the Programme that grants long-term residence 
permits to foreigners cooperating with law enforcement agencies whose presence is 
significant for prevention, detection or investigation of a serious crime.        
</p>
<p><b> 3. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response provided by the Government.  She 
remains concerned, however, that the exemption of NGOs and service providers assisting 
trafficked persons from the &#8220;duty to report&#8221; is still not spelt out in law and the Government </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>relies on the assumption that they would not be prosecuted.  The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to carefully review the potential impact of these provisions 
once again and to consider amending the provisions so that such service providers are 
legally exempted from the &#8220;duty to report&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Egypt  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 8 December 2010  
</b></p>
<p>24. On 8 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
approximately 260 migrants from Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia who were held hostage by 
&#8220;traffickers&#8221; in Sinai and six of the Eritrean hostages who were murdered by the traffickers.     
</p>
<p>25. According to the information received, approximately 260 migrants from Eritrea, 
Sudan and Ethiopia had been held hostage for over a month in Sinai near the Israeli border.  
The information received suggested that the place of hostage was likely to be the city of 
Rafah near the Israeli border, and the migrants were reportedly held in purpose-built 
containers.  The hostages were allegedly held in extremely degrading and inhumane 
conditions.  It was reported that they were bound by chains around their ankles, deprived of 
adequate food and given salty water to drink, and subjected to beating and ill-treatment by 
extreme methods, including the use of electric shocks.    
</p>
<p>26. It was reported that the traffickers were demanding a payment of US$8,000 per 
person as a condition of release and ongoing journey to Israel.  On 28 November 2010, 
three Eritrean hostages were reportedly killed by gunshot, after their family members 
confirmed that they were unable to make the payment to the traffickers.  On 29 November 
2010, another three Eritrean hostages reportedly died after being beaten with sticks and 
tortured by the traffickers for attempting to escape.  It was also alleged that nine hostages 
were seriously injured, ten suffered from serious diseases and there were several pregnant 
women among the hostages.   It was alleged that while this case was reported to the police, 
they had not commenced any investigation or taken any action.   
</p>
<p>27. These allegations were reported in light of information suggesting that Sinai has 
become a major centre for people trafficking by highly organized crime syndicates.  
Reports indicated that migrants were often trafficked through Sinai desert to Israel, 
particularly for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.  Migrants were also 
allegedly exploited in the hands of traffickers during their journey and subjected to violence 
and abuse, including rape, sexual assault, use of electric shocks, branding with hot metals 
and beatings.  Concerns had been further raised that the migrants currently held hostage 
may include trafficked persons.  In addition, it was of concern that despite the information 
indicating the existence of organized traffickers in Sinai, the law enforcement authorities 
allegedly failed to take any action to address this issue.   
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteurs sought clarifications of the facts and requested information 
on any investigation carried out in relation to the migrants who were held hostages in Sinai; 
steps taken to ensure the safety of the hostages; any investigation carried out in relation to 
the alleged murder of the six Eritrean migrants; and any measures undertaken by the 
Government to combat and prevent crimes committed by traffickers in Sinai.    </p>

<p><b> 1. Communication du 25 mars 2011 
</b></p>
<p>30. Le 25 mars 2011, la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la traite des personnes, en particulier 
les femmes et les enfants, a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation au Gouvernement concernant la 
situation de Mlle Kate Moses,  qui aurait &#233;t&#233; victime de traite des personnes &#224; des fins 
d&#8217;exploitation sexuelle. Il &#233;tait mentionn&#233; que Mlle Moses aurait &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e &#224; plusieurs 
reprises pour s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier en France et n&#8217;aurait re&#231;u ni protection, ni assistance, au titre 
de victime de traite des personnes. 
</p>
<p>31. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, Mlle Moses serait une ressortissante du Sierra L&#233;one, 
r&#233;sidant actuellement &#224; Bordeaux, en France. Elle serait n&#233;e le 3 mars 1980 &#224; Kenema, en 
Sierra Leone. En 2001, ses parents et sa s&#339;ur cadette auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;s au Sierra Leone par 
un groupe arm&#233;. Mlle Moses aurait alors fui en Guin&#233;e peu de temps apr&#232;s cet incident. En 
Guin&#233;e, elle aurait rencontr&#233; un homme dans une &#233;glise qui l&#8217;aurait aid&#233; &#224; se rendre 
clandestinement en France par bateau en Octobre 2002. A son arriv&#233;e en France, Mlle 
Moses aurait rencontr&#233; une femme sur le port qui l&#8217;aurait emmen&#233; en train &#224; Creil. A Creil, 
cette femme l&#8217;aurait accompagn&#233;e &#224; la Croix Rouge Fran&#231;aise o&#249; Mlle Moses a fait une 
demande d&#8217;asile le 15 octobre 2002. Ce m&#234;me jour, Mlle Moses aurait fait la connaissance 
d&#8217;une femme nomm&#233;e Eva qui l&#8217;aurait emmen&#233; &#224; Bordeaux en train. Il &#233;tait rapport&#233; que 
Mlle Moses serait rest&#233;e dans l&#8217;appartement de cette d&#233;nomm&#233;e Eva qui l&#8217;aurait forc&#233; de se 
prostituer &#224; Bordeaux d&#8217;Octobre 2002 &#224; la fin 2004. Mlle Moses aurait alors &#233;t&#233; forc&#233;e de 
donner pendant cette p&#233;riode tout l&#8217;argent qu&#8217;elle gagnait &#224; Eva, soit environ 3800 euros 
par semaine. Il &#233;tait estim&#233; que Mlle Moses aurait ainsi donn&#233; &#224; Eva environ 220 000 euros. 
Il &#233;tait aussi rapport&#233; que durant cette p&#233;riode elle aurait &#233;t&#233; victime de coups de la part du 
compagnon d&#8217;Eva. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, Mlle Moses ne pouvait pas fuir, car elle 
ne parlait pas fran&#231;ais, elle ne connaissait personne en France, elle &#233;tait toujours surveill&#233;e 
par Eva et elle n&#8217;avait pas de titre de s&#233;jour valable pour demeurer l&#233;galement en France. 
</p>
<p>32. La demande d&#8217;asile de Mlle Moses a &#233;t&#233; rejet&#233;e par la Commission des recours des 
r&#233;fugi&#233;s le 19 mars 2004 au motif qu&#8217;il ne r&#233;sultait pas de l&#8217;instruction que Mlle Moses 
aurait &#233;t&#233; personnellement expos&#233;e &#224; des pers&#233;cutions pour l&#8217;un des motifs &#233;num&#233;r&#233;s &#224;

r&#233;fugi&#233;s en cas de retour au Sierra Leone. Depuis 2005, Mlle Moses a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e &#224; 
plusieurs reprises pour s&#233;jour irr&#233;gulier. Le 24 juin 2005, elle a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e par le 
Tribunal Correctionnel de Lyon &#224; deux mois d&#8217;emprisonnement ainsi qu&#8217;&#224; une interdiction 
du territoire national durant trois ans pour avoir omis de pr&#233;senter &#224; l&#8217;autorit&#233;

renseignements inexacts sur son identit&#233;. Le 23 mai 2008, elle a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e &#224; trois mois 
d&#8217;emprisonnement pour les m&#234;mes raisons. Le 4 septembre 2008, elle a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e &#224; 
trois mois d&#8217;emprisonnement et trois ans d&#8217;interdiction du territoire national pour s&#233;jour 
irr&#233;gulier en France en r&#233;cidive et racolage public. Enfin, le 16 janvier 2009, Mlle Moses a

<p><b> 2. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur is still awaiting a response from the Government and 
encourages the Government to provide a response by 25 May 2011, as indicated in the 
communication.   
</p>
<p><b> E. India 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 15 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>36. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery, and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, sent a letter of allegation concerning an estimated 70,000 child bonded labourers 
who worked in the so-called &#171; rat mines &#187; of Jaintia Hills, which is located in the North 
Eastern State of Meghalaya, India. 
</p>
<p>37. According to the information received, an estimated 70,000 bonded child labourers 
from Nepal and Bangladesh worked at the so-called &#8220;rat mines&#8221; of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya 
State, India. The mines were reportedly known as such, because of the narrow and crude 
holes dug into the hills where only children can pass. It was estimated that about 40,000 
children from Bangladesh and 30,000 children from Nepal worked at the mines. In most 
cases, the children were allegedly purchased by middlemen or abducted or sold by gangs in 
Nepal and Bangladesh to the mining mafia in Meghalaya. The children were allegedly sent 
to the mines after their parents accepted money from middlemen engaged in child 
trafficking. The price for a child varied from 50 to 75 US dollars. It was claimed that 
everyday, trucks transporting coal to Bangladesh returned with children, who were lured 
into the mining industry with the promise of better wages and living conditions. The 
children were in debt bondage situations, as they were not paid for their work in some cases 
so that they repay with their labour the price for which they were bought.  In other cases, 
the children were given half wage compared to adults, which left them with very little 
money to survive on as expenses for their good were deducted from their wages.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>38. The working conditions at the mines were allegedly hazardous, unhygienic, cruel 
and inhuman. The children were threatened not to disclose their identity to anyone they met 
and they had no freedom to move from the premises of the mines. The working hours were 
long and the children had no rest from the day break to the nightfall. They had no means to 
communicate with the outside world, let alone their families. The children were not 
provided with any safety equipment and were only given shovels or pickaxes to extract coal 
or limestone. Further, it appeared that deaths of children were common due to the unsafe 
working conditions at Jaintia Hills and often remained unreported. According to the 
information received, human skeletons were recovered beneath a pile of coal in the mine in 
Jaintia Hills and it was verified that they were the remains of children who lost their lives 
due to suffocation in the mine shafts or in other accidents during the mining operations.  
</p>
<p>39. The information received also suggested that the children live in very poor 
conditions. They reportedly lived in huts made with plastic sheets and there are no proper 
sanitary facilities. There was a lack of safe drinking water and proper sewage system. 
Although many people fell ill due to the poor living conditions, there were no medical 
facilities available near the mines.  
</p>
<p>40. It was alleged that girls were also often bought by the owners of the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and 
subject to sexual exploitation. They were exploited not only by mine owners, but also 
managers, other older workers and even truck drivers. There was also information 
suggesting that some children were trafficked further from the mines to the cities for sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteurs sought clarifications of the facts from the Government and 
requested information on: actions or investigations undertaken to identify the children 
working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and to verify their working conditions; investigations carried out 
in relation to individuals who were implicated in trafficking or selling the children to the 
&#8220;rat mines&#8221; and keeping them in bonded labour; whether the Government of Meghalaya 
fully considered the use of child labour at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; in drafting mining policies; 
policies and preventive and awareness-raising measures undertaken to combat human 
trafficking, sale of children and sexual exploitation of children in India; whether the victims 
or the families of the victims had access to adequate procedures of compensation for 
damages from those legally responsible for the trafficking in children, the sale of children, 
sexual exploitation of children, and the use of bonded labour; and any cooperation 
arrangements with the Nepalese or Bangladeshi authorities to facilitate the rapid 
identification of the children working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided a reply to the 
communication to date and continues to receive information that a large number of children 
continue to be maintained in situations of bonded labour.  The Special Rapporteur calls 
upon the Government to provide information on the questions raised in the communication 
as soon as possible and to immediately undertake appropriate measures to protect the rights 
of the children concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Malaysia  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 13 December 2010  
</b></p>
<p>43. On 13 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government concerning amendments to the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act 2007 (&#8220;ATIP 
Act&#8221;) approved by the Malaysian Parliament in August 2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>44. According to the information received, clause 4 (g) of the Anti-Trafficking in 
Persons (Amendment) Act 2010 stated that trafficking in persons means &#8220;all actions 
involved in acquiring or maintaining the labour or services of a person through coercion, 
and includes the act of recruiting, conveying, transferring, harbouring, providing or 
receiving a person for the purposes of this Act&#8221;. This definition of trafficking in persons 
effectively limited the crime to those situations in which a person is exploited by means of 
&#8220;coercion&#8221;, defined in the ATIP Act essentially as threat of serious harm to or physical 
restraint against a person, or &#8220;the abuse of the legal process&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>45. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Amendment) Act 2010 also created Part IIIA and 
effectively incorporated provisions criminalizing the facilitation of irregular migrants in 
and out of Malaysia in Part III, which concerns the offence of trafficking in persons.  
Further, under section 41A of the amended ATIP Act, smuggled migrants were specifically 
excluded from protection or assistance available to trafficked persons under Part V of the 
ATIP Act, unless &quot;the smuggled migrant is a trafficked person&quot;.  
</p>
<p>46. Moreover, it was reported that the amended ATIP Act gave law enforcement 
authorities a wide power in investigating offences under the ATIP Act, such as arbitrarily 
detaining migrants, interrogating them about smuggling networks, and charging them with 
giving support to smugglers based on the fact that they paid for their own journeys.  
Furthermore, the amended ATIP Act contained no provisions ensuring that smuggled 
migrants are treated in accordance with international human rights law during interception, 
detention, and deportation proceedings. Finally, the anti-smuggling amendments to the 
ATIP Act did not recognize the specific protection needs of refugees and asylum seekers.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur sought clarifications of the amendments to the ATIP Act and 
asked the Government whether they had already entered into force.  She requested 
information from the Government on: any measures that it had taken or intended to take to 
ensure that trafficked persons were not misidentified as irregular migrants and that they 
received appropriate protection and assistance under the ATIP Act; the ambit of the 
definition of trafficking in persons under the ATIP Act and the rationale behind the 
amendments introduced; any measures that it had taken or intended to take to protect 
persons who were trafficked by means of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of 
power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits 
to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person; and any measures 
that the Government had taken or intended to take to ensure the respect of the non-
refoulement principle and to provide effective protection to those individuals seeking 
asylum. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Response of the Government of 8 February 2011  
</b></p>
<p>48. By letter dated 8 February 2011, the Government replied to the communication of 
13 December 2010.  The Government informed that the amendments to the ATIP Act 
entered into force on 15 November 2010.  In explaining the scope of the amendments, it 
stressed that the revised definition of trafficking in persons under section 2 of the ATIP Act 
should be read together with substantive provisions under Part III (sections 12 to 24) of the 
ATIP Act, which specifically criminalized trafficking in persons (section 12), aggravated 
trafficking in persons (section 13), trafficking in persons against children (section 14), 
profiting from exploitation of trafficked person (section 15) as well as various ancillary 
offences.  The Government stated that reading these provisions together would demonstrate 
that the requirements under the Palermo Protocol have been satisfied.            
</p>
<p>49. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the rationale for the revised 
definition was to extend the scope of trafficking in persons to include forced labour and to 
streamline the definition with the existing definitions of &#8220;exploitation&#8221; and &#8220;coercion&#8221;, as 
well as the substantive criminalizing provision.  In this regard, the Government noted that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;coercion&#8221; is separately defined in section 2 of the Act to mean: &#8220;(a) threat of serious harm 
to or physical restraint against any person; (b) any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to 
cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or 
physical restraint against any person; or (c) the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal 
process&#8221;.  Thus, the Government took the view that the term &#8220;coercion&#8221; as used in the 
definition of &#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; actually encompasses all aspects of the definition of 
trafficking in persons under article 3 of the Palermo Protocol.   
</p>
<p>50. The Government stated that it is fully aware that the crime of trafficking in persons 
is substantively different from the crime of smuggling of migrants in that the former 
contains the element of exploitation; the non-requirement of illegal border crossing and the 
fact that victims of trafficking are treated as commodities.  Smuggling of migrants is 
identified mainly from the non-existence of the element of exploitation; the involvement of 
illegal border crossing and the fact that the smuggled migrants have paid for the illegal 
passage and are considered clients of the smugglers.    
</p>
<p>51. The Government maintained that it had taken and will continue to take various 
measures to avoid the misidentification of trafficked persons as irregular migrants.  Such 
measures included the initiative to conduct several training courses to equip relevant 
officers with knowledge of the differences between the crime of trafficking and the 
smuggling of migrants.  The Government informed that the primary target of this training 
included the front line agencies such as the Immigration Department, the Royal Malaysia 
Police, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, the Royal Malaysian Customs and 
the Malaysian Labour Department.  The Government has also jointly conducted courses 
with the Australian Government to train prosecutors and enforcement agencies on 
trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling.  Furthermore, the Government informed that 
Standard Operating Procedures have been prepared and implemented by respective 
enforcement agencies.  Standard Operating Procedures are said to be aimed at minimizing 
the occurrence of misidentification of a trafficked person as a smuggled migrant and also at 
ensuring a better understanding of the difference between the crime of trafficking and the 
crime of people smuggling.  
</p>
<p>52. As for the protection accorded by the Government to trafficked persons, the 
Government stated that steps have been taken to provide for the necessary shelter homes, as 
provided under section 42 of the amended ATIP Act.  According to the Government, it 
provides, among others, counseling and medical treatment to the victims.  At the time of 
the reply, there were nine authorized public shelters, although only six of them were 
operational.  The Government was also said to be working with NGOs to provide shelters, 
counseling and skill training for trafficked persons.    
</p>
<p>53. In response to the question as to what measures the Government had taken or 
intended to take to ensure the respect of the non-refoulement principle, the Government 
stated that despite its non-ratification of the United Nations Convention Relating to the 
Status of Refugees, the Government has morally fulfilled its international obligations to 
refugees through special arrangements with UNHCR on humanitarian grounds.  However, 
the Government stated that there is no special legislation relating to refugees in Malaysia 
and the Immigration Act 1959/63 [Act 155] and the Immigration Regulation 1963 are the 
main legislation governing and regulating the entry and stay of foreigners into Malaysia.  
No distinction is made between refugees, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants.  Thus, 
non-citizens who have entered Malaysia in non-compliance with Act 155 are regarded as 
illegal immigrants and are subject to prosecution.   
</p>
<p>54. Furthermore, the Government maintained that the State obligation towards non-
refoulement only arises when the life or freedom of the refugee would be threatened on 
account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or 
political opinion.  The Government also noted that the principle does not apply to a refugee </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>if there are reasonable grounds for regarding him as a danger to the security of the country, 
or in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or acts contrary 
to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.  Thus, the Government took the view 
that its decisions and policy in dealing with illegal immigrants rest, inter alia, on the need to 
protect the threat posed by them on the national interest, national security, public order and 
public health in Malaysia.      
</p>
<p><b> 3. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its comprehensive response.  
The Special Rapporteur still does not fully appreciate the rationale behind the inclusion of 
the term &#8220;coercion&#8221; in the definition of trafficking in persons and is concerned that it may 
create unnecessary confusion.  While section 13 of the ATIP Act does proscribe certain 
means of trafficking in persons in line with the Palermo Protocol, the two-tier definition of 
trafficking in persons may be difficult to apply in practice.  The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government clearly provides for a single, holistic definition of 
trafficking in persons in accordance with the Palermo Protocol.   
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by those initiatives that the Government has 
undertaken to enhance an understanding of relevant government officials of the differences 
between the crime of trafficking and the smuggling of migrants.  In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur invites the Government to provide her with a copy of the Standard Operating 
Procedures and information on the identification and referral procedures available to 
trafficked persons.  Further, the Special Rapporteur invites the Government to provide 
further details of protection and support provided to trafficked persons.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her concern about the lack of protection for 
refugees and asylum seekers, in view of the Government&#8217;s non-ratification of the 1951 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the information that no distinction is 
made between refugees, asylum seekers and irregular migrants.  The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to point out that trafficked persons may qualify as refugees under the 1951 
Convention in certain circumstances and thus should not be expelled or returned to their 
country of origin.  Further, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that States have a non-
derogable obligation under international customary law not to expel or return a person to 
another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in 
danger of being subjected to torture. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government reviews the ATIP Act in 
view of these concerns and remains ready to continue engaging with the Government on 
this matter.    <b>

<p>59. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery, and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, sent a letter of allegation concerning an estimated 70,000 child bonded labourers 
who worked in the so-called &#171; rat mines &#187; of Jaintia Hills, which is located in the North 
Eastern State of Meghalaya, India. 
</p>
<p>60. According to the information received, an estimated 70,000 bonded child labourers 
from Nepal and Bangladesh worked at the so-called &#8220;rat mines&#8221; of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya

</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteurs sought clarifications of the allegations from the

Government regarding the situation of Ms. A.R., an award-winning investigative journalist 
and director of the independent investigative newspaper <i>Ziarul de Garda</i> (<i>The Guard</i> 
newspaper). Ms. A.R. is a member of the board of the International Association for Women 
in Radio and Television (IAWRT), the Moldovan Association of Independent TV 
Journalists and the South East European Media Organisation. Over the past few years, Ms. 
A.R. had been investigating various affairs in the fields of corruption, human trafficking, 
smuggling and human rights abuses in Moldova. 
</p>
<p>67. According to the information received, on 18 September 2010, a prosecuting officer 
of the Chisinau Police contacted Ms. A.R. in order to inform her that a request for 
prosecution against her was submitted. Reportedly, the request had been submitted by an 
individual whose name was revealed by Ms. A.R. in a series of newspaper articles entitled 
&#8220;Jail in the brothel&#8221; as a person accused of trafficking 17 young women.  
</p>
<p>68. On 21 September 2010, Ms. A.R. received a summon informing her that she should 
go to the Criminal Investigation Department for a hearing concerning the complaint filed 
against her. Reportedly, on 24 September 2010, Ms. A.R. and her lawyer went to the 
Criminal Investigation department where Ms. A.R. was interrogated. She was told by 
police that a criminal file against her would be opened. 
</p>
<p>69. It had been reported that over the past few months, Ms. A.R. had been receiving 
threats, including death threats, from people accused of trafficking in human beings. 
Concern was expressed that the threats and actual complaint filed against Ms. A.R. may be 
connected to her legitimate activities as an investigative journalist and human rights 
defender, in particular with her work documenting instances of human trafficking in the 
country.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteurs sought clarifications of the facts and asked whether a 
complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim.  They further requested 
the Government to provide the details, and where available the results, of any investigation 
and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Response of the Government of 3 January 2011  
</b></p>
<p>71. By letter dated 3 January 2011, the Government replied to the communication of 15 
November 2010.  The Government stated that the summon against Ms. A.R. was issued in 
accordance with national law and the police were obliged to examine the complaint.  The 
authorities investigated the claim made against Ms. A.R. and concluded that the facts did 
not establish a ground for further investigation.  Accordingly, the Prosecutor Office of the 
Municipality of Chisinau refused to initiate a criminal investigation against her.  Further, 
the Government indicated that Ms. A.R. did not submit any complaints to the law 
enforcement authorities about the death threats she received.  Nevertheless, the law 
enforcement authorities were investigating the cases in order to arrest and prosecute the 
perpetrators.     
</p>
<p><b> 3. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply provided by the Government.  She is 
pleased to learn that the authorities duly investigated and dismissed the complaint against </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>Ms. A.R.  The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to continue monitoring the 
situation to ensure that the rights and freedoms of journalists and human rights defenders 
working in the field of trafficking are respected and protected, which she considers as one 
of necessary conditions in raising public awareness of trafficking issues and preventing 
trafficking in persons.

<p><b> 1. Carta de alegaci&#243;n de 27 de agosto 2010 
</b></p>
<p>73. El d&#237;a 27 de agosto 2011 la Relatora Especial sobre la trata de personas, 
especialmente las mujeres y los ni&#241;os envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n se&#241;alando a la  atenci&#243;n  
del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con una mujer nigeriana que fue 
deportada a Nigeria, a pesar de informaciones que indicaban que era una potencial v&#237;ctima 
de trata de personas y que hab&#237;a recibido amenazas de muerte por parte de su tratante en 
Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>74. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas la <b>Sra. G.J.,</b> una mujer nigeriana de Benin City, 
fue objeto de trata y trasladada a Espa&#241;a para fines de explotaci&#243;n sexual por un hombre 
llamado Vito. Vito se acerc&#243; a la Sra. G.J. despu&#233;s que sus padres fueron asesinados por 
causa de su fe cristiana, afirmando que &#233;l era amigo de sus padres. Vito ofreci&#243; ayudarla a 
viajar a Europa para trabajar en servicios dom&#233;sticos y para continuar sus estudios. Vito le 
dio dinero para viajar a Espa&#241;a y la Sra. G.J. sali&#243; de Nigeria en octubre de 2006. A su 
llegada, la Sra. G.J. recibi&#243; llamadas telef&#243;nicas de Vito, quien argument&#243; que le deb&#237;a 
veinte mil euros. Vito le dijo que tendr&#237;a que trabajar como prostituta, dado que no pose&#237;a 
documentaci&#243;n legal para trabajar en Espa&#241;a. Vito continu&#243; llam&#225;ndola por lo menos tres 
veces por semana, record&#225;ndola que ten&#237;a una deuda con &#233;l y que el incumplimiento de 
dicha deuda pod&#237;a causarla la muerte. La Sra. G.J. trabaj&#243; como prostituta en almacenes 
situados en Villaverde, Madrid y transfiri&#243; peri&#243;dicamente sumas de dinero a Vito. 
</p>
<p>75. El 12 de junio de 2007, la Sra. G.J. fue detenida por la polic&#237;a y se le emiti&#243; una 
orden de deportaci&#243;n, sin embargo &#233;sta no fue ejecutada en ese momento y la Sra. G.J. 
permaneci&#243; en Espa&#241;a. En febrero de 2010, la Sra. G.J. fue detenida nuevamente por la 
polic&#237;a y su historial revel&#243; la orden de deportaci&#243;n emitida en el 2007. La Sra. G.J. fue 
entonces enviada al Centro de Internamiento de Extranjeros en Madrid. A pesar de que en 
ese momento la Sra. G.J. estaba embarazada y que las autoridades supuestamente estaban 
enteradas de esto, se report&#243; que no recibi&#243; asistencia m&#233;dica ni psicol&#243;gica mientras 
permaneci&#243; detenida. Adem&#225;s, durante su detenci&#243;n, la Sra. G.J. supuestamente tem&#237;a que 
iba a ser asesinada por Vito en caso de ser deportada a Nigeria, ya que s&#243;lo hab&#237;a pagado 
10.000 euros de su deuda a Vito. 
</p>
<p>76. El 25 de febrero de 2010, la Sra. G.J. solicit&#243; asilo argumentando persecuci&#243;n por 
motivos de g&#233;nero, como v&#237;ctima de trata de personas y por persecuci&#243;n religiosa. El 2 de 
marzo de 2010, su solicitud de asilo fue rechazada a pesar de que la solicitud fuera apoyada 
por la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados. Sus 
sucesivos recursos contra esta decisi&#243;n tambi&#233;n fueron rechazados. 
</p>
<p>77. A nombre de la Sra. G.J., el 12 de marzo de 2010, se presentaron solicitudes 
formales ante diversas autoridades espa&#241;olas para que se le concediera un per&#237;odo de 
restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n de conformidad con el art&#237;culo 59 bis numeral 2 de la Ley 
Org&#225;nica 4/2000, misma que prev&#233; que &#8220;los &#243;rganos administrativos competentes para la 
instrucci&#243;n del expediente sancionador, cuando estimen que existen motivos razonables 
para creer que una persona extranjera en situaci&#243;n irregular ha sido v&#237;ctima de trata de seres 
humanos, informar&#225;n a la persona interesada sobre las previsiones del presente art&#237;culo y 
elevar&#225;n a la autoridad competente para su resoluci&#243;n la oportuna propuesta sobre la </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>concesi&#243;n de un per&#237;odo de restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n, de acuerdo con el procedimiento 
previsto reglamentariamente.&#8221; El Art&#237;culo 59 bis numeral 2 especifica, adem&#225;s, que &#8220;dicho 
per&#237;odo de restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n tendr&#225; una duraci&#243;n de, al menos, treinta d&#237;as.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>78. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, las solicitudes fueron hechas a las 
siguientes autoridades gubernamentales, dada la falta de claridad en la ley con respecto a 
quienes est&#225;n facultados para conceder el periodo de restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Gobierno de la Delegaci&#243;n de Madrid, Unidad de Inmigraci&#243;n; 
</p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; Director del Centro de internamiento para los Extranjeros.  
</p>
<p>79. Adicionalmente, se present&#243; una solicitud de suspensi&#243;n de la orden de deportaci&#243;n 
contra la Sra. G.J., con base en dos fundamentos. En primer lugar, se solicit&#243; que se 
concediera un per&#237;odo de restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n a la Sra. G.J., como v&#237;ctima de trata.  
En segundo lugar, se solicit&#243; la suspensi&#243;n de la expulsi&#243;n de la se&#241;ora G.J. en raz&#243;n de su  
embarazo, de conformidad con el art&#237;culo 57 numeral 6 de la Ley Org&#225;nica 4/2000 que 
establece que la expulsi&#243;n no podr&#225; ser ejecutada cuando &#233;sta conculcase el principio de no 
devoluci&#243;n, o afecte a las mujeres embarazadas, cuando la medida pueda suponer un riesgo 
para la gestaci&#243;n o la salud de la madre. 
</p>
<p>80. La oficina del Defensor del Pueblo apoy&#243; ambas solicitudes de conceder  a la Sra. 
G.J. un periodo de restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n y de  suspender la orden de deportaci&#243;n. La 
Fiscal&#237;a de Asuntos de Inmigraci&#243;n tambi&#233;n apoy&#243; la petici&#243;n y busc&#243; a trav&#233;s del 
magistrado investigador la liberaci&#243;n de la Sra. G.J. del centro de detenci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>81. Sin embargo, la Sra. G.J. fue deportada el 17 de marzo de 2010 sin previo aviso a su 
representante legal. S&#243;lo despu&#233;s de que la expulsi&#243;n se llev&#243; a cabo, la Delegaci&#243;n del 
Gobierno de Madrid notific&#243; el 18 de marzo de 2010 a su representante legal, la decisi&#243;n de 
negar la solicitud del per&#237;odo de restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n bajo el argumento de que 
hab&#237;a informaci&#243;n insuficiente para establecer que la Sra. G.J. era una v&#237;ctima de trata. 
</p>
<p>82. La Relatora Especial le pedi&#243; al Gobierno que clarifique los hechos mencionados en 
la carta de alegaci&#243;n y que transmita informaci&#243;n adicional sobre los puntos siguientes: 
informaci&#243;n relativa a las medidas adoptadas para garantizar la seguridad de las alegadas 
victimas en el caso; detalles de las investigaciones judiciales o de otro tipo que se hubiesen 
llevado a cabo en relaci&#243;n con este caso; las razones por las cuales el representante legal de 
la Sra John no fue informado sobre el rechazo de la solicitud oficial a conceder un per&#237;odo 
de restablecimiento y recuperaci&#243;n y reflexi&#243;n, as&#237; como de la orden de deportaci&#243;n de la 
Sra John; igual solicit&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre cual autoridad es responsable y cuales criterios 
se utilizan para la concesi&#243;n del per&#237;odo de restablecimiento y reflexi&#243;n; a  las acciones 
tomadas para prevenir la repetici&#243;n de situaciones similares a la alegada y, de existir, las 
medidas de compensaci&#243;n adoptadas y finalmente solicit&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre actividades 
que se hayan realizadas o planeadas para funcionarios de inmigraci&#243;n para hacer cumplir la 
ley.  </p>

<p><b> 2. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the 
Government and urges the Government to provide information on the questions raised in 
the communication as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Thailand  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 15 February 2011  
</b></p>
<p>84. On 15 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on contemporary forms of slavery and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning the alleged trafficking of 
migrant workers from Myanmar and Cambodia for the purpose of labour exploitation on 
fishing boats.  
</p>
<p>85. According to the information received, Mr. Kyaw Kyaw<b>,</b> a 25 year-old man from Pa 
An in Karen State, Myanmar, came to Mae Sot, Thailand in April 2009 to work in 
agriculture. In September 2009, he met a broker who offered him 8,000 baht (US$266) in 
cash and recruited him for a job which would earn 5,000 baht (US$166) a month. Mr. 
Kyaw Kyaw asked the broker about the nature of the work, but the broker did not answer 
him. Mr. Kyaw Kyaw was then sold to work in a fishing boat, which usually travelled in 
the Rayong sea area. He worked on the fishing boat for 10 months from November 2009 to 
August 2010. The conditions of work on the fishing boat were allegedly very harsh. He was 
required to catch fish every three or four hours all day and thus could not get any adequate 
rest. During these months, he did not receive any salary for his work. When the boat 
reached a harbor every 15 days, Mr. Kyaw Kyaw had to beg for 500 baht (US$16) from the 
manager of the boat so that he could buy food. After working on the boat for 10 months, he 
asked the manager to give him 3,000 baht (US$99) so that he could go to a karaoke bar. 
When the manager reluctantly gave him the money, he managed to run away from the boat.  
</p>
<p>86. In addition to Mr. Kyaw Kyaw&#8217;s case, the Special Rapporteurs received a number of 
cases which pointed to a pattern of trafficking of migrant workers for labour exploitation in 
the fishing industry, particularly in a coastal town of Mahachai in the Samut Sakhon 
province. The migrant workers reportedly entered Thailand for the purpose of employment 
with the help of brokers, only to realize that their job in Thailand was different from what 
they were promised. The migrants were often forced to work on fishing boats under debt-
bondage conditions, as they owed their brokers fees for finding employment in Thailand 
and money for a variety of expenses, such as costs of transportation to Thailand. Deceptive 
and unfair payment practices, including non-payment of wages were a common feature in 
many cases. The migrants were further reported to perform long working hours without rest 
and in a hazardous environment which put their health, safety and life at risk. They were 
also submitted to physical abuse if they complained to their employers. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteurs sought clarifications of the facts and requested information 
on: any investigation, judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in 
relation to Mr. Kyaw Kyaw and other migrants from Myanmar and Cambodia who were 
trafficked to work on fishing boats in Thailand for the purpose of labour exploitation; the 
existence and use of a labour inspection system in properly identifying victims of 
trafficking on fishing boats in Thailand; any cooperation arrangements with the authorities 
in Myanmar and Cambodia to prosecute and punish brokers who facilitate trafficking of 
migrant workers from Myanmar and Cambodia for the purpose of labour exploitation; and 
whether the victims or the families of the victims had access to adequate procedures of 
compensation for damages from those legally responsible for the crime of trafficking and 
other exploitative practices. </p>

<p><b> 2. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided a reply to the 
communication to date and calls upon the Government to provide information on the 
questions raised in the communication as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b> K. United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Response of the Government to the communication of 16 November 2009  
</b></p>
<p>89. On 23 April 2010, the Government responded to the communication of 16 
November 2009 concerning the case of Ms. Fatima Zahra Moussa.  Details of this 
communication are reported in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous communications report 
(A/HRC/14/32/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>90. The Government informed that Ms. Moussa was appointed by the Emirates Center 
for Strategic Studies and Research (&#8220;ECSSR&#8221;) as an editor / media monitor on 9 September 
2005, not on 25 July 2005 as claimed.  The Government stated that the ECSSR found her to 
be somewhat nervous, aggressive and opinionated, and that she complained frequently to 
the administration about her colleagues.  The Government also stated that Ms. Moussa later 
attended a clinic for psychological disorders at the Zayyid Military Hospital, complaining, 
inter alia, of depression, fits of crying, loss of appetite and severe anxiety.   
</p>
<p>91. In response to the allegation that Ms. Moussa was forced to renew her employment 
contract with ECSSR, the Government stated that this is a complete fabrication and 
maintained that Ms. Moussa voluntarily renewed the contract, noting in writing that she 
appreciated the high degree of professionalism demonstrated by the managers in general 
and the ECSSR as a whole.   
</p>
<p>92. In response to the allegation that the ECSSR cancelled Ms. Moussa&#8217;s visa and 
sought to evict her from the ECSSR&#8217;s accommodation after she submitted a letter of 
resignation on 16 January 2007, the Government explained that the ECSSR gave her 15 
days until 31 January 2007 to vacate the apartment. When she refused, the ECSSR made an 
urgent application to the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of First Instance seeking her eviction.  
The Court granted an eviction order on 29 May 2007 and the ECSSR took possession of the 
apartment on 7 August 2007.          
</p>
<p>93. With respect to Ms. Moussa&#8217;s complaint against the Dubai Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry (DCCI), the Government stated that Ms. Moussa was dismissed in accordance 
with clause 6 of the employment contract, which allows DCCI to terminate Ms. Moussa&#8217;s 
employment without reasons at any time during the six-month probation period.  The 
Director of Information and Publishing at DCCI described Ms. Moussa&#8217;s performance as 
very weak and gave her a rating of one out of ten for rapport-building, team-work and 
comprehension skills in her performance appraisal of 27 June 2007.  Ms. Moussa&#8217;s 
employment was terminated on 18 July 2007, when another performance appraisal of 15 
July 2007 indicated that she had made no improvement.  DCCI owed Ms. Moussa an 
outstanding salary in the amount of 2,250.94 dirham and issued a cheque to her in the same 
amount.  However, it had not been possible to contact her after she had been separated from 
DCCI.     
</p>
<p>94. The Government also added that Ms. Moussa filed a legal proceeding against DCCI 
to claim compensation of approximately 160,000 dirhams in respect of her period of 
employment.  However, her case was withdrawn, as Ms. Moussa travelled abroad and her 
lawyer considered that there was no legal basis for her complaint.  The Government 
informed DCCI&#8217;s view that the disputes between Ms. Moussa and DCCI do not concern 
trafficking in persons at all and DCCI deals with its staff in a civil and fair manner.    </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for providing a detailed response.  
The Special Rapporteur regrets, however, that the reply did not provide any information on 
the role of the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking and how the Committee 
dealt with Ms. Moussa&#8217;s case.  The Special Rapporteur recognizes the importance of a 
complaint mechanism at the national level in ensuring that trafficked persons have access to 
remedies.  Thus, she urges the Government to provide information on how the Committee 
addressed Ms. Moussa&#8217;s complaint, regardless of its merit.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Response of the Government to the communication of 9 February 2010  
</b></p>
<p>96. On 3 August 2010, the Government responded to the communication of 9 February 
2010 concerning 988 Pakistani child camel jockeys who were previously trafficked to the 
United Arab Emirates and who had not been provided with compensation to date.  Details 
of this communication are reported in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous communications 
report (A/HRC/14/32/Add.1).   
</p><p>97. The Government&#8217;s response contained extensive information on the compensation 
process. It contained a report by the follow-up committee on compensation for former child 
camel jockeys on action taken by the Government in respect of former camel jockeys. The 
report stated that the United Arab Emirates had taken necessary and appropriate measures 
to repatriate all former child camel jockeys in the United Arab Emirates who are nationals 
of the countries concerned (Pakistan, the Sudan, Mauritania and Bangladesh). All those 
who were entitled to it received compensation, and rehabilitation and social reinsertion 
programmes were established for them in their home countries. Moreover, laws had been 
formulated and actions and measures had been taken to prevent groups such as this from 
taking part in camel races in the United Arab Emirates in the future. In addition, the report 
by the follow-up committee included the following efforts made by the United Arab 
Emirates: 
</p>
<p> (a) The adoption of Federal Act No. 15 of 2005 which prohibits the participation 
of children under 18 years of age in camel races, and accompanying penalties.  
</p>
<p> (b) Measures taken to implement Federal Act No. 15 of 2005: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the establishment of executive monitoring and follow-up mechanisms under a 
special committee;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; the establishment of a field operations unit which stipulates entry permit 
requirements for jockeys in accordance with the relevant Federal Act; undertakes 
surveillance and monitoring of all camel race tracks, in coordination with the 
national camel-racing federation; coordinates with relevant authorities in order to 
check the actual age of each camel jockey, against the information entered on their 
passports; implements an awareness raising campaign to encourage all camel 
owners to use robotic jockeys and to inform them of Federal Act No. 15 of 2005 and 
the penalties prescribed for violations, namely, a term of up to 3 years&#8217; 
imprisonment and a fine of not less than 50,000 UAE dirhams (Dh).  
</p>
<p> (c) Steps taken to implement the agreement with UNICEF and memorandums of 
understanding with the States concerned: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In accordance with the two-phase agreement signed by the United Arab Emirates 
and UNICEF covering the period 2007&#8211;2008 and 2008&#8211;2009, the Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Interior issued a decision establishing a special follow-up 
committee on implementation of the agreement and compensation procedures and 
the establishment of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes for the 
children concerned.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The special committee formed joint committees, two thirds of the members of which 
represented the States concerned. In line with the memorandums of understanding 
signed by the Ministry of Interior of the United Arab Emirates with the 
Governments of these States, these joint committees considered all the claims that 
were submitted to them. The special committee followed up on the implementation 
of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes, in coordination with UNICEF 
and other partners. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The compensation committee also made repeated visits to all the States concerned in 
order to ensure that the process whereby compensation cheques were distributed to 
children there was conducted satisfactorily. The final announcement that the 
compensations process had concluded in Pakistan was made on 22 January 2010. 
The conclusion of the compensation process in the Sudan was announced on 4 April 
2010, at a joint press conference with the Sudanese Ministry of Interior which was 
attended by local and foreign media. 
</p>
<p> (d) Consideration of claims: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Claims were received or rejected following close scrutiny and careful consideration 
by local committees which, as mentioned above, were composed of three members, 
two from the States concerned and one from the United Arab Emirates special 
committee. The subcommittees consulted medical and legal advisers and the 
compensation protocol in order to help them with their work.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Furthermore, the subcommittees were fully empowered to conduct investigations, 
ask questions and assess the compensation amounts in the light of the protocol 
drawn up by an adviser to the special committee. In some cases where fatalities had 
occurred, 30,000 United States dollars ($) was paid in compensation. All those 
children who were entitled to it received compensation once the claims submitted in 
the States concerned had been considered. The subcommittees did not reject any 
claim where the claimant was entitled to compensation. The total compensation 
awarded to the children in the aforesaid States amounted to $11,082,750 and the full 
amount was transferred in coordination with the subcommittees and officials in 
these States. Data on the children who received compensation, the number of claims 
filed and the number that were rejected are set out below.

<p> (e) Efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate children into their societies: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Following the promulgation of Federal Act No. 15 of 2005, the Government brought 
together child camel jockeys from all over the United Arab Emirates, placed them in 
shelters, took care of their affairs and started to return them promptly to their 
countries of origin. This initiative, taken in coordination with UNICEF, cost Dh 10 
million. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government also allocated Dh 30 million to help fund rehabilitation and social 
reintegration programmes for children. This amount was transferred to UNICEF in 
order to implement the programmes that had been established in coordination with 
officials in each State. The main committee visited the four States concerned </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24 
</b></p>
<p>(Pakistan, the Sudan, Mauritania and Bangladesh) and also made continuous visits 
to the representatives of each State in order to ensure that the compensation process 
was conducted according to the protocol and that the children&#8217;s rehabilitation and 
social reintegration programmes continued to be implemented. More than 50 such 
visits were made in 2008, 2009 and 2010, punctuated by support coordination 
programmes with UNICEF and the other authorities concerned. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The United Arab Emirates has implemented with care and attention the agreements 
concluded with UNICEF and the memorandums of understanding concluded with 
the Governments of the States concerned. For that purpose, it established a budget 
of Dh 100 million to cover the costs of returning, repatriating and compensating 
children and establishing rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes for 
them. 
</p>
<p> (f) Publicization of the programme: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The United Arab Emirates provided sufficient funding to cover the subcommittees&#8217; 
administrative costs, equip their offices and meet their other needs. It also provided 
funding for media and medical committees and the costs of advisers and other 
support staff. The subcommittees ran intensive advertising campaigns on television 
and radio and in the press to publicize the programme in all the children&#8217;s home 
countries.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Public announcements on the receipt of claims were run for a sufficient period of 
time (from the signature of memorandums of understanding with the States 
concerned in 2007 to the end of 2008). In some States, claims continued to be 
received until early 2009. The States concerned announced the following deadlines 
for the receipt of claims:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Pakistan, 31 December 2008 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Sudan, 21 December 2008 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bangladesh, 15 February 2009 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mauritania, 10 January 2009 
</p>
<p> (g) Receipt of compensation by children: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The sums determined by the subcommittees in the four States concerned were 
delivered to all the children, and the conclusion of the compensation programme 
was announced once the mechanism had completed its work and the subcommittees 
had issued cheques in the names of the children. In Pakistan, cheques for the 
children were delivered to His Excellency Mr. Rehman Malik, Interior Minister of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, in the presence of the United Arab Emirates 
Ambassador to Islamabad, His Excellency Mr. Ali Saif al-Awani and a 
representative of the Pakistan joint committee. The Pakistani Ministry of Interior 
wrote to inform us of this event, which was covered by the Pakistani press. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Pakistan subcommittee considered all the claims submitted to it and awarded 
compensation to 1,303 Pakistani children. No valid claim for compensation was 
rejected. The main committee reviewed each case file in detail, including the 
decision of the subcommittee. The funds for compensating minors were delivered to 
the authorities concerned, namely, mother and child protection boards, government 
authorities and non-governmental institutions. These authorities deposited the 
money in banks in order to ensure the interest could be spent on the children. This 
arrangement was verified by the special committee when it visited these States. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As mentioned above, funds were transferred through UNICEF to support 
programmes for the rehabilitation and social reintegration of the children. The funds 
amounted to Dh 30 million, of which Pakistan received Dh 7.34 million to establish 
rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes and to improve the children&#8217;s 
living conditions. The States concerned and numerous international organizations 
have commended the United Arab Emirates humanitarian programme.  
</p>
<p>98. The report stated that the United Arab Emirates seeks to act in the interest of the 
children concerned and to provide them with compensation, in keeping with the approach 
and policy pursued nationally. The report refuted the estimate of an international NGO that 
approximately 15,000 children had been trafficked from Pakistan. The precise figures 
which the United Arab Emirates, in partnership with the competent authorities in the States 
concerned produced, based on available data and information, indicated that 4,728 children 
from Pakistan, the Sudan, Mauritania and Bangladesh were trafficked and that there were 
none from any other State.  
</p>
<p>99. With regard to reports that most of the children were sold to human traffickers by 
their impoverished parents and that some were kidnapped and sold to human trafficking 
rings, the report underscored that these allegations are unfounded and have no connection 
with the situation of former child camel jockeys in the United Arab Emirates. Most of the 
children involved in camel racing were present by choice and with the consent of those who 
exercised parental authority over them, who also accompanied them. They worked for 
salaries that were considered generous and were well-treated by their employers &#8211; contrary 
to the allegations claiming that they were kept in farms in poor living conditions, not fed, 
subject to abuse, beatings and electric shocks, and other such far-fetched allegations. Such 
acts, if committed, are punishable by law. Part 7 of the Criminal Code promulgated by 
Federal Act No. 3 of 1987, as amended, concerns all offences against the person, in 
particular offences that endanger human life and limb, infringe liberty and endanger or 
threaten persons. Federal Act No. 51 on the suppression of human trafficking is a special 
law enacted to combat offences such as intimidation, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of 
authority, exploitation of a situation of vulnerability, and other acts involving sexual 
exploitation, bonded labour, slavery or forced labour. Moreover, the law prescribes a 
penalty of life imprisonment, if the victim is a child, a woman or a person with a disability. 
Offenders are brought to the Office of the Prosecutor and before the competent court, as the 
United Arab Emirates respects human rights principles and abides by all the conventions, 
treaties and protocols that it has ratified.<b>

<p><b> 4. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed response provided by the 
Government.  She duly notes the Government&#8217;s statements that the committee responsible 
for reviewing claims for compensation did not reject any valid claims and that the 
compensation was delivered to the authorities concerned, namely, mothers and child 
protection boards, government authorities and non-governmental institutions.  However, 
the Government did not provide a specific response to the allegation that the compensation 
mechanism was closed as of 31 March 2009 without providing compensation to the 988 
claimants concerned in the communication.  The Special Rapporteur invites the 
Government to provide any supplementary information on the questions raised in the 
communication.       
</p>
<p><b> 5. Response of the Government to the communication of 12 March 2010 
</b></p>
<p>101. On 11 June 2010, the Government responded to the communication of 12 March 
2010 concerning the situation of S.M., who is the founder of a nongovernmental 
organization aimed at protecting women subjected to violence including rape, human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26 
</b></p>
<p>trafficking, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and incest, as well as women domestic 
workers who suffered abuse in the United Arab Emirates.  Details of this communication 
are reported in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous communications report 
(A/HRC/14/32/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>102. The Government stated that the allegation that the authorities closed down the 
shelter run by S.M. was untrue and that the shelter went through a difficult period which 
prevented it from continuing its work without assistance of the local authorities.  The 
Government explained that since 2006, the authorities received a variety of reports from 
members of the public against S.M., including that she beat one of the women staying at 
the shelter, she abducted a girl, she was complicit in forging an official document, and she 
had a criminal record and is wanted by Al-Rifaa police station.  Due to these reports, S.M. 
left the United Arab Emirates in 2008, leaving behind a number of outstanding financial 
claims by the owner of the shelter and the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority.  As a 
result, the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children intervened in the situation and 
transferred all the women to its headquarters.   
</p>
<p>103. On 12 July 2010, the Government submitted further information concerning the 
criminal case against S.M.  According to the Government, on 15 May 2008, the General 
Department of State Security received information that S.M. sold a newborn child of a 
Russian woman named I.G. to another woman. The Public Prosecution issued a 
surveillance warrant for S.M.&#8217;s telephones, which revealed connection between S.M. and 
an American national who was suspected of perjury and forgery of official documents in 
her attempt to secure custody and care of the child.  The American national was 
subsequently sentenced to 3 month imprisonment in respect of these charges.  The 
Government stated that S.M. is a fugitive and remains wanted for criminal investigation.   
</p>
<p><b> 6. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response provided by the Government.  It 
would be of interest to the Special Rapporteur to know whether the authorities conducted 
any investigation of the complaints made against S.M. before she left the country and 
whether they were substantiated.  Further, the Special Rapporteur invites the Government 
to provide information on partnerships and cooperation with civil society organizations that 
the Government may have in ensuring the adequate provision of protection and assistance 
to trafficked persons.
