<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b><i>Chair-Rapporteur</i>: El Hadji Malick Sow 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 During 2012, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, under its regular 
procedure, adopted 69 opinions concerning the detention of 198 persons in 37 countries 
(see addendum 1, A/HRC/22/44/Add.1). It also transmitted a total of 104 urgent appeals to 
44 States concerning 606 individuals, including 56 women. States informed the Working 
Group that they had taken measures to remedy the situation of detainees: in some cases, 
detainees were released; in other cases, the Working Group was assured that the detainees 
concerned would be guaranteed a fair trial. The Working Group is grateful to those 
Governments that heeded its appeals and took steps to provide it with the requested 
information on the situation of detainees. The Working Group engaged in continuous 
dialogue with countries that it visited particularly concerning its recommendations. 
Information regarding the implementation of recommendations made by the Working 
Group was received from the Government of Malta. During 2012, the Working Group 
visited El Salvador. The report on this visit is contained in addendum 2 to the present 
document (A/HRC/22/44/Add.2). 
 In accordance with Council resolution 20/16 adopted on 6 July 2012, the Working 
Group initiated preparations concerning the draft basic principles and guidelines on 
remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or 
detention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without 
delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention 
is not lawful. The draft basic principles and guidelines aim at assisting Member States in 
fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. A report comprising the 
basic principles and guidelines will be presented to the Human Rights Council in 2015.

<p> The Working Group adopted, at its sixty-fifth session, its Deliberation No. 9 
concerning the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary 
international law. The Working Group found that the prohibition of all forms of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty forms a part of international customary law and constitutes a pre-
emptory or <i>jus cogens</i> norm. 
 The report concludes that the prohibition of arbitrariness in customary international 
law comprises thorough examination of lawfulness; reasonableness; proportionality and 
necessity of any measure depriving a human being of his or her liberty. It also concludes 
that administrative detention should only be permitted in strictly limited circumstances. 
</p>
<p> In its recommendations the Working Group requests States to enforce the protection 
of every person&#8217;s right to liberty under customary international law; ensure that the 
available guarantees and safeguards are extended to all forms of deprivation of liberty, 
including for example house arrest, re-education through labour, protective custody, 
detention of migrants and asylum seekers, detention for treatment or rehabilitation and 
detention in transit areas; and ensure that persons are not held in pretrial detention for 
periods longer than those prescribed by law as well as ensuring that such persons are 
promptly brought before a judge. All detainees should benefit from all minimum 
procedural guarantees, including the principle of equality of arms; the provision of 
adequate time and facilities for the preparation of the defence; proper access of evidence; 
and guarantees against self-incrimination.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the former 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1991/42 and entrusted with the 
investigation of instances of alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty, according to the 
standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant 
international instruments accepted by the States concerned. The mandate of the Working 
Group was clarified and extended by the Commission in its resolution 1997/50 to cover the 
issue of administrative custody of asylum seekers and immigrants. At its sixth session, the 
Human Rights Council assessed the mandate of the Working Group and adopted resolution 
6/4 which confirmed the scope of its mandate. On 30 September 2010, by its resolution 
15/18, the Human Rights Council extended the Working Group&#8217;s mandate for a further 
three-year period. 
</p>
<p>2. During 2012, the Working Group was composed of Ms. Shaheen Sardar Ali 
(Pakistan), Mr. Mads Andenas (Norway), Mr. Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile), Mr. El Hadji 
Malick Sow (Senegal) and Mr. Vladimir Tochilovsky (Ukraine). 
</p><p>3. El Hadji Malick Sow is the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group and Shaheen 
Sardar Ali its Vice-Chair. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group in 2012 
</b>4.  During the period 1 January to 30 November 2012, the Working Group held its 
sixty-third, sixty-fourth and sixty-fifth sessions. It undertook an official mission to El 
Salvador from 23 January to 1 February 2012 (see addendum 2 for the official country visit 
report). 
5. Pursuant to the Human Rights Council resolution 20/16, the Working Group has 
initiated preparations concerning the draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and 
procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention, to 
bring proceedings before court in order that the court may decide without delay on the 
lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful. 
The draft basic principles and guidelines aim at assisting Member States in fulfilling their 
obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty, in compliance with international human 
rights law. A report comprising of the principles and guidelines will be presented to the 
Human Rights Council in 2015. 
</p>
<p>6. In November 2011, the Working Group launched a database, accessible at 
www.unwgaddatabase.org, which is a freely and publicly available compilation of its 
opinions. The database provides over 600 opinions in English, French and Spanish that 
have been adopted since the establishment of the Working Group in 1991. Throughout 
2012, the Working Group received information that the database was being increasingly 
used by various stakeholders, including States and civil society organizations. The database 
provides a practical research tool for victims, lawyers, academics and others, who would 
like to prepare and submit cases of alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty to the Working 
Group. 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group has been engaged in discussions regarding the possibility of 
transmitting cases to Governments on situations where an individual is at risk of being 
arrested due to an arrest warrant or detention order being issued against him or her, and 
where the resulting deprivation of liberty is likely to be arbitrary in nature. </p>


<p>GE.12-18935 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. At its sixty-fifth session held from 14 to 23 November 2012, the Working Group 
adopted its Deliberation No. 9 on the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty 
in customary international law (the full text of the deliberation is included in the annex to 
the present report). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Handling of communications addressed to the Working Group during 
2012 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communications transmitted to Governments 
</b></p>
<p>9. Hyperlinks to a description of the cases transmitted and the contents of the replies of 
Governments can be found in the respective opinions adopted by the Working Group (see 
A/HRC/22/44/Add.1). 
</p><p>10. During its sixty-third, sixty-fourth and sixty-fifth sessions, the Working Group 
adopted 69 opinions concerning 198 persons in 37 countries. Some details of the opinions 
adopted during these sessions appear in the table below and the hyperlinks to the complete 
texts of opinions Nos. 1/2012 to 69/2012 are contained in addendum 1 to the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Opinions of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>11. Pursuant to its revised methods of work (A/HRC/16/47, annex), the Working Group, 
in addressing its opinions to Governments, drew their attention to resolutions 1997/50 and 
2003/31 of the former Commission on Human Rights and resolutions 6/4 and 15/18 of the 
Human Rights Council, requesting them to take account of the Working Group&#8217;s opinions 
and, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily 
deprived of their liberty and to inform the Working Group of the steps they had taken. On 
the expiry of the two-week deadline, the opinions were transmitted to the source.

<p>13. By note verbale dated 20 November 2012, the Government of Spain submitted

<p>opinion stated that Mr. El Hadj was arrested without a warrant when in fact there was a 
court order for his arrest. Furthermore, Mr. El Hadj enjoyed all the procedural safeguards 
common to the rule of law including the right to legal representation and to appeal. 
</p>
<p>14. According to the Government, the deportation of Mr. El Hadj did not contravene 
Spanish law as its premise was an order issued by the Criminal Court of Cartagena. The 
Government refuted the opinion, saying that there was no discrimination against Mr. El 
Hadj on the basis of national, ethnic or social origin. Mr. El Hadj&#8217;s deportation resulted 
from a prior conviction and the subsequent legal decision to deport him was within the 
ambit of the Spanish law. The Government also stated that the allegations relating to ill-
treatment had been a subject of an enquiry made by the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and that the Government of 
Spain was preparing an official response thereto, a copy of which would be shared with the 
Working Group in due course. 
</p>
<p>15. By note verbale dated 10 December 2012 from the Permanent Mission of the 
Republic of Cuba to the United Nations Office at Geneva, the Government of Cuba rejected 
the Working Group&#8217;s opinion No. 69/2012 (Cuba) on the grounds that it was a biased and 
unbalanced assessment of the case and lacked a proper legal foundation. The Working 
Group&#8217;s decision stems from a fundamental flaw that prevents the analysis from being 
objective, since, having failed to find evidence of violations of due process or of a lack of 
procedural safeguards in the conduct of the trial, the Working Group instead challenges the 
entire Cuban judicial system. According to the Government, the Working Group is 
overstepping its mandate in acting as a body with the authority to determine whether the 
Cuban courts are independent and impartial and in seeking to dictate changes in the 
legislation of a sovereign State. 
</p>
<p>16. Cuba rejects all allegations of violations of articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, since the judicial proceedings provided all the safeguards 
available under Cuban law, in accordance with the principles on the independence of the 
judiciary recognized by the United Nations, to a person who infringed the law in a 
sovereign State and was duly convicted by a competent court. The Government also 
reserves the right to voice serious doubts as to whether the case was the subject of an 
impartial and objective analysis and discussion in view of the fact that the Group did not 
adhere to its standard procedures and time allotments. The unusual haste with which the 
examination of the case was completed and the insufficient assessment of the extensive 
information and evidence provided by the Cuban Government suggest that selective and 
politicized considerations interfered with the Working Group&#8217;s deliberations. This is a far 
cry from the objective and impartial approach that the Group should take to its work. This 
is in addition to the fact that it has overstepped its mandate as established in resolution 
1997/50 of the Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>17. By note verbale dated 13 December 2012, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of 
Cuba to the United Nations Office at Geneva rejected opinion No. 23/2012 (Cuba), adopted 
by the Working Group on 28 August 2012. It states that the Working Group clearly did not 
take due account of the information provided by the Government. It further states that 
Yusmani Rafael &#193;lvarez Esmori and Yasm&#237;n Conyedo River&#243;n were not arrested for 
exercising their fundamental right to freedom of opinion and expression, but for breaking 
into a home, physically assaulting its occupants and injuring one of them. Both citizens had 
the benefit of full procedural safeguards while in prison. The Government regrets that 
selective and politicized considerations interfered with the examination of this case and 
expects the Working Group to fulfil its mandate in an objective and impartial manner. </p>

(United Arab Emirates). 
19. The Working Group expresses its gratitude to those Governments that undertook 
positive actions and released detainees that were subjects of its opinions. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Requests for review of opinions adopted 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Working Group considered the Government requests for review of the 
following opinions: No. 54/2011 (Angola); Nos. 15/2011 and 16/2011 (China); No. 
12/2012 (Egypt) and No. 46/2011 (Viet Nam). 
</p><p>21. After carefully and closely examining the requests for review, the Working Group 
decided to maintain its opinions, in accordance with paragraph 21 of its methods of work 
(A/HRC/16/47, annex, and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Reprisal against a subject of an opinion of the Working Group 
</b>22. The Working Group expresses its concern regarding the continued detention of 
Mar&#236;a Lourdes Afiuni Mora, subject of its opinion No. 20/2010 (Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela), who was arrested in 2009 for ordering the conditional release of Eligio 
Ceden&#245;, also the subject of the Working Group&#8217;s opinion No. 10/2009 (Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela). The Working Group considers the action against Judge Afiuni as reprisal. It 
calls on the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to immediately release 
Ms. Afiuni and to provide her with effective reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Communications giving rise to urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the period 18 November 2011&#8211;17 November 2012, the Working Group sent 
104 urgent appeals to 44 countries concerning 606 individuals (including 56 women). 
Urgent appeals were sent to the following countries: 
</p>
<p> Algeria (2 urgent appeals); Azerbaijan (1); Bahrain (4); Barbados (1); Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of) (1); Cambodia (2); Central African Republic (1); China (6); 
Colombia (1); Cyprus (1); Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (1); Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (1); Egypt (3); Equatorial Guinea (1); Eritrea (1); Ethiopia

Zimbabwe (2). 
</p>
<p>The full text of the urgent appeals can be consulted in the joint reports on communications.2 
</p><p>24. In conformity with paragraphs 22&#8211;24 of its revised methods of work (A/HRC/16/47, 
annex, and Corr.1), the Working Group, without prejudging whether a detention was 
arbitrary, drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as 
reported, and appealed to them to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained 
persons&#8217; right to life and to physical integrity were respected. 
</p>
<p>25. When the appeal made reference to the critical state of health of certain persons or to 
particular circumstances, such as failure to execute a court order for release, the Working 
Group requested the Government concerned to take all necessary measures to have the 
person concerned released. In accordance with Council resolution 5/2, the Working Group 
integrated into its methods of work the prescriptions of the Code of Conduct for Special 
Procedures Mandate-Holders of the Human Rights Council relating to urgent appeals and 
has since applied them. 
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group wishes to thank those Governments that heeded its appeals and 
took steps to provide it with information on the situation of the persons concerned, 
especially the Governments that released those persons. In other cases, the Working Group 
was assured that the detainees concerned would receive fair trial guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Requests for visits 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Working Group has been invited to visit on official mission Argentina (a 
follow-up visit), Azerbaijan, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Greece, India, Japan, Libya, Spain and 
the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group has also asked to visit Algeria, Bahrain (a follow-up visit), 
Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Nauru, New Zealand, Nicaragua (a follow-
up visit limited to Bluefields), Papua New Guinea, Philippines, the Russian Federation, 
Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Follow-up to country visits of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>29. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group decided in 1998 to 
address a follow-up letter to the Governments of countries it had visited, requesting 
information on such initiatives as the authorities might have taken to give effect to the 
relevant recommendations adopted by the Working Group contained in the reports on its 
country visits (E/CN.4/1999/63, para. 36). 
</p><p>30. During 2012, the Working Group requested information from Armenia and 
Malaysia. It had previously also requested information from Italy, Malta and Senegal. It 
received information from the Government of Malta.

<p><i>  Malta 
</i></p>
<p>31. The Government of Malta informed the Working Group of the measures taken in 
compliance with the recommendations issued in the Working Group&#8217;s report on its official 
mission to Malta in January 2009 (A/HRC/13/30/Add.2). 
</p><p>32. The Government of Malta referred to the recommendation concerning the 
strengthening of the status, powers and functions of the Ombudsman in accordance with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (Paris Principles). The mandate of the Parliamentary Ombudsman as laid 
down in the Ombudsman Act (Laws of Malta, chap. 385) has been strengthened by various 
initiatives. An important legal development was the introduction of article 64 (a) in the 
Constitution which provides the Ombudsman the function of investigating actions taken by 
or on behalf of the Government or by such other authority, body or person as may be 
provided by law, in the exercise of administrative functions. Previously, the Ombudsman 
did not have this function. The new provision of the Constitution can only be amended or 
revoked by a resolution approved by a vote of two thirds of the members of the House of 
Representatives. The amendment ensures the Ombudsman the independent authority to 
scrutinize administrative actions by the Government. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government of Malta has been exploring the possibility of widening the 
mandate of the Ombudsman to allow it to function also as the country&#8217;s national human 
rights institution, rather than set up a new administrative structure, which may not be 
feasible due to financial and cost restraints. The Ombudsman has submitted a formal 
proposal to Government to implement this measure. 
</p>
<p>34. The House of Representatives approved a bill further amending the Ombudsman 
Act, empowering the Ombudsman to provide administrative and investigative services to 
specialized commissioners entrusted with the investigation of complaints in specific areas 
of public administration. The Commissioners appointed are to assist with improving good 
governance and provide citizens with an added mechanism to assist with seeking remedies 
against maladministration and malpractice. The Government has committed to providing 
the necessary funding resources for the expansion of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>35. The Government provided information on various cases in which the Ombudsman 
effectively assisted in the protection of various rights, including the rights of rejected 
immigrants to marry and have a family; the right to worship by a group of Muslims; and the 
right of irregular immigrants to receive humanitarian protection and be reunited with their 
families. Two cases regarding discrimination on the ground of age (in relation to access to 
medical care) and employment on the ground of sexual orientation were also handled by the 
Ombudsman.3 
</p>
<p><b> C. Follow-up to the joint study on secret detention 
</b>36. The Working Group has considered how it can it can contribute to the follow-up of 
the joint study on secret detention (A/HRC/13/42) within its mandate and will continue this 
consideration in 2013. The Working Group will also address the follow-up of its own 
previous reports and opinions on detention and antiterrorism measures, taking account of 
subsequent developments including the length of detention of individuals.

<p><b> III. Deliberation No. 9 concerning the definition and scope of 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary 
international law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is the only body in the international 
human rights system entrusted by the former Commission on Human Rights and the 
Human Rights Council with a specific mandate to receive and examine cases of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty. In this capacity, the Working Group has interpreted and enforced the 
international legal rules on deprivation of liberty as they have developed in domestic, 
regional and international jurisdictions since 1991.4 In order to determine the definition and 
scope of arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law, the Working 
Group has reviewed international treaty law and its own jurisprudence and that of 
international and regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>38. The Working Group regards cases of deprivation of liberty as arbitrary under 
customary international law in cases where: 
</p>
<p> (a) When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the 
deprivation of liberty; 
</p>
<p> (b) The deprivation of liberty results from the exercise of the rights or freedoms 
guaranteed by articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; 
</p>
<p> (c) The total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating to the 
right to a fair trial established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the 
relevant international instruments is of such gravity as to give the deprivation of liberty an 
arbitrary character; 
</p>
<p> (d) Asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees are subjected to prolonged 
administrative custody without the possibility of administrative or judicial review of 
remedy; 
</p>
<p> (e) The deprivation of liberty constitutes a violation of the international law for 
reasons of discrimination based on birth; national, ethnic or social origin; language; 
religion; economic condition; political or other opinion; gender; sexual orientation; 
disability or other status, and which aims towards or can result in ignoring the equality of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>39. On 31 October 2011, the Working Group consulted States and civil society and sent 
a note verbale inviting all to reply to two questions concerning the prohibition of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty in national legislation.5

 These questions were: (1) is the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty expressly contained in 
</p>
<p>your country&#8217;s legislation? If so, please refer to the specific legislation; and (2) what elements are 
taken into account by national judges to qualify the deprivation of liberty as arbitrary? If possible, 
please provide concrete examples of the judgments. </p>

<p>40. The Working Group received written submissions from Afghanistan, Australia, 
Azerbaijan, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Japan, 
Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Oman, 
Paraguay, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Suriname, Switzerland and Turkey. 
The Working Group also received written submissions from the International Commission 
of Jurists and the Spanish Society for International Human Rights Law. It further notes with 
appreciation the constructive engagement and cooperation of Governments and civil society 
attending the Working Group&#8217;s public consultation of 22 November 2011. 
</p>
<p>41. Based on the findings of the review of its own jurisprudence, international and 
regional mechanisms, consultations and the submissions to the note verbale, the Working 
Group adopts the following deliberation on the definition and scope of arbitrary deprivation 
of liberty under customary international law. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty in international law 
</b></p>
<p>42. The prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty is recognized in all major 
international and regional instruments for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
These include articles 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 6 of the African Charter of Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights (African Charter), article 7, paragraph 1, of the American Convention on 
Human Rights (American Convention), article 14 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights 
(Arab Charter), and article 5, paragraph 1, of the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>43. Currently, 167 States have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, and the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty is widely enshrined in national 
constitutions and legislation and follows closely the international norms and standards on 
the subject.6 This widespread ratification of international treaty law on arbitrary deprivation 
of liberty, as well as the widespread translation of the prohibition into national laws, 
constitute a near universal State practice evidencing the customary nature of the arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty prohibition. Moreover, many United Nations resolutions confirm the 
<i>opinio iuris</i> supporting the customary nature of these rules: first, resolutions speaking of the 
arbitrary detention prohibition with regard to a specific State that at the time was not bound 
by any treaty prohibition of arbitrary detention;7 second, resolutions of a very general 
nature on the rules relating to arbitrary detention for all States, without distinction

</p>
<p>according to treaty obligations.8 Such resolutions demonstrate the consensus that the 
prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty is of a universally binding nature under 
customary international law. 
</p>
<p>44. The International Court of Justice in its judgment in the case concerning United 
States diplomatic and consular staff in Tehran emphasized that &#8220;wrongfully to deprive 
human beings of their freedom and to subject them to physical constraint in conditions of 
hardship is in itself manifestly incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations, as well as with the fundamental principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights&#8221;.9 
</p>
<p>45. The prohibition of &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; arrest and detention has been recognized both in times 
of peace and armed conflict.10 International law recognizes detention or other severe 
deprivation of physical liberty as a crime against humanity, where it is committed as part of 
a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population.11 
</p>
<p>46. Detailed prohibitions of arbitrary arrest and detention are also contained in the 
domestic legislation of States not party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, including China (art. 37 of the Constitution), Qatar (art. 40 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure), Saudi Arabia (art. 36 of the Saudi Basic Law of Governance and art. 35 of the 
Saudi Law of Criminal Procedure (Royal Decree No. M/39)), the United Arab Emirates 
(art. 26 of the Constitution) and others. This practice of non-States parties to the major 
human treaties is further evidence of the customary nature of the prohibition of the arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>47. The prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty and the right of anyone deprived 
of his or her liberty to bring proceedings before a court in order to challenge the legality of 
the detention, known in some jurisdictions as habeas corpus, are non-derogable under both 
treaty law and customary international law. Regarding the former, this is explicitly 
recognized by the Arab Charter, which lists the right to not be arbitrarily deprived of one&#8217;s 
liberty as non-derogable (art. 14, para. 2). Similarly, the American Convention prohibits 
derogation from &#8220;the judicial guarantees essential for the protection of [non-derogable] 
rights&#8221; (art. 27, para. 2). Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter and the European 
Convention, derogation from the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty is excluded. 
This follows from the condition common to all derogation provisions in human rights 
treaties that any measure taken pursuant to derogation be necessary for the protection of the 
particular interest under threat.12 
</p>
<p>48.  Arbitrary deprivation of liberty can never be a necessary or proportionate measure, 
given that the considerations that a State may invoke pursuant to derogation are already

<p>factored into the arbitrariness standard itself. Thus, a State can never claim that illegal, 
unjust, or unpredictable deprivation of liberty is necessary for the protection of a vital 
interest or proportionate to that end. This view is consistent with the conclusion of the 
Human Rights Committee that the Covenant rights to not be arbitrarily deprived of one&#8217;s 
liberty and the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to bring proceedings before a 
court in order to challenge the legality of the detention are non-derogable.13 
</p>
<p>49.  With regard to the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to bring 
proceedings before a court in order to challenge the legality of the detention, all regional 
treaties mentioned declare that right non-derogable.14 In addition, both the prohibition of 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty and the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to bring 
proceedings before a court in order to challenge the legality of the detention, are adopted in 
the domestic legislation of Member States of the United Nations, so that detaining someone 
without the required legal justification is against accepted norms of State practice.15 The 
International Court of Justice in its 2010 <i>Diallo</i> judgment stated that article 9, paragraphs 1 
and 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 6 of the 
African Charter (Prohibition of Arbitrary Detention) are applicable in principle to any form 
of detention, &#8220;whatever its legal basis and the objective being pursued&#8221;.16 
50. Furthermore, derogation from customary international law&#8217;s prohibition of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty is not possible. The equivalent to the right to derogate under 
customary international law is to be found in the secondary rules on State responsibility, in 
particular in the plea of necessity as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness for an act 
inconsistent with an international obligation.17 The International Law Commission&#8217;s articles 
on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts confirm that this may only be 
invoked where, inter alia, it &#8220;is the only way for a State to safeguard an essential interest 
against a grave and imminent peril&#8221; (art. 25, para. 1 (a)). As with the right to derogate 
codified in the human rights treaties, an essential condition for the valid invocation of the 
customary international law plea of necessity is that non-compliance with the international 
obligation at issue actually be necessary for this purpose and proportionate to that end.18 As 
noted above, this can never be possible with arbitrary deprivations of liberty.

<p>51. Consequently, the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty is part of treaty law, 
customary international law and constitutes a <i>jus cogens</i> norm. Its specific content, as laid 
out in this deliberation, remains fully applicable in all situations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Qualification of particular situations as deprivation of liberty 
</b>52. In 1964, a committee established by the former Commission on Human Rights 
studied the right of everyone to be free from arbitrary arrest, detention and exile. To date, 
this study remains the one and only detailed multilateral study on the issue. According to 
this study, detention is: 
</p>
<p>the act of confining a person to a certain place, whether or not in continuation of 
arrest, and under restraints which prevent him from living with his family or 
carrying out his normal occupational or social activities.19 
</p>
<p>53. The study defined arrest as: 
</p>
<p>the act of taking a person into custody under the authority of the law or by 
compulsion of another kind and includes the period from the moment he is placed 
under restraint up to the time he is brought before an authority competent to order 
his continued custody or to release him.20 
</p>
<p>54. When the Working Group was established, the term &#8220;detention&#8221; was not 
expressively defined. It was only with the adoption of resolution 1997/50 of the former 
Commission on Human Rights that the differing interpretations of the term were 
provisionally resolved. The resolution provides for the renewal of the mandate of the 
Working Group: 
</p>
<p>entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed 
arbitrarily, provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic 
courts in conformity with domestic law, with the relevant international standards set 
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant 
international instruments accepted by the States concerned. 
</p>
<p>55. The Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 8 (1982) on the right to 
liberty and security of persons concluded that article 9, paragraph 1, of the Covenant is 
applicable to &#8220;all deprivations of liberty&#8221; including cases concerning immigration control.21 
Any confinement or retention of an individual accompanied by restriction on his or her 
freedom movement, even if of relatively short duration, may amount to de facto deprivation 
of liberty. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group has consistently followed the position that &#8220;what mattered to 
the [former Commission on Human Rights] in the expression &#8216;arbitrary detention&#8217; was 
essentially the word &#8216;arbitrary&#8217;, i.e., the elimination, in all its forms, of arbitrariness, 
whatever might be the phase of deprivation of liberty concerned&#8221;.22 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>necessity is inherent in the plea: any conduct going beyond what is strictly necessary for the purpose 
will not be covered&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>57. The Working Group regards as detention all forms of deprivation of liberty and 
would like to re-emphasize its former statement: 
</p>
<p>if the term &#8220;detention&#8221; were to apply to pretrial detention alone, then it would follow 
that the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights] does not condemn arbitrary 
imprisonment pursuant to a trial of whatever nature. Such an interpretation is per se 
unacceptable. In fact the Declaration, in article 10, stipulates the entitlement in full 
equality of a fair and public hearing to everyone by an independent and impartial 
tribunal. This further confirms that the expression &#8220;detention&#8221; in article 9 refers to 
all situations, either pre-trial or post-trial.23 
</p>
<p>58. This broad interpretation is confirmed by current State practice.24 
</p>
<p>59. Placing individuals in temporary custody in stations, ports and airports or any other 
facilities where they remain under constant surveillance may not only amount to restrictions 
to personal freedom of movement, but also constitute a de facto deprivation of liberty.25 
The Working Group has confirmed this in its previous deliberations on house arrest, 
rehabilitation through labour, retention in non-recognized centres for migrants or asylum 
seekers, psychiatric facilities and so-called international or transit zones in ports or 
international airports, gathering centres or hospitals.26 
</p>
<p>60. In this regard secret and/or incommunicado detention constitutes the most heinous 
violation of the norm protecting the right to liberty of human being under customary 
international law. The arbitrariness is inherent in these forms of deprivation of liberty as the 
individual is left outside the cloak of any legal protection.27 
</p>
<p><b> D. The notion of &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; and its constituent elements under customary 
international law 
</b></p>
<p>61. The notion of &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; <i>stricto sensu</i> includes both the requirement that a particular 
form of deprivation of liberty is taken in accordance with the applicable law and procedure 
and that it is proportional to the aim sought, reasonable and necessary.28 The drafting 
history of article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &#8220;confirms 
that &#8216;arbitrariness&#8217; is not to be equated with &#8216;against the law&#8217;, but must be interpreted more

</p>
<p>broadly to include elements of inappropriateness, injustice, lack of predictability and due 
process of law&#8221;.29 
</p>
<p>62. The Human Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;in order to avoid a characterization of 
arbitrariness, detention should not continue beyond the period for which the State party can 
provide appropriate justification&#8221;.30 The legal basis justifying the detention must be 
accessible, understandable, non-retroactive and applied in a consistent and predictable way 
to everyone equally. Moreover, according to the Human Rights Committee, an essential 
safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention is the &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; of the suspicion on 
which an arrest must be based. According to the European Court of Human Rights, &#8220;having 
a &#8216;reasonable suspicion&#8217; presupposes the existence of facts or information which would 
satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. 
What may be regarded as &#8216;reasonable&#8217; will however depend upon all the circumstances&#8221;.31 
</p>
<p>63. The notion of &#8220;arbitrary detention&#8221; <i>lato sensu</i> can arise from the law itself or from 
the particular conduct of Government officials. A detention, even if it is authorized by law, 
may still be considered arbitrary if it is premised upon an arbitrary piece of legislation or is 
inherently unjust, relying for instance on discriminatory grounds.32 An overly broad statute 
authorizing automatic and indefinite detention without any standards or review is by 
implication arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>64. Legislation allowing military recruitment by means of arrest and detention by the 
armed forces or repeated imprisonment of conscientious objectors to military service may 
be deemed arbitrary if no guarantee of judicial oversight is available. The Working Group 
has on occasion found the detention of conscientious objectors in violation of, inter alia, 
article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 18 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.33 
</p>
<p>65. Legal provisions incompatible with fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed 
under international human rights law would also give rise to qualification of detention as 
arbitrary.34 In this regard, national courts have drawn upon notions of arbitrariness as 
applied by the Human Rights Committee.35 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group observes that the notion of promptness as set out in article 9, 
paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one key element 
that might render detention arbitrary. The Human Rights Committee has consistently found 
violations of article 9, paragraph 3, of the Covenant in cases of delays of a &#8220;few days&#8221;

<p>before the person is brought before a judge.36 At the same time, the European Court of 
Human Rights has explained that the &#8220;scope for flexibility in interpreting and applying the 
notion of &#8216;promptness&#8217; is very limited&#8221;.37 The court has also highlighted that &#8220;justification 
for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the 
authorities&#8221;.38 
</p>
<p>67. Any extension of the period of deprivation of liberty detention must be based on 
adequate reasons setting out a detailed justification, which must not be abstract or general 
in character. 
</p>
<p>68. The increased reliance on administrative detention is particularly worrying. Types of 
administrative detention considered by the Working Group include preventive detention, 
detention in emergency or exceptional situations, detention on counter-terrorism grounds, 
immigration detention, and administrative penal law detention. Article 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one of the central provisions regarding the 
freedom of those detained under an administrative order.39 Administrative detention may 
also be subject to the customary norm codified in article 14 of the Covenant, e.g. in cases 
where sanctions, because of their purpose, character or severity, must be regarded as penal 
even if, under domestic law, the detention is qualified as administrative. 
</p>
<p>69. Since its establishment, the Working Group has been seized of an overwhelming 
number of administrative detention cases. Already in 1992, the Working Group held that 
the detention of the individual under emergency laws was arbitrary and contrary to the 
provision on the right to seek a remedy and a fair trial. In subsequent years, the Working 
Group has consistently found violations of the various provisions contained in articles 9 and 
14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in cases of administrative 
detention. 
</p>
<p>70. In the majority of the cases of administrative detention with which the Working 
Group has dealt, the underlying national legislation does not provide for criminal charges or 
trial. Consequently, the administrative rather than judicial basis for this type of deprivation 
of liberty poses particular risks that such detention will be unjust, unreasonable, 
unnecessary or disproportionate with no possibility of judicial review. 
</p><p>71. Although it is acknowledged that counter-terrorism measures might require &#8220;the 
adoption of specific measures limiting certain guarantees, including those relating to 
detention and the right to a fair trial&#8221; in a very limited manner, the Working Group has 
repeatedly stressed that &#8220;in all circumstances deprivation of liberty must remain consistent 
with the norms of international law.&#8221;40 In this respect, the right of anyone deprived of his or 
her liberty to bring proceedings before a court in order to challenge the legality of the

</p>
<p>detention is a personal right, which must &#8220;in all circumstances be guaranteed by the 
jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.&#8221;41 
</p><p>72. Counter-terrorism legislation that permits administrative detention often allows 
secret evidence as the basis for indefinite detention. As this would be inconsistent with the 
prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, no person should be deprived of liberty or 
kept in detention on the sole basis of evidence to which the detainee does not have the 
ability to respond, including in cases of immigration, terrorism-related and other sub-
categories of administrative detention. The Working Group has held that, even if lawyers of 
the detainee have access to such evidence but are not allowed to share or discuss it with 
their client, this does not sufficiently protect the detainee&#8217;s right to liberty.42 
</p>
<p>73. The Working Group also reiterates that &#8220;the use of &#8216;administrative detention&#8217; under 
public security legislation [or] migration laws &#8230; resulting in a deprivation of liberty for 
unlimited time or for very long periods without effective judicial oversight, as a means to 
detain persons suspected of involvement in terrorism or other crimes, is not compatible 
with international human rights law&#8221;.43 The practice of administrative detention is 
particularly worrying as it increases the likelihood of solitary confinement, acts of torture 
and other forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>74. Even though administrative detention per se is not tantamount to arbitrary detention, 
its application in practice is overly broad and its compliance with the minimum guarantees 
of due process is in the majority of cases inadequate. 
75. In conclusion and in the light of the foregoing, the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention finds that all forms of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, including the five 
categories of arbitrary deprivation of liberty as referred to above in paragraph 38, are 
prohibited under customary international law. The Working Group also concludes that 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty constitutes a peremptory or <i>jus cogens</i> norm.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b>76. <b>The Working Group, in the fulfilment of its mandate, welcomes the cooperation 
it has received from States with regard to the responses by the Governments 
concerned concerning cases brought to their attention under its regular procedure. 
During 2012, the Working Group adopted 69 opinions concerning 198 persons in 37 
countries. It also sent 104 urgent appeals to 44 countries concerning 606 persons 
(including 56 women).</b> 
77. <b>The Working Group welcomes the invitations extended to it to pay visits to 
countries on official mission. The Working Group conducted an official visit in 2012 to 
El Salvador. Among all the requested country visits, the Working Group has received 
invitations from the Governments of Argentina (for a follow-up visit), Azerbaijan, 
Brazil, Burkina Faso, Greece, India, Japan, Libya, Spain and the United States of 
America. It has also requested to be invited to other 20 countries. The Working Group 
reiterates its belief that its country visits are essential in fulfilling its mandate. For 
Governments, these visits provide an excellent opportunity to show developments and 
progress in detainees&#8217; rights and the respect for human rights, including the crucial 
right not to be arbitrarily deprived of liberty.</b>

forms of arbitrary deprivation of liberty constitutes part of customary international 
law and constitutes a peremptory norm or <i>jus cogens</i>. A significant number of States 
have adopted and implemented in their domestic legislation strict prohibitions of 
arbitrary detention and have sought to do so following closely the terms of article 9 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>The prohibition of arbitrariness comprises thorough examination of lawfulness, 
reasonableness, proportionality and necessity of any measure depriving a human 
being of her or his liberty. The prohibition of arbitrariness can arise at any stage of 
legal proceedings.</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Administrative detention should only be permitted in strictly limited 
circumstances. It should be short in nature; be in line with international and domestic 
legislation and not be used to extend the pretrial detention of the suspects.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Working Group recommends that States:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Enforce and protect the right to liberty of every human being under 
customary international law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that the guarantees available against arbitrary arrest and 
detention are extended to all forms of deprivation of liberty, including house arrest; 
re-education through labour; prolonged periods of curfew; detention of migrants and 
asylum seekers; protective custody; detention for rehabilitation or treatment; 
detention in transit areas; border control checkpoints, etc.; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that persons are not held in pretrial detention for periods longer 
than those prescribed by law, with the requirement of prompt production before a 
judge. 
</b>83. <b>All measures of detention should be justified; adequate; necessary and 
proportional to the aim sought.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>All persons subjected to a measure of detention should benefit at all stages of 
access to a lawyer of her or his choice as well as to effective legal assistance and 
representation. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>All detainees should benefit from all minimum procedural guarantees, 
including the principle of equality of arms; the provision of adequate time and 
facilities for the preparation of the defence; proper access to evidence and guarantees 
against self-incrimination.</b>
