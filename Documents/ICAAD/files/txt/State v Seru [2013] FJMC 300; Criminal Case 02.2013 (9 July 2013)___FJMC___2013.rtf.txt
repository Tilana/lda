Law

I reproduce Section 369 of the Crimes Degree No.44 of 2009.It says;

(1) A person commits a summary offence if he or she wilfully and unlawfully destroys or damages any property.

Maximum Penalty for damaging property is Imprisonment for 2 years, if no other punishment is provided under any other provision of this section.

There is no set of tariff for the offense of Damaging Property (Gounder J in Tikomainiusiladi v State [2008] FJHC 18; HAA 134.2007 (15 February 2008). But in Navitalai v The State, Criminal Appeal No HAA0084 & 85 of 2002 S, a sentence of 2 years imprisonment for the damage of a door valued at $250.00 was reduced to 6 months imprisonment on appeal.

5.      
Mitigating Factors and Personal Background

I consider following Mitigating factors which were brought before me in mitigation. That you are;

38 years, married with 4 children, all of them are schooling, self-employed welder and earns $140 per week; Sole-bread winner and wish to restitution.
 
6.      
Aggravating Factors 

According to the information revealed by the Summary of Facts 1 x Front passenger door window valued at $150.00, and 1 x Car dashboard valued at $2,350.00 which is a sustainable amount. You were drunk when the offence took place. This aggravates the situation. Other than that there are no any special aggravating factors as the charge constitutes counts of elements of offence.

7.      
Sentence

In the light of general principle of sentencing under Section 15 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and objective of sentencing under section 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, I now consider appropriate sentence on you.

I acknowledge your early guilty plea; you are a first offender and also consider Mitigating Factors in this case and noted you are remorseful.

I order you to pay a fine $100.00 (01 penalty unit) to be paid into Court in default 10 days for the offence of Damaging Property Contrary to section 369(1) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009.
I note that the learned Prosecutor has sought a compensation of $2500.00 submitting a quotation dated 31-12-12. I have carefully analysed the charge and summary of facts. The offence had committed on16th day of December, 2012 and noted that there is no indication as to a particular vehicle Registration No. Therefore it is not just in the circumstances' to order the unrepresented accused person to pay the total amount. At the same token I note that the accused is willing to compensate for the damage. Therefore, I order accused to pay $1000.00 to the registry as compensation to the complainant by instatements of $200.00 per month. 28 days to pay the fine and first instalment.
28 days to appeal.
