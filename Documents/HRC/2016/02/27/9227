<b>Views on conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>1. Brazil expressed its gratitude to the Human Rights Council and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It stated that it was a great opportunity to be able to 
present the human rights situation in its country and the efforts undertaken by the Government to 
promote, protect and guarantee those rights in an environment of constructive and frank dialogue. 
</p>
<p>2. Brazil stressed that it was a great honour to be engaged in the whole process leading to the 
adoption of the first final reports of the Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review: the 
institution-building process, the preparation of the national report, its presentation and the outcome 
process. 
</p>
<p>3. Brazil stated that it was pleased to see the successful conclusion of the beginning of the first 
universal periodic review cycle. It was convinced that the implementation of the universal periodic 
review mechanism was deeply connected to the successful outcome of human rights system reform, 
which was aimed at leaving politicization and selectivity behind. 
</p>
<p>4. Brazil believed strongly that the universal periodic review mechanism constituted an 
innovative framework to deal with human rights defence in a multilateral system. It could serve as a 
good example to be repeated in other United Nations bodies. As the beginning of the first universal 
periodic review cycle was concluding, it was becoming clear that non-selectivity and transparency 
were the most efficient ways to promote true dialogue and to achieve real cooperation among 
countries. 
</p>
<p>5. The Brazilian delegation, which came to Geneva for the presentation of its national report and 
interactive dialogue, was broad and representative. Brazil stated that most of its members had 
previous experience in civil society activities. The delegation was headed by the Under-Secretary of 
the Special Secretariat for Human Rights, and comprised high-level authorities from the Special 
Secretariat of Policies for Women, the Special Secretariat of Promotion of Racial Equality, the 
Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of External Relation and the 
National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform. 
</p>
<p>6. During the interactive dialogue, 47 States from all five regional groups commented on the 
national report, asked questions and made recommendations. Brazil stressed that such active 
participation of all States in the universal periodic review process vindicated its acknowledgement 
that, despite all differences, human rights were a common concern for all. Brazil regarded the 
review exercise as a valuable opportunity for international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>7. Brazil reiterated its commitment to take serious account of the recommendations made in the 
report of the Working Group, all of them accepted and acknowledged. 
</p>
<p>8. It recognized that, despite all progress achieved since democratization in Brazil, there were 
still many areas in serious need of improvement, and many issues still had to be addressed before 
human rights could be fully realized. Brazil acknowledged that it faced huge challenges concerning, 
inter alia, the reduction of poverty, the improvement of prison conditions, the empowerment of 
women, the protection of human rights defenders, the eradication of racial discrimination, respect 
for indigenous peoples rights, access to justice, the improvement of public security and the 
elimination of torture. </p>

9. Brazil expressed its strong belief, however, that 2008 would be an important year for the 
promotion of human rights; a year of reflection not only on what its challenges were and on which 
public policies needed to be reformulated, but also on what had worked well so far. 
</p>
<p>10. Brazil noted that the eleventh national conference on human rights, to be held in December 
2008, would be a major step towards a comprehensive evaluation of the human rights challenges 
faced by Brazil. The conference would aim at revising the national plan on human rights, which 
established the core guidelines for the elaboration of actions and public policies for the protection 
and promotion of human rights at the domestic level. The plan stemmed from a recommendation 
made at the Vienna World Conference, the final document of which was initially implemented in 
Brazil in 1996. 
</p>
<p>11. In the context of the commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, Brazil reported that the Government, together with civil society entities, was 
organizing important events, not only of national but also of international scope. 
</p>
<p>12. The regional preparatory conference for the Durban Review Conference would be held in 
Brasilia, from 17 to 19 June. The conference would bring together delegations from South and 
Central America, the Caribbean region and representatives of civil society to discuss what the 
region expected from the Durban Review Conference and how it could contribute to the review 
process. 
</p>
<p>13. From 25 to 28 November, the third World Congress against the Sexual Exploitation of 
Children and Adolescents would bring together more than 3,000 people in Rio de Janeiro to explore 
the challenges of implementing an inter-sectoral approach to the global fight against the sexual 
exploitation of children and adolescents. Brazil invited all States and representatives of civil society 
present to come together for the third Congress so that efforts could be combined to combat that 
crime. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the Human Rights Council, Brazil was committed to launching a set of human 
rights voluntary goals by December 2008. Brazil and the co-sponsors of the initiative continued to 
count on the cooperation of all States in the elaboration of these goals in commemoration of the 
sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>15. Furthermore, on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, Brazil expected that a resolution would be consensually adopted at the next session of the 
Council. The draft guidelines on alternative care for children without parental care should be 
adopted by the Council and transmitted to the General Assembly. The guidelines were an important 
complement to the system of child protection established by the Convention. 
</p>
<p>16. Brazil also mentioned the holding of the first National Conference of Gays, Lesbians, 
Bisexuals, Transvestites and Transsexuals and of the third Film Festival on Human Rights and 
Cinema in South America, among many other initiatives. 
</p>
<p>17. Brazil stated that its voluntary commitment to creating a national system of human rights 
indicators and the elaboration of annual reports on the situation of human rights, taking into account 
the follow-up to the universal periodic review, would be fundamental tools for the domestic 
monitoring of human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. Brazil also highlighted that, in the last week of May, a second public hearing, as a follow-up 
to the one held before the conclusion of its national report, had been held by the Commission of 
Human Rights and Minorities of the House of Representatives. On that occasion, civil society </p>

organizations were able to express their opinions regarding the universal periodic review process 
and make comments on the participation of Brazil in international human rights forums. 
</p>
<p>19. Brazil pointed out that its commitments before the Council meant concrete actions in Brazil; 
along the way, the Government was open to a transparent and objective dialogue with civil society, 
because no public policy could be effective without its participation. Non-governmental 
organizations in Brazil had been partners of the Government in the improvement of human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>20. Brazil thanked all countries that had participated in the review of the Brazilian report, and 
expressed its gratitude to the members of the troika and to the States that had recently supported the 
reelection of Brazil to the Council. 
</p>
<p>21. It stated that it had great expectations for the consolidation of the universal periodic review 
mechanism in upcoming sessions and expressed its hope that it could contribute to that task.   
</p>
<p>22. Brazil seized the opportunity to reiterate its voluntary commitments. It stressed that its goal 
was to continue collaborating with the Council, to enhance cooperation with international 
mechanisms for monitoring the protection of human rights, to consider ratifying human rights 
treaties to which Brazil was not a State party, to support the activities of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and to strengthen regional systems for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>23. Brazil also thanked various delegations for their comments made concerning their 
involvement and the commitment of Brazil to the improvement of its human rights policies. 
Concerning the comments made by the representatives of civil society, Brazil noted that its 
statement had been clear about its openness to work along with civil society organizations in the 
ongoing process. It noted that the public policies included in national report of Brazil and the report 
of the Working Group reflected the other steps that Brazil would have to take to address the main 
human rights problems. Brazil also noted that one of its main objectives was to develop a set of 
human rights indicators that would help improve and fine-tune the human rights policies already in 
place. Brazil highlighted that the national programme introduced in the country for the protection of 
human rights defenders had not been reflected in the final report of the Working Group, and that 
that programme was aimed to guarantee, inter alia, the life of defenders and their physical and 
psychological safety, to prevent threats and situation of vulnerability, and to implement active 
polices. It pointed out that, in some federal States, pilot projects were being implemented for the 
protection of human rights defenders, and that this was an indication of how the national process 
could be improved. Brazil also stated that the national policy on the matter had been launched by 
the President in 2007, and that a legal framework had been developed. It reported that one of the 
country&#8217;s priorities had been to establish a national protection system that would rationalize all 
sectoral programmes under way in various areas, such as the protection programmes for victims and 
witnesses, human rights defenders, and children and adolescents.
