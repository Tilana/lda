MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
August 9, 2016 – The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of financial results (“MD&A”)
as provided by the management of Bellatrix Exploration Ltd. (“Bellatrix” or the “Company”) should be
read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the
Company for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
related MD&A. Disclosure which is unchanged from the MD&A for the year ended December 31,
2015 may not be repeated herein. This commentary is based on information available to, and is dated
as of, August 9, 2016. The financial data presented is in Canadian dollars, except where indicated
otherwise.
CONVERSION: The term barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) may be misleading, particularly if used in
isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil
equivalent (6 mcf/bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at
the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio
based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the
energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of
value. All boe conversions in this report are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio of six
thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil.
DRILLING LOCATIONS: This presentation discloses 521 net identified drilling locations. These
identified drilling locations are comprised of 191 booked locations; and 330 unbooked locations.
Booked locations are proved locations and probable locations derived from the Corporation's most
recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by Sproule Associates Limited, Bellatrix's
independent reserves evaluator, as of December 31, 2015 and account for drilling locations that have
associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal
estimates based on Bellatrix's prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that
can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review. Unbooked locations have
been identified by management as an estimation of our multi-year drilling activities based on
evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production, pricing assumptions and
reserves information. There is no certainty that Bellatrix will drill all booked or unbooked drilling
locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas
reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which Bellatrix actually drill wells will
ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and
natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and
other factors. While the majority of Bellatrix's unbooked locations are extensions or infills of the
drilling patterns already recognized by the independent evaluator, other unbooked drilling locations
are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics
of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations
and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves,
resources or production.
NON-GAAP MEASURES: This MD&A contains the term “funds flow from operations” which should
not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than “cash flow from operating activities” as
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as an indicator of
the Company’s performance. Therefore reference to funds flow from operations or funds flow from
operations per share may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other
entities. Management uses funds flow from operations to analyze operating performance and
leverage and considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the
Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay
debt. Funds flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from operating activities, excluding
decommissioning costs incurred and changes in non-cash working capital incurred. The
reconciliation between cash flow from operating activities and funds flow from operations can be
found in this MD&A. Funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the weighted average
number of shares for the period.
1
This MD&A also contains the terms “total net debt”, “long-term debt”, “adjusted working capital
deficiency (excess)”, “operating netbacks”, “adjusted net profit (loss)”, “total revenue” and “total capital
expenditures – net”, which also are not recognized measures under GAAP. Therefore reference to the
non-GAAP measures of total net debt, long-term debt, adjusted working capital deficiency (excess),
operating netbacks, adjusted net profit (loss), total revenue or total capital expenditures – net may not
be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. The Company’s calculation
of total net debt excludes deferred lease inducements, decommissioning liabilities, the long-term
finance lease obligation, and deferred tax liabilities. Total net debt includes the adjusted working
capital deficiency (excess), current bank debt and long-term debt. Long-term debt includes the
balances of bank debt and Senior Notes (as defined below). The adjusted working capital deficiency
(excess) is a non-GAAP measure calculated as net working capital deficiency (excess) excluding
current finance lease obligation, current deferred lease inducements, current portion of risk
management assets and liabilities, and the current portion of bank debt. Management believes these
measures are useful supplementary measures of the total amount of current and long-term debt.
Operating netbacks are calculated by subtracting royalties, transportation, and operating expenses
from total revenue. Management believes this measure is a useful supplemental measure of the
amount of total revenue received after transportation, royalties and operating expenses. The
Company’s calculation of total revenue includes petroleum and natural gas sales and other income,
and excludes commodity price risk management. Adjusted net profit (loss) is calculated by excluding
the after tax effect after adjusting for non-deductible tax items, of non-cash commodity contracts mark-
to-market gains and losses, unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, non-cash impairment
charges and non-cash one time charges, as applicable, impacting net profit (loss). Management
believes that, in addition to net profit (loss), adjusted net profit (loss) is a useful supplemental measure
as it reflects the underlying performance of Bellatrix’s business activities. Readers are cautioned,
however, that this measure should not be construed as an alternative to net profit or loss determined
in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Bellatrix’s method of calculating this
measure may differ from other entities, and accordingly, may not be comparable to measures used by
other companies. Total capital expenditures - net includes the cash impact of capital expenditures
and property dispositions, as well as the non-cash capital impacts of corporate acquisitions,
adjustments to the Company’s decommissioning liabilities, and share based compensation.
JOINT ARRANGEMENTS: Bellatrix is a partner in the Grafton Joint Venture and the CNOR Joint
Venture (all as defined below), which have all been separately assessed and classified under
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as joint operations. This classification is on the
basis that the arrangement is not conducted through a separate legal entity and the partners are
legally obligated to pay their share of costs incurred and take their share of output produced from the
various production areas, and all partners have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities
resulting from the joint operations. The Company considered these factors as well as the terms of the
individual agreements in determining the classification of a joint operation to be appropriate for each
arrangement. For purposes of disclosure throughout the MD&A and financial statements, Bellatrix has
referred to these arrangements by the common oil and gas industry term of joint ventures.
GRAFTON JOINT VENTURE – During 2013 Bellatrix and Grafton Energy Co I Ltd.(“Grafton”)
established a joint venture whereby Grafton agreed to contribute 82%, or $200 million, to participate
in a Notikewin/Falher and Cardium well program in the Willesden Green and Brazeau areas of West-
Central Alberta (the “Grafton Joint Venture”) with a two year funding period (expiring June 26, 2015).
Under the terms of the Grafton Joint Venture agreement, Grafton earns 54% of Bellatrix’s working
interest (“WI”) in each well drilled in the well program until payout (being recovery of Grafton's capital
investment plus an 8% internal rate of return) on the total program, which reverts to  33% of Bellatrix's
pre-Grafton Joint Venture WI after payout.  At any time after payout of the entire program, Grafton has
the option to elect to convert all wells from the 33% WI to a 17.5% Gross Overriding Royalty
(“GORR”). During 2014, Bellatrix announced that Grafton elected to exercise an option to increase
committed capital investment to the Grafton Joint Venture by an additional $50 million on the same
terms and conditions, for a total commitment by Grafton of $250 million. For wells relating to the
exercised option, the funding period of the Grafton Joint Venture was extended to June 26, 2016.
During the second quarter of 2015 the funding period for the initial $200 million commitment was
extended to December 31, 2015 (from June 26, 2015). The funding obligation was satisfied by
Bellatrix and Grafton by that date. In the first quarter of 2016,  the parties agreed to further extend the
funding period for the remaining $50 million commitment under the Grafton Joint Venture to
December 31, 2016 (from June 26, 2016) thereby providing additional operational flexibility for
development drilling activity during the 2016 year. Bellatrix and Grafton expect to fulfill all of the
spending commitments under the Grafton Joint Venture in the 2016 calendar year.
2
CNOR JOINT VENTURE - During the third quarter of 2014, Bellatrix announced that the Company
and Canadian Non-Operated Resources Corp. ("CNOR"), a non-operated oil and gas company
managed by Grafton Asset Management Inc., had completed the formation of a new multi-year joint
venture arrangement (the “CNOR Joint Venture”), pursuant to which CNOR has committed $250
million in capital towards future accelerated development of a portion of Bellatrix's extensive
undeveloped land holdings. Under the terms of the agreement, CNOR will pay 50% of the drilling,
completion, equipping and tie-in capital expenditures associated with development plans to be
proposed by Bellatrix and approved by a management committee comprised of representatives of
Bellatrix and CNOR in order to earn 33% of Bellatrix's working interest before payout (being recovery
of CNOR’s capital investment plus an 8% return on investment) and automatically converting to a
10.67% GORR on Bellatrix's pre-joint venture working interest after payout. On September 1, 2015,
the parties amended the terms of the CNOR Joint Venture to extend the funding period to December
31, 2019, and as a result Bellatrix is now required to propose a joint development plan on or before
October 1, 2016 with the expectation that the funds will be primarily spent between 2017 through
2019.

The reader is further cautioned that the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Estimating reserves is also critical to several accounting
estimates and requires judgments and decisions based upon available geological, geophysical,
engineering and economic data. These estimates may change, having either a negative or positive
effect on net earnings as further information becomes available, and as the economic environment
changes.

Overview and Description of the Business
Bellatrix Exploration Ltd. (“Bellatrix” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded Western Canadian based
growth oriented oil and gas company engaged in the exploration for, and the acquisition,
development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the provinces of Alberta, British
Columbia and Saskatchewan.
Common shares of Bellatrix trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and on the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “BXE”.
Second Quarter 2016 Activities
In the second quarter of 2016, Bellatrix continued to proactively execute on its strategy to reduce debt
and focus on optimization initiatives. As is customary during spring-break up, the Company curtailed
capital activity in the second quarter, and instead focused on a number of optimization initiatives,
including the completion of 65 plunger lift installations and 15 wellbore cleanouts. These optimization
efforts effectively attenuated the Company’s corporate decline rate, resulting in production volumes
being maintained at 38,000 boe/d without drilling a single well in the second quarter of 2016. First half
2016 production averaged 38,234 boe/d, exceeding first half guidance of 38,000 boe/d despite having
underspent forecast capital expenditures in both the first and second quarters of 2016 relative to plan.
Additionally, during the second quarter and subsequent to June 30, 2016, Bellatrix completed four
strategic transactions which collectively have generated total gross proceeds of approximately $267.5
million, increased operated volumes, cash flow and reserves, and enhanced liquidity, all while
preserving the Company’s core asset base and long term value platform. During the second quarter,
these strategic transactions include the monetization of certain production facilities for $75 million (the
“Facilities Monetization”), the acquisition of approximately 2,000 boe/d of complementary Spirit River
producing assets (the “Grafton Acquisition”). Subsequent to quarter end, Bellatrix completed the sale
of a 35% minority working interest in the Bellatrix O'Chiese Nees-Ohpawganu'ck deep-cut gas plant
at Alder Flats (the "Alder Flats Plant") for $112.5 million (the “Alder Flats Plant Sale”), and two
financing transactions which combined have raised $80 million in gross proceeds.
On a pro forma basis, these transactions have helped deliver a reduction in total bank debt
outstanding from $314 million at the end of the second quarter 2016 down to approximately $122
million, representing a reduction of 61% or $192 million at August 9, 2016. As a result of these
strategic steps to reduce debt and re-position the Company, Bellatrix expects to regain a growth
trajectory heading into 2017 through focused investment in the Spirit River liquids-rich natural gas
play, which is one of the lowest supply cost natural gas plays in North America.
ACHIEVED MATERIAL DEBT REDUCTION AND ENHANCED LIQUIDITY THROUGH
STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS
Bellatrix has remained focused on debt reduction and liquidity enhancing initiatives through 2016.
Accomplishments year to date include:
the Facilities Monetization completed on May 3, 2016 which generated cash proceeds of $75 million.
Bellatrix maintains operatorship and preferential access to the facilities for its operated production
·
volumes and retains, at its sole discretion, the option to repurchase the facilities at any time during
the eight year term of the agreement. Net proceeds from the sale were used to repay bank
indebtedness.
the Grafton Acquisition which involved the acquisition of approximately 2,000 boe/d of operated
producing assets from Grafton Energy Co. I Ltd. (“Grafton”) for consideration of $29.2 million satisfied
on a cash-free basis through the issuance of common shares of Bellatrix, which closed on June 22,
2016. The transaction is consistent with Bellatrix's strategy to consolidate operated production and
·
acreage within the Company’s core area at attractive metrics. The transaction adds highly
complementary production and reserves which are expected to be processed through Bellatrix
owned infrastructure and facilities and expected to have no incremental impact on general and
administrative costs.
5
the Alder Flats Plant Sale which involved the sale of a 35% minority interest in the Alder Flats Plant
to Keyera Partnership ("Keyera") for cash consideration of $112.5 million, which closed on August 9,
2016. Following the transaction, Bellatrix remains operator of the Alder Flats Plant, maintains a 25%
working interest ownership, and retains the option to reacquire a 5% interest in the Alder Flats Plant
·
near the end of the final year of the 10 year agreement with Keyera at a cost of $8 million. The $112.5
million of cash consideration includes a prepayment by Keyera for 35% of the estimated future
construction costs of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant. Net proceeds from the sale were used to repay
bank indebtedness.
on August 9, 2016, Bellatrix closed two financings (together, the “Offerings”) for gross proceeds of
$80 million. The Offerings included the issuance of $50 million principal amount of unsecured
subordinated convertible debentures (the “Debentures”) and 25,000,000 subscription receipts (the
“Subscription Receipts”) at a price of $1.20 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of
approximately $30 million. As a result of the completion of the Alder Flats Plant Sale, the maturity
date of the Debentures has automatically been extended to September 30, 2021 and the
Subscription Receipts have automatically converted into Common Shares. Net proceeds from the
·
Offerings of approximately $76.0 million were used to repay bank indebtedness. In connection with
the Offerings, Bellatrix has granted the underwriters an option (the “Over-Allotment Option”) to
purchase up to an additional $4.5 million of Subscription Receipts and $7.5 million principal amount
of Debentures to cover over-allotments and for market stabilization purposes, exercisable in whole or
in part at any time, and from time to time, until 30 days after the closing date of the Offerings. If the
Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, gross proceeds from the Offerings would increase by $12
million to $92 million.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, Bellatrix completed its semi-annual borrowing base
redetermination and the renewal of its syndicated credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities"). Effective
July 15, 2016, total commitments under the Company's Credit Facilities were set at $365 million,
comprised of a $210 million revolving facility (the "Revolving Facility") with an extendible maturity
date currently set at July 1, 2017, and a $155 non-revolving facility (the "Term Facility") with a maturity
date set at November 11, 2016.
Following completion of the Alder Flats Plant Sale and the Offerings and the application of the net
proceeds therefrom, the Revolving Facility has been reduced to $160 million and the amount
outstanding under the Term Facility reduced to approximately $13 million. The Company anticipates
being able to fully repay all amounts owing under the Term Facility prior to the November 11, 2016
maturity date by utilizing cash received from its operations and the proceeds, if any, from the full or
partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. Alternatively, Bellatrix may undertake other transactions
that would reduce outstanding indebtedness and repay the Term Facility in full prior to its maturity
date. Bellatrix is also in active discussions with existing and new potential syndicate members about
establishing a new long-term revolving credit facility prior to the next semi-annual redetermination and
the maturity date of the Term Facility.
DELIVERED ON GUIDANCE
Second quarter 2016 production averaged 38,000 boe/d (72% natural gas weighted), which
combined with first quarter volumes contributed to first half average production volumes of 38,234
boe/d, exceeding first half 2016 guidance of 38,000 boe/d while underspending the first half capital
budget by approximately 8%. Bellatrix exercised sagacious capital restraint given low commodity
prices as evidenced by the Company having underspent forecast capital expenditures in both the first
and second quarters of 2016, while effectively maintaining production volumes at or above corporate
guidance.
Activity in the second quarter of 2016 remained focused on optimization of existing assets given
curtailed development drilling activity. Improving wellbore dynamics through the installation of
plunger lift systems, wellbore cleanouts and the repositioning of pumps to optimize daily rate have
contributed to further attenuation of the base corporate decline rate. Further optimization initiatives
including gathering system modelling and the subsequent redirection of hydrocarbon directional flows
have maximized deliverability of Bellatrix operated production across the gathering system. Active
management of nominations during the ongoing restrictions of firm capacity on the Nova Gas
Transmission Ltd. (“NGTL”) system has minimized production impacts. The aforementioned
production initiatives have delivered positive results, with first half average production meeting
Company guidance despite the shut in of minor non-core properties in Southern Alberta due to
persistently low gas prices through the first and second quarters.
6
Production expenses in the first half of 2016 averaged $7.91/boe, slightly ahead of Company
guidance. The Facilities Monetization impacted the cost structure in the first half of 2016 and the Alder
Flats Plant Sale is anticipated to impact production expenses in the second half of 2016 as outlined
within the Company’s updated outlook. Bellatrix expects that upon completion of Phase 2 of the Alder
Flats Plant, production expenditures will realize a favourable step change reduction given the
incremental 30 MMcf/d ownership capacity net to Bellatrix’s 25% working interest.

CONTINUOUS EMPHASIS ON COST CONTAINMENT AND REDUCTIONS
Weak commodity prices persisted through the second quarter of 2016, most notably for natural gas
prices with AECO daily and monthly indices averaging $1.39/mcf and $1.25/mcf, respectively, down
24% and 41% compared to first quarter 2016 pricing and down 48% and 53%, respectively, compared
with pricing in the second quarter 2015. Despite continued commodity price volatility and weakness,
Bellatrix continued its focus on reducing and sustaining low costs across all business units during the
second quarter of 2016. In the first half of 2016 compared with the first half of 2015, Bellatrix achieved:
·Production expenses of $7.91/boe, a reduction of 8% from $8.57/boe
·Transportation expenses of $0.90/boe were down 27% from $1.24/boe
·Royalty expenses of $1.01/boe, a reduction of 68% from $3.11/boe
·General and administrative (“G&A”) costs of $1.35/boe, down 26% from $1.82/boe
·Capital costs per well drilled were reduced by approximately 22%
ALDER FLATS PHASE 2 TO DELIVER ENHANCED REVENUE GENERATION AND REDUCED
COSTS
Bellatrix continues to advance the Phase 2 expansion project of the Alder Flats Plant which is
expected to more than double the inlet capacity of the Plant from 110 MMcf/d currently to 230 MMcf/d.
The project remains on time and budget, scheduled for completion in the first half 2018. Bellatrix
invested approximately $5.1 million in the second quarter 2016 in facilities and infrastructure related
capital including $4.3 million directly in Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant.
The Phase 2 expansion project is similar in size and process to Phase 1, however Phase 2 is
engineered with a colder process to provide deeper liquids extraction capability with approximately
57% ethane extraction expected, versus approximately 19% ethane extraction engineered within
Phase 1. Bellatrix entered into long term NGL fractionation and ethane pricing agreements for both
Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Plant, therefore expects to benefit from enhanced liquids extraction and
revenue capture upon completion of Phase 2 in the first half of 2018.
With an expected increase in available throughput at the Alder Flats Plant by approximately 30
MMcf/d to 57.5 MMcf/d net to Bellatrix’s 25% net ownership interest, corporate operating costs are
expected to recognize a step change reduction in the first half of 2018 further enhancing the
Company’s long term competitiveness. The reduced cost profile further enhances rate of return
expectations on drilling projects in the greater Ferrier area and on future development drilling within
liquids rich natural gas formations such as the Spirit River and Cardium where Bellatrix holds an
estimated inventory of approximately 521 net identified locations within close proximity to the
Company’s core consolidated infrastructure and facility network.
7
Utilization remained strong at the Alder Flats Plant in the second quarter of 2016 averaging over 97%
and since July 2015 the Plant has efficaciously averaged 100% capacity utilization. The Alder Flats
Plant not only provides a strategic cost benefit but also provides Bellatrix the ability to re-direct
additional natural gas volumes to the Plant during periods of third party facility constraints and
unplanned downtime.
STRONG HEDGE PORTFOLIO
Bellatrix’s strategic planning is an active risk management policy providing reduced commodity price
volatility and greater predictability of future revenue and cash flow. As at August 9, 2016 Bellatrix had
strong risk management protection in place for the second half of 2016 with approximately 60% of
gross natural gas volumes hedged at an average fixed price of approximately $2.96/mcf, based upon
forecast second half of 2016 average production volumes of 34,500 boe/d (74% natural gas
weighted). Additionally, Bellatrix maintains a firm level of risk management protection in 2017 with
approximately 35% of gross natural gas volumes hedged at an average fixed price of approximately
$3.37/mcf, based on forecast December 2016 average production volumes of 36,500 boe/d (74%
natural gas weighted). Bellatrix did not add to its risk management portfolio during the second quarter
given weak spot and forward strip natural gas prices. At August 1, 2016 the 2017 AECO forward strip
had improved by approximately 10% compared with forward strip pricing on April 1, 2016.
Management continues to monitor market pricing with the intent to enhance Bellatrix’s level of risk
management protection in 2017 and further fortifying the portfolio with an inaugural base level of 2018
risk management protection over the next several quarters.
SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS
Although weak commodity prices have reduced industry exploration and development activity, the
expectations set for environmental, safety, and regulatory activity continues to increase given
heightened obligations and directives as set out in existing and new requirements. To that end,
Bellatrix is pleased to announce second quarter results were achieved with no lost time incidents,
and no material environmental or regulatory events. Bellatrix continues to execute our Inactive Well
Compliance Program (“IWCP”), have achieved our target quota in year one, and have an effective
proactive strategy in place to ensure the Company successfully achieves compliance for year two. In
July, the Alberta Energy Regulator (“AER”) assessed Bellatrix’s Liability Management Ratio (“LMR”)
at 8.8, more than double the industry average LMR of 4.2, and significantly above the Industry LMR
Threshold of 1.0 demonstrating a continued strong LMR position.

(1) The Company has entered into various commodity price risk management contracts which are
considered to be economic hedges. Per unit metrics after risk management include only the realized
portion of gains or losses on commodity contracts. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to
these contracts. As such, these contracts are revalued to fair value at the end of each reporting date.
This results in recognition of unrealized gains or losses over the term of these contracts which is
reflected each reporting period until these contracts are settled, at which time realized gains or losses
are recorded. These unrealized gains or losses on commodity contracts are not included for purposes
of per unit metrics calculations disclosed.
10
(2) Total revenue is considered to be a non-GAAP measure. Therefore reference to the non-GAAP
measure of total revenue may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other
entities. The Company’s calculation of total revenue includes petroleum and natural gas sales and
other income, and excludes commodity price risk management. Management believes this measure
is a useful supplementary measure of the revenue generated by the Company.
(3) The term funds flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure which should not be considered an
alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash flow from operating activities as determined in
accordance with GAAP as an indicator of the Company’s performance. Therefore reference to the
non-GAAP measures of funds flow from operations, or funds flow from operations per share may not
be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. Management uses funds
flow from operations to analyze operating performance and leverage and considers funds flow from
operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash
necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt. The reconciliation between cash flow
from operating activities and funds flow from operations can be found in the MD&A. Funds flow from
operations per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares for the
period.
(4) Total net debt is considered to be a non-GAAP measure. Therefore reference to the non-GAAP
measure of total net debt may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other
entities. The Company’s calculation of total net debt excludes deferred lease inducements,
decommissioning liabilities, the long-term finance lease obligation and deferred tax liability. Total net
debt includes the adjusted working capital deficiency (excess), current bank debt and long-term debt.
The adjusted working capital deficiency (excess) is a non-GAAP measure calculated as net working
capital deficiency (excess) excluding current commodity contract assets and liabilities, current finance
lease obligation, current deferred lease inducements, and the current portion of bank debt. A
reconciliation between total liabilities under GAAP and total net debt as calculated by the Company is
found in this MD&A.
(5) Operating netbacks, adjusted net profit (loss), and total capital expenditures – net are considered
non-GAAP measures. Operating netbacks are calculated by subtracting royalties, transportation, and
operating costs from total revenue. Adjusted net profit (loss) is calculated by excluding from net profit
(loss) unrealized gains and losses on commodity contracts, unrealized gains and losses on foreign
exchange, non-cash one time charges and non-cash impairments net of associated tax impacts after
adjusting for non-deductible items. The detailed calculations of adjusted net profit (loss) are found in
the MD&A. Adjusted net profit (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted average number of
common shares for the period. Total capital expenditures – net includes the cash impact of capital
expenditures and property dispositions, as well as the non-cash capital impacts of corporate
acquisitions, property acquisitions, adjustments to the Company’s decommissioning liabilities, and
share based compensation. The detailed calculations of operating netbacks are found in the MD&A.
(6) Basic weighted average shares for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were
193,770,290 (2015: 191,960,174) and 192,867,100 (2015: 191,956,654), respectively.
In computing weighted average diluted loss per share, weighted average diluted adjusted net loss per
share, weighted average diluted cash flow from operating activities per share, and weighted average
diluted funds flow from operations per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, a total
of nil (2015: nil) and nil (2015: nil) common shares were added to the denominator as a consequence
of applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s outstanding share options, resulting in diluted
weighted average common shares of 193,770,290 (2015: 191,960,174) and 192,867,100 (2015:
191,956,654), respectively.

Second Quarter 2016 Financial and Operational Results
SALES VOLUMES
Sales volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2016, decreased by 6% to an average of 38,000
boe/d compared to 40,426 boe/d in the second quarter of 2015. Total sales volumes decreased
between the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as drilling activity was curtailed in the latter
half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 in response to the volatile and challenging commodity price
environment as the Company balanced its focus on maintaining financial strength and liquidity as
well as optimization of capital investments. Total crude oil, condensate and NGLs averaged 28% of
sales volumes for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 28% in the same period in 2015.
Sales volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2016, averaged 38,234 boe/d, a decrease of 10%
from 42,406 boe/d realized in the first half of 2015. Total crude oil, condensate and NGLs averaged
28% of sales volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 28% in the same period
in 2015.
Bellatrix focused operational activity in the first half of 2016 on optimization of existing assets,
offsetting base declines and providing additional cash flow. Optimization of operations has provided
Bellatrix the ability to mitigate downtime, reduce declines, and reduce operating costs across its
operating areas. By improving wellbore dynamics through optimization projects daily rates are
maximized and base production declines have flattened. Gathering system optimization was
achieved through system modelling and subsequent redirection of flow has maximized deliverability
of the gathering system. Active management of nominations during the ongoing NGTL restrictions of
firm capacity has minimized production impacts as there have also been significant unplanned firm
service restrictions on the NGTL system during the second quarter (80-85% of firm transport for
several weeks). Despite the shut in of minor non-core properties in Southern Alberta due to
persistently low gas prices, Bellatrix first half 2016 average production met the guidance of 37,500 to
38,500 boe/d.
11
In response to low natural gas prices forecast through the summer and into the fall, Bellatrix has
phased its second half 2016 development plans and on-stream delivery of new Spirit River wells to
coincide with stronger forecast pricing later in the year. By delaying the on-stream delivery of new
flush natural gas production to the latter part of 2016, Bellatrix plans to maximize the rate of return of
the second half 2016 capital program.  Production volumes are anticipated to wane through the third
quarter of 2016 before regaining a growth trajectory through the fourth quarter of 2016 with average
daily production guidance for the second half of 2016 of 34,500 boe/d.

Bellatrix curtailed drilling activity in the second quarter of 2016 in response to the low commodity
price environment. In the first six months of 2016, Bellatrix posted a 100% success rate, drilling and/or
participating in 10 gross (5.7 net) wells Spirit River liquids-rich gas wells. Bellatrix’s drilling activity in
the first six months of 2016 was weighted 100% towards liquids-rich natural gas wells. The Company
has continued its drilling focus in the Spirit River liquids-rich natural gas play in response to ongoing
suppressed oil prices in the global market, and to take advantage of processing capacity at the Alder
Flats Plant. Bellatrix intends to continue to access up to $31 million of partner capital in the second
half of 2016 under the Grafton Joint Venture on development drilling in the high impact Spirit River
play.
By comparison, during the second quarter of 2015, Bellatrix drilled and/or participated in 4 gross (2.8
net) Spirit River liquids-rich gas wells. During the first half of 2015, Bellatrix drilled and/or participated
in 10 gross (6.0 net) wells, consisting of 3 gross (1.2 net) Cardium light oil horizontal wells and 7
gross (4.8 net) Spirit River liquids-rich gas wells. Bellatrix’s drilling activity in the six months of 2015
was weighted 30% towards oil wells and 70% towards natural gas wells.
12
Bellatrix’s strategic priority remains focused on maintaining financial strength and liquidity as well as
on profitable resource development in 2016. A net capital budget to not exceed $40 million has been
set for the second half of 2016 with the majority of the Company’s second half capital budget
expected to be invested directly in drilling, completion and tie-in activity.

The average CDN$/US$1.00 foreign exchange rate increased 5% to 1.2882 for the quarter ended
June 30, 2016, from an average rate of 1.2290 in the same period of 2015 and increased by 8% to
1.3289 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from an average rate of 1.2344 in 2015. The
devaluation of the Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar serves to partially offset the
impact of lower United States dollar-denominated crude oil for Canadian producers.
Through the first half of 2016, continued high levels of global oil production have oversupplied the
market and led to a supply-demand imbalance in the global marketplace, which has resulted in the
prolonged price deterioration for crude oil. The market sentiment towards a rebalancing of supply and
demand forces resulted in a 33% increase in crude benchmark pricing in the second quarter of 2016
compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Production of natural gas in North America has remained strong and has more than offset increased
Mexican exports and higher than expected demand for natural gas used for power generation in the
United States. Further impacting pricing has been robust natural gas storage levels in both Canada
and the United States resulting in realized pricing down 25% in the second quarter of 2016 compared
to the first quarter of 2016. Forest fires occurred in the Fort McMurray area of Alberta in early May
temporarily leading to lower industrial demand for natural gas in Alberta as oil sands producers were
required to curtail some production until the fires subsided, which lead to higher natural gas storage
levels and additional downward pressure on AECO pricing.
In the second quarter of 2016, Bellatrix realized an average price of $49.32/bbl before commodity
price risk management contracts for crude oil and condensate, a decrease of 26% from the average
price of $66.95/bbl received in the second quarter of 2015. By comparison, Canadian Light crude
blend price decreased by 20% and the average WTI crude oil benchmark price decreased by 21%
between the second quarters of 2016 and 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix
realized an average price for crude oil and condensate of $44.10/bbl before commodity price risk
management contracts, a decrease of 24% from the average price of $57.69/bbl realized during the
first half of 2015. By comparison Bellatrix’s realized price decreased in line with industry, the
Canadian Light price decreased by 21% and the average WTI crude oil benchmark price decreased
by 26% between the first six months of 2016 and 2015.
13
Bellatrix’s average realized price for NGLs (excluding condensate) decreased by 14% to $13.05/bbl
during the second quarter of 2016, compared to $15.15/bbl received in the second quarter of 2015.
NGL pricing in Western Canada remains challenged given individual market conditions for propane
and butane products. Butane pricing has been impacted by higher product supply from key United
States natural gas plays which has negatively impacted the overall supply-demand balance. Propane
pricing has also been negatively impacted by supply-demand balance and logistical issues in
Western Canada which has hindered deliveries to major demand markets. Realized propane prices
have continued to improve in the second quarter of 2016 as seasonal demand has risen in key
markets. Bellatrix’s average realized price for NGLs (excluding condensate) decreased by 30% to
$11.74/bbl during the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $16.69/bbl received in the first
half of 2015.
Natural gas prices declined during the second quarter of 2016 as year-over-year storage levels
remained robust due to strong production levels. Bellatrix’s natural gas sales are priced with
reference to the daily or monthly AECO indices. Bellatrix’s natural gas sold has a higher heat content
than the industry average, which results in slightly higher realized prices per mcf than the AECO daily
index. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the AECO daily reference price decreased by
48% and the AECO monthly reference price decreased by approximately 53% compared to the
second quarter of 2015. Bellatrix’s natural gas average sales price before commodity price risk
management contracts for the second quarter of 2016 decreased by 48% to $1.50/mcf compared to
$2.91/mcf in the same period in 2015. Bellatrix’s natural gas average price after including commodity
price risk management contracts for the three months ended June 30, 2016 averaged $2.34/mcf
compared to $2.94/mcf in the second quarter of 2015. During the first six months of 2016, the AECO
daily reference price decreased by 40% and the AECO monthly reference price decreased by 40%
compared to the same period in 2015. Bellatrix’s natural gas average sales price before commodity
price risk management contracts for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 41% to
$1.75/mcf compared to $2.95/mcf in the first half of 2015. Bellatrix’s natural gas average price after
including commodity price risk management contracts for the six months ended June 30, 2016
averaged $2.38/mcf compared to $2.99/mcf in the same period in 2015.
REVENUE
Total revenue of $48.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 46%
compared to $88.9 million realized in the second quarter of 2015. During the first six months of 2016,
Bellatrix’s total revenue decreased by 42% to $103.4 million, compared to $179.1 million in the same
period in 2015. The lower realized total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to significantly lower realized commodity pricing for
light oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs. Further contributing to the decrease in total revenue was
a 10% decrease in sales volumes resulting from lower drilling activity throughout the first half of 2016
as compared to the same period of 2015.
Crude oil and NGLs revenue before other income, royalties and commodity price risk management
contracts for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 38% to $24.5 million from $39.4
million realized during the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenue realized between the
periods was the result of significantly reduced realized crude oil, condensate, and NGL prices when
compared to the second quarter of 2015 and an 8% decrease in sales volumes resulting from the shift
in capital activity to the Spirit River play. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix realized
crude oil and NGLs revenue before other income, royalties and commodity price risk management
contracts of $45.0 million, a 41% decrease from $76.7 million realized during the first half of 2015.
The decrease in realized revenue between the six month periods was due to weaker average crude
oil and NGL prices.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, total crude oil, condensate and NGL revenues
contributed 52% and 46% of petroleum and natural gas sales, respectively, compared to 46% and
44% in the comparable 2015 periods.
14
Natural gas revenue before other income, royalties and commodity price risk management contracts
decreased by 51% in the second quarter of 2016 to $22.5 million from $46.0 million during the same
period in 2015. This was a result of a 48% decrease in realized natural gas prices before risk
management in conjunction with a 5% decrease in sales volumes between the periods. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, natural gas revenue before other income, royalties and commodity
price risk management contracts decreased by approximately 46% to $52.9 million compared to
$97.2 million realized during the first half of 2015. The decrease between the periods was the result of
a 41% decrease in realized gas prices before risk management and a 9% decrease in sales volumes
between the periods.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company has a formal commodity price risk management policy which permits management to
use specified price risk management strategies including fixed price contracts, collars, and the
purchase of floor price options and other derivative financial instruments and physical delivery sales
contracts to reduce the impact of price volatility for a maximum of thirty months beyond the transaction
date. The program is designed to provide price protection on a portion of the Company’s future
production in the event of adverse commodity price movement, while retaining significant exposure to
upside price movements. By doing this, the Company seeks to provide a measure of stability to funds
flow from operations, as well as to ensure Bellatrix realizes positive economic returns from its capital
development and acquisition activities. The Company plans to continue its commodity price risk
management strategies focusing on maintaining sufficient cash flow to fund Bellatrix’s capital
expenditure program. Any remaining production is realized at market prices.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company has entered into commodity price risk management arrangements
as follows:

When the Company has outstanding commodity price risk management contracts at a reporting date,
the fair value, or mark-to-market value, of these contracts reflected in its financial statements as an
unrealized asset or liability is based on the estimated amount that would have been received or paid
to settle the contracts as at the reporting date and would differ from what would eventually be realized.
Changes in the fair value of the commodity contracts are recognized in the Company’s Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss within the financial statements.

ROYALTIES
Bellatrix pays royalties to the respective provincial governments and landowners in British Columbia,
Alberta and Saskatchewan in which it operates. Each province that Bellatrix operates in has
established a separate and distinct royalty regime which impacts Bellatrix’s average corporate royalty
rate. The Company’s royalties are primarily paid in the province of Alberta. In Alberta, crown royalty
rates are based on reference commodity prices, production levels and well depths and are offset by
certain incentive programs, which usually have a finite period of time and are in place to promote
drilling activity by reducing overall royalty expense.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $3.6 million in royalties, compared
to $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. As a percentage of petroleum and natural gas sales
revenue (after transportation costs), royalties were 8% in the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to 11% in the comparative 2015 period. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix
incurred total royalties of $7.0 million compared to $23.9 million incurred in the first half of 2015.
Overall royalties as a percentage of petroleum and natural gas sales revenue (after transportation
costs) in the first six months of 2016 were 8%, compared with 15% in the same period in 2015.
Lower average corporate royalty rates period over period include the impact from lower commodity
prices reflecting the “sliding scale” effect included in the Alberta Royalty Framework and a change in
corporate production volume commodity weighting as well as increased gas cost allowance (“GCA”)
credits mainly associated with significant infrastructure and facilities investments by the Company
over the past three years. The GCA credits have also increased as a result of the growth in custom
processing from the Alder Flats Plant that was commissioned in 2015.

The Company’s light crude oil, condensate, NGLs, and natural gas royalties are impacted by lower
royalties on more recent wells in their early years of production under the Alberta New Well Royalty
Rate program and the Natural Gas Deep Drilling royalty incentive program, offset in-part by wells
drilled on Ferrier lands with higher combined Indian Oil and Gas Canada (“IOGC”) royalty and gross
overriding royalty (“GORR”) rates.
In the first half of 2016, the Government of Alberta completed its oil and gas royalty review, and
announced a new Modernized Royalty Framework (“MRF”) which included, for conventional activity,
no changes to the royalty structure of wells drilled prior to 2017 for a 10-year period from the MRF
implementation date and improved transparency concerning disclosure of royalty information. In July
2016, the Alberta government provided further formulaic details on the MRF which is currently being
assessed by Bellatrix.

PRODUCTION EXPENSES
Production expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $29.3 million
($8.46/boe) and $55.0 million ($7.91/boe), compared to $31.6 million ($8.58/boe) and $65.8 million
($8.57/boe) in the comparative 2015 periods. The decrease in production expense on a per-boe basis
between the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and the comparative periods in 2015
was primarily attributable to cost reductions realized from the Company’s investment in the Alder
Flats Plant which reduced the sales volume flowing to higher cost structured third-party facilities, as
well as increased operational efficiencies, field optimization work and increased competitive pricing
of contract services. Bellatrix executed a strong optimization program in the first half of 2016, resulting
in mitigation of downtime, moderating base declines and reducing production expenses. The
culmination of the programs resulted in additional cash flow with relatively small capital investment.

Transportation expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were $3.0 million
($0.87/boe) and $6.2 million ($0.90/boe), compared to $4.6 million ($1.26/boe) and $9.5 million
($1.24/boe) in the same periods in 2015. The decrease in transportation costs per boe in the 2016
year was due to Bellatrix completing the construction of pipeline infrastructure in the second half of
2015 to transport liquids volumes from major compression facilities to processing facilities as
opposed to trucking the production volumes. Additionally, in the latter part of 2015 and the first half of
2016, Bellatrix shifted capital activity towards the development of Spirit River liquids-rich gas wells
which have lower associated transportation costs than oil wells due to increased utilization of
Company owned pipeline infrastructure associated with these wells.

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company’s corporate operating netback before
commodity risk management contracts decreased by 70% to $3.58/boe compared to $11.92/boe in
the second quarter of 2015. The reduced netback realized in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily
the result of depressed average realized commodity prices, partially offset by reduced production,
transportation and royalty expenses. After including commodity risk management contracts, the
corporate operating netback for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $7.17/boe compared to
$11.99/boe in the second quarter of 2015. Per unit metrics including risk management include
realized gains or losses on commodity contracts and exclude unrealized gains or losses on
commodity contracts.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the corporate operating netback (before commodity risk
management contracts) was $5.05/boe a decrease of 52% compared to $10.42/boe in the first half of
2015. The reduced netback realized in the first six months of 2016 was primarily the result of lower
average realized commodity prices, partially offset by lower production, transportation and royalty
expenses. After including commodity risk management contracts, the corporate operating netback for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $7.73/boe compared to $10.74/boe in the first six months of
2015.

Operating netback before commodity price risk management contracts for crude oil, condensate and
NGLs during the second quarter of 2016 averaged $11.78/bbl, a decrease of 42% from the $20.25/bbl
realized during the same period in 2015. After including commodity price risk management contracts,
the operating netback for crude oil, condensate, and NGLs for the three months ended June 30, 2016
was $11.57/bbl compared to $20.03/bbl in the same period in 2015. The decrease between the
periods was primarily a result of weaker crude oil, condensate and NGL commodity prices, partially
offset by lower production, transportation and royalty expenses.
Operating netback for crude oil, condensate, and NGLs decreased by 41% to $10.36/bbl for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 from $17.57/bbl realized in the first half of 2015. After including
commodity price risk management contracts, the operating netback for crude oil, condensate, and
NGLs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $10.20/bbl compared to $18.16/bbl in the first half
of 2015. The reduced netback was primarily attributable to suppressed crude oil, condensate, and
NGL commodity prices, partially offset by lower production, transportation and royalty expenses.

The operating netback for natural gas before commodity price risk management contracts during the
second quarter of 2016 of a loss of $0.02/mcf compared to $1.22/mcf recorded in the same period in
2015. As a result Bellatrix’s active risk management strategy, the operating netback for natural gas for
the second quarter of 2016 was $0.82/mcf compared to $1.25/mcf in the same period in 2015 after
including commodity risk management contracts.
The reduction to the realized netback between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016 was driven by a
significant decrease in natural gas prices, partially offset by reduced production and transportation
expenses and royalty recoveries in the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30,
2016, Bellatrix realized an operating netback for natural gas of $0.32/mcf, a decrease of 71% from
$1.10/mcf realized in the same period in 2015. The lower netback realized between the periods
reflected lower natural gas prices, partially offset by decreased production, transportation and royalty
expenses. After including commodity risk management contracts, the operating netback for natural
gas for the first six months of 2016 was $0.95/mcf compared to $1.14/mcf in the same period in 2015.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
Bellatrix incurred lower gross G&A expenses (before capitalized G&A and recoveries) in the second
quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015 by 28% as the Company initiated
numerous cost saving strategies to reduce gross G&A expenses. Net G&A expenses (after
capitalized costs and recoveries) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were $4.9 million
($1.41/boe) and $9.4 million ($1.35/boe), respectively, compared to $6.7 million ($1.81/boe) and
$14.0 million ($1.82/boe) in the comparative 2015 periods, a decrease of 27% and 33%, respectively.
The overall decrease to net G&A was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross G&A expenses as
a result of significant cost saving initiatives on discretionary G&A spending, workforce reductions and
compensation expenses in the last half of 2015 and the first half of 2016. This decrease more than
offset reduced recoveries from partners associated with lower capital spending in 2016 as compared
to 2015.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix recorded $12.0 million ($3.48/boe) and
$24.2 million ($3.48/boe) of interest and financing charges related to the bank debt and the
outstanding US$250 million of 8.50% senior unsecured notes maturing on May 15, 2020 (“Senior
Notes”), compared to $9.3 million ($2.52/boe) and $15.5 million ($2.02/boe) during the same periods
in 2015, respectively.
The overall increase in interest and financing charges between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016
was mainly due to interest related to the Senior Notes which were issued during the second quarter of
2015 partially offset by the decrease interest charges related to the lower Bank debt.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Bellatrix has an Incentive Award Plan where the Company may grant Restricted Awards (“RAs”) and
Performance Awards (“PAs”) to officers, employees, and other service providers. As at August 9,
2016, Bellatrix had 1,390,681 RAs and 1,143,400 PAs outstanding. During the second quarter, the
shareholders and the TSX approved the issuance of common shares on settlement of RAs and PAs
under the Incentive Award Plan. As a result, awards under the Incentive Award Plan may be settled in
cash, in common shares of the Company, or a combination thereof. In the case of PAs, settlement is
subject to a “payout multiplier” (the payout multiplier shall be based on such corporate performance
measures as determined by the Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee) of the Company
and may range between zero and two times.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, non-cash share-based compensation was an expense of
$1.1 million ($0.32/boe) compared to $3.3 million ($0.90/boe) in the same period in 2015. The non-
cash share-based compensation expense realized in the three months ended June 30, 2016 period
was composed of an expense of $1.2 million (2015: $1.8 million) for the Company’s outstanding
share options, an expense of $0.1 million for Deferred Share Units (“DSUs”) (2015: $0.9 million
expense), an expense of $0.2 million (2015: $1.5 million expense) for RAs and an expense of $0.1
million (2015: $0.2 million expense) for PAs. Share-based compensation expense was offset by
capitalized share-based compensation. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, capitalized share-
based compensation was $0.5 million compared to $1.1 million in the same period in 2015. As a
result of the shareholder and TSX approval received, Bellatrix recorded $0.8 million to contributed
surplus in the period in relation to certain awards that the Company expects will be equity settled.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, non-cash share-based compensation expense was $1.3
million ($0.19/boe) compared to $3.7 million ($0.48/boe) in the first half of 2015. The decrease in non-
cash share-based compensation expense was the result of a lower expense of $1.9 million (2015:
$3.4 million expense) for the Company’s outstanding share options, a reduced expense of $0.2
million (2015: $1.3 million expense) for RAs, an expense of $0.1 million (2015: $0.1 million expense)
for PAs and a $0.2 million recovery for DSUs (2015: $0.4 million expense). The recovery recognized
for DSUs during the six months ended June 30, 2016, was due to the revaluation of DSUs resulting
from lower weighted average share trading price at June 30, 2016 than at December 31, 2015. Share-
based compensation expense was offset by capitalized share-based compensation. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, capitalized share-based compensation was $0.7 million compared to
$1.5 million in the same period in 2015.
21
DEPLETION AND DEPRECIATION
Depletion and depreciation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, was $37.6
million ($10.86/boe) and $75.2 million ($10.80/boe) compared to $44.2 million ($12.02/boe) and
$92.6 million ($12.07/boe) recognized in the comparative 2015 periods, respectively. The decrease in
the Company’s depletion and depreciation expense on a per boe basis between the periods can be
attributed to the lower capital cost base stemming from the impairment of assets recognized in 2015, a
decline in the associated future development costs attributable to the reserves in 2016, and a
decrease in production volumes in 2016, resulting in a lower depletion rate.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix has included a total of $1.11 billion (2015: $1.21
billion) for future development costs in the depletion calculation and excluded from the depletion
calculation a total of $60.8 million (2015: $83.3 million) for estimated salvage value.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Bellatrix incurs gains and losses in relation to the foreign currency translation of its Senior Notes. The
Senior Notes are translated from the United States dollar to Canadian dollar using the closing foreign
exchange rate for the period. Unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses are included in earnings in
the period related to the translation of the outstanding balance of the Senior Notes at the end of the
period. Realized foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized as the Senior Notes and other
minor foreign currency based transactions are translated and settled during the period.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix recorded a foreign exchange loss of $0.9
million and a gain of $16.8 million, respectively. This was due to the impact of the change over the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the
United States dollar primarily on the Company’s United States dollar denominated Senior Notes ($1.5
million loss and $20.0 million gain, respectively), net of the change in the fair value of its United
States foreign exchange forward contract ($0.1 million gain and $3.7 million loss, respectively).
The Company may utilize foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage foreign exchange risks in
order to maintain cash flow stability. Foreign exchange derivative transactions are conducted in
accordance with the risk management policy that has been approved by the Board of Directors. The
aggregate amount hedged under all foreign exchange derivate contracts is limited to the outstanding
principal amount of the Senior Notes and the term of foreign exchange contracts is limited to the
remaining term of the related Senior Notes.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had entered into the following United States foreign exchange
forward purchase contracts:

INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes arise from differences between the accounting and tax basis of the Company’s
assets and liabilities. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized
deferred income tax recoveries of $19.5 million and $18.6 million, compared to recoveries of $0.6
million and $4.4 million realized during the same periods in 2015, respectively. The deferred income
tax recovery recognized in the first six months of 2016 compared to the deferred tax recovery
recognized in the first half of 2015 was primarily attributable to a greater net loss recognized in the
2016 period compared to the net loss during the 2015 period, after adjusting for non-deductible tax
items. At June 30, 2016 the Company had a total deferred tax asset balance of $77.9 million.
At June 30, 2016, Bellatrix had approximately $1.65 billion in tax pools available for deduction
against future income as follows:

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, FUNDS FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, NET LOSS,
AND ADJUSTED NET LOSS
As detailed previously in this MD&A, funds flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure that does
not have any standardized meaning under GAAP. Bellatrix’s method of calculating funds flow from
operations may differ from that of other companies, and accordingly, may not be comparable to
measures used by other companies. Funds flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from
operating activities before decommissioning costs incurred and changes in non-cash working capital
incurred.

Bellatrix generated funds flow from operations of $9.0 million ($0.05 per basic share and diluted
share) in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of 68% from $28.4 million ($0.15 per basic share
and diluted share) generated in the comparative 2015 period. The decrease in funds flow from
operations between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016 was mainly attributable to lower realized
commodity pricing for crude oil and natural gas and a 6% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset
by decreased production, transportation, royalty and G&A expenses. Bellatrix’s cash flow from
operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 53% to $7.7 million
($0.04 per basic share and diluted share) from $16.5 million ($0.09 per basic share and diluted share)
generated in the second quarter of 2015.
23
Bellatrix generated funds flow from operations of $21.9 million ($0.11 per basic share and diluted
share) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 59% from $53.2 million ($0.28 per basic
share and diluted share) generated during the first six months of 2015. The decrease in funds flow
from operations between the first six months of 2015 and 2016 was mainly attributable to lower
realized commodity pricing for crude oil and natural gas and a 10% decrease in sales volumes,
partially offset by decreased production, transportation, royalty and G&A expenses. Bellatrix’s cash
flow from operating activities in the first half of 2016 decreased by 54% to $18.0 million ($0.09 per
basic share and diluted share) from $39.0 million ($0.20 per basic share and diluted share) generated
in the comparative 2015 period.
Bellatrix maintains a commodity price risk management program to provide a measure of stability to
funds flow from operations. Unrealized mark–to–market gains or losses are non-cash adjustments to
the fair market value of the contract over its entire term and are included in the calculation of net profit
(loss).
Management believes that, in addition to net profit (loss), adjusted net profit (loss) is a useful
supplemental measure as it reflects the underlying performance of Bellatrix’s business activities by
excluding the after tax effect after adjusting for non-deductible tax items of non-cash commodity
contracts mark–to–market gains and losses, unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, non-cash
impairment and non-cash one time charges, as applicable, that may significantly impact net profit
(loss) from period to period.

Bellatrix recognized an adjusted net loss of $32.3 million ($0.17 per basic and diluted share) for
the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to an adjusted net loss of $16.4 million ($0.09
per basic and diluted share) in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in adjusted net loss
recorded in the second quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted net loss in the same period in
2015 was primarily the result of the significant decrease in revenue driven by the volatile and
challenging commodity price environment, more than offsetting the decrease in the costs
related to production, transportation, G&A and depletion and depreciation expenses, as
compared to the same period in 2015.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix recognized a net loss of $55.2 million
($0.28 per basic and diluted share), compared to a net loss of $24.4 million ($0.13 per basic
share and diluted share) in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in net loss recorded in the
second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily the result of an
increase in unrealized losses on commodity risk management contracts and losses on
property dispositions in the quarter.
Bellatrix recognized an adjusted net loss of $48.3 million ($0.25 per basic and diluted share) for
the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to an adjusted net loss of $30.4 million ($0.16
per basic and diluted share) in the comparative 2015 period, after realizing decreased funds
from operating activities from the significantly reduced commodity pricing environment.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix recognized a net loss of $35.8 million ($0.19
per basic and diluted share), compared to a net loss of $37.1 million ($0.19 per basic and
diluted share) in the same period in 2015. The decrease in net loss recorded in the first half of
2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in realized
gains on commodity risk management contracts and future income tax recoveries recorded in
the period.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Bellatrix curtailed capital activity in the second quarter of 2016 given low commodity prices
and the seasonal spring break up period. Bellatrix’s strategic priority remains focused on
maintaining financial strength and liquidity as well as on profitable resource development in
2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix invested $7.8 million in
exploration and development capital projects, excluding property acquisitions and
dispositions, compared to $37.5 million in the same period in 2015. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, Bellatrix invested $36.8 million in exploration and development capital
projects, excluding property acquisitions and dispositions, compared to $118.8 million in the
comparative 2015 period.

In the second quarter of 2016, capital spending on exploration and development activities of
$7.8 million was focused primarily on facilities and equipment expenditures related to the
development of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant. Bellatrix remains committed to construction
of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant as significant pre-build and flexibility has already been
incorporated into the design and footprint at the Alder Flats Plant. The combined inlet capacity
for Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be a total of 230 MMcf/d with an expected on-stream date for
Phase 2 in the first half of 2018.
25
Based on economic conditions and Bellatrix’s operating forecast for the second half of 2016,
the Board approved a budget in June 2016 for a net capital program of up to $40 million in the
second half of 2016, with funding limited to available cash flow. The second half of 2016 capital
is expected to be directed towards drilling, completion and tie-in activity, primarily in the Spirit
River formation and investment in strategic infrastructure projects with approximately 19% of
total expenditures invested in facilities and infrastructure, including approximately $7 million
invested into Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant. A portion of such expenditures represent the
prepayment made by Keyera related to Phase 2, pursuant to the Alder Flats Plant Sale.
Business Combination
Bellatrix completed a property acquisition of complementary assets within its core Ferrier area
for total consideration of $29.2 million, paid through the issuance of 20,547,576 common
shares of Bellatrix during the second quarter of 2016. In accordance with IFRS, a property
acquisition is accounted for as a business combination when certain criteria are met, such as
the acquisition of inputs and processes to convert those inputs into beneficial outputs.
Bellatrix assessed the property acquisition and determined it to constitute a business
combination under IFRS. In a business combination, acquired assets and liabilities are
recognized by the acquirer at their fair market value at the time of purchase. Any variance
between the determined fair value of the assets and liabilities and the purchase price is
recognized as either a gain or loss in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of
acquisition.
The estimated fair value of the property, plant and equipment acquired was determined using
observable market metrics. The decommissioning liabilities assumed were determined using
the timing and estimated costs associated with the abandonment, restoration and reclamation
of the wells and facilities acquired. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is final. The acquired assets consisted of $29.7 million of oil and natural gas
properties, the value of which was determined using observable market metrics in addition to
$0.5 million of decommissioning liabilities assumed as a result of the acquisition. The acquired
assets were originally earned by Grafton under the $250 million Grafton Joint Venture, and
consist of Grafton’s interest in 18 gross wells (representing Grafton’s pre-payout interest in
such wells) and related lands, rights and interests currently operated by Bellatrix. The acquired
assets produced an average of approximately 2,000 boe/d net to Grafton in the month prior to
acquisition (79% natural gas weighted). No gain or loss on property acquisition was
recognized in relation to the acquisition. The closing date of the transaction was June 22, 2016.
Dispositions
During the three month period ending June 30, 2016, Bellatrix completed the Facilities
Monetization, pursuant to which it sold certain production facilities to a third party midstream
company for proceeds of $75 million effective May 3, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement, Bellatrix
maintains operatorship and preferential access to the facilities for its operated production
volumes and will pay an annual rental fee over the eight year duration of the agreement. In
addition, Bellatrix retains, at its sole discretion, the option to repurchase the facilities at any
time during the agreement period. The estimated rental costs associated with the arrangement
will have a modest impact on the Company’s overall corporate operating cost profile, which
Bellatrix believes will be partially offset by continued cost reduction initiatives and third party
processing revenue generated and retained by Bellatrix from the facilities. Payments for use of
the facilities are treated as an operating lease and included in Bellatrix’s corporate
commitments.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized total net gains on
disposition of $0.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively, were recognized relating to gains on
wells drilled under the Grafton Joint Venture (2015: $1.9 million and $8.0 million on wells drilled
under the Grafton Joint Venture and the joint venture between Bellatrix and TCA Energy Ltd.
that was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2015) which were completed and tied-in during the
quarter as well as adjustments for wells completed and tied in during prior periods. A gain on
disposition for each well is recognized to account for the disposal of the pre-payout working
interest earned by the joint venture partner on the well, which results from the difference
between the percentage of all capital costs contributed for the drilling, completion, equipping
and tie-in of the well by the joint venture partner and the pre-payout working interest allocated
to the joint venture partner by the Company. The gain on disposition for a well is recognized
during the quarter in which the well was completed and tied-in.
Under the Grafton Joint Venture, Grafton contributes 82% of the total capital costs required for
each well and in return earns 54% of Bellatrix’s WI in each well drilled in the well program until
payout.
26
Additionally in the quarter, Bellatrix had minor dispositions of both assets and working interest
in assets for proceeds of $2.7 million.
Bellatrix recorded a total loss on property dispositions of $13.1 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016.
Subsequent to the quarter end, Bellatrix closed the transaction to sell a 35% minority interest
in the Alder Flats Plant to Keyera for cash consideration of $112.5 million. As part of the
transaction, Bellatrix and Keyera will enter into a midstream services and governance
agreement pursuant to which Bellatrix will have exclusive access to the purchased capacity
(approximately 80.5 MMcf/d post commissioning of Phase 2) for a term of 10 years, and will
remain the operator of the Alder Flats Plant.  In exchange for exclusive access to the
purchased capacity during the term, Keyera will be entitled to receive, on an annual basis, a
guaranteed fee calculated with reference to the capital fees that Keyera will otherwise receive
in accordance with the terms of the construction, ownership and operation agreement
governing the Alder Flats Plant. Following completion of the transaction, Bellatrix will retain a
25% interest in the Alder Flats Plant, and will also have the option to reacquire a 5% interest in
the Alder Flats Plant near the end of the final year of the agreement at a cost of $8 million.
Bellatrix continues to advance the Phase 2 expansion project of the Alder Flats Plant which is
expected to more than double the inlet capacity of the Plant from 110 MMcf/d currently to 230
MMcf/d. The project remains on time and budget, and is scheduled for completion in the first
half 2018 at a remaining net cost to Bellatrix of approximately $41 million, including the amount
represented by Keyera's prepayment. Subject to changes in commodity prices and the
assumptions and risk factors discussed under "Forward-Looking Statements", Bellatrix
currently anticipates that the remaining net costs relating to the Phase 2 expansion project of
the Alder Flats Plant, including the amount represented by Keyera's prepayment, will be
funded from our cash flow.
DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITIES
At June 30, 2016, Bellatrix has recorded decommissioning liabilities of $98.1 million compared
to $96.4 million at December 31, 2015, for future abandonment and reclamation of the
Company’s properties. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, decommissioning
liabilities increased by a net $1.7 million as a result of $0.4 million incurred in relation to
development activities, $0.8 million as a result of charges for the unwinding of discount rates
used for assessing liability present values and $5.2 million resulting from changes in
estimates. This was offset by a $4.7 million reduction in the liability as a result of disposition
transactions in the period. The $5.2 million increase in decommissioning liabilities between
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 resulting from revisions on estimates were primarily due
to reduced market interest rates which decreases the discount rates applied to the valuation of
the liabilities.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As an oil and gas company, Bellatrix has a declining asset base and therefore relies on
ongoing development and acquisitions to replace production and add additional reserves.
Future oil and natural gas production and reserves are highly dependent on the success of
exploiting the Company’s existing asset base and in identifying or acquiring additional
reserves. To the extent Bellatrix is successful or unsuccessful in these activities, cash flow
could be increased or decreased. In addition, the Company’s cash flow depends on a number
of factors, including commodity prices, production and sales volumes, operating expenses,
taxes and royalties.
Bellatrix remains highly focused on key business objectives of maintaining financial strength
and liquidity, and optimizing capital investments in the current low commodity price
environment. In order to preserve liquidity and capital resources, Bellatrix’s Board of Directors
approved a 2016 net capital budget of up to $77 million, with funding limited to available cash
flow. The 2016 capital budget represents an approximate 50% reduction in capital spending
relative to total 2015 capital spending. Bellatrix expects to be able to fund its 2016 capital
program by reinvesting cash flow and to the extent necessary, through borrowings under its
revolving Credit Facilities. Bellatrix continually monitors its capital spending program in light
of prevailing commodity prices and the United States/Canadian dollar exchange rate with the
aim of ensuring the Company will be able to meet future anticipated obligations incurred from
normal ongoing operations with funds flow from operations and borrowings under its Credit
Facilities, as necessary.
27
In addition to funds flow from operations, the Company’s other main source of liquidity is its
revolving Credit Facilities. Availability under the Credit Facilities is governed by a borrowing
base, which is re-determined by the lenders, in their sole discretion, on a semi-annual basis on
or before May 31 and November 30 of each year, taking into consideration the estimated value
of the Company’s oil and natural gas properties in accordance with the lenders’ customary
practices for oil and gas loans. At June 30, 2016 the Company had $314 million outstanding at
a weighted average interest rate of 4.48%.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company completed its semi-annual borrowing base
redetermination and the renewal of its Credit Facilities. The total commitments under the Credit
Facilities have been set at $365 million and are comprised of a $210 million Revolving Facility
and a $155 million Term Facility. The maturity date of the Revolving Facility has been extended
to July 1, 2017, and Bellatrix may request a further extension for a period not to exceed 3 years
which may or may not be granted by the lenders. The maturity date of the Term Facility has
been set at November 11, 2016. The borrowing base is subject to redetermination on or before
May 31 and November 30 in each year prior to maturity, with the next semi-annual
redetermination expected to occur on November 11, 2016.
The agreement governing the Credit Facilities contemplates that concurrently with the maturity
of the Term Facility on November 11, 2016, the Revolving Facility will be reduced from $210
million to $152 million; however, the actual amount of the Revolving Facility will depend on the
semi–annual borrowing base review to be conducted in November 2016, which could result in
the total commitment under the Revolving Facility being higher or lower than the $152 million
currently contemplated.
The agreement governing the Credit Facilities contains certain events of default which relate to
the Company failing to satisfy certain milestones in order to payout the amounts owing on
November 11, 2016. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, Bellatrix completed the Alder Flats Plant
Sale to Keyera for cash consideration of $112.5 million, which closed on August 9, 2016. Net
proceeds from the sale were used to repay bank indebtedness.
On August 9, 2016, Bellatrix closed two financings for gross proceeds of $80 million. The
Offerings included the issuance of $50 million principal amount of Debentures and 25,000,000
Subscription Receipts at a price of $1.20 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of
approximately $30 million. As a result of the completion of the Alder Flats Plant Sale, the
maturity date of the Debentures has automatically been extended to September 30, 2021 and
the Subscription Receipts have automatically converted into Common Shares. Net proceeds
from the Offerings of approximately $76.0 million were used to repay bank indebtedness. In
connection with the Offerings, Bellatrix has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up
to an additional $4.5 million of Subscription Receipts and $7.5 million principal amount of
Debentures to cover over-allotments and for market stabilization purposes, exercisable in
whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, until 30 days after the closing date of the
Offerings. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, gross proceeds from the Offerings
would increase by $12 million to $92 million. Bellatrix used the cash proceeds from the
Offerings to partially effect the mandatory repayments of indebtedness required under the
Credit Facilities.
Following completion of the Alder Flats Plant Sale and the Offerings and the application of the
net proceeds therefrom, the Revolving Facility has been reduced to $160 million and the
amount outstanding under the Term Facility reduced to approximately $13 million. The
Company anticipates being able to fully repay all amounts owing under the Term Facility prior
to the November 11, 2016 maturity date by utilizing cash received from its operations and the
proceeds, if any, from the full or partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. Alternatively,
Bellatrix may undertake other transactions that would reduce outstanding indebtedness and
repay the Term Facility in full prior to its maturity date. Bellatrix is also in active discussions
with existing and new potential syndicate members about establishing a new long-term
revolving credit facility prior to the next semi-annual redetermination and the maturity date of
the Term Facility.
Bellatrix's ability to repay the Term Facility at maturity will depend on the Company's ability to
generate sufficient cash flow prior to November 11, 2016 or generate funds from other
transactions or secure other sources of financing. Although Bellatrix believes that the
Company will generate sufficient cash flow prior to November 11, 2016 to repay the Term
Facility, if our cash flow is lower than anticipated for any reason and we are not able to secure
alternative financing, we may not be able to repay the Term Facility at maturity which may
result in the lenders under the Credit Facilities proceeding to foreclose or otherwise realize
upon the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness under the Credit Facilities.

The following table shows Bellatrix’s pro forma Bank Debt as at June 30, 2016, assuming the
Alder Flats Plant Sale and the Offerings closed effective June 30, 2016. Management expects
this pro forma June 30, 2016, Bank Debt balance to approximate actual August 9, 2016, Bank
Debt balances post-closing the Alder Flats Plant Sale and the Offerings:

In addition to the semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations, the Credit Facilities
incorporate the financial covenant of Senior Debt to EBITDA (the “Senior Debt Covenant” as
defined in detail below) which also has the ability to effectively limit the Company’s maximum
drawings permitted under the Credit Facilities. Specifically, the Senior Debt Covenant requires
that the Company maintain a Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.5 times for the
fiscal quarters ending on or before March 31, 2017. Commencing with the second quarter of
2017, the maximum Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio reduces to 3.0 times (3.5 times for the two
fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition). Senior Debt is defined as all debt
of the borrower, including outstanding letters of credit, bank debt, finance lease obligations,
deferred lease inducements and net working capital deficiency. Excluded from the calculation
of Senior Debt is subordinated debt such as the Senior Notes, convertible debentures,
decommissioning liabilities and deferred tax liability. EBITDA is defined as consolidated
earnings before interest, taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization. As at June 30, 2016,
the Company’s trailing twelve-month EBITDA was $123.0 million and Senior Debt was $343.1
million, resulting in a Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.79 times. Pro forma the Alder Flats Plant
Sale and the Offerings, Bellatrix’s Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio would have been approximately
1.43 times as at June 30, 2016.
Total net debt levels of $638.0 million at June 30, 2016 decreased by $79.6 million from $717.6
million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in total net debt from December 31, 2015 was
primarily due to the Facilities Monetization transaction which generated proceeds of $75.0
million. Total net debt levels at June 30, 2016 include bank debt, Senior Notes, and the net
balance of an adjusted working capital deficiency of $10.6 million, which incorporated $8.7
million in advances from joint venture partners, the majority of which represents drilling
obligations predominantly under the Grafton Joint Venture. Total net debt excludes unrealized
risk management contract assets and liabilities, deferred taxes, finance lease obligations,
deferred lease inducements and decommissioning liabilities.

(1) As detailed previously in this MD&A, funds flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure
with no standardized meaning or definition under GAAP. Funds flow from operations is
calculated as cash flow from operating activities, excluding decommissioning costs incurred,
changes in non-cash working capital incurred and transaction costs. Refer to the
reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to funds flow from operations appearing
elsewhere herein.
(2) Total net debt is considered to be a non-GAAP measure. Therefore reference to the
additional non-GAAP measure of total net debt may not be comparable with the calculation of
similar measures for other entities. The Company’s calculation of total net debt excludes
deferred lease inducements, decommissioning liabilities, the long-term finance lease
obligation and deferred tax liability. Total net debt includes the adjusted working capital
deficiency (excess), current bank debt, and long-term debt. The adjusted working capital
deficiency (excess) is a non-GAAP measure calculated as net working capital deficiency
(excess) excluding current risk management contract assets and liabilities, current finance
lease obligation, current deferred lease inducements, and the current portion of bank debt. A
reconciliation between total liabilities under GAAP and total net debt as calculated by the
Company is found below in this MD&A.
(3) For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, total net debt to funds flow from
operations ratio (annualized) is calculated based upon second quarter funds flow from
operations annualized. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, total net debt to
funds flow from operations ratio (annualized) is calculated based upon first half funds flow
from operations annualized.
(4) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, includes unrealized foreign exchange
loss of $1.5 million (2015: $6.3 million) and gain of $20.0 million (2015: $6.3 million loss),
respectively, and does not include an unrealized gain of $0.1 million (2015: nil) and $3.7 million
(2015: nil) of unrealized loss on foreign exchange contracts, respectively.
(5) Trailing periods funds flow from operations ratio annualized is based upon the twelve-
month periods ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.
As at June 30, 2016 the Company’s ratio of total net debt to annualized funds flow from
operations (based on second quarter funds flow from operations) was 17.6 times. The total net
debt to annualized funds flow from operations ratio as at June 30, 2016 increased from that at
June 30, 2015 of 6.3 times primarily due to a decrease in funds flow from operations due to the
significant and continued decline in commodity prices, specifically the decline in Bellatrix’s
realized gas prices. On a pro forma basis the subsequent event transactions reduce total net
debt (excluding convertible debentures) to annualized funds flow from operations at June 30,
2016, from 17.6 times to 12.3 times and total net debt to trailing funds flow from operations from
8.2 times to 5.7 times. The Company continues to preserve liquidity through the priority use of
funds flow from operations.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that Bellatrix will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they
become due. Bellatrix actively manages its liquidity through daily and longer-term cash, debt
and equity management strategies. Such strategies encompass, among other factors: having
adequate sources of financing available through its Credit Facilities, estimating future cash
generated from operations based on reasonable production and pricing assumptions,
analysis of economic risk management opportunities, and maintaining sufficient cash flows for
compliance with the Credit Facilities Senior Debt Covenant described above and the ability to
repay the Term Facility and Revolving Facility.
Bellatrix generally relies on its operating cash flows and, as necessary and if available, its
Credit Facilities to fund capital requirements and provide liquidity. Future liquidity depends
primarily on cash flow generated from operations, availability under the Credit Facilities and
Bellatrix’s ability to comply with the Senior Debt Covenant and other covenants contained
therein, and the ability to access debt and equity markets. From time to time, the Company
accesses capital markets to meet its additional financing needs and to maintain flexibility in
funding its capital programs. As at June 30, 2016, the Company has the ability to offer to sell
up to an additional $470.8 million in securities under its $500 million Shelf Prospectus, which
expires on June 30, 2018.
There can be no assurance that future debt or equity financing, additional credit under the
Credit Facilities, or cash generated by operations will be available or sufficient to meet these
requirements or for other corporate purposes or, if debt or equity financing is available, that it
will be on terms acceptable to Bellatrix.
As at August 9, 2016, Bellatrix had outstanding a total of 11,493,835 options at an average
exercise price of $5.66 per share and 237,511,486 common shares. In addition, as at August 9,
2016, Bellatrix had 1,390,681 RAs and 1,143,400 PAs outstanding. During the second quarter,
the shareholders and the TSX approved the issuance of common shares on settlement of RAs
and PAs under the Incentive Award Plan. As a result, awards under the Incentive Award Plan
may be settled in cash, in common shares of the Company, or a combination thereof. In the
case of PAs, settlement is subject to a “payout multiplier” (the payout multiplier shall be based
on such corporate performance measures as determined by the Board of Directors (or the
Compensation Committee) of the Company and may range between zero and two times.
30
In addition, as at August 9, 2016, there was $50 million principal amount of Debentures
outstanding which are convertible into common shares of the Company at a price of $1.62 per
share (representing a conversion rate of approximately 617.2840 Common Shares per $1,000
principal amount of Debentures and subject to certain adjustments as set out in the Indenture
(as defined below) at the option of the holder. If the full principal amount of Debentures was
converted it would result in the issuance of approximately 30,864,198 common shares. In
addition, the Company may elect to issue common shares of the Company to satisfy our
obligation to repay, in whole or in part, the principal amount of the Debentures upon
redemption or maturity of the Debentures (any accrued and unpaid interest on such
redemption or maturity will be paid in cash). The exact number of common shares of the
Company that may be issuable on redemption or maturity is not readily determinable as such
number will be determined by dividing the principal amount of the Debentures subject to the
election which are to be redeemed or will mature by 95% of the current market price of the
common shares on the redemption date or maturity date, as applicable.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to Bellatrix if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from Bellatrix’s trade
receivables from joint venture partners, petroleum and natural gas marketers, and financial
derivative counterparties.
A substantial portion of Bellatrix’s accounts receivable are with customers and joint interest
partners in the petroleum and natural gas industry and are subject to normal industry credit
risks. Bellatrix currently sells substantially all of its production to ten primary purchasers
under standard industry sale and payment terms. The most significant 60 day exposure to a
single counterparty is approximately $10 million. Purchasers of Bellatrix’s natural gas, crude
oil and natural gas liquids are subject to a periodic internal credit review to minimize the risk of
non-payment. Bellatrix has continued to closely monitor and reassess the creditworthiness of
its counterparties, including financial institutions. This has resulted in Bellatrix mitigating its
exposures to certain counterparties by obtaining financial assurances or reducing credit
where it is deemed warranted and permitted under contractual terms.
Bellatrix may be exposed to third party credit risk through its contractual arrangements with its
current or future partners and joint venture partners, marketers of its petroleum and natural
gas production, derivative counterparties and other parties. In the event such entities fail to
meet their contractual obligations to Bellatrix, such failures may have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In
addition, poor credit conditions in the industry and of joint venture partners may impact a joint
venture partner’s willingness to participate in Bellatrix’s ongoing capital program, potentially
delaying the program and the results of such program until Bellatrix finds a suitable alternative
partner.
Long Term Debt
Bank Debt
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, amounts borrowed under the Credit Facilities bear
interest at a floating rate based on the applicable Canadian prime rate, U.S. base rate, CDOR
rate or LIBOR margin rate, plus between 0.8% to 4.75%, depending on the type of borrowing
and the Company’s Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio. A standby fee is charged of between 0.405%
and 1.06875% on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facilities, depending on the Company’s
Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities are secured by a
$1 billion debenture containing a first ranking charge and security interest. Bellatrix has
provided a negative pledge and undertaking to provide fixed charges over its properties in
certain circumstances.
On July 18, 2016, Bellatrix announced the completion of the semi-annual borrowing base
redetermination and the renewal of our Credit Facilities. In connection with the establishment
of these revised Credit Facilities, Bellatrix entered into an amended and restated credit
agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") with the lenders under the Credit
Facilities. Pursuant to the renewal the total commitments under our Credit Facilities were
reduced from $460 million to $365 million consisting of the $210 million Revolving Facility and
the $155 million Term Facility. The maturity date of the Revolving Facility has been extended to
July 1, 2017, and Bellatrix may request further extension of the maturity date of the Revolving
Facility for a period not to exceed 3 years, which may or may not be granted by the lenders
under the Credit Facilities. The maturity date of the Term Facility has been set at November 11,
2016.
31
Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the
applicable Canadian prime rate, U.S. base rate, CDOR rate or LIBOR margin rate, plus between
0.8% and 4.75%, depending on the type of borrowing and the Company's consolidated Senior
Debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio (both as defined herein). A standby fee is charged of
between 0.405% to 1.06875% on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility, depending on
the Company's consolidated Senior Debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio. Amounts borrowed
under the Term Facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the applicable Canadian prime
rate, U.S. base rate, CDOR rate or LIBOR margin rate, plus between 4.30% and 8.25% from July
15, 2016 to and including September 30, 2016 and between 4.80% and 8.75% from and after
October 1, 2016 depending on the Company’s consolidated Senior Debt to consolidated
EBITDA ratio.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contemplates that concurrently with the
maturity of the Term Facility on November 11, 2016, the Revolving Facility will be reduced from
$210 million to $152 million; however, the actual amount of the Revolving Facility will depend
on the semi–annual borrowing base review to be conducted in November 2016, which could
result in the total commitment under the Revolving Facility being higher or lower than the $152
million currently contemplated in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The borrowing
base is subject to redetermination on or before May 31 and November 30 in each year prior to
maturity, with the next semi-annual redetermination currently ongoing with finalization
expected to occur on November 11, 2016.
Following completion of the Alder Flats Plant Sale and the Offerings and the application of the
net proceeds therefrom, the Revolving Facility has been reduced to $160 million and the
amount outstanding under the Term Facility reduced to approximately $13 million. The
Company anticipates being able to fully repay all amounts owing under the Term Facility prior
to the November 11, 2016 maturity date by utilizing cash received from its operations and the
proceeds, if any, from the full or partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. Alternatively,
Bellatrix may undertake other transactions that would reduce outstanding indebtedness and
repay the Term Facility in full prior to its maturity date. Bellatrix is also in active discussions
with existing and new potential syndicate members about establishing a new long-term
revolving credit facility prior to the next semi-annual redetermination and the maturity date of
the Term Facility.
The agreement governing the Credit Facilities contains market standard terms and conditions,
and includes, for instance, restrictions on asset dispositions and hedging. Generally,
dispositions of properties to which the Company is given lending value in the determination of
the borrowing base require lender approval if the net present value at 10% attributed to all
properties sold in a fiscal year exceeds 5% of the borrowing base in effect at the time of such
disposition. However, the agreement governing the Credit Facilities also provides that until the
Term Facility is repaid in full and the Revolving Facility has been reduced to $152 million, and
at any time when there is a borrowing base shortfall, the value of the properties being sold or
disposed cannot exceed $5 million in aggregate in any fiscal year without approval of a
majority of lenders. In addition, asset dispositions are generally not permitted unless there
would be no borrowing base shortfall as a result of such properties being sold. Hedging
transactions must not be done for speculative purposes. The term of any hedging contract for
commodity swaps cannot exceed 3 years. The aggregate amount hedged under all oil and gas
commodity swaps cannot exceed 70% of the Company’s average daily sales volume for the
first year of a rolling 3 year period, 60% for the second year of such period or 50% for the third
year of such period, with the average daily sales volume being based on the Company’s
production for the previous fiscal quarter. The aggregate amount hedged under all interest
rate swaps, relating to unsecured note debt, cannot exceed the outstanding principal amount
of any unsecured note debt or have a term exceeding the remaining term of the unsecured
note debt. For interest rate swaps, unrelated to any unsecured note debt, the aggregate
amount hedged cannot exceed 60% of the amount of the commitment under the Credit
Facilities or exceed a term of three years. The aggregate amount hedged under all exchange
rate swaps, relating to unsecured note debt, cannot exceed the outstanding principal amount
of any unsecured note debt or have a term exceeding the remaining term of the unsecured
note debt. For exchange rate swaps, unrelated to any unsecured note debt, the aggregate
amount hedged cannot exceed 60% of Bellatrix’s United States dollar revenue over the
previous three months or exceed a term of three years.
The agreement governing the Credit Facilities also contains certain events of default which
relate to the Company failing to satisfy certain milestones in order to payout the amounts
owing on November 11, 2016. A copy of the agreement governing the Credit Facilities has
been filed with Canadian and US securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed
through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com), through the SEC website (www.sec.gov).
32
Senior Notes
The Company has US$250 million of 8.50% senior unsecured notes maturing May 15, 2020 all
of which remained outstanding as at June 30, 2016. Interest is payable on the Senior Notes
semi-annually and the Senior Notes are redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in
part, commencing on May 15, 2017 at specified redemption prices. The Senior Notes are
redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal
amount of the Senior Notes): May 15, 2017 to May 14, 2018 at 104.250%, May 15, 2018 to May
14, 2019 at 102.125%, May 15, 2019 and thereafter at 100.000%.  Prior to May 15, 2017, some or
all of the Senior Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus
a make-whole premium. Additionally, up to 35% of the Senior Notes may be redeemed prior to
May 15, 2017 at a redemption price equal to 108.500%, with an amount of cash not greater than
the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. The Senior Notes are carried at amortized
cost, net of debt issuance costs of $7.7 million, which accrete up to the principal balance at
maturity using the effective interest rate of 9.6%. The Senior Notes were initially recognized at
fair value, net of debt issue costs, and have subsequently been carried at amortized cost.

Covenants
The agreement governing the Credit Facilities contains one financial covenant (referred to
above as the Senior Debt Covenant), which requires that the Company will not permit its ratio
of outstanding Senior Debt to EBITDA, as defined by the terms of the agreement governing the
Credit Facilities and adjusted for non-cash charges, for a trailing 12-month period to exceed a
specified amount (the “Senior Debt Covenant”). Specifically, the Senior Debt Covenant
requires that the Company maintain a Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.5 times
for the fiscal quarters ending on or before March 31, 2017. Commencing with the second
quarter of 2017, the maximum Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio reduces to 3.0 times (3.5 times for
the two fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition). As at June 30, 2016, the
Company was in compliance with the Senior Debt Covenant with a Senior Debt to EBITDA
ratio of 2.79 times. Pro forma the Alder Flats Plant Sale and the Offerings, Bellatrix’s Senior
Debt to EBITDA ratio would have been approximately 1.43 times as at June 30, 2016.
33
The Senior Notes do not contain any maintenance financial covenants but contain an
incurrence-based minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant which, if not met, limits the
Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness beyond its existing Senior Notes and its
Credit Facilities.
The following table lists the covenant under the Credit Facilities and Senior Notes, and the
Company’s compliance therewith as at June 30, 2016:

June 30, 2016
(1) “Senior Debt” is defined as Consolidated Total Debt, excluding any unsecured or
subordinated debt (Senior Notes and Convertible Debentures). “Consolidated Total Debt” is
defined as determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP and without
duplication, all Debt of the Borrower. The Company’s calculation of Consolidated Total Debt
excludes decommissioning liabilities and deferred tax liability. The calculation includes
outstanding letters of credit, bank debt, finance lease obligations, deferred lease inducements
and net working capital deficiency (excess), calculated as working capital deficiency excluding
current risk management contract assets and liabilities. Senior Debt at June 30, 2016 was
$343.1 million.
(2) “EBITDA” refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization.
EBITDA is calculated based on terms and definitions set out in the Credit Agreement which
adjusts net income (loss) for financing costs, certain specific unrealized and non-cash
transactions, and acquisition and disposition activity and is calculated based on a trailing
twelve month basis. EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2016 was $123.0
million.
(3) Fixed charge coverage is computed as the ratio of fixed charges (as defined in the indenture
governing the Senior Notes fixed charges generally includes interest expense plus paid or
accrued dividends, if any) to trailing twelve month consolidated cash flow (as defined in the
indenture governing the Senior Notes, consolidated cash flow includes the consolidated net
profit (loss) and adds back unrealized foreign exchange, provision for taxes, fixed charges,
depletion, and various other non-recurring expenses and charges). Both fixed charges and
consolidated cash flow are non-GAAP measures.  For the trailing twelve months ended June
30, 2016, fixed charges were $48.7 million and consolidated cash flow was $148.5 million.
As at June 30, 2016, total outstanding letters of credit were $6.5 million which reduced the
amount otherwise available to be drawn under the Credit Facilities. As a result of the Alder
Flats Plant Sale subsequent to June 30, 2016, total outstanding letters of credit will be $13.1
million.
Convertible Debentures
On July 19, 2016, Bellatrix entered into an agreement with the Underwriters pursuant to which
the Underwriters agreed to purchase on a bought deal basis $50 million principal amount of
Debentures at a price of $1,000 per Debenture. The offering for the Debentures closed on
August 9, 2016. The Debentures are governed by the terms of an indenture dated August 9,
2016 between the Company and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the “Indenture”),
which has been filed with Canadian and US securities regulatory authorities and may be
accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com), through the SEC website
(www.sec.gov). The Debentures bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum, payable
semiannually in arrears on September 30 and March 31 of each year commencing September
30, 2016. The first interest payment payable on September 30, 2016 will represent interest
accrued for the period from August 9, 2016 up to, but excluding, September 30, 2016.
Following completion of the Alder Flats Plant Sale the maturity date of the Debentures was
extended to September 30, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”). Each $1,000 principal amount of
Debenture is convertible at the option of the holder into approximately 617.2840 common
shares of Bellatrix (representing a conversion price of $1.62) prior to 5:00 p.m. (Calgary time)
on the earlier of: (i) the last business day immediately prior to the Maturity Date, (ii) the last
business day immediately preceding any Redemption Date at the Conversion Price (as those
terms are defined in the Indenture), and (iii) if called for repurchase pursuant to a mandatory
repurchase as a result of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture). The Debentures
are not redeemable prior to September 30, 2019, except in limited circumstances following a
Change of Control. On and after September 30, 2019 and up to and including September 30,
2020, the Debentures may be redeemed in whole or in part from time to time at the Company’s
option, on not more than 60 days’ and not less than 30 days’ prior written notice, at a price
equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that the volume
weighted average trading price of the common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the
20 consecutive trading days preceding the date on which the notice of redemption is given is
not less than 125% of the conversion price. On or after September 30, 2020 and prior to the
Maturity Date, the Debentures may be redeemed in whole or in part from time to time at the
Company’s option, on not more than 60 days, at a price equal to their principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest. The Debentures are direct, subordinated unsecured obligations
of the Company, subordinated to the Credit Facilities, the Senior Notes and any other senior
indebtedness.
34
On a redemption date or on the Maturity Date, as applicable, subject to required regulatory
approvals and provided that no Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) has occurred
and is continuing, Bellatrix may, at our option, on not more than 60 days' and not less than 40
days' prior notice, elect to satisfy our obligation to repay, in whole or in part, the principal
amount of the Debentures which are to be redeemed or which will mature by issuing and
delivering freely tradeable common shares of the Company to the holders of the Debentures.
Payment for such Debentures subject to the election would be satisfied by delivering that
number of common shares obtained by dividing the principal amount of the Debentures
subject to the election which are to be redeemed or which will mature by 95% of the current
market price of the common shares on such redemption date or Maturity Date, as applicable.
Any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid in cash.
Bellatrix currently has commitments associated with the Credit Facilities outlined above and
the commitments outlined under the “Commitments” section.
COMMITMENTS
As at June 30, 2016, Bellatrix committed to drill 2 gross (1.0 net) wells pursuant to farm-in
agreements. Bellatrix expects to satisfy these drilling commitments at an estimated net cost of
approximately $3.4 million.
Bellatrix also has certain drilling commitments relating to the Grafton Joint Venture. In meeting
the drilling commitments under these agreements, Bellatrix will satisfy some of the drilling
commitments under the joint operating agreement described above.
As at June 30, 2016, commitments under the Grafton Joint Venture are as follows:

pursuant to the Grafton Joint Venture.
(2) During April 2014, Grafton elected to exercise an option to increase committed capital
investment to the Grafton Joint Venture established during 2013 by an additional $50 million,
for a total commitment of $250 million. The funding period of the Grafton Joint Venture was
extended to the third anniversary (June 26, 2016) of the program’s effective date for wells
relating to the exercised option. All other terms and conditions of the commitment increase are
the same as the previously announced Grafton Joint Venture.
(3) During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the funding period of the Grafton Joint Venture
amended agreement for the wells relating to the exercised option was extended to December
31, 2016 (from June 26, 2016).
During the first half of 2016, Bellatrix and Grafton agreed to extend the funding period for the
remaining commitments under the Grafton Joint Venture to December 31, 2016 (from June 26,
2016) thereby providing additional operational flexibility for development drilling activity during
the calendar 2016 year. Bellatrix and Grafton expect to fulfill all of the spending commitments
under the Grafton Joint Venture in 2016.
35
Bellatrix and CNOR, a non-operated oil and gas company managed by Grafton Asset
Management Inc., formed the CNOR Joint Venture in 2014. Through the joint venture, CNOR
has committed $250 million in capital towards future accelerated development of a portion of
Bellatrix's undeveloped land holdings. On September 1, 2015, the parties amended the terms
of the CNOR Joint venture to extend the funding period to December 31, 2019 as a result
Bellatrix is now required to propose a joint development plan on or before October 1, 2016,
with the expectation that the funds will be primarily spent between the years 2017 through
2019. Bellatrix is not currently subject to any formal well or cost commitments in relation to the
CNOR Joint Venture.

(1) Includes $0.8 million of accrued interest payable in relation to the bank credit facilities and
$3.5 million related to interest on the Senior Notes is included in Accounts Payable and
Accrued Liabilities.
(2) Bank debt is based on a three year facility, fully revolving until maturity, and extendable
annually at the Company’s option (subject to lender approval), provided that the term after any
extension would not be more than three years. Interest due on the Credit Facilities is
calculated based upon floating rates. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed its
semi-annual borrowing base redetermination and the renewal of its Credit Facilities. The total
commitments under the Credit Facilities have been set at $365 million and are comprised of a
$210 million Revolving Facility and a $155 million Term Facility. Following completion of the
Alder Flats Plant Sale and the Offerings and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, the
Revolving Facility has been reduced to $160 million and the amount outstanding under the
Term Facility has been reduced to approximately $13 million. The maturity date of the
Revolving Facility has been extended to July 1, 2017, and may be further extended for a period
not to exceed 3 years, and the maturity date of the Term Facility has been set at November 11,
2016.
(3) Senior Notes mature on May 15, 2020, but may be redeemed by Bellatrix at any time on or
after May 15, 2017 at specific redemption prices.
(4) Amounts represent the inflated, discounted future abandonment and reclamation
expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the life of the Company’s properties (between
2017 and 2065).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has certain fixed-term lease agreements, primarily compressor and office space
leases, which were entered into in the normal course of operations. During the three months
period ending June 30, 2016, Bellatrix completed a sales leaseback of certain production
facilities to a third party midstream company for proceeds of $75 million pursuant to the
Facilities Monetization transaction. Bellatrix maintains operatorship and preferential access to
the facilities for its operated production volumes and retains, at its sole discretion, the option
to repurchase the facilities at any time during the agreement period. Pursuant to the
agreement, Bellatrix will pay a nominal annual rental fee over the duration of the eight year
term of the agreement. All leases have been treated as operating leases whereby the lease
payments are included in operating expenses or G&A expenses depending on the nature of
the lease. The lease agreements for office space do not currently provide for early termination.
No asset or liability value has been assigned to these leases in the balance sheet as of June
30, 2016.
BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND 2016 OUTLOOK
In response to unsustainably low natural gas prices forecast through the summer and into the
fall, Bellatrix has phased its second half 2016 development plans and on-stream delivery of
new Spirit River wells to coincide with stronger forecast pricing later in the year. By delaying
the on-stream delivery of new flush natural gas production to the latter part of 2016, Bellatrix
plans to maximize the rate of return of the second half 2016 capital program. Production
volumes are anticipated to wane through the third quarter before regaining a growth trajectory
through the fourth quarter. Additionally, the deferral of on-stream activity to late 2016 is
expected to position Bellatrix favourably to capitalize on a much stronger natural gas pricing
environment in 2017.
36
The majority of the Company's second half capital budget is expected to be invested directly
in drilling, completion and tie-in activity with approximately 19% of total expenditures invested
in facilities and infrastructure, including approximately $7 million invested into Phase 2 of the
Bellatrix Alder Flats Plant a portion of such expenditures represent a portion of the
prepayment made by Keyera related to Phase 2, pursuant to the Alder Flats Plant Sale.
Preliminary second half 2016 production expenditure guidance of $9.10/boe reflects the impact
from both the $75 million Facilities Monetization and the Alder Flats Plant Sale. Bellatrix
expects that upon completion of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant, production expenditures will
realize a favourable step change reduction given the incremental 30 MMcf/d ownership
capacity net to Bellatrix’s 25% working interest.

Bellatrix continues to proactively manage its business through this protracted commodity
price cycle and has completed several strategic measures to ensure the Company maintains
adequate liquidity and flexibility, while preserving the core asset base and long term value
platform of the Company. To that end, management has had to make difficult decisions on how
to most effectively reduce outstanding debt and the potentially increasing level of constraint
that outstanding debt could have on the business. Management spent a significant amount of
effort analyzing and scrutinizing the impact and effect of all of its potential deleveraging
options. We believe that the measures undertaken to date have achieved an optimal outcome
of materially reducing outstanding debt while preserving ownership of the core foundational
asset base of the Company. While we recognize the short term impact some of the measures
have taken on a per share basis, the long term value and profitable growth platform of the
Company remains largely intact.
With significantly enhanced capital resources, Bellatrix intends on maintaining its strategic
focus on investment in the Spirit River liquids-rich natural gas play. Bellatrix has firmly
positioned itself to proactively accelerate capital investment decisions into a firmer pricing
environment, providing enhanced benefits to shareholders over the near to medium term. With
improved capital resources and a significant reduction in debt, ample firm service capacity,
firmer natural gas prices and a significant inventory of high rate of return drilling locations in
the low cost Spirit River play, Bellatrix is focused on delivering accretive and profitable growth
for shareholders. The Company anticipates growth momentum will begin through the end of
2016 as evidenced by our December average production guidance relative to volume
expectations in the second half of the year.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The reader is advised that the critical accounting estimates, policies, and practices described
in the Company’s MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2015 continue to be critical in
determining Bellatrix’s unaudited financial results as of June 30, 2016. There were no changes
in accounting policies during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
A summary of future accounting pronouncements is found in the Company’s MD&A for the
year ended December 31, 2015. A copy of the Company’s MD&A for the year ended December
31, 2015 is available at www.sedar.com or as part of the Company’s annual report on Form 40-

The Company is involved in various claims and litigation arising in the normal course of
business. While the outcome of these matters is uncertain and there can be no assurance that
such matters will be resolved in the Company’s favor, the Company does not currently believe
that the outcome of adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding related to
these and other matters or any amount which it may be required to pay by reason thereof
would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations.
The Company reviews legal, environmental remediation and other contingent matters to both
determine whether a loss is probable based on judgment and interpretation of laws and
regulations and determine that the loss can reasonably be estimated. When the loss is
determined, it is charged to earnings. The Company’s management monitors known and
potential contingent matters and make appropriate provisions by charges to earnings when
warranted by the circumstances.
With the above risks and uncertainties the reader is cautioned that future events and results
may vary substantially from that which Bellatrix currently foresees.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance
and Chief Financial Officer have designed, or caused to be designed under their supervision,
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a) - 15(e) and  15d – 15(e) under
the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and
National Instrument 52-109, Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings
(“NI 52-109”)) to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) material information relating to the
Company is made known to the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and
Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer by others, particularly during the
period in which the annual and interim filings are being prepared; and (ii) information required
to be disclosed by the Company in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or
submitted by it under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time period specified in securities legislation.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance
and Chief Financial Officer have designed, or caused to be designed under their supervision,
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13(a) – 15(f) and 15(d) – 15(f) under
the Exchange Act and NI 52-109) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP.
The Company is required to disclose any changes herein in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the period April 1, 2016 and ended on June 30,
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria described in “Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. No material changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting were identified during such period that has materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
It should be noted that a control system, including the Company’s disclosure and internal
controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived, can provide only reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met and it should not be
expected that the disclosure and internal controls and procedures will prevent all errors or
fraud.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The table below shows sensitivities to funds flow from operations as a result of product price,
exchange rate, and interest rate changes. This is based on actual average prices received for
the second quarter of 2016 and average production volumes of 38,000 boe/d during that
period, as well as the same level of debt outstanding as at June 30, 2016. Diluted weighted
average shares are based upon the second quarter of 2016. These sensitivities are
approximations only, and not necessarily valid under other significantly different production
levels or product mixes. Commodity price risk management activities can significantly affect
these sensitivities. Changes in any of these parameters will affect funds flow as shown in the
table below:

(1) The term “funds flow from operations” should not be considered an alternative to, or more
meaningful than cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP
as an indicator of the Company’s performance. Therefore reference to non-GAAP measures of
funds flow from operations or funds flow from operations per diluted share may not be
comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. Management uses funds
flow from operations to analyze operating performance and leverage and considers funds flow
from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the
cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt. The reconciliation
between cash flow from operating activities and funds flow from operations can be found
elsewhere herein. Funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the weighted
average number of common shares for the period.
(2) Commodity price risk management activities are excluded from funds flow from operations
sensitivity calculations.

In the second quarter of 2016 Bellatrix reduced outstanding bank debt and working capital by
approximately $77.3 million (or 19%) from the first quarter of 2016 through the use of proceeds
from the Facilities Monetization transaction for proceeds of $75 million. The Company incurred
$7.8 million of total cash capital expenditures in the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to $37.5 million in the comparative 2015 period. Bellatrix focused its capital activity
in the second quarter primarily on facilities and equipment expenditures related to the
development of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant. The decrease in capital expenditures was due
to Bellatrix proactively curtailing development drilling activity in the quarter in response to
significantly depressed natural gas prices. The decrease in capital activity for the three months
ended June 30, 2016, has coincided with a 6% decrease in sales volumes to 38,000 boe/d from
40,426 boe/d realized in the second quarter of 2015.
40
Bellatrix’s first quarter 2016 results were impacted by a weak global commodity price
environment which continued from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2016.
Total net debt was reduced in the quarter by $3.8 million. In the three months ended March 31,
2016, the Company incurred $28.9 million of net cash capital expenditures, compared to $83.2
million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily attributable
to the decrease in facilities and equipment spending period over period in relation to the Alder
Flats Plant which was commissioned in the second quarter of 2015. The Company drilled 10
gross (5.7 net) wells, compared to 6 gross (3.2 net) wells in the same period of 2015. Sales
volumes decreased 13% to 38,467 boe/d from 44,408 boe/d realized in the first quarter of 2015,
the decrease was due to a significant number of wells being tied-in during the first quarter of
2015 relating to the fourth quarter 2014 drilling program and a decrease in drilling activity
throughout 2015 and into 2016 due to continued depressed commodity prices. The
Company’s total revenue generated in the quarter ending March 31, 2016, decreased 39% to
$55.2 million from $90.2 million in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the continued, weak
global commodity price environment.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, Bellatrix reduced outstanding bank debt and working capital
deficiency by approximately $17 million (or 4%) from the third quarter of 2015 through the use
of proceeds from a minor disposition of facility equipment and cash flow in excess of
expenditures. Bellatrix continued to realize reductions in production expenses in the quarter
as a result of the Alder Flats Plant, production expenses decreased 7% to $6.87/boe in the
fourth quarter of 2015 from $7.38/boe in the third quarter of 2015. In the three months ended
December 31, 2015, the Company incurred $12.1 million of net cash capital expenditures,
compared to $232.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, $149 million of the fourth quarter of
2014 capital expenditures related to property acquisitions, and drilled and/or participated in 5
gross (2.3 net) wells, compared to 12 gross (7.1 net) wells in the same period in 2014. Sales
volumes decreased 5% to 40,705 boe/d from 42,945 boe/d realized in the fourth quarter of 2014,
the decrease was due to significant number of wells being tied-in during the fourth quarter of
2014 relating to the third quarter of 2014 drilling program and a decrease in drilling activity in
2015 due to depressed commodity prices. The Company’s total revenue generated in the
quarter ending December 31, 2015, decreased 45% to $72.1 million from $130.1 million in the
fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of a continued, overall weak global commodity price
environment.
In the third quarter of 2015, Bellatrix reduced outstanding bank debt and working capital
deficiency by $14.7 million from the second quarter of 2015. Bellatrix realized its first full
quarter of contribution from the Alder Flats Plant which resulted in production expense
decreases of 14% to $7.38/boe in the third quarter of 2015 from $8.58/boe in the second quarter
of 2015. In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $11.3 million of
net cash capital expenditures, compared to $167.8 million in the third quarter of 2014, and
drilled and/or participated in 12 gross (5.4 net) wells, compared to 35 gross (17.5 net) wells in
the same period in 2014. Sales volumes increased 6% to 40,277 boe/d from 37,838 boe/d
realized in the third quarter of 2014. The Company’s total revenue generated in the quarter
ending September 30, 2015, decreased 40% to $82.1 million compared to $137.4 million in the
third quarter of 2014.
During the second quarter of 2015, Bellatrix successfully completed Phase 1 of the Alder Flats
Plant. In addition, Bellatrix closed a private offering of US$250 million of 8.50% Senior Notes
maturing in 2020 during the second quarter 2015. In the three months ended June 30, 2015, the
Company incurred $37.7 million of net cash capital expenditures, compared to $126.0 million in
the second quarter of 2014, and drilled and/or participated in 4 gross (2.8 net) wells, compared
to 19 gross (9.0 net) wells in the same period in 2014. Bellatrix achieved sales volumes of
40,426 boe/d, an 11% increase from 36,342 boe/d realized in the second quarter of 2014.
Bellatrix’s total revenue generated in the second quarter of 2015 was impacted by the overall
weak global commodity price environment, resulting in a decrease of 42% to $88.9 million
compared to $152.3 million in the second quarter of 2014.
Bellatrix’s first quarter 2015 results were impacted by a weak global commodity price
environment which continued from the fourth quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015.
The negative impacts of the first quarter 2015 pricing environment were partially offset by a
27% increase in production over the first quarter of 2014, which resulted from the success of
Bellatrix’s first quarter 2015 drilling program and Bellatrix’s ongoing successful drilling activity
in the Cardium and Spirit River resource plays throughout 2014.
