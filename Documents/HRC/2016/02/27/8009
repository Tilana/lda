<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 20 to 29 August 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, Najat Maalla M&#8217;jid, undertook an official visit to 
Guatemala at the invitation of the Government. The mission is the second to the country 
under the mandate; the previous mandate holder visited in 1999.  
</p>
<p>2. In Guatemala City, the Special Rapporteur met with the Vice-President, the First 
Lady, in her capacity as the head of the Social Works Secretariat of the First Lady (SOSEP) 
and the Social Welfare Secretariat of the Presidency (SBS). She held meetings with 
representatives of the National Adoption Council, National Commission on Children and 
Adolescents, Secretariat against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons 
(SVET), Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights (Procuradur&#237;a de los Derechos 
Humanos), National Civil Police (NCP), Ministry of the Interior (Ministerio de 
Gobernaci&#243;n), National Council for Migrants (CONAMIGUA), Ministry of Education, 
Ministry of Labour and Social Security, Presidential Commission on Human Rights 
(COPREDEH), Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (Ministerio P&#250;blico), Attorney General&#8217;s Office 
(Fiscal&#237;a General), Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Congress. She also engaged with 
members of the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Justice, Solicitor General&#8217;s Office 
(Procuradur&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n) and Children&#8217;s Parliament, judges for children and 
adolescents, the Guatemala Chamber of Tourism (CAMTUR), the Guatemalan Tourism 
Institute (INGUAT) and a company that provides Internet services. 
</p>
<p>3. In Solol&#225;, Cob&#225;n, Coatepeque, Tec&#250;n Um&#225;n and Escuintla, the Special Rapporteur 
also met with governors, mayors and police commissioners, representatives of the Office of 
the Ombudsman for Human Rights (hereinafter the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office), the Municipal 
Office of Child Protection, the Board of Directors of the Child and Adolescent Protection 
Network and the Juan Jos&#233; Ortega Regional Hospital, and judges for children and youth and 
civil society organizations (CSOs). </p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited centres and institutions for vulnerable children, 
including the Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asunci&#243;n, run by SBS, and centres run by non-
governmental organizations, such as El Refugio de la Ni&#241;ez, La Alianza, Casa de Migrantes 
and Casa de la Mujer. She also visited the child-friendly services within the Centro 
Metropolitano de Justicia of the Supreme Court. The Special Rapporteur was particularly 
grateful to have met and interacted with children and victims in those centres.  
</p><p>5. The Special Rapporteur also met with other members and networks of civil society 
and representatives of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), and the international community.  
6. The objectives of the visit were to explore the incidence of, trends in and root causes 
of sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in Guatemala and to examine 
the initiatives and measures taken by the Government and civil society to combat and 
prevent these phenomena, as well as the child protection system in general. 
7. The Special Rapporteur expresses her sincere appreciation to the Government, and 
in particular COPREDEH, for the indispensable support it provided in planning and 
coordinating the visit. She further thanks the CSOs and the United Nations Country Team 
for engaging with her on ongoing child protection issues and programmes in the country, 
and particularly the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) for their valuable assistance and support before, during 
and after her mission. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.1

</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p>8. Guatemala is a constitutional democratic republic; the President is both Head of 
State and Head of Government. Guatemala is divided into 22 departments, further 
subdivided into 334 municipalities. With just under 14.1 million inhabitants, Guatemala is 
the most populous country in Central America. Social development indicators, such as 
infant mortality, chronic child malnutrition and illiteracy remain below the average for the 
region, and Guatemala ranks 131st on the human development index.1 A total of 48.3 per 
cent of the population of Guatemala is below the age of 18.2 Over 59 per cent of all children 
and adolescents live in poverty, and 19.2 per cent are extremely poor. Chronic malnutrition 
affects 49.8 per cent of children under five&#8212;65.9 per cent in indigenous areas.3 Persistent 
structural patterns of discrimination against indigenous peoples, who represent 60 per cent 
of the population, contribute to difficult access to social services.4 Literacy rates show a 
significant disparity between indigenous (59.6 per cent) and non-indigenous (83.4 per cent) 
populations.5 
</p>
<p>9. High rates of violence and impunity linked to organized crime and the weakness of 
public institutions generate mistrust, despair and insecurity among the population.6 
According to the NCP, from 1 January to 31 August 2011, there were 3,806 violent deaths, 
including 448 women and 295 children; 4,162 people were injured in violent attacks, and 
34 deaths and 15 injuries resulted from lynching.7 Of these violent deaths, 82 per cent were 
caused by firearms; under the legal framework and its interpretation by the Constitutional 
Court, there is no limit on the number of arms a person can possess, and the possession of 
arms and ammunitions is inadequately controlled.8 
</p>
<p>10. Geographically, the State&#8217;s porous border with Mexico and its location along the 
migration corridor from Central America to the United States of America contribute to the 
trafficking of arms, drugs and persons. Moreover, the size and mountainous terrain of 
Guatemala renders accessibility difficult and furthers inequalities between the capital and 
departments. The national economy has been affected by natural disasters, including 
hurricanes, droughts and flooding.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional human rights instruments  
</b></p>
<p>11. Guatemala is a party to: the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional 
Protocols thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and on 
the involvement of children in armed conflict; the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the International Covenant on

<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the first Optional Protocol thereto; the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol; the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional 
Protocol thereto; the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. It has also ratified the Protocol 
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; the Hague Convention on Protection of 
Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (hereinafter the Hague 
Convention); and International Labour Organization Conventions No. 138 (1973) 
concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and No. 182 (1999) concerning 
the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour. 
</p>
<p>12. Guatemala is not a party to, inter alia, the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (signature only, 2009) or the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances 
(signature only, 2007). 
</p>
<p>13. At the regional level, Guatemala is a member of the Organization of American 
States and has ratified the American Convention on Human Rights and the Inter-American 
Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women. It 
has yet to ratify the Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Situation analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography  
</b></p>
<p>14. The exact scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in 
Guatemala is difficult to measure. Crimes are underreported due to fear of reprisals, limited 
knowledge of laws, social tolerance for certain practices, discrimination against girls and 
indigenous people, organized crime networks, absence of confidence in judiciary and police 
systems, weakness of control mechanisms for high-risk areas, such as cyber caf&#233;s, brothels 
and &#8213;markets&#8214;, blind spots on borders and the limited number of accessible complaints and 
reporting mechanisms. Another obstacle is the absence of a harmonized methodology for 
gathering and processing data to identify the actual extent of these offences in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>15. Guatemala is a source, transit and destination country for children who are subjected 
to sex trafficking and forced labour; for example, in Guatemala, as well as in Mexico and 
the United States, children from Guatemala and other Central American countries are found 
in commercial sexual exploitation, and Guatemalan children have been subjected to forced 
labour in the agriculture and garment industries.9 Organized crime networks and gangs also 
recruit destitute children to commit illicit acts, sometimes using force or coercion. 
</p><p>16. Prior to the 2007 Adoption Act, sale of children for international adoption was a 
main issue. Since the implementation of this act, which is a positive step in controlling the 
adoption process, efforts have been made by the Government to reduce the number of 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>illegal adoptions; however irregularities remain. In its 2010 report, UNICEF highlighted 
that at least 70 per cent of international adoptions may be linked to crimes or serious 
irregularities.10 According to CICIG, problems such as corruption and impunity of State 
actors involved in the process, particularly notaries, judges for children and adolescents, 
medical professionals and vital statistics registrar officials, and lack of proper investigation 
by an understaffed Solicitor General&#8217;s Office persisted. This is reflected in the fact that 
while irregularities were found in about 60 per cent of the cases handled during the 
transition period; the Solicitor General&#8217;s Office ruled that the adoption could proceed in 
</p>
<p>over 90 per cent of the cases.11 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the fate of Guatemalan children whose 
international adoptions, initiated prior to the enactment of the Adoption Act, are pending; 
about 80 cases are still under investigation. In the meantime, those children stay in shelters 
or with foster families who are sometimes their soon-to be adoptive foreign families. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>18. While the prevalence of child prostitution in Guatemala is not known, a 2010 study 
by ECPAT identified prostitution of underage boys as the most prevalent type of 
commercial sexual exploitation of males in the municipalities of Guatemala and Ayutla.12 
In the 35 locations in Guatemala City and Ayutla where such practices have been identified, 
the number of underage male prostitutes is twice that of adult male prostitutes. The number 
of underage homosexual prostitutes is also double that of their adult male counterparts, and 
between 20 and 25 boys are engaged in transsexual prostitution.13 
</p><p>19. Most child prostitutes are poor migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, 
on their way to the United States.14 Most victims of sexual exploitation are between the 
ages of 15 and 17; however there are cases of boys as young as 5 years old forced to engage 
in sexual stimulation of men.15 
</p>
<p>20. While cases of child prostitution are not systematically denounced, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that even where such denunciations occurred, the slowness and 
weakness of investigations, impunity and corruption enabled brothel owners to receive 
warnings ahead of raids and hide the children. 
</p><p>21. The Special Rapporteur visited places licensed as &#8213;small markets&#8214; where, in the 
back, child prostitution took place. According to information she received, the real use of 
these places is a matter of public knowledge, yet authorities issue or renew such licenses 
regularly.  
22. As regards child sex tourism, it is prevalent in certain areas, such as Antigua, Puerto 
Barrios, R&#237;o Dulce, around Lake Atitl&#225;n and Tec&#250;n Um&#225;n. Child sex tourists predominately 
come from Canada, Germany, Spain and the United States.16 Child pornography and 
commercial sexual exploitation are often promoted and included as part of tourism 
packages.17

</b></p>
<p>23. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was concerned to learn of cases in which 
foreigners implicated in the sexual exploitation of children had fled the country after being 
released on bail. She notes the dismissal of several court cases due to the absence of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction between the perpetrator&#8217;s State and Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, pornography involving children has been 
reported in the regions of Huehuetenango, Jutiapa, Retalhuleu and Guatemala, among 
others.18  
</p>
<p>25. The majority of underage victims are recruited as masseurs or masseuses through 
advertisements in newspapers. Pornographic pictures and videos featuring these children 
are then taken and posted on the Internet or distributed/sold by the children to their clients.  
</p><p>26. The Special Rapporteur learned that, of 524 child pornography-related complaints 
received by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office between 2009 and 2012, 61 judicial proceedings 
were opened and 10 convictions were made.19 She was encouraged to learn that action was 
being taken; for example, 700 pornographic videos featuring adolescents were seized by the 
Court for Children and Adolescents in Coatepeque,20 and an anti-human trafficking unit has 
been created within the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, with a mandate, inter alia, to investigate 
</p>
<p>child pornography (see para. 59). 
</p>
<p>27. Underlying factors of the sale and sexual exploitation of children are 
multidimensional and linked to the political, institutional, legislative, socioeconomic and 
cultural context. They include poverty; unemployment; unequal access to social services; 
insecurity; vulnerable and dysfunctional families; social tolerance for certain practices; 
gender discrimination; violence and impunity; regular and irregular migration; and 
transnational organized crime/trafficking networks. The growing tourism industry and 
market for the sex industry, easy access to information and communications technologies 
and demand for international adoption are also underlying factors. 
</p>
<p>28. The high rate of pregnancies among girls between 10 and 14 years old, most due to 
intrafamily sexual violence and lack of access to sexual education (A/HRC/19/21/Add.1, 
para. 50), is another challenge. For instance, in the Verapaces region 1,657 early 
pregnancies were registered in 2011.21 An estimated 35 per cent of the population practices 
early marriage and 18 per cent of girls between 15 and 19 are married or in a civil union.22 
In the Verapaces region, 983 marriages of girls aged between 10 and 17 years alleged to 
have resulted from post-rape negotiation were recorded between January and July 2012.23  
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal and regulatory framework  
</b></p>
<p>29. Guatemala has an adequate legal framework for the protection of children. The 
Constitution describes the family as the bedrock of society and guarantees its social, 
economic and legal protection (art. 47). It recognizes the equality of all children before the

<p>law (art. 50) and forbids the employment of children less than 14 years of age subject to 
exceptions provided by law (art. 102).  
</p>
<p>30. In addition, the legal framework for the promotion and protection of child rights 
consists of some 22 recently promulgated pieces of legislation and regulations that 
complete and amend the penal and civil codes and procedures.24 The main ones are the Act 
on the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents (PINA Act, 2003) which 
provides for the protection of children and adolescents from physical, sexual and emotional 
abuse; the Adoption Act (2007), which addresses irregular international adoptions with 
reference to the Hague Convention, in accordance with the best interest of the child and 
prioritizing placement of children with their family and national adoption before 
considering international adoption; the Organized Crime Act (2008), which criminalizes 
organized crime and provides measures to prevent, combat and eradicate it; and the Act 
against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against Women (2008), which is aimed at 
eradicating physical, psychological, sexual, economic and any other type of violence 
against women. The Act against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Human Trafficking 
addresses these crimes by empowering victims and increasing criminalization and 
punishments; the Alba-Keneth Alert System Act (2010) regulates joint urgent actions 
among public institutions to locate, recover and protect children from disappearance and 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Penal Code25 considers the sale of persons as a form of trafficking carrying an 
imprisonment of 8 to 18 years and a fine of 300,000 to 500,000 quetzales.26  
</p><p>32. As regards the minimum age for marriage, the Civil Code establishes it at 18 years. 
Nevertheless boys over 16 and girls over 14 can be married with the authorization of both 
their parents, their guardian or a judge.27  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>33. Paid sexual activities with minors are criminalized by prison terms of 5 to 8 years.28 
Anyone who facilitates, organizes, promotes or allows the use of tourism for the 
commercial sexual exploitation is liable to imprisonment for 6 to 10 years and a fine of 
100,000 to 500,000 quetzales.29 The punishment increases by up to two thirds if the victim 
is between 14 and 18 years of age and by up to three quarters if the victim is under 14 years 
of age; it doubles if the victim is under 10 years.30 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>34. The production, manufacturing or elaboration of pornographic material with images 
and voices of minors engaged in pornographic or erotic activity is criminalized by 
imprisonment for 6 to 10 years and a fine of 50,000 to 300,000 quetzales.31 Publication, 
reproduction, import, export, distribution, transportation, exhibition and dissemination of

<p>such pornographic material are criminalized by imprisonment for six to eight years and a 
fine of 50,000 to 500,000 quetzales.32 Article 195 ter further proscribes the possession of 
pornographic material involving minors, which is punishable by imprisonment for two to 
four years. 
</p><p>35. Anyone who allows children under the age of 18 to attend or have access to a show 
of a sexual nature or who disseminates pornographic material is liable to imprisonment for 
three to five years.33 The punishment increases accordingly if victims are under 18, 14 or 10 
years old34 (see para. 33). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Trafficking of children 
</b></p>
<p>36. The crime of trafficking in persons includes exploitation for the purpose of 
prostitution, other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, any kind of 
labour exploitation, begging, any form of slavery, servitude, sale of persons, extraction and 
trafficking of human organs and tissue, illegal adoption, irregular adoption proceedings, 
pornography, forced pregnancy and forced or servile marriage. Trafficking in persons is 
punishable by imprisonment for 8 to 18 years and a fine of 300,000 to 500,000 quetzales.35 
</p><p>37. The recruitment of minors by organized criminal groups for the purpose of 
exploitation is also considered trafficking and carries the same punishment as above. When 
victims are under 18 years of age, the penalty increases by one third.36  
38. Anyone who, for himself or for others, in exchange for the exploitation activities 
referred to under the crime of trafficking, provides or promises to a third party an economic 
benefit or any other kind of benefit, is liable to imprisonment for six to eight years. If the 
remuneration is promised in exchange for exploitation activities of a person under 14 years 
of age, the punishment increases by up to two thirds; if the victim is under 10 years of age, 
the punishment is doubled.37

which impedes their access to education.38 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Transfer or removal of organs of children for profit 
</b></p>
<p>40. The recruitment, transportation, transfer, retention, harbouring or receipt of a person 
for the purpose of extracting and trafficking human organs and tissue is considered a form 
of trafficking in persons and thus punishable by imprisonment for 8 to 18 years and a fine 
of 300,000 to 500,000 quetzales.39 (See para. 38 above.)  
41. Anyone who participates in illegal activities relating to the extraction, harbour,

</b></p>
<p>42. Anyone who, for the purpose of adopting a child, gives or promises him/her or a 
third party an economic benefit or any other kind of benefit, regardless of whether he 
achieves the purpose or not, is liable to imprisonment for three to five years and a fine of 
20,000 to 100,000 quetzales. 41 
</p><p>43. Any government employee who knowingly expedites, authorizes or registers an 
adoption, falsifies documents or records or in any way alters the information about the 
parents of a child or any other information required by law is liable to imprisonment for 6 
to 10 years and a fine of 50,000 to 100,000 quetzales.42 
44. Mandatory HIV/AIDS testing of both the adopter and the child is one of the 
requirements laid down under the Regulations for the Adoption Act (art. 42). In addition to 
limiting the adoption process of persons living with HIV/AIDS, this regulation also 
contradicts the HIV Act (art. 20), which does not provide for mandatory HIV/AIDS testing 
for adoption, the Constitution and international human rights instruments.43 A revised draft 
law on HIV/AIDS is also under consideration.44 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Sexual abuse and sexual exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>45. State protection of children from physical, sexual and emotional abuse or negligent 
treatment, through legislative, administrative, social and educational measures is provided 
for in the PINA Act (art. 54).  
</p><p>46. The PINA Act (art. 56) also guarantees the right of children and adolescents to be 
protected from any form of exploitation or sexual abuse, including inducement to engage in 
any sexual activity; use in prostitution, entertainment or pornographic material; sexual 
promiscuity; and sexual harassment by teachers, guardians and other authority figures.  
47. Anyone who, with physical or psychological violence, has vaginal, anal or oral 
intercourse with someone else, or introduces an object or any part of his/her body into any 
of the aforementioned orifices, or forces another person to insert them himself or herself, is 
punished with imprisonment of 8 to 12 years. These acts are considered statutory rape when 
the victim is under 14 years of age, even if there is no evidence of physical or psychological 
violence.45 The punishment increases accordingly if the victim is under 18, 14 or 10 years 
of age (see para. 33).46  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Abduction and abandonment of children  
</b></p>
<p>48. The abduction of children from their parents, guardians or caregivers is criminalized, 
with imprisonment ranging from six months to 12 years depending on the age of the 
victims, the consent of children older than 12, and their family link to the abductor.47 
</p><p>49. The Alba-Keneth Alert System Act stipulates that the search of a missing child must 
begin within the six hours after the abduction, kidnapping, disappearance or trafficking is 
reported.48

<p>50. The protection of abandoned or orphaned children is considered a matter of national 
interest (art. 54 of the Constitution); the abandonment of a child under the age of 10 or a 
child living with disabilities by his parents or his caregivers is criminalized with 
imprisonment for 6 months to 10 years, depending on the gravity of the harm to the child.49 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Juvenile justice  
</b></p>
<p>51. The penal code and procedures of Guatemala have been amended (see para. 30) to 
further strengthen the protection of children whose rights have been violated and those in 
conflict with the law. Courts and specialized branches of the judiciary, the Offices of the 
Public Prosecutor and the Solicitor General, and the NCP have further been reinforced, 
including with separate sections for children, as has the social reintegration programme for 
such children. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>52. The child protection system of Guatemala is complex and involves numerous actors, 
including SVET, under the Vice-President, which is mandated to coordinate the efforts of 
various State institutions in the area of prevention, prosecution and punishment of these 
crimes.50 
</p><p>53. Assisting children and women victims of sexual exploitation and violence is part of 
the mandate of the SBS,51 which is in charge of formulating, coordinating and executing 
public policies on the comprehensive protection of children and contributing to the welfare 
of the family and the community. It is also responsible for carrying out all actions relating 
to the application of the punishments and protective measures for children in conflict with 
the law envisaged under the PINA Act (art. 259). It runs centres for vulnerable children, for 
street children and for migrants.52 
54. As regards adoption, the National Adoption Council protects children who are in the 
process of adoption, in accordance with their best interest and by prioritizing national 
adoptions, assigning adequate families, maintaining updated information, and authorizing 
shelters for children and monitoring the conditions thereof. Established in accordance with 
the Hague Convention, the Council has a Board of Directors composed of representatives 
of the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure that the procedures are 
legal and transparent.53 It is important to build the capacity of the National Adoption 
Council through adequate administrative, policy and financial measures. Prior to the entry 
into force of the Adoption Act, the adoption process was reviewed by the Solicitor 
General&#8217;s Office, which studied the documentation and issued favourable opinions in the 
adoptions processed by notaries. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the establishment of 
two inter-institutional technical roundtables in charge of verifying the adoption processes. 
</p>
<p>55. With regard to child employment, the Unit for the Protection of Working 
Adolescents, under the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, executes projects and 
programmes relating to the protection of working adolescents in coordination with the

<p>National Commission on Children and Adolescents. The Ministry also allocates the budget 
for programmes focusing on children as per the PINA Act.  
</p>
<p>56. Other ministries, including the Ministry of Education, sensitize children about the 
dangers of trafficking in persons by incorporating the issues into school curricula. The 
newly established Ministry of Social Development aims to improve the welfare of 
vulnerable social groups by generating opportunities and capabilities.54 
</p>
<p>57. The Social Works Secretariat of the First Lady also promotes and supports actions in 
the areas of education, health and community development, for the benefit of, among 
others, children under 6 years of age.55 It provides care for at-risk children, including street 
children, and promotes equity in education and health.56 
</p>
<p>58. The judicial protection of children is ensured by newly established courts under the 
PINA Act, including the Courts for Children and Adolescents or, in their absence, the 
magistrate&#8217;s courts (<i>juzgados de paz</i>), the decisions of which can be appealed to the Court 
of Appeals for Children and Adolescents.57 Courts for adolescents in conflict with the law 
have also been established.58 Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged to learn that 
mobile magistrate&#8217;s courts with civil, family and labour jurisdiction have been established 
in an effort to provide access to justice around the department of Quetzaltenango and 
Guatemala City,59 the dispatch of 10 more such units in rural areas throughout the country 
is planned. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the establishment in November 2012 of 
specialized courts for the prosecution of femicide and other forms of violence against 
women, sexual violence, exploitation and human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>59. The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit within the Organized Crime Division of the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office investigates crimes against public order, including trafficking in 
persons, and promotes the prosecution of such crimes. It also directs the NCP and other 
State security bodies in the investigation of criminal offenses. The Special Rapporteur also 
learned of the newly established Anti-Human Trafficking Division within the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.60 Created with support of SVET, it is aimed at addressing the increased 
workload and highlighting the importance of the problem.  
</p><p>60. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children and Adolescents (Procuradur&#237;a de la 
Ni&#241;ez y Adolescencia) under the Solicitor General&#8217;s Office further ensures the legal 
representation of children and adolescents whose rights have been infringed.61  
61. The Ministry of the Interior, through the Anti-Trafficking Unit of the Directorate-
General of Migration, contributes to the protection and promotion of the rights of victims of 
trafficking, including children. CONAMIGUA coordinates, defines and monitors State 
institutions engaged in the assistance of foreign and Guatemalan migrants. The NCP, and 
particularly the Specialized Department for Children and Adolescents, coordinates, trains 
and guides its officers and the population on the protection of children and adolescents and 
the prevention, investigation and prosecution of crimes involving children and 
adolescents;62 to this end, it also works with the Investigation of Human Trafficking Crimes

through the establishment of a specialized department for the investigation of sexual

into sex crimes is in the process of being established, with the support of SVET.  
</p>
<p>62. With regard to tourism, the NCP has a unit to ensure the security of tourists, while 
INGUAT promotes sustainable tourism development through coordination among 
Government, civil society and the private sector, including CAMTUR.  
</p><p>63. Within the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the Office of the Defender of Children and 
Adolescents (Defensor&#237;a de la Ni&#241;ez y de la Juventud) investigates complaints of alleged 
violations of children&#8217;s rights. Where it appears that the violations alleged are in 
</p>
<p>contravention of the criminal law, it refers the case to the Solicitor General, who initiates 
legal proceedings. The Special Rapporteur however notes the insufficient resources 
allocated to this institution, which impedes it from fulfilling its functions. She is further 
concerned about troubling reports of political bias, lack of attention to monitoring and 
preventative work, and failure to follow up on detected violations mentioned by 
stakeholders she met.63 Nevertheless, she counts on the reassurance given to her by the new 
management that these issues will be addressed. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts by the Government to address the 
situation of vulnerable children through the establishment of institutions for the protection 
and promotion of their rights. Nevertheless she remains concerned about the multiplicity of 
institutions, the absence of clear terms of reference which contribute to an overlap of some 
of their mandates, the lack of coordination between institutions at the local and central 
levels and the lack of resources (financial and trained personnel). She also notes the short 
time frame of their activities, which is not favourable for the establishment of sustainable 
and integrated child protection mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>  Interagency collaboration 
</b></p>
<p>65. The complexity of the child protection system, the multiplicity of actors involved 
and the delicate relationships between some stakeholders render coordination particularly 
challenging.  
</p><p>66. Consultation, management and development of initiatives to combat human 
trafficking is undertaken by the Inter-institutional Commission against Trafficking (CIT) 
under SVET.64 Its members include representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
the Interior, Education, Culture and Sports, Public Health and Social Assistance, and 
Labour and Social Security; the SBS; and COPREDEH.65 
67. With regard to protection of victims of sexual violence and/or abuse, an interagency 
agreement exists among the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (through its 
hospitals), the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the National Institute of Forensic Science 
(INACIF) and the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office (see para. 79).66

<p>SBS and comprised of representatives of civil society and government. The Commission 
elaborates policies for the comprehensive protection of children and adolescents and 
disseminates them to the Government institutions concerned; similar commissions are also 
present at the municipal level.67 
</p><p>69. With a view to decentralize its functions and to promote development outside the 
capital, institutions were created at the departmental and municipal levels. In parallel to this 
structure, the Government established development councils, comprised of a mixed 
representation of authorities and population, to enhance proximity between the population 
and the Government. These councils are organized at different levels, including communal 
(COCODEs), municipal (COMUDEs) and departmental (CODEDEs),68 to promote and 
protect the rights of children through policies and programmes. 
70. Also at the municipal level, Municipal Committees for the Protection of Children 
and Adolescents (Juntas Municipales de Protecci&#243;n a la Ni&#241;ez y Adolescencia), under the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, receive and register complaints on child rights violations, direct such 
complaints to relevant authorities and raise awareness on child rights, among other 
activities. Composed of trained volunteers, these committees aim to address the absence or 
weakness of the judiciary in some municipalities and resolve conflicts that do not require a 
judicial trial.69 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of the Child and Adolescent 
Protection Network, which comprises governmental and non-governmental institutions 
engaged in the protection of child rights in the municipalities.  
</p><p>72. CSOs also work in networks. The Special Rapporteur however cautions CSOs to 
also jointly work with the Government without substituting Government institutions, in 
particular in the area of prevention and to some extent, delivery of assistance to victims. 
73. While the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the multidisciplinary approach to 
protecting children, she is concerned that the extent of the interagency collaboration 
framework might substitute existing government institutions and render such institutions 
inefficient, and also increase competition for the little funding available. She is further 
concerned by the lack of coordination between these bodies, and other stakeholders, both in 
the capital and at the departmental level. Moreover, she highlights that the participation of 
the same institutions in various inter-institutional settings may not be the best use of limited 
resources.

Rapporteur, including the National Policy on the Prevention of Youth Violence and the 
Public Policy on Comprehensive Protection and its Plan of Action (2004-2015) aimed at, 
inter alia, coordinating the actions of stakeholders and fulfilling the rights of children and 
adolescents; the National Plan to Prevent and Eradicate Domestic Violence and Violence 
against Women (2004-2014), aimed at strengthening prevention and the protection of 
women; and the National Policy on Human Rights Education (2006-2015), aimed at

<p>institutionalizing and mainstreaming human rights in policies, Government and non-
governmental institutions.   
</p>
<p>75. The Public Policy on Human Trafficking and the Comprehensive Protection of 
Victims and the National Plan of Strategic Action (2007-2017) redirect and focus the 
State&#8217;s actions and budget to prevent and combat human trafficking based on the best 
interest of the child, non-discrimination, protection and attention to victims. 
</p><p>76. The Special Rapporteur noted the elaboration of the Pilot Plan for International 
Adoption (2010-2012), aimed at increasing capacities for the search for adoptive families in 
foreign countries for children who could not be placed with a Guatemalan family, and 
cooperation with authorities of receiving countries that are members of the Hague 
Convention.70 However, she regrets that it has not been put into practice. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur also notes numerous other policies which are pertinent to 
her mandate, including the Public Policy for Coexistence and the Elimination of Racism 
and Racial Discrimination (2006), and the Institutional Strategic Plan (2012-2016) to 
increase security, democracy and justice, and socioeconomic inclusion for all. She also 
acknowledges similar policies at the departmental level. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts made by Guatemala in addressing 
the protection of children through various national policies. Nevertheless she notes a lack of 
complementarity and synergy among them, an absence of an integral strategy on child 
protection, a lack of sustainability due to the short-term nature of the policies, and the 
limited budget and human resources. A lack of adequate indicators, monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms somewhat affects the outcome of the policies to the detriment of the 
children they aim to protect. Implemented under different institutions or joint 
&#8213;committees&#8214;, there is no centralized institution in charge of the effective coordination and 
implementation of the policies at the national and regional levels.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Investigation and prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>79. A protocol on inter-institutional coordination signed in 2010 by the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the judiciary and the Solicitor General&#8217;s Office, with technical support 
from UNICEF, is intended to strengthen support for children and adolescents whose human 
rights are threatened or violated; its aims include simplifying judicial procedures and 
rendering the justice system more accessible and effective so as to minimize re-
victimization.71  
</p>
<p>80. A judicial process regarding children or adolescents whose rights have been 
threatened or violated can be initiated by the National Commission on Children and 
Adolescents and/or the magistrate&#8217;s court, ex officio, on the basis of a complaint submitted 
by the victim or any person or authority,72 including hospitals. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office is 
also mandated to receive and investigate complaints submitted to it; upon identification of 
an offence, it must notify the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office or the judiciary, as appropriate. </p>
<p>81. The Solicitor General&#8217;s Office, through its Child Rescue Unit, assesses the risk of 
the situations of children, authorizes their transfer to juvenile courts and requests protection 
measures. In cases of abuse, it determines whether minors can be placed with another 
family member where they would have no contact with their abuser, or whether they should 
remain temporarily in a children&#8217;s home. However, the Solicitor General&#8217;s Office is not

<p>responsible for the prosecution of the abuser; it must inform the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
(CRC/C/GTM/3-4, paras. 21&#8211;22). 
</p>
<p>82. Penal investigations and prosecutions are then undertaken by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office through specialized units, including the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit within the 
Organized Crime Division, and the Division for Child and Adolescent Victims within the 
Division for Women.73 While the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has a branch in each of the 
country&#8217;s 22 departments, it has a presence in only 20 per cent of the municipalities 
(CRC/C/GTM/Q/3-4/Add.1, para. 32). Moreover, these branches (<i>fiscal&#237;as communes</i>) are 
criticized for their lack of capacity and absence of structures to investigate and prosecute 
crimes relating to sexual exploitation.74 Every month the Division for Children and 
Adolescents receives about 200 complaints, of which 50 per cent are related to the sexual 
abuse of minors.75 The Special Rapporteur takes note of the high workload of these offices, 
which have few staff.76 
</p>
<p>83. Child-friendly spaces, such as the Office for Comprehensive Assistance for Victims, 
within the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, and the Centro Metropolitano de Justicia collaborate 
with all child protection mechanisms to facilitate easy access by victims, speedy resolution 
of their cases and centralization of information. The Special Rapporteur notes the necessity 
of replicating this good practice throughout the country. Specific courts for children (para. 
58) ensure the judicial protection of child victims of sexual exploitation, trafficking and 
other crimes.  
</p><p>84. During the visit, all stakeholders noted that a major challenge for investigations was 
the lack of technical know-how and human, financial and material resources at the Solicitor 
General&#8217;s Office, which does not have local branches throughout the country. The actual 
working hours of magistrate&#8217;s courts&#8212;to 3 p.m., instead of the full 24 hours&#8212;has also 
contributed to long delays in bringing cases to court. A reluctance to denounce crimes of 
sexual exploitation of children due to fears of reprisal, inadequate protection of victims, 
their families and witnesses, social tolerance, lengthy investigations and delayed court 
proceedings has also been identified as a challenge. Finally, stakeholders reported that the 
corruption and impunity of some officials within government institutions, including the 
judiciary and the police, posed further challenges. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the absence of the 
investigation and prosecution of cases concerning online child pornography, attributed to a 
lack of adequate laws and expertise of law enforcement authorities in this area.  </p>
<p><b> 3. Assistance to child victims of exploitation and abuse  
</b></p>
<p>86. The removal of children from harmful situations of exploitation and abuse and their 
placement in public or private institutions separate from penal/correctional facilities for 
children in conflict with the law requires the authorization of the Solicitor General&#8217;s Office 
and a court order.77 As such placement is a last-resort measure, it also necessitates the 
exhaustion of all other placement options, and should be for the minimum period needed 
and in the best interest of the child.78

<p>87. All policies mentioned above recognize the need for the provision of comprehensive 
assistance to victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation and those awaiting 
adoption, including through an effective referral system, minimum standards for alternative 
and residential care and a recovery/rehabilitation plan. 
</p><p>88. Health professionals, psychologists and social and legal workers work with children 
placed in shelters in order to assess their case and provide them with needs-based 
assistance. Depending on the case, the child&#8217;s family may also benefit from practical 
training in the context of schools for parents.  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur visited Hogar Virgen de la Asunci&#243;n, which is run by SBS. 
At the time of the visit, 701 boys and girls were staying at the shelter, all referred by the 
court. In addition to the high number of children in the shelter, the Special Rapporteur was 
alarmed by the wide range of the children&#8217;s profiles, which included histories of physical 
and/or sexual abuse, abandonment, living and/or working in the streets, conflict with the 
law and trafficking. While it is essentially a temporary shelter for minors, residents 
included 25 persons with disabilities aged between 18 and 36, who have no alternative to 
the shelter. She emphasizes that effective, specialized care and assistance cannot be 
delivered when children with such a wide spectrum of needs are placed together. She 
further notes the impact that the lack of resources, both human and financial, and the 
location of the shelter, at the outskirts of the capital, have on access to education and other 
social services essential for the children&#8217;s recovery/reintegration process. 
</p><p>90. The Special Rapporteur also visited CSO-run shelters that had fewer children and 
better quality assistance.79. However, she notes the need to elaborate and implement with 
the participation of each child a personalized life project and to ensure regular follow-up 
until the child&#8217;s full recovery. 
91. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the considerable number of shelters for 
children throughout Guatemala that are operating without clear standards and with a 
noticeable lack of trained manpower and financial and material resources. She is further 
concerned that in the absence of other alternatives, children are being institutionalized with 
insufficient care and inadequate rehabilitation for their eventual reinsertion into the society. </p>
<p><b> 4. Prevention, capacity-building and awareness raising 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Government has undertaken numerous efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of children, including by tackling root causes through policies such as those 
aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals in the areas of economic 
development, food security, health, education and justice.80 It also plans to fight corruption 
and impunity, which could lead to improvements in, inter alia, the investigation and 
prosecution of perpetrators of commercial sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p>93. Effective sex education in schools is lacking; sex is also a taboo topic within homes 
and the community. This creates confusion and lack of understanding about sexuality, 
particularly for pre-adolescents, and an environment where children do not feel safe or 
secure discussing issues relating to sexuality with their families and within their 
communities. While the Ministry of Education claims that there are sexual education 
programmes in the schools, reportedly, in practice, teachers are reluctant to present them.

</p>
<p>94. As a result, stakeholders report that teenage pregnancy rates are increasing, as is 
precocious sexual activity. The Special Rapporteur notes the lack of a system of alternative 
care to support single teenage mothers. She reiterates the importance of providing such 
assistance as part of the child protection system to prevent the sale of children through 
adoption and to enable the girls to continue their education.81 Limited birth registration 
outside the capital was also cited as an obstacle to education, especially for girls in poor 
communities, and as a factor facilitating illegal adoptions.  
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur was informed of various trainings and capacity-building on 
child rights offered to stakeholders within Government and non-governmental institutions, 
as envisaged in the national policies. She also notes the involvement of the international 
community and UNICEF in conducting training and awareness-raising on the topic. Despite 
these various programmes, the Special Rapporteur underscores the need for further 
capacity-building, an issue raised by all stakeholders with whom she met. She encourages 
tailor-made training on a wide range of child rights issues, such as on sexual tourism, online 
pornography and cybercrime involving children, in order to meet the specific needs of the 
country and facilitate the work of professionals involved with child victims and witnesses, 
such as teachers, police, judges, prosecutors and health and social workers.  
</p><p>96. In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur observes that more could be done to 
create an effective protective environment for children against all forms of violence, abuse 
and exploitation, by involving relevant partners at all levels, including community and 
religious leaders and the private sector.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Child participation 
</b></p>
<p>97. In Guatemala, children are informed about their rights through trainings and 
awareness-raising as envisaged in all policies involving them. Through the Children&#8217;s 
Parliament, children participate to some extent in national issues that concern them, 
including health, education, intrafamily domestic violence, sexual abuse and commercial 
exploitation.82  
</p><p>98. While the PINA Act provides for the right and duty of children to participate in the 
implementation of policies on their protection, in reality children have yet to assume this 
role. The Special Rapporteur notes the need for a reinforced and systematized participation 
of children in policies and programmes affecting them. She recalls that child participation 
consists of the right of each child to express his or her views and to have these views taken 
into consideration in all matters that concern his or her life, with the objective of 
influencing decision-making and achieving change. Children are not simply victims or 
vulnerable to becoming victims; they can and should take part actively in finding solutions; 
they must thus be empowered to fight for their own protection and that of their peers. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Complaints mechanisms and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>99. In Guatemala, at least six different hotlines under various institutions allow victims, 
including children, to call in, report emergencies and receive guidance: the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Office (1555); Solicitor General&#8217;s Office (1546); NCP (110); Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
(1570); Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1552); and Directorate-General of Migration (1573).83 
</p>
<p>  
 81 The Special Rapporteur noted, however, the Inter-institutional Memorandum of Understanding for the 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Roadmap to Tackle Pregnancies of Girls under 14.

</b></p>
<p>Another hotline (1561) within the Centre for the Collection, Analysis and Dissemination of 
Criminal Intelligence (CRADIC) of the NCP, with an emphasis on complaints of human 
trafficking, was established in October 2012.84 
</p>
<p>100. In the absence of centralized information (envisaged in nearly all policies involving 
children) and adequate resources, including trained personnel capable of providing victims 
with appropriate child-friendly guidance, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the 
overlapping work of these institutions, which are often the first contacts of the victims.  
</p>
<p>101. As mentioned above, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office also receives and submits 
complaints, inspects institutions, promotes the rights of the child and cooperates with 
Government institutions and other national human rights institutions in the region. 
Nevertheless, accessibility by children to the institution is weak and could benefit from 
increased local offices and resource allocation; the confidence of the community in the 
institution must also be re-built. 
</p>
<p>102. As regards monitoring the effectiveness of past and present protection systems, 
including national policies, institutions and CSO programmes, the Special Rapporteur was 
not able to get any information about actual results of such follow-up, despite the inclusion 
of the principle of monitoring and evaluation in most policies. This lack of periodic review 
of achievements and impediments on the basis of clear indicators and accountability in 
budget allocation prevents the assessment of the impact of stakeholders&#8217; efforts in the area 
of child protection.  </p>
<p><b> 7. Involvement of private sector 
</b></p>
<p>103. Guatemala, as part of the Secretariat for the Integration of Central American 
Tourism (SITCA), is in the process of adopting a code of conduct for the tourism sector. As 
part of a roundtable (<i>mesa t&#233;cnica</i>) comprising the Institute for Social Security, CAMTUR, 
UNICEF, the International Labour Organization, ECPAT and SVET, training on the code 
was conducted. The Special Rapporteur is, however, concerned about the limited personnel 
available to provide these trainings in all institutions within the tourism sector in 
Guatemala, including hotels and tour operators. </p>
<p>104. Under the National Policy on the Prevention of Youth Violence, the media, 
particularly television and cinema, is called on to minimize the inclusion of pornography, 
drug addiction, violence and degrading portrayals, especially of children, and to promote 
the equality of all.85 
</p>
<p>105. As regards the Internet, it is not currently regulated in Guatemala. Moreover, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that Internet service providers, mobile phone operators, 
search engines and other relevant private sector actors have not adopted a code of conduct 
and do not have the legal obligation to report violations, block access to sites, or retain 
material for a specific period of time for the purposes of investigation and legal 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. International and regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>106. The sale and sexual exploitation of children have become increasingly international 
phenomena owing to the development of information technologies, trafficking networks, 
tourism and migration. Solid networks at the regional and international levels are required 
to address these crimes through coordination and cooperation in the areas of exchange of

</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>information and expertise, sharing and harmonization of practices and provision of 
technical and financial support. 
</p>
<p>107. At the regional level, Guatemala has a bilateral memorandum of understanding with 
El Salvador on the protection of victims of trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling. It 
is also part of the Regional Coalition to Combat Human Trafficking, along with Belize, 
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.86 It is currently considering a 
programme of protection and comprehensive assistance for the repatriation and 
reintegration of children intercepted by United States and Mexican authorities, through 
bilateral agreements with those countries.87 Guatemala is also working with El Salvador and 
Honduras to adopt the &#8213;Guardian Angels&#8214; programme, aimed at better sharing information 
and protecting victims of trafficking in border areas.88 Guatemala has also established a unit 
that works with INTERPOL within the Criminal Investigation Subdirectorate of the NCP<i>.</i>89 
Despite such efforts, the Special Rapporteur notes the absence of international cooperation, 
particularly as regards extraterritorial jurisdiction, extradition, mutual legal assistance and 
seizure and confiscation of proceeds relating to cases described in the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography. 
</p>
<p>108. The Special Rapporteur met with key international technical partners in Guatemala. 
They are involved, to varying degrees, in technical cooperation directly with the 
government, with CSOs or through UNICEF for the promotion and protection of child 
rights, including delivery of training on child rights and grants. The Special Rapporteur 
notes the limited coordination and short-term nature of the programmes, which tend to be 
focused on prevention aspects and delivered on an ad-hoc basis, as challenges are 
encountered by international partners in Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the Government has established 
adequate laws, policies and institutions, and mobilized considerable energy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources, to enhance the protection of children from sale, prostitution and 
</b></p>
<p><b>pornography, and of child rights more generally. However, the Government is 
</b></p>
<p><b>struggling to have an efficient sustained impact on the lives of vulnerable children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>due to the unknown extent of the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</b></p>
<p><b>pornography in the country, the proliferation of institutions addressing only a few 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of the phenomena and weak inter-institutional coordination. Existing policies 
</b></p>
<p><b>on child rights have weak coherence, and lack adequate resources, time-bound 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators and systematic monitoring and evaluation. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the clear commitment of all actors with 
whom she met, including representatives of the highest level of Government, non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations, the United Nations and the international community, to 
</b></p>

<p><b>through:  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/54/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Harmonization of national legal (civil and penal) and regulatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>frameworks, including on the minimum age of marriage, with ratified international 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Widespread dissemination of user-friendly and adapted information 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Establishment of effective mechanisms fighting corruption and impunity. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>With regard to the institutional framework, the Government should conduct a 
mapping of all institutions, programmes and actors involved in child protection, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>a view to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Identifying: (i) best practices, and capitalizing on them; (ii) overlaps, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gearing them towards complementary interactions; and (iii) inefficiencies and gaps, in

</b></p>
<p><b>accommodate the basic needs of child victims, by establishing minimum standards for 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>guided by child-rights standards and ethical principles, supporting the health, self-
</b></p>
<p><b>respect and dignity of the child and in particular promoting the complete physical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>psychological recovery and social integration of all child victims. Registered centres 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be required to provide monthly reports on the children, details of their care and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfer;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Establishing sustainable and adapted training (intervention levels) and 
</b></p>
