DIRECTORS’ REPORT
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
 
Update on Iron Ore Projects in Peru 
 
During the financial year, Strike: 




Renewed (on an annual basis in June 2016) its Peruvian Apurimac Magnetite Iron Ore Project and 
Cusco  Magnetite  Iron  Ore  Project  mineral  concessions  -  as  previously  reported,  Strike  has 
consolidated  its  holding  of  mineral  concessions  to  the  core  concessions  where  JORC  Code 
compliant  Mineral  Resources  have  been  delineated  as  well  as  a  number  of  neighbouring 
concessions  which  have  strategic  value  associated  with  the  projects  –  this  has  reduced  Strike’s 
holding costs in Peru and provides Strike with the flexibility to pursue opportunities to realise value 
from these iron ore assets in the future if and when favourable market conditions return; and 
Commenced preliminary/conceptual desk-top studies to investigate a potential alternative value-add 
strategy  in  relation  to  the  development  of  the  Apurimac  Project  –  this  is  consistent  with  Strike’s 
recognition of the project as a potentially strategic asset in Peru which may, when market conditions 
improve, provide opportunity for the Strike to recover value.
Update on Company Strategy 
 
During the financial year, Strike continued to examine a range of strategies for the Company in light of the 
on-going poor outlook for the iron ore sector.  In this regard: 

Strike has and is reviewing a number of resource opportunities in sectors (in Australia and overseas) 
where  the  Company  believes  that  the  current  market  conditions  may  present  good  buying 
opportunities  or  where  there  exists  positive  market  sentiment.    Strike  is  actively  seeking  to 
build/acquire  a  portfolio  of  mining  projects  in  commodities  that  in  the  Company’s  view  have 
strong market fundamentals and in locations which Strike has significant operating experience – 
principally, Australia and South America. 
Further to the above: 

Strike  has  recently  applied  for  a  number  exploration  licences  in  the  North  Pilbara,  Western 
Australia and exploration concessions in northern Chile considered prospective for lithium1; 
and  
Strike  are  in  discussions  with  a  number  of  potential  parties  to  acquire  (joint  venture  and  or 
farm-in)  interests  in  a  range  of  more  advanced  lithium  and  other  attractive  commodity 
resource projects in Australia and overseas.

Whilst  Strike  has  investigated  a  number  of  technology  related  ventures  which  could  form  the 
foundation  for  a  new  strategy  for  the  Company  (subject  to  Strike  shareholder  approval  and 
compliance with the ASX Listing Rules and Corporations Act), market sentiment in this sector has 
waned of late and Strike is now focusing more on the resource sector (as noted above).
Bentley Capital’s Takeover Bid for Strike 
 
On  2  July  2015,  Strike  announced  that  a  Takeover  Response  Committee  of  the  Company’s  then 
independent Directors (being Mr Malcolm Richmond, Ms Samantha Tough and Mr Matthew Hammond) had 
been established to respond to the off-market 5.5 cent per share cash takeover bid for Strike announced2 
by Bentley Capital Limited (ASX:BEL) (Bentley) on 30 June 2015 (the Offer). 
 
In  July  2015,  Bentley  lodged  its  Bidder’s  Statement  relating  to  the  Offer  with  ASIC  and  despatched  the 
same to Strike’s shareholders.3

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS  
 
There have been no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Consolidated Entity save as otherwise 
disclosed in this Directors’ Report or the financial statements and notes thereto. 
 
 
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS 
 
The Consolidated Entity will continue to: 

maintain  its  iron  ore  projects  in  Peru  as  potentially  strategic  assets  which  may,  when  market 
conditions improve, provide opportunity for the Strike to recover value from the same; and  
examine  a  range  of  strategies  (in  the  resources  and  potentially  non-resources  sector)  for  the 
Company in light of the on-going poor outlook for the iron ore sector.

The  likely  outcomes  of  these  activities  depend  on  a  range  of  technical  and  economic  factors  and  also 
industry, geographic and other strategy specific issues.  In the opinion of the Directors, it is not possible or 
appropriate  to  make  a  prediction  on  the  results  of  these  activities,  the  future  course  of  markets  or  the 
forecast of the likely results of the Consolidated Entity’s activities.  
 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  
 
The  Consolidated  Entity  holds  mineral  tenement/concession  licences  issued  by  the  relevant  mining  and 
environmental protection authorities of the various countries in which Strike operates (from time to time).  In 
the course of its mineral exploration, evaluation and development activities, the Consolidated Entity adheres 
to licence conditions and environmental regulations imposed upon it by various authorities (as applicable).  
The  Consolidated  Entity  has  complied  with  all  licence  conditions  and  environmental  requirements  (as 
applicable) during the financial year and up to the date of this report.  There have been no known material 
breaches of the Consolidated Entity’s licence conditions and environmental regulations during the financial 
year and up to the date of this report.

Remuneration Policy 
 
The  Board  (with  guidance  from  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee)  determines  the 
remuneration structure of all Key Management Personnel having regard to the Consolidated Entity’s 
strategic objectives, scale and scope of operations and other relevant factors, including experience 
and  qualifications, 
length  of  service,  market  practice  (including  available  data  concerning 
remuneration paid by other listed companies in particular companies of comparable size and nature 
within the resources sector in which the Consolidated Entity operates), the duties and accountability 
of  Key  Management  Personnel  and  the  objective  of  maintaining  a  balanced  Board  which  has 
appropriate expertise and experience, at a reasonable cost to the Company. 
 
The  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee:    A  purpose  of  the  Committee  is  to  assist  the 
Managing Director and the Board to adopt and implement a remuneration system that is required to 
attract,  retain  and  motivate  the  personnel  who  will  enable  the  Company  to  achieve  long-term 
success.  In carrying out this ‘remuneration function’, the Committee’s key responsibilities are to: 

make recommendations to the Board on the specific benefits to be provided to the Managing 
Director within the policy 
conduct an annual review of Non-Executive Directors’ fees and determining whether the limit 
on the Non-Executive Directors’ fee pool remains appropriate, and 
assist  the  Managing  Director  to  determine  the  remuneration  (including  equity-based 
remuneration)  of  ‘Senior  Management’  (being  executive  direct  reports  to  the  Managing 
Director and other senior employees) and advise on those determinations.
A  copy  of  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  Charter  may  be  downloaded  from  the 
Company’s website: http://strikeresources.com.au/corporate/corporate-governance/.

In respect of Non-Executive Directors, payment for the performance of extra services or the

concurrence of the Board).
Short-Term  Benefits:  The  Managing  Director  has  the  opportunity  to  earn  an  annual  short-term 
incentive  (STI)  cash  amount  if  predefined  key  performance  indicators  (KPI’s)  are  achieved.    The 
STI/KPI’s are reviewed annually (where applicable).  There were no STI KPI’s set for the Managing

employees (and potentially Executive Directors). Under the ESOP, the Board will nominate personnel 
to participate and will offer options to subscribe for shares  in the Company to those personnel.  A 
summary of the terms of ESOP is set out in Annexure B to the Company’s Notice of Annual General 
Meeting  and  Explanatory  Statement  dated  8  October  200823.    The  Company  has  not  granted  any 
options to Key Management Personnel during the financial year.

Post-Employment Benefits: The Company does not  presently provide retirement benefits to  Key 
Management  Personnel.    The  Company  notes  that  shareholder  approval  is  required  where  a 
Company  proposes  to  make  a  “termination  payment”  (for  example,  a  payment  in  lieu  of  notice,  a 
payment  for  a  post-employment  restraint  and  payments  made  as  a  result  of  the  automatic  or 
accelerated vesting of share based payments) in excess of one year’s “base salary” (defined as the 
average base salary over the previous 3 years) to a director or any person who holds a managerial 
or executive office. 
 
Performance-Related Benefits and Financial Performance of Company: Save for any applicable 
STI(s) in place for the Managing Director or any applicable equity-benefits that may be provided to 
Key Management Personnel, the current remuneration of Key Management Personnel is fixed, is not 
dependent  on  the  satisfaction  of  a  performance  condition  and  is  unrelated  to  the  Company’s 
performance. 
 
In considering the Company's performance and its effects on shareholder wealth, Directors have had

reviewing or auditing the auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the

results  of  its  subsidiaries  for  the  year  then  ended.    The

inclusive of GST.  Cash flows are presented in the Statement

  Financial assets will either be measured at amortised cost,

or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

However,  AASB  9  requires  that  gains  or  losses  on  financial 
liabilities measured at fair value are recognised in profit or loss, 
except that the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
 
Impairment  
 
The  new  impairment  model  in  AASB  9  is  now  based  on  an 
‘expected  loss’  model  rather  than  an  ‘incurred  loss’  model.    A 
complex  three  stage  model  applies  to  debt  instruments  at 
amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive 
income for recognising impairment losses.  
 
A simplified impairment model applies to trade receivables and 
lease receivables with maturities that are less than 12 months. 
For trade receivables and lease receivables with maturity longer 
than 12 months, entities have a choice of applying the complex 
three stage model or the simplified model.  
 
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 Joint Arrangements to provide 
guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint 
operations in which the activity constitutes a business. The 
amendments require: 

the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the 
activity  constitutes  a  business,  as  defined  in  AASB  3 
Business  Combinations,  to  apply  all  of  the  principles  on 
business  combinations  accounting  in  AASB  3  and  other 
Australian Accounting Standards except for those principles

Nature of Change 
AASB  116  Property  Plant  and  Equipment  and  AASB  138 
Intangible  Assets  both  establish  the  principle  for  the  basis  of 
depreciation and amortisation as being the expected pattern of 
consumption of the future economic benefits of an asset.  
 
The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods 
to  calculate  the  depreciation  of  an  asset  is  not  appropriate 
because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use 
of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption 
of the economic benefits embodied in the asset. 
 
The  amendment  also  clarified 
is  generally 
presumed  to  be  an  inappropriate  basis  for  measuring  the 
consumption  of 
in  an 
intangible asset. This presumption, however, can be rebutted in 
certain limited circumstances. 
The subjects of the principal amendments to the Standards are 
set out below: 
 
AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations:   
  Changes  in  methods  of  disposal  –  where  an  entity 
reclassifies an asset (or disposal group) directly from being 
held for distribution to being held for sale (or vice versa), an 
entity shall not follow the guidance in paragraphs 27–29 to 
account for this change.

  Applicability  of  the  amendments  to  AASB  7  to condensed 
interim  financial  statements  -  clarify  that  the  additional 
disclosure  required  by 
to  AASB  7 
Disclosure–Offsetting  Financial  Assets  and  Financial 
Liabilities is not specifically required for all interim periods. 
However, the additional disclosure is required to be given in 
condensed interim financial statements that are prepared in 
accordance  with  AASB  134  Interim  Financial  Reporting 
when its inclusion would be required by the requirements of 
AASB 134.
AASB 119 Employee Benefits: 
  Discount rate: regional market issue - clarifies that the high 
quality corporate bonds used to estimate the discount rate 
for  post-employment  benefit  obligations  should  be 
denominated in the same currency as the liability. Further it 
clarifies  that  the  depth  of  the  market  for  high  quality 
corporate bonds should be assessed at the currency level.
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting:  
  Disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial 
report’  -  amends  AASB  134  to  clarify  the  meaning  of 
disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial 
report’ and to require the inclusion of a cross-reference from 
the  interim  financial  statements  to  the  location  of  this 
information.

Accounting policy
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue
are net of returns, trade allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Consolidated
Entity recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. It is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Consolidated Entity’s
activities as described below. The Consolidate Entity bases its estimates on historical results,
taking into
consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement. Revenue is
recognised for the major business activities as follows:
(i)
income is recognised using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired,
Interest revenue
Interest
the
Consolidated Entity reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash
flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount
as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the original effective interest rate.
(ii)  Gain on loss of control of subsidiary
When the Consolidated Entity ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its
fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. Any amounts previously recognised
in Other Comprehensive Income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Consolidated Entity had
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in
Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(iii)  Other revenues
Other revenues are recognised on a receipts basis.

Accounting policy
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions
and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income,
except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or
are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Foreign exchange gains or losses that relate to
borrowings are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income within
finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or
Loss and Other Comprehensive Income on a net basis within other income or operating expenses.

Director. The Managing Director is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of
the
operating segments and has considered the business and geographical perspectives of the operating results and
determined that the Consolidated Entity operates only in Australia and Peru.

Critical accounting judgement and estimate
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised as, in the Directors' opinion, it is not probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the Consolidated Entity can utilise the benefits. The utilisation of revenue and
capital tax losses are subject to compliance with taxation legislation.
Accounting policy
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities
attributable to temporary differences and for unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the
basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the
Company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However,
deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is
also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by
the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or
the deferred income tax liability is settled.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE (continued)
Accounting policy (continued)
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable
that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of
investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities, and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax
liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net
basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in
Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive
Income or directly in equity, respectively.

Under AASB113 (Earnings per share), potential ordinary shares such as options will only be treated as dilutive
when their conversion to ordinary shares would increase the loss per share from continuing operations. Diluted
loss per share has not been calculated as the Company's options do not increase the basic loss per share.
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the operating result after income tax by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares on issue during the financial period.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share by taking into
account amounts unpaid on ordinary shares and any reduction in earnings per share that will probably arise from
the exercise of options outstanding during the financial period

instruments consist of deposits with banks, receivables and payables. The
Consolidated Entity's financial instruments are subject to market (which includes interest rate and foreign exchange
risk), credit and liquidity risks.
The Board is responsible for the overall internal control framework (which includes risk management) but no cost-
effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities. The system is based, in part, on the
appointment of suitably qualified management personnel. The effectiveness of the system is continually reviewed
by management and at least annually by the Board.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
(i)
Foreign exchange risk
The Consolidated Entity operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from
various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and Peruvian Nuevo Soles.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities
denominated in a currency that is not the Consolidated Entity's functional currency. The risk is measured
using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting.
The Consolidated Entity has a policy of not hedging foreign exchange risk and therefore has not entered
into any hedging against movements in foreign currencies against
including
forward exchange contracts, as at the reporting date and is currently fully exposed to foreign exchange
risk.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Consolidated Entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated
with financial
liabilities. The Consolidated Entity has no borrowings. The Consolidated Entity's non-cash
investments can be realised to meet trade and other payables arising in the normal course of business. The
financial liabilities disclosed in the above table have a maturity obligation of not more than 30 days.
(c) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty under a financial instrument will default (in whole or in part) on
its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Consolidated Entity. Credit risk arises from cash
and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, including outstanding receivables and
committed transactions. Concentrations of credit risk are minimised primarily by the management carrying out
all market
transactions through recognised and creditworthy brokers and the monitoring of receivable
balances. The Consolidated Entity's business activities do not necessitate the requirement for collateral as a
means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The credit quality of the financial assets are neither past due nor impaired and can be assessed by reference
to external credit ratings (if available with Standard & Poor's) or to historical information about counterparty
default rates. The maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date is the carrying amount of the financial
assets as summarised below:

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Consolidated Entity has assessed the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation in accordance with
AASB 6 (Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources) and has recognised an impairment expense of
$271,844 during the current financial year. The ultimate recoverability of deferred exploration and evaluation
expenditure is dependent on the successful development or sale of the relevant area of interest.
Accounting policy
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is initially capitalised in respect of each identifiable area of interest
where the Consolidated Entity has right of tenure. These costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are
expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area or where activities in the area have not
yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically-recoverable
reserves. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit in the year in
which the decision to abandon the area is made.
Under AASB 6 (Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources), if facts and circumstances suggest that the
carrying amount of any recognised exploration and evaluation assets may be impaired, the Consolidated Entity
must perform impairment tests on those assets and measure any impairment in accordance with AASB 136
(Impairment of Assets). Any impairment loss is to be recognised as an expense. A regular review is undertaken of
each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area
of interest.

* Withholding tax (2015) comprises an accrual/provision of 1,472,822 Peruvian Soles in respect of Non-Resident
Income Tax Withholding Tax (WHT) pertaining to Peruvian subsidiary, Apurimac Ferrum SAC (AF) – this relates to
a SUNAT (the Peruvian Tax Administration) determination following an audit of AF's WHT obligations for the 2010
and 2011 fiscal years completed in June 2014.
SUNAT’s original WHT determination was for 3,693,580 Soles ($1,470,453 as accrued/provided for in the 30 June
2014 Consolidated Entity’s accounts), which AF sought to formally review.
In April 2015, SUNAT confirmed the
legitimacy of a minor amount of ($10,918) in WHT liabilities (and late payment penalties) and requested a re-audit
of a number of matters as it believed that there was insufficient evidence compiled to support its initial findings. As
a consequence of this decision, the Consolidated Entity reduced its accrual/provision to 1,472,822 Soles ($610,446
as at 30 June 2015).
SUNAT has not advised the Consolidated Entity as to the status of commencement/completion of their re-audit.
Given the lack of action by SUNAT since April 2015, the Directors have reviewed the previous decision to
recognise the WHT accrual/provision and after receipt of advice from its Peruvian tax advisors, have determined to
reverse this WHT accrual/provision. The Consolidated Entity reiterates that it intends to appeal any final WHT
determination by SUNAT to the Tax Administration Court (where applicable). The Consolidated Entity has
disclosed this matter as a contingent liability in Note 21(f).

Accounting policy
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Consolidated Entity prior to the end of
the financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months from the
reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

Short-term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within
12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect
of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid
when the liabilities are settled. The liability for annual leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits. All
other short-term employee benefit obligations are presented as payables.
Provisions for legal claims, service warranties and make good obligations are made where the Consolidated Entity
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised
for future operating losses.

translation reserve as described in the accounting policy note below and accumulate in a separate reserve
within equity. The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the net investment is disposed of.
Accounting policy
Foreign currency translation reserve
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary
economy) that have a functional currency different
from the presentation currency are translated into the
presentation currency as follows:
(i)
assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the
date of that statement of financial position
income and expenses for Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income are
translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect
of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the
dates of the transactions), and
(ii)
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of
borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in Other
Comprehensive Income.

life of share options
Accounting policy
Shared-based compensation benefits are provided to Directors (after receipt of shareholder approval) and to
employees via the Strike Resources Limited Employee Share Option Plan.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in
equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which
includes any market performance conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions but excludes the impact
of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options
that are expected to vest based on the non-marketing vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to
original estimates, if any, in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

INVESTMENT IN CONTROLLED ENTITIES (continued)
Accounting policy
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Consolidated Entity has control. The
Consolidated Entity controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control
is transferred to the group. They are
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Consolidated Entity.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions in the Consolidated Entity are
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the
assets transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency
with the policies adopted by the Consolidated Entity.

COMMITMENTS
Lease Commitments
20. 
 
(a) 
 
The Consolidated Entity has no lease commitments. 
 
(b)  Mineral Tenements/Concessions - Commitments for Expenditure
(i)
Australian Tenements
In order to maintain current rights of tenure to exploration tenements, the holders of Australian mineral tenements 
are required to outlay lease rentals and meet minimum expenditure commitments.  The Consolidated Entity does 
not currently have any material commitments for expenditure relating to Australian tenements.
(ii)  Peruvian Mineral Concessions
CONTINGENCIES
Australian Native Title
Government Royalties
The Consolidated Entity is required to pay annual licence fees by 30 June of each year, at rates which vary on an 
amount  per-hectare  basis.    The  total  amount  of  this  commitment  will  depend  upon  the  number  and  area  of 
concessions retained, relinquished or granted (if any) and cannot therefore be reliably estimated. 
 
A number of non-core mineral concessions in Peru were allowed to lapse on 30 June 2015, significantly reducing 
the  Consolidated  Entity’s  annual  expenditure  in  Peru.    The  Consolidated  Entity  continues  to  hold  14  core 
Apurimac  and  Cusco  Project  mineral  concessions  where  JORC  Mineral  Resources  of  iron  ore  have  been 
delineated (and neighbouring areas which have strategic value associated with the projects). 
 
 
21. 
 
(a) 
 
The Consolidated Entity's tenements in Australia may be subject to native title applications in the future.  At this 
stage  it  is  not  possible  to  quantify  the  impact  (if  any)  that  native  title  may  have  on  the  operations  of  the 
Consolidated Entity. 
 
(b) 
 
The Consolidated Entity is liable to pay royalties on production obtained from its mineral tenements/concessions. 
 
(c) 
 
The  Consolidated  Entity  has  entered  into  deeds  of  indemnity  with  Strike  Resources  Limited  Directors, 
indemnifying  them  against  liability  incurred  in  discharging  their  duties  as  Directors/officers  of  the  Consolidated 
Entity.  As at the reporting date, no claims have been made under any such indemnities and, accordingly, it is not 
possible to quantify the potential financial obligation of the Consolidated Entity under these indemnities. 
 
(d) 
 
Pursuant  to  a  settlement  agreement  dated  30  December  2012  whereby  the  Consolidated  Entity  acquired  the 
(50%) balance of equity interest in Apurimac Ferrum SAC (AF) (the holder of the Apurimac and Cusco Projects) 
from D&C Pesca SAC, the Consolidated Entity has a series of deferred payment obligations as outlined below. 
 
The Consolidated Entity has payment obligations if certain milestones are achieved as follows: 
(i)
Deferred Payments from Settlement Agreement Relating to Apurimac Ferrum SAC
Resource  Milestone  Payment:  US$2  million  on  the  delineation  of  at  least  500  Mt  of  JORC  Mineral 
Resources  at  an  average  grade  of  at  least  55%  Fe  with  at  least  275  Mt  of  contained  iron  having  an 
average grade of at least 52.5% Fe, on the Apurimac Project mineral concessions. 
Approvals Milestone Payment: Up to US$3 million on AF receiving all formal government environmental 
and community approvals for the construction and operation of an iron ore mine and required infrastructure 
with  a  design  capacity  of  at  least  10Mtpa  of  iron  ore  product,  relating  to  the  Apurimac  Project  mineral 
concessions.

Deferred Payments from Settlement Agreement Relating to Apurimac Ferrum SAC (continued)
Construction Milestone Payment: Up to US$5 million on formal approval of the AF Board to commence 
construction  of  an  iron  ore  project  or  the  commencement  of  bulk  earthworks  for  an  iron  ore  mine  or 
processing plant, in either case with a design capacity of at least 10Mtpa of iron ore product, relating to the 
Apurimac Project mineral concessions.
The Consolidated Entity has royalty payment obligations as follows: 
(i)
1.5% of the net profits from sales of iron ore mined and iron ore products produced from the Apurimac and 
Cusco Project mineral concessions. 
2% of the proceeds of sales of other metals (on a net smelter return basis) mined from the Apurimac and 
Cusco Project mineral concessions.
(ii)
AF may extinguish the royalties (save for royalties on other metals up to a cap of US$0.5 million per annum) by 
making an Extinguishment Payment as follows - US$30 million, if paid 4 years from 20 December 2012 but before 
the Construction Milestone occurs or the 15th anniversary of the settlement agreement (whichever is sooner). 
 
Due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the achievement and timing of the above milestones/royalty triggers, 
the Consolidated Entity regards these future payment obligations as contingencies.  
 
For further background details, refer also to Strike’s ASX Announcement dated 31 December 2012: Strike Moves 
to 100% Ownership of AF 
 
(e) 
 
The Consolidated Entity has successfully defended against a number of legal actions and claims made by several 
Peruvian parties (that have had a contractual relationship with AF) relating to the Consolidated Entity’s mineral 
concessions  in  Peru.    Whilst  there  still  remain  some  outstanding  claims  and  appeals,  the  Consolidated  Entity 
believes  that  they  will  all  eventually  be  dismissed,  consistent  with  previous  decisions  by  the  relevant  Peruvian 
authorities.
