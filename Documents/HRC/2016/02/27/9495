<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In her 2007 report to the Human Rights Council, entitled &#8220;Minorities, Poverty and the 
Millennium Development Goals:  Assessing Global Issues&#8221; (A/HRC/4/9), the independent 
expert on minority issues, Gay McDougall, establishes that minorities experience high and 
disproportionate levels of poverty.  There is a genuine risk that the strategies used to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and to reduce poverty will be less beneficial for persons 
belonging to marginalized minority groups and that they might even increase inequalities and 
cause harm.  To date, the link between the inclusion of minorities, the protection of minority 
rights and the realization of MDGs has not been widely considered or sufficiently acted upon.  
The present report helps reveal and address such gaps.  It reviews 50 MDG country reports and 
selected Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) to determine if and how marginalized 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are reflected in these documents.  This timely review 
highlights the good practice on MDGs and poverty reduction where it exists and gives 
recommendations on how States and the international community could be doing better.   
</p>
<p> The findings of this survey are revealing.  Ethnic or linguistic minorities are mentioned in 
only 19 of the 50 MDG country reports reviewed.  The inequalities experienced by religious 
minorities are mentioned in only two of the reports.  An additional 10 reports mention only 
indigenous peoples without identifying any other minority groups.  The degree to which 
minorities are mentioned varies widely, with some reports providing a good range of information 
under several MDGs and disaggregated data.  In other cases, minorities are mentioned only in 
the background section describing the national population but without particular attention to their 
situation in relation to MDGs.  Minorities were mentioned most frequently in connection with 
Goal 2 on universal primary education.  Attention to indigenous peoples is in general 
significantly higher than attention to non-indigenous marginalized minorities across the reports.  
While attention to gender issues in many MDG country reports is positive, there is very little 
consideration of intersectional discrimination experienced by minority women, or targeted 
policies for marginalized minority women.  Minorities are virtually absent from the 
MDG country reports from donor countries.  None of the MDG country reports gives 
consideration to minorities under each of the eight Goals.  
</p>
<p> There is a weak understanding of the causes of poverty for minorities and its 
manifestations in the social, economic, cultural and political spheres.  In particular, even in those 
reports where minorities are mentioned, there is no discussion on how and why minorities are 
experiencing disproportionately high levels of poverty and other serious inequalities in most 
countries.  The issue of discrimination, both direct and indirect, is noticeably absent in the 
poverty analyses and also in policy responses for poverty reduction.  Discussion of other rights 
of minorities is rarely evident in MDG reports. 
</p>
<p> This lack of information presented in MDG country reports is not necessarily indicative 
of practice on the ground but suggests that ensuring strategies for the MDGs and PRSPs include 
minorities is still a low priority for most governments.  While resources and capacity are vital 
factors, the starting point for improving the impact of poverty reduction on minorities is political 
will.  MDG country reports and PRSPs are flagships for this political will and if the situation of 
minorities is analysed better in these documents, accompanied by requisite strategies, this can 
serve to empower minorities to realize human development and their human rights.   </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> While the general situation remains extremely weak in terms of State consideration of 
minorities and minority issues, some promising practice was in evidence in the MDG reports and 
PRSPs, including:   
</p>
<p> (a) Providing background information on the existence of minority groups within the 
country, including especially indicators on poverty, disaggregated by membership in an ethnic, 
religious or linguistic group and also by gender; 
</p>
<p> (b) Discussing in some detail the rationale behind the need for specially targeted 
poverty reduction measures for minorities, based on an analysis of disproportionate and 
persistent inequalities experienced by certain minority groups over time and the failure of 
previous approaches to benefit these groups; 
</p>
<p> (c) Including dedicated sections to outline measures for marginalized minority 
groups, both in terms of mainstreamed approaches and also details on targeted programmes; 
</p>
<p> (d) Giving specific attention to the situation of minority women and girls and 
providing targeted efforts to overcome the inequalities they experience; 
</p>
<p> (e) Discussing the importance of participation of minorities in the elaboration and 
implementation of MDG and PRSP-related development programmes and projects, especially at 
the level of local governance; 
</p>
<p> (f) Adding MDG-Plus Targets aimed at marginalized minorities and including 
ethnically disaggregated indicators for monitoring progress towards MDG and PRSP objectives; 
 (g) Making commitments to improve the legal framework for enabling citizens to 
better access their human rights; 
</p>
<p> (h) Taking a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction by including 
mainstreaming and targeted measures for minorities not only in the area of income growth but 
also key issues such as education, health, governance and access to information. 
</p>
<p> These efforts are promising on paper but much work remains to be done.  The 
independent expert strongly encourages States to provide more information on this promising 
practice, in particular on how policies are being implemented and evaluated on the ground.  
Overcoming long-entrenched inequalities is very difficult, often requiring not only additional 
and targeted resources but also a serious commitment to tackling underlying causes of this 
inequality, in particular that of direct and indirect discrimination. 
</p>
<p> Governments play the most important role in achieving the MDGs for minorities but 
there is also a vital contribution of the United Nations and its agencies and bodies.  On 18 and 
19 October 2006, UNDP in cooperation with the independent expert on minority issues 
convened in New York an international consultation on &#8220;UNDP&#8217;s Engagement with Minorities 
in Development Processes&#8221;.  The participants at that meeting made clear that UNDP can better 
integrate consideration of minority rights into the guidance and support it offers to governments 
on the MDGs.  They agreed that elaborating a Guidance/Policy Note for UNDP work with </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>minorities would be beneficial.  Several other entry points for improved cooperation were also 
identified, including strengthening collection of disaggregated data on MDGs, increasing 
participation of minorities in dialogues relating to MDGs and planning, and providing training to 
development practitioners on how to cooperate better with marginalized minorities.   
</p>
<p> It is important to emphasize that the overall approach to ensuring that minorities can 
benefit from MDGs and PRSPs should be a human rights-based approach<i>.</i>  The particular causes 
of poverty and low human development for minorities are often linked to other violations of their 
rights.  The independent expert uses a four point framework for the general protection of 
minority rights:  protecting a minority&#8217;s existence, including their physical integrity; protecting 
and promoting cultural and social identity; ensuring non-discrimination and equality, including 
ending structural or systemic discrimination; and ensuring effective participation of minorities in 
public life, especially in decisions that affect them.  These rights should be at the centre of 
national and international efforts to achieve MDGs and reduce poverty globally.   </p>

<p><b>ACHIEVING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS) FOR 
MINORITIES</b>:  <b>A REVIEW OF MDG COUNTRY REPORTS AND  
                              POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGIES</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. There are two key aid modalities that shape international development cooperation 
today - the set of targets contained in the universally agreed Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) and the nationally owned Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs).  The two 
modalities are intertwined:  PRSPs are the vehicle for achieving the MDGs and the MDGs 
provide concrete targets for PRSPs.   
</p>
<p>2. All countries have committed to working towards achievement of the MDGs by 2015.  
The Goals (see Annex 1) - agreed as part of the Millennium Declaration - call for a reduction of 
poverty, hunger, and maternal and child mortality rates; increased access to education - in 
particular for girls; more safe drinking water; improvements in the lives of slum dwellers; more 
sustainable development; and a reversal in the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major 
diseases.  Overarching these aims is the commitment in Goal 8 to &#8220;develop a global partnership 
for development&#8221;, which foresees changes in the international trade and financial regimes, more 
debt relief, better access to drugs and technology, and special attention to landlocked and small 
island developing States. 
</p>
<p>3. Both donor countries and countries receiving development assistance produce periodic 
reports on the steps they are taking to reach the MDGs.  A total of 143 States have submitted one 
or more MDG country reports.<b>1</b>  Some 52 countries have produced PRSPs (or Interim PRSPs) 
and donors seek to assist such countries with the realization of the policies set forth in the PRSP 
to achieve the MDGs.  
</p>
<p>4. This paper seeks to review the MDG country reports and selected PRSPs to illustrate if 
and how marginalized ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are reflected.  The MDGs and 
PRSPs were selected for review because they offer a useful starting point for reflecting on 
cross-regional practice in integrating minorities positively into development processes.   
</p>
<p>5. Recognizing that both MDG country reports and PRSPs are intended to be summary 
documents of a much more complex set of actions and policies, they nevertheless serve as useful 
proxies to identify the priorities and processes of a given State in its efforts to eradicate poverty 
and promote human development.  Within the pages of these reports can be found examples of 
good practice, innovations in participation of the poor, descriptions of progress made, and  
</p>

</p>
<p>*<b> </b> Corinne Lennox, a freelance consultant on minority rights and development and trainer on 
human rights was commissioned by the independent expert as an expert consultant on this 
review

</p>
<p>specific targets set for the future.  They offer an analysis of the particular development 
challenges faced by a country and often detail how specific regions and/or sections of the 
population face additional hurdles. 
</p>
<p>6. For this reason, a review of the MDG country reports and PRSPs can give insight into the 
kinds of issues and interventions that governments have identified as important for national 
policy on social and economic development.  This in turn can help reveal whether hurdles faced 
by particular regions or groups are being overcome through specially-considered programmes on 
the ground.  A recent review of the gender components of selected MDG country reports 
conducted by the UNDP revealed important insights into how gender perspectives and practice 
where reflected unevenly across the set of eight Goals.<b>2</b>  The report offered useful 
recommendations on how gender could be integrated better into MDG strategies and reporting.  
A similar desk study was conducted for the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues, reviewing how several MDG country reports considered the situation of indigenous 
peoples.<b>3</b>  The study concluded that very few of the reports examined had discussed indigenous 
peoples and none had provided disaggregated data on specific indigenous groups and their 
realization of the MDGs.   
</p>
<p>7. This review will focus primarily on persons belonging to ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities in line with the mandate of the independent expert.  The independent expert has 
established that in using the term &#8220;minorities,&#8221; the focus of her work is on distinct groups within 
societies that have faced long-term discrimination and disadvantage on the basis of a distinct 
national, ethnic, religious or linguistic identity.  The independent expert highlights that under her 
mandate &#8216;minority&#8217; status is not defined by numerical factors alone.  This report focuses on 
groups that are disproportionately disadvantaged and who are otherwise denied the power to 
protect their rights.  This review will also include discussion of indigenous peoples where these 
communities are mentioned in MDG country reports.  The excellent work being undertaken to 
ensure that indigenous peoples can benefit from MDGs and PRSPs should be supported fully.  
The independent expert expresses concern, however, that non-indigenous marginalized 
minorities are more likely to be omitted from MDG country reports and policy dialogues on 
poverty reduction.  This review will demonstrate this omission and seeks to encourage 
governments, international development actors and civil society to take further steps to include 
marginalized minorities in the MDGs.  
</p>
<p><i>Methodology: 
</i></p>
<p>8. The research in this report has been carried out by desk review of selected MDG country 
reports and PRSPs (see Annex II).  As of 1 November 2006, 182 MDG country reports had been 
submitted; of these 50 were selected for review based on ensuring regional representation and 
representation of countries receiving development assistance and donor countries.  Efforts were

<p> 
</p>
<p>made also to include a number of countries where minority issues are on the public policy 
agenda and/or where minorities are marginalized, with the hope of highlighting positive practice.  
This gives a selection bias towards those States most likely to include discussion of minorities in 
their MDG country reports.  In order to trace practice across policy documents, a small number 
of countries with PRSPs where also reviewed.  Each report was examined to determine whether: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; minorities are mentioned and if so, which minorities are named; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; data disaggregated by ethnicity is included; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reference is made to minorities under each of the eight Goals (or in the PRSP); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; programmes aimed specifically at minorities are discussed. 
</p>
<p>9. Given the time and resources available to prepare this report, sampling was necessary.  It 
was also difficult to undertake a detailed country-specific social, political and economic analysis 
for each of the MDG country reports reviewed.  Those with an in-depth knowledge of the 
countries considered here may be able to point to important information not captured in the 
analysis using the four-point criteria detailed above.  For example, in some countries the 
terminology of &#8216;minority&#8217;, &#8216;indigenous peoples&#8217;, &#8216;ethnicity&#8217; or similar terms may not be used; in 
other cases, certain ethnic groups may be strongly associated with distinct regions otherwise 
discussed in the MDG country report.  Every effort has been made to draw out relevant 
information on minority groups for each country, including searching for discussion of specific 
groups (e.g. Roma, African-descendants, Muslims) and trying to discern proxy discussion of 
minorities by region; if any important information has been overlooked, however, the 
independent expert highlights that she would welcome further details on this.   
</p>
<p>10. There are limitations with using the MDG country reports and PRSPs, not least because 
developed countries do not record their domestic policy on poverty reduction via such reports.  
Nevertheless, in their capacity as partners in international development cooperation, donor States 
have an equal responsibility to ensure that marginalized minorities can benefit from progress 
towards the MDGs and poverty reduction.  Marginalized minorities in developed countries also 
experience higher levels of poverty, less access to education, higher rates of child and maternal 
mortality and poorer health care.  This relative deprivation demands equal attention by 
developed countries within their domestic policy and should be considered part of the 
international commitment to achieve the MDGs.   
</p>
<p>11. Further information on State practice vis-&#224;-vis minorities in achieving the MDGs and 
within the PRSP processes would be greatly welcomed from States, including those reviewed in 
this analysis, and should be provided directly to the independent expert.  Especially where 
promising practice for minorities has been identified in the MDG or PRSP report, States are 
encouraged to provide more information on this practice, including through a dialogue with the 
independent expert, in particular on how policies are being implemented and evaluated on the 
ground.  It is hoped that this study will contribute to further research on the important issue of 
how to ensure that persons belonging to minorities benefit from and contribute to poverty 
reduction strategies globally.   </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  MINORITY RIGHTS AND THE MDGS 
</b></p>
<p>12. Ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are more likely to be poor in all regions of the 
world.  Human development indicators disaggregated by ethnicity or religion regularly show 
high and disproportionate levels of poverty and poor human development for persons belonging 
to minorities.  Marginalized minorities should therefore benefit from progress towards the 
MDGs.  Evidence suggests, however, that minorities are often left behind.   
</p>
<p>13. The particular causes of poverty and low human development for minorities are often 
linked to violations of their rights.  The independent expert uses a four point framework for the 
general protection of minority rights:  protecting a minority&#8217;s existence, including their physical 
integrity; protecting and promoting cultural and social identity; ensuring non-discrimination and 
equality, including ending structural or systemic discrimination; and ensuring effective 
participation of minorities in public life, especially in decisions that affect them. 
</p>
<p>14. Each of these rights is important to development processes and the achievement of the 
MDGs.  The right to existence is threatened when persons belonging to minorities have 
disproportionately higher rates of child and maternal mortality.  The right to non-discrimination 
is violated, for example, when persons belonging to minorities cannot access employment 
opportunities because of their identity or when public policies intentionally or unintentionally 
exclude minorities.  The right to participate in decision-making is violated when minorities do 
not have a say in consultations on PRSPs or MDGs-related strategies.  The cultural identity of 
minorities is under threat when mainstream development plans make it impossible for them to 
pursue their traditional livelihoods or when education curricula are only available in majority 
languages.  These human rights issues - existence, non-discrimination, cultural identity and 
participation - are little understood or inadequately addressed yet they can hold the key to 
improved development interventions.  Table 1 provides some key examples of how minority 
rights translate into concrete practice for MDG country reports and MDG policies.  Using a 
human rights-based approach to the MDGs can be a useful tool in ensuring that highly 
marginalized minorities can access and benefit from mainstream poverty reduction programmes.  
</p>
<p>15. At present, however, there is a genuine risk that the strategies used to achieve the MDGs 
will be less beneficial for minority groups, and might even increase inequalities and further harm 
some minority communities.  To date, the link between inclusion of minorities, protection of 
minority rights and realization of the MDGs has not been widely considered by development 
actors.<b>4</b>  This is in contrast with ongoing dialogues on gender and the MDGs<b>5</b> and the dialogue 
on the MDGs and indigenous peoples undertaken in recent sessions of the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues.

<p>16. The Millennium Declaration, in which the MDGs are elaborated, recognises the 
importance of protecting minority rights.  Therein States resolve to &#8220;strengthen the capacity of 
all our countries to implement the principles and practices of democracy and respect for human 
rights, <i>including minority rights&#8221;</i>.<b>6</b>  All efforts to achieve the MDGs must not loose sight of this 
important aim.  This point was noted in the<i> Human Development Report 2003.  Millennium 
Development Goals:  A compact among nations to end human poverty</i>: 
</p>
<p>In a number of countries the Goals could be met more easily simply by improving the 
circumstances of people already better off &#8230; But while this approach may fit the letter of 
the Goals, it does not fit their spirit.  Women, rural inhabitants, <i>ethnic minorities</i> and 
other poor people are typically progressing slower than national averages - or showing no 
progress - even where countries as a whole are moving towards the Goals.<b>7</b>  
</p>
<p>17. Greater effort is needed to ensure that minorities who are poor benefit fairly from the 
international commitment to reduce poverty and meet the MDGs by 2015.  Governments play 
the most important role in this regard but it is important to also consider the vital contribution of 
the United Nations and its agencies.  Several MDG initiatives have been supported under the 
direction of the United Nations Secretary-General and the lead United Nations agency, UNDP.  
The United Nations has committed to a human rights based approach to development in all of its 
work and the central place of protection of minorities must not be forgotten.  The Millennium 
Project supports this view with the call to States to ensure that special attention is paid to groups 
like minorities in the elaboration of poverty reduction strategies, in a manner that is consistent 
with human rights:   
</p>
<p>National MDG-based poverty reduction strategies should be consistent with the principle 
of equality and non-discrimination laid down in applicable international human rights 
standards.  This implies that strategies are designed to reach the entire underserved 
population, irrespective of ethnicity, religion, regional background or gender.  It also 
implies taking steps to ensure that the most underprivileged and marginalized sections of 
society can exercise their rights.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>18. The Millennium Project can continue to promote this understanding through its own 
work on the MDGs, including in the pilot projects for the Millennium Villages that aim to apply

<p>good practice for achieving the MDGs.  Similarly, the Millennium Campaign, that reaches out to 
civil society, can take steps to ensure that marginalized minorities are engaged in national 
campaigns on the MDGs. 
</p>
<p>19. The independent expert has commended the UNDP, which takes a lead role within 
United Nations Country Teams in supporting governments on the MDGs, for its leadership in 
trying to strengthen United Nations cooperation with minorities.  A 2-day meeting was convened 
by the UNDP in cooperation with the independent expert in October 2006 for an &#8220;Initial 
Consultation on UNDP&#8217;s Engagement with Minorities in Development Processes&#8221;.  The meeting 
brought together UNDP representatives from several Country Teams to review the UNDP&#8217;s 
cooperation with marginalized minority groups in the practice areas of poverty reduction/MDGs, 
good governance and crisis prevention and recovery.  The lessons learned from existing 
cooperation with indigenous peoples were also considered.  The participants at that meeting 
made clear that UNDP can better integrate consideration of minority rights into the guidance and 
support it offers to governments on the MDGs.  They agreed that elaborating a Guidance/Policy 
Note for its work with minorities would be beneficial.  Several other entry points for improved 
cooperation where also identified.  For example, the <i>MDG Reporting Guidelines</i> can give more 
specific recommendations on the collection of data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender and 
social group.  Minorities can be supported to participate in national dialogues on the MDGs.  
United Nations Country Teams can be offered additional training on how to ensure that 
minorities benefit from the MDGs.  
</p>
<p>20. The UNDP&#8217;s new Global Human Rights Programme includes a budget line for pilot 
initiatives with minorities, providing the baseline financial commitment to push forward this 
important work.  In this regard, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) can also play a role.  OHCHR staff have expertise on minorities and on human 
rights based approaches to development and they have recently established a specific unit to 
focus more of their work on the MDGs.  These and other United Nations actors could more 
effectively pool their resources and expertise to ensure that marginalized minorities are able to 
achieve the MDGs by 2015.   
</p>
<p>21. The MDG country reports are one important vehicle for working towards this aim.  
Notwithstanding the concerns that the MDGs cannot be met at current rates of progress, national 
and international cooperation to reach the 2015 targets remains a high priority.  The Reports 
offer a space for reflecting on progress to date and identifying priorities for future efforts on the 
MDGs.  Given that many minorities are clearly lagging behind, the MDG country reports should 
reflect these concerns and translate them into national policy responses.  Often this is not the 
case as evidenced by this review of a selection of MDG country reports below.  Table 1 lists 
some of the positive practice that should be reflected in the MDG Reports and in MDG policies.  
The review will highlight the good practice where it exists and give recommendations on how 
States and the international community could be doing better.   </p>

<p><b>II.  MDG COUNTRY REPORTS REVIEW 
</b></p>
<p>22. Minorities exist in each of the countries examined and in many cases those minorities are 
economically, socially and/or politically marginalized.  In the case of donor countries, minorities 
are present in countries with which they have development cooperation activities (as well as in 
their own countries).  The imperative for considering the particular situation of minorities in 
MDG strategies is high for all of the countries considered here. 
</p>
<p>23. Ethnic or linguistic minorities are mentioned in only 19 of the 50 MDG country reports 
reviewed.  Religious minorities are mentioned in only four of the MDG country reports and in 
only two of these Reports are 
inequalities experienced by members of 
particular religious minorities noted (in 
Nepal and Thailand).  An additional 10 
reports mention only indigenous 
peoples without identifying any other 
minority groups.  The degree to which 
minorities are mentioned varies widely, 
with some Reports providing a good 
range of information under several of 
the Goals and providing disaggregated 
data.  In other cases, minorities are 
mentioned only in the background section describing the national population but without 
particular attention to their situation in relation to the Goals.   
</p>
<p>24. Given the length of the MDG Reports, it is difficult for authors to go into great detail 
about any policies and programmes but some reports do make a good effort to give a broader and 
considered picture of the situation of marginalized minorities.  This is the case in 11 of the 
50 MDG country reports that discuss the situation of minorities under 4 or more of the Goals 
(these are:  Brazil, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Peru, the Philippines, 
Venezuela and Vietnam).  No Country Report discusses minorities under each of the 8 Goals; the 
most is under 6 Goals by Mexico (for indigenous peoples) and Vietnam (for ethnic minorities).   
</p>
<p>25. Brazil&#8217;s MDG Report acknowledges that &#8220;inequality in Brazil is also related to race, 
affecting blacks and mulattos more intensely&#8230;86% of those in the most privileged class were 
white, while 65% of the poorest were blacks or mulattos&#8221; (Goal 1).  The report goes on to 
highlight the particular challenges faced by Afro-Brazilians in accessing education (Goal 2), 
including for the girl child (Goal 3); accessing health care (Goal 6); and in securing adequate 
housing, where &#8220;The most affected social groups are the poor and the afro-descendant 
population, who live in areas with higher levels of inadequate housing and do not have access to 
credit for housing purposes&#8221; (Goal 7). 
</p>
<p>26. Bulgaria&#8217;s MDG Report gives extensive attention to Roma and ethnic Turks, who 
are 10 times and 4 times respectively more likely to be poor than ethnic Bulgarians (Goal 1).  
The lower level of literacy and schooling of these groups are noted (Goal 2), as are the higher 
rates of child mortality (Goal 4) and higher rates of contraction of tuberculosis (Goal 6). 
</p>
<p><b>Box 1</b>:  <b>Where are minorities? 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Only 38 per cent of the MDG reports examined 
mentioned minorities or &#8216;ethnic groups&#8217; at 
least once.  In most cases, minorities were 
mentioned only briefly and without indicators 
on their progress towards the MDGs. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Only 11 of the MDG Country Reports reviewed 
mention minorities under four or more of the 
Goals. </i></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27. Ecuador&#8217;s MDG Report provides many examples in relation to indigenous peoples but 
only briefly notes the Afro-Ecuadorian population (in respect of a programme entitled 
PRODEPINE that address poverty for these two groups) (Goal 1).  The higher level of child 
mortality amongst indigenous peoples is described (Goal 4), along with higher rates of 
tuberculosis (Goal 6) and lower levels of education amongst indigenous girls (Goal 3).  The 
important role of indigenous peoples in helping secure protection for the environment (Goal 7) is 
noted.   
</p>
<p>28. The MDG Report for Laos reports that &#8220;poverty is much more widespread in rural and 
mountainous area where most of the ethnic groups live&#8221; (Goal 1).  The challenges of accessing 
education for ethnic minorities is also discussed, given that Lao is the language of instruction 
and the girl child often faces cultural practices that limit her educational opportunities (Goal 2 
and 3).  The poor accessibility for ethnic minorities to health facilities (Goal 5) and the higher 
rates of tuberculosis and malaria (Goal 6) that they experience is also cited as a priority area of 
concern.  
</p>
<p><b>Box 2:  Minorities and the MDG Country Reports at a Glance 
</b></p>
<p>! <i>19 out of 50 reports mention minorities or &#8216;ethnic groups&#8217;; an additional 10 reports mention 
only indigenous peoples without identifying any other minority groups. Only 2 reports 
discuss the situation of marginalized religious minorities.  
</i></p>
<p>! <i>17 reports mention minorities in connection with Goal 1 on poverty reduction.  A further 4 
reports do not mention minorities but do disaggregate poverty data by region which 
conceivably could be used as a proxy for specific territorially concentrated groups. 
</i></p>
<p>! <i>19 reports mention minorities in connection with Goal 2 on universal primary education.  
Only 11 countries mention minorities under both Goals 1 and 2.  
</i></p>
<p>! <i>7 reports give attention to the situation of minority girls/women under Goal 3. 
</i></p>
<p>! <i>10 reports give attention to the situation of health and/or health care access for minorities 
under Goal 4. 
</i></p>
<p>! <i>5 reports give attention to minorities and maternal health under Goal 5. 
</i></p>
<p>! <i>14 reports give attention to minorities when discussing Goal 6. 
</i></p>
<p>! <i>12 reports give attention to minorities when discussing Goal 7. 
</i></p>
<p>! <i>Only one report mentions minorities under Goal 8, in this case (Sudan) in relation to youth 
employment and combating discrimination. 
</i></p>
<p>! <i>Only 11 MDG Country Reports discussion the situation of minorities under 4 or more of the 
Goals (these are:  Brazil, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Peru, the 
Philippines, Venezuela and Vietnam).  No Country Report discusses minorities under each of 
the 8 Goals (the most is 6).   
</i></p>
<p>! <i>12 reports provide at least one example of data disaggregated by ethnicity.  Another 13 
reports provide at least some data by region, which could be used as a proxy measure.  </i> </p>

</p>
<p>29. The Malaysia MDG Report provided extensive disaggregation of data along Malaysia&#8217;s 
three main ethnic communities:  the Bumiputera (Malays and other indigenous groups), Chinese, 
and Indians.  The report indicates that &#8220;Ethnic differences remain marked (poverty incidence 
in 2002 being 7.3 per cent for Bumiputera, 1.5 per cent for Chinese, and 1.9 per cent for 
Indians), but at a much lower level of incidence of poverty than previously.  The vast majority of 
remaining poor households are Bumiputera, with a significant proportion of these being the 
Orang Asli and the indigenous communities of Sabah and Sarawak.&#8221; (Goal 1).  The report 
emphasizes the importance of reducing ethnic disparities in attainment of reduced child and 
maternal mortality (Goal 4 and 5); identifies ethnic differentials in incidence of HIV/AIDS 
(Goal 6); and gives details on the provision for minority language schools in Chinese and Tamil 
(Goal 2). 
</p>
<p>30. Mexico provides extensive information on the situation of indigenous peoples in the 
MDG Report.  No other minority groups, such as Afro-Mexicans, are discussed.  The higher 
rates of poverty of indigenous peoples are recognized and some programmes to address this are 
outlined (Goal 1).  The report indicates that &#8220;40% of the indigenous population of 15 years old 
has not finished primary school&#8221;, highlighting the gap in reaching universal primary education 
(Goal 2).  The highest rates of maternal mortality are among the indigenous population (Goal 5) 
and child mortality for indigenous peoples can be three times higher than the national average in 
some municipalities (Goal 4).  Lower human development is also caused by the use of firewood 
as fuel among indigenous populations (Goal 7).  The government is undertaking specific actions 
towards indigenous peoples to help overcome high incidence of preventable disease (Goal 6). 
</p>
<p>31. Nepal&#8217;s ethnic and social diversity is reflected in its MDG Report.  Several groups are 
named in the report, including Dalits, Muslims, Magar, Newar, Rai, Gurung and Limbu, 
Janajatis, Tharu and the Tamang.  On poverty, the report notes that &#8220;caste and ethnicity are 
important variables that reflect variation in the poverty rate.  For instance, the lowest 
consumption levels are among low caste Dalits with poverty incidence of 46%, Muslims with 
41% and hill Janajatis (ethnic communities) with 45%&#8221; (Goal 1).  The diversity in educational 
attainment is also detailed, where some ethnic minorities obtain higher than average levels of 
education and others achieve significantly lower than average levels of education (Goal 2).  
Information on the levels of immunization are given disaggregated by ethnicity (Goal 4).   
</p>
<p>32. The MDG Report of Peru gives attention to the situation of indigenous peoples.  The 
Afro-descendant population in Peru is not discussed.  The economic exclusion of indigenous 
peoples is recognized (Goal 1).  Indigenous peoples are also reported to have less access to 
health care in the rural areas where they live (Goal 5) and they are 30 per cent less likely to have 
access to a measles vaccine (Goal 6).  Access to water is also a serious problem:  &#8220;Access to 
water and plumbing is much more critical in the 1,450 indigenous forest communities, where 
only 12% have water supply and 10% have access to plumbing&#8221; (Goal 7). 
</p>
<p>33. The Philippines&#8217; MDG Report gives particular attention to education for indigenous 
peoples.  No other ethnic or religious minorities are mentioned in the Report.  Projects have been 
adopted to prioritize education provision in underserved indigenous communities (Goal 2).  
Literacy programmes for indigenous women and girls have also been adopted (Goal 3).  
Indigenous peoples are acknowledged to be at higher risk for HIV/AIDS (Goal 6).  On 
sustainable development, &#8220;with the Community Based Forest Management Programme </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(CBFMP), participation of local communities, indigenous peoples and other stakeholders are 
strengthened in the protection, management, development and conservation of forestlands and 
resources&#8221; (Goal 7). 
</p>
<p>34. Venezuela also focuses on indigenous peoples in its MDG Report.  The lower levels of 
education attainment are a priority concern (Goals 2) as are the efforts to ensure housing 
programmes benefit indigenous children (Goal 4).  Higher rates of hunger among indigenous 
populations are evidenced by the fact that indigenous peoples are over half those attending 
&#8220;popular and communitarian kitchens or canteens [of the 18,520 people attending, 10,845 are 
indigenous]&#8221; (Goal 1).  Indigenous communities are also less likely to have access to water or 
plumbing (Goal 7). 
</p>
<p>35. The high rates of poverty of ethnic minorities get particular attention in Vietnam&#8217;s MDG 
Report.  The report indicates that &#8220;Differences in income levels and living standards have 
increased between&#8230;the ethnic minorities and the Kinh people&#8221; (Goal 1).  Educational enrolment 
is lower for ethnic minority children and &#8220;access to education and training for girls and women 
from ethnic minority groups in mountainous, remote and isolated regions is more difficult than 
for boys and men&#8221; (Goals 2 and 3).  Access to maternal health care is poorest in the regions 
where minorities live (Goal 5).  The need to improve land tenure security for ethnic minorities is 
a key target and a &#8220;number of essential infrastructure projects (transportation, irrigation, water, 
schools, health clinics) are build [sic] quickly to improve the productive activities and living 
conditions of ethnic minorities&#8221; (Goal 7).  The additional Vietnam Development Goals included 
specific targets for culture of ethnic minorities to &#8220;preserve and develop the literacy of ethnic 
minority languages in areas where ethnic minority becomes the majority&#8221; and &#8220;increase radio 
and television broadcasting time and programs in ethnic languages&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i>Disaggregated Data, Targets and Indicators: 
</i></p>
<p>36. The MDGs come with a set of 18 targets and 48 recommended indicators to measure 
progress towards the targets and Goals.  There are five indicators that call for disaggregation of 
data by sex, mostly in relation to Goal 3.  The disaggregation of data by ethnicity is <i>not</i> included 
among the recommended indicators.  Without this kind of data, the impact of MDG strategies on 
different groups cannot be measured accurately.  A marginalized ethnic or religious minority 
group may be experiencing increased levels of poverty as resources are diverted to meet the 
needs of the &#8216;less poor&#8217;; in the absence of disaggregated data, this negative impact may go 
unnoticed.   
</p>
<p><b>Box 3:  Missing disaggregated data 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Only 24 per cent of the MDG reports examined included any data disaggregated by ethnicity.   
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Several reports did offer some data by region, but over half of the reports failed to provide any 
disaggregated data that could be used as a proxy for measuring the progress of minorities 
towards the MDGs. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Several reports indicated plans for data collection reform, which could provide opportunities 
for the inclusion of ethno-cultural data in future MDG progress reports.  </i> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>37. The invisibility of the economic, social and political status of minorities is evidenced also 
in the MDG Reports reviewed.  Only 12 of the reports provide at least one example of data 
disaggregated by ethnicity.  Another 13 reports provide some data by region, which could be 
used as a proxy measure for minority groups that are territorially concentrated. 
</p>
<p>38. The lack of disaggregated data by ethnicity is recognized as a weakness and a barrier to 
effective policy-making in a few reports.  Laos&#8217; MDG Report admits &#8220;Data used in this report 
are national averages, which hide strong disparities between gender, ethnic minorities, poor and 
less poor, rural and remote areas&#8221;.  In Botswana, the MDG Report similarly notes:   
</p>
<p>Aggregate measures of success sometimes mask significant inequalities - geographical, 
intergenerational, <i>ethnic</i>, gender based, etc.  Lack of disaggregated indicators of 
development may mask significant differences among constituencies.  It thus makes for 
inefficient policymaking and disempowers decentralized institutions of governance. 
(emphasis added) 
</p>
<p>39. Several MDG Reports express a strong commitment on the part of the government to 
improve data collection in MDG monitoring.  There is real scope, therefore, for integrating 
collection of data by ethnicity into these plans.  Tanzania&#8217;s MDG Report, for example, foresees a 
&#8220;Poverty Monitoring Master Plan [that] will detail a systematic approach for collecting a 
wide-range of poverty- related information, including:  periodic surveys, routine administrative 
data, poverty research and participatory poverty assessments.&#8221;  According to its 2004 MDG 
Country Report, Sudan also seeks to overcome gaps in data:  &#8220;This will mean defining indicators 
where needed and gathering data so as to assemble comparable and high-quality social 
indicators&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>40. An important innovation in a few of the MDG Reports is the inclusion of 
minority-specific targets and indicators.  Romania&#8217;s MDG Report includes an additional target 
under Goal 2 to &#8220;reduce illiteracy among the Roma&#8221;.  Thailand has an MDG Plus framework, 
which strengthens the minimum requirements of the MDGs indicators.  According to the MDG 
Report of Thailand:   
</p>
<p>The MDG Plus framework improves on the original MDG indicators in three important 
ways.  First, it ensures that the indicators take into account quality information for more 
advanced monitoring that may be missing from the original MDG indicators.  Second, it 
ensures that the scope of monitoring progress is expanded to measure the benefits to all 
members of Thai society.  Third, it accounts for differences in geographic coverage, as 
aggregated national indicators may cover up serious regional and<i> ethnic disparities</i>.  
(emphasis added) 
</p>
<p>41. Thailand has MDG Plus indicators focused on regions with the highest proportion of 
ethnic minorities (i.e. &#8220;highland areas, northern provinces and the three southernmost 
provinces&#8221;) for Goal 1 on poverty reduction and Goal 4 and 5 on child and maternal mortality.  
</p>
<p>42. In the Vietnam MDG Report, targets for ethnic minorities are included under the 
Vietnam Social Development and Poverty Reduction Goals, a set of additional goals outlining 
specific priorities for Vietnam.  Of these, one is to &#8220;Develop culture and information to improve </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>spiritual life of people; preserve culture of ethnic minority groups&#8221;, including targets on 
provision of broadcasting and development of literacy in ethnic minority languages; support to 
greater participation of ethnic minorities in public administration; ensuring land rights for ethnic 
minorities; and improved provision of social services (e.g. health, information services) to ethnic 
minorities.   
</p>
<p><i>Goal 1:  Poverty Reduction and Elimination of Hunger

<p><i>$1 a day. 
</i></p>
<p>o <i>Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. 
</i>43. 17 of the reports give some consideration to the situation of minorities (or indigenous 
peoples) under Goal 1.  A further four reports do not mention minorities but do disaggregate 
poverty data by region which could be used as a proxy for territorially concentrated minority 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b>Box 4:  MDG Plus Targets and Indicators </b></p>
<p><i>Some States are adding to the existing list of 18 targets and 48 indicators for the MDGs through the 
adoption of &#8216;MDG Plus Indicators&#8217;.  This can include new targets for marginalized minorities, such 
as:   
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>adding targets for regions in which the poorest minorities live;  
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>adding targets to close the inequality gap between minorities and other groups under specific 
Goals such as health or education; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>adding targets to address the particular challenges of marginalized minorities, 
e.g. increasing literacy.  
</i></p>
<p><b>Box 5:  Good practice on poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p><i>Several reports recognized that minorities on average have higher rates of poverty.  Some states 
are taking action, including: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Publishing disaggregated data on poverty; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Undertaking baseline studies on the experiences of poverty by minorities; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Adopting national strategies to reduce poverty for the poorest minorities; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Using affirmative action policies to increase public employment opportunities for minorities. </i></p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44. Poverty, as discussed above, is commonly more acute for persons belonging to minorities 
than for other groups within a country.  This may be due to unequal access to social services; 
living in remote regions with poor infrastructure; insecure land rights and less access to justice, 
putting minorities at higher risk of displacement and landlessness.  The impact of discrimination 
is an overarching factor.  Discrimination can decrease access to health, education, financial 
credit, housing and employment - each compounding the likelihood of living in poverty.  Due to 
a lack of disaggregated data, the inequalities experienced by minorities usually are invisible in 
public policy discourses, where minorities also often lack a strong political voice.   
</p>
<p>45. About a third of the MDG Reports reviewed recognized that minorities (and/or 
indigenous peoples) within the country had higher rates of poverty.  Kenya, for example, notes in 
its MDG Report that &#8220;Pastoralists are a major vulnerable group as they are always susceptible to 
droughts and have poor resource endowment&#8221;, but does not provide any corresponding data on 
poverty levels for pastoralists or other ethnic, religious, or linguistic groups.  Only nine reports 
provided some disaggregated poverty data by ethnicity (Belize, Brazil, Bulgaria, Hungary, 
Malaysia, Namibia, Nepal, Romania, Vietnam).  Malaysia stood out for providing a longer-view 
analysis of poverty reduction by ethnicity, supplying statistical trends since 1970.  The Report 
also indicated that special monitoring is being commissioned to better understand the poverty of 
particularly marginalized groups; for example &#8220;A special Household Income Survey (HIS) to 
gather information on household income of Bumiputera minorities in Sabah and Sarawak was 
conducted in 2002&#8221;.  Thailand also indicated that it has plans to improve its data collection 
processes on poverty:  &#8220;A number of tools are required including a poverty map of all regions 
(with attention to the Northeast and the three southern- most provinces [these are regions with a 
high proportion of minority groups]) and a more thorough poverty profile of disadvantaged 
groups that will illustrate areas of most need in a systemic and continuous manner.  The 
Government&#8217;s poverty registration will also help to establish and maintain a list of the poor in 
every province.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>46. The need for targeted poverty reduction programmes for marginalized minorities was 
also acknowledged in a small number of reports.  China&#8217;s MDG Report sees that &#8220;Reducing the 
disproportionately high poverty rate among ethnic minorities&#8221; is a key challenge and for poverty 
reduction programmes, &#8220;The priority is given to remote mountainous regions, ethnic minorities 
and extremely poor areas&#8221;.  Romania has adopted a &#8220;national strategy to improve the lives of the 
Roma population&#8221;.  Hungary&#8217;s MDG Report similarly gives information on the &#8220;3 year plan to 
improve the situation of the Roma&#8221;.  Vietnam&#8217;s MDG Report indicates &#8220;more jobs will be 
created and priority given to ethnic minorities in public employment&#8221; and &#8220;efforts will be made 
to continue policy development to support poor ethnic minority people in production, trade, and 
bringing their produce to market&#8221;.  A program for loans with subsidized interest is being offered 
to ethnic minorities in the poorest regions.  In Mexico, a special budget aimed at promoting 
development in indigenous communities has been included in the general budget since 2002. 
</p>
<p>47. Minorities are virtually absent from the MDG reports from donor countries.  As part of 
its poverty reduction efforts through agriculture, Norway commits to support &#8220;Indigenous 
peoples&#8217; efforts to preserve their culture, realize their rights and participate in development 
processes.&#8221;  More generic terms are typically used, with policies targeting the &#8216;vulnerable&#8217;, </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8216;disadvantaged&#8217; or &#8216;excluded&#8217;.  
Switzerland&#8217;s &#8220;bilateral programmes [on 
poverty] place a strong focus on advocacy, 
participation, empowerment and capacity 
building targeted to disadvantaged and 
marginalized groups.&#8221;  The UK Department 
for International Development (DFID) 
focuses on &#8216;social exclusion&#8217; and vulnerable 
groups in its analysis; although minorities 
are not mentioned explicitly, DFID has &#8220;established a Working Group on Inequality and Social 
Exclusion, to help understand the role of inequalities in slowing progress towards both the 
income and non-income MDGs.&#8221;  Donor countries should ensure that in their country strategies 
for development cooperation that details on the situation of minorities, including in relation to 
the MDG-strategies supported, is provided in full.   
</p>
<p>48. Only a few of the MDG Reports reviewed paid attention to minorities and hunger.  
Ecuador&#8217;s MDG Report notes &#8220;Malnutrition affects mainly rural and indigenous populations&#8221;.  
Although Rwanda&#8217;s MDG Report does not mention minorities, the report does recognize the 
need to &#8220;Include the development of adequate information systems to collect reliable data and 
identify food insecure and vulnerable groups.  This could also provide useful information for 
targeted activities.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>49. The MDG on hunger should be sensitive to the integral links between many minority 
cultures and food production, devising strategies to ensure this is protected in the long-term.  
Food has certain cultural aspects, associated with how a community or people grows, prepares 
and eats it.  Cultural acceptability is a core aspect of the right to adequate food.<b>9</b>  When a 
community&#8217;s food-growing capacity is constrained or their ability to secure their traditional food 
is curtailed, elements of their cultures may also be threatened.  Some cultural sensitivity was in 
evidence in the MDG Report for Belize.  The Government of Belize is supporting &#8220;Programs to 
ensure that within the context of their cultural and personal preferences the Mayan diet is 
balanced to ensure adequate consumption of basic nutritional substances, particularly in the case 
of children.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Goal 2.  Achieve universal primary education  
</i></p>
<p>o <i>Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to 
complete a full course of primary schooling. 
</i></p>
<p>50. Minorities are mentioned more under Goal 2 on education than under any other Goal.  
Nineteen MDG Reports mention minorities in connection with Goal 2.  Persons belonging to 
minorities face several barriers in accessing education equally, including:  lack of mother-tongue 
education; poor provision of schools and qualified teachers in regions where minorities live; 
prohibitive costs of school fees that disproportionately impact on minorities (as the poorest 
groups); curricula that do not reflect community priorities for learning; and discrimination by 
teachers and/or pupils.

<p><b>Box 6:  Donors can do more for minorities </b></p>
<p><i>Minorities are not mentioned in-depth in any of 
the donor MDG reports reviewed.  While these 
reports do note the importance of focusing on the 
most &#8216;vulnerable&#8217; groups, none have adequately 
acknowledged that minorities may face 
particular barriers to achieving the MDGs. </i></p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>51. Several MDG Reports recognise some of these difficulties.  Botswana&#8217;s MDG Report 
discusses that there are &#8220;groups in society - ethnic minorities, remote area dwellers, religious 
minorities etc. - that face particular access [to education] problems of the type that generate 
significant horizontal inequalities&#8221;.  The Report identifies increasing attendance in schools of 
children from Nomadic communities as a major challenge.  Namibia&#8217;s MDG Reports indicates 
&#8220;Although the policy framework is in place, greater effort is needed to provide quality education 
for children of marginalized groups such as the San, Ovahimba, farm workers, and those living 
under extreme poverty&#8221;.  In Brazil, the MDG Report indicates that &#8220;Young whites aged 15 to 17 
in secondary education have almost double the attendance of young blacks and mulattos.  In 
higher education, this difference increases fourfold&#8221;; in response, the &#8220;government&#8217;s focus in the 
education area [seeks to] to address the lack of an education policy focusing on diversity and 
citizenship, particularly directed towards specific social segments, such as afro-descendants and 
indigenous populations.&#8221;  In Mexico, statistics show that &#8220;39% of the indigenous population 
between 5 and 24 years old do not go to school.  Additionally, 40% of the indigenous population 
of 15 years old has not finished primary school&#8221;.  To help overcome these inequalities, the 
government has developed the &#8220;Programa de Cursos Comunitarios y el de Atenci&#243;n Educativa a 
Poblaci&#243;n Ind&#237;gena&#8221;.  The serious problem of segregation of Roma in schooling is acknowledged 
in Hungary&#8217;s MDG Report.  In response: 
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has launched a programme that financially supports the preparation of 
Roma children for integrated education.  The aim of the programme is to provide assistance to 
the schools to eliminate the separate classes, and to enable pupils, with the help of tutoring, to 
participate in integrated classes.  The modification of the Law on Public Education will in turn 
review the present system of directing children to special education schools.   
</p>
<p>52. Romania is also focusing on Roma&#8217;s access to education through the &#8220;Strategy for 
Stimulating the Participation in Education of Roma Children and Youth&#8221;.  Moreover, the MDG 
Report includes a separate target under Goal 2:  &#8220;Target 7:  Increase the literacy rate of the Roma 
population&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>53. Several reports discuss minority 
language education.  Kazakhstan has 
adopted the &#8220;Education for All&#8221; 
approach in its efforts to reach Goal 2.  
Ethnic minorities are identified as a 
vulnerable group in need of support to 
access education.  The MDG Report 
indicates that Kazakhstan provides 
education in five languages (Kazakh, 
Russian, Uigur, Uzbek, and Tajik) and 
gives details on the number of children 
being taught using these languages and 
public expenditure on education by 
region (Table 2.D and Table 2.1).  The 
MDG Report acknowledges, however, 
that &#8220;The provision of teacher training for teachers in ethnic minority schools (Uigur, Uzbek) is 
currently not meeting actual needs.  The provision of textbooks is also still insufficient.  To  
</p>
<p><b>Box 7:  Good practice on education 
</b></p>
<p>Minorities are mentioned most frequently under 
Goal 2 on education.  Some of the good 
practices noted include: 
&#8226; <i>Offering education in minority languages;  
</i>&#8226; <i>Providing disaggregated data on children able to 
</i></p>
<p><i>access education in their mother tongue; 
</i>&#8226; <i>Adopting additional MDG targets for minorities 
</i></p>
<p><i>in relation to education;  
</i>&#8226; <i>Reviewing national laws to help eliminate 
</i></p>
<p><i>discrimination against minority children in 
access</i> <i>to education.</i> </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sustain quality in minority schools, allocation of significant funding is required.&#8221; The MDG 
Report of Laos notes &#8220;Education is in the Lao language.  This can be very difficult for children 
in non-Lao speaking ethnic minority groups&#8221;; indeed the ethnic disparities in education levels 
are acknowledged in the report, albeit without disaggregated data.  One of the stated objectives 
under Goal 2 in Nepal is &#8220;Ensuring the rights of indigenous people and linguistic minorities to 
quality basic and primary education through their mother tongue&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>54. In Malaysia, the constitution recognizes the existence of &#8220;two types of primary schools in 
Malaysia, the national and national-type (Tamil and Chinese) schools.  The medium of 
instruction in national schools is Bahasa Malaysia, while in national-type schools the medium of 
instruction is Tamil or Chinese, although Bahasa Malaysia is a compulsory subject.&#8221;  The MDG 
Report indicates that this approach helps support &#8220; social unity&#8221; and integration.  The Vietnam 
MDG Report notes, &#8220;for ethnic minority children, language as they start school is a challenge&#8221;.  
The report goes on to say, &#8220;ethnic language training is organized in 25 provinces and the 
Ministry of Training and Education publishes text books in eight ethnic languages&#8221;.  Specific 
data on the number of minority children able to access some mother tongue language training is 
also provided.  
</p>
<p><i>Goal 3.  Promote gender equality and empower women 
</i></p>
<p>o <i>Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005 
and in all levels of education no later than 2015. 
</i></p>
<p>55. Eliminating gender disparity in access to education will be much more difficult for 
minority girls and women than for others.  This is because of &#8220;intersectional discrimination&#8221;, or 
the compound impact of discrimination based on gender and discrimination based on ethnic, 
religious or linguistic identity.  Only seven of the MDG reports give any attention to the situation 
of minority girls/women under Goal 3.  This is indicative of the high levels of &#8216;invisibility&#8217; and 
marginalization of minority girls and women.  Moreover, only two reports provide disaggregated 
data by ethnicity and gender for education:  Brazil and Kosovo.  The Kosovo MDG Report, for 
example, indicates:  &#8220;While 97% of Albanian girls, 99% of Serb girls, and 69% of girls of other 
minorities attend primary schools, only 56% of Albanian and 40% of non-Serb minority girls 
attend secondary schools&#8221;.  Minority girls may find it more difficult because of language barriers 
to integrate into schools and may have less familial support to their education because parents 
(especially mothers) similarly lack the necessary language skills to assist their children.  There 
may also be particular cultural norms in relation to the role of women and girls in some minority 
communities that restrict their equal opportunities for education.  This problem was highlighted 
in the MDG Report of Laos and of Ethiopia.  The Ethiopian MDG Report goes on to say, &#8220;Lack 
of data does not allow for such an important issue to be dealt with in greater depth&#8221;. 
Opportunities for minority girls to access education are also closely linked to higher poverty 
rates of minorities, with minority girl children being more likely to remain at home to support 
the family&#8217;s welfare. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>56. In the Philippines, the MDG 
Report indicates that some important 
steps have been taken to address these 
issues:  &#8220;The government also expanded 
alternative non-formal education systems 
for indigenous communities such as 
Magbasa Kita (Let Us Read) that teaches 
women and girls and parents of working 
children to read.  School-based child- 
minding centres were also set up in the 
cultural communities so older children, 
mostly girls of school age who take care 
of younger siblings, can attend classes 
despite baby-sitting chores.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>57. Many MDG Reports take a wider view of gender equality measures beyond the narrow 
target on education under Goal 3.  Of the reports reviewed a small number discussed gender 
equality policies that engage minority women.  In Nepal, &#8220;a program of affirmative 
discrimination will be formulated and implemented to give due representation to women, Dalit 
and ethnic groups in the public administration&#8221;.  Similarly, in May 2002, the Government of 
Brazil introduced the National Program for Affirmative Action under which &#8220;the agencies of the 
Federal Public Administration must establish participation quotas for blacks, women and people 
with disabilities in filling the DAS [high-level civil service] positions.&#8221;  Also in Brazil the First 
National Conference on Women&#8217;s Policies was held in July 2004 and included participation of 
indigenous and black representatives.  
</p>
<p>58. It should be noted that gender inequality does not always relate to women.  In Brazil, 
there are small inequalities in access to primary school by gender or race (3% difference by race) 
but it is black or mulatto <i>males</i> who are least likely to access secondary and higher education:  
&#8220;although women are present in higher education numbers regardless of race, among the black 
and mulatto population the ratio increases:  it leaps to 125.9%, reaching 143.3% in higher 
education.&#8221;  The MDG Report attributes this to &#8220;the even more increased dropout of black and 
mulatto men to enter the labour market, and to the phenomenon of discrimination, which affects 
blacks and mulattos of both genders and ends up moving them away from school.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Goals 4, 5, 6.  Reduce child mortality.  Improve maternal health.  Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria 
and other diseases. 
</p>
<p>o <i>Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate. 
</i>o <i>Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio.

<p>o <i>Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
</i>o <i>Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major

</i></p>
<p><b>Box 8:  Invisibility of minority women 
</b></p>
<p><i>Only 4 per cent of reports reviewed provided any 
data disaggregated by gender and ethnicity.  The 
invisibility of minority women is reinforced by this 
lack of information on their progress towards the 
Goals.  Some good practice included: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Establishing non-formal literacy programmes 
targeted for women; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Adopting affirmative action programmes to 
increase representation of minority women in 
public service employment. </i></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>59. Goals 4, 5 and 6 address various aspects of improving health and health care provision.  
Nine of the MDG Reports reviewed give attention to the situation of health and/or health care 
access for minorities under Goal 4; five 
reports give attention to minorities and 
maternal health under Goal 5; and 13 
give attention to minorities when 
discussing Goal 6.  The poor attention 
to minorities under these Goals is 
striking given that health and sanitation 
conditions are often worse in regions 
where minorities live.  Existing 
infrastructure for medical services may 
be more limited in remote or 
impoverished areas where minorities 
are settled.  In hospitals, persons 
belonging to minorities may face 
discrimination and a lack of medical 
professionals able to communicate in their languages.  The cultural practices of minorities are 
also often unfamiliar to mainstream medicine, which may inhibit the effective prescription of, 
for example, pre- and post-natal care. 
</p>
<p>60. Some of the MDG Reports recognize these factors.  In Thailand, the MDG Report 
acknowledges that regions with a high proportion of minorities have less<b> </b>health care:  &#8220;There are 
difficulties accessing primary health care in the North due to the mountainous terrain.  In the 
southernmost provinces, complexities based on gender, culture, religion and language can make 
access to or use of primary health care difficult.&#8221; In response, the Government of Thailand has 
elaborated additional targets under Goals 4 and 5 to reduce by half, between 2005 and 2015, the 
under 5 mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate &#8220;in highland areas, selected northern 
provinces and three southernmost provinces&#8221;.  Peru also seeks to prioritize health care assistance 
in areas where indigenous peoples live.  In Romania, one measure adopted to help reduce ethnic 
disparities in health is the creation of the office of Roma Community Health Mediator.  
Malaysia&#8217;s MDG Report indicates success in reducing ethnic inequalities on child mortality and 
maternal mortality.   
</p>
<p>61. Several reports recorded that minorities (or indigenous peoples) have higher rates of 
contracting tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS.  Malaysia&#8217;s MDG Report provides disaggregated data by 
ethnicity on HIV/AIDS, acknowledging that different ethnic groups face different risk factors 
and modes of contracting HIV/AIDS.  In the Philippines, indigenous peoples are identified as a 
high risk group for HIV/AIDS and the MDG Report pledges to give priority attention, <i>inter alia</i>, 
to areas where indigenous peoples live.  In Nicaragua, the programmes for tuberculosis control 
will consider &#8220;interculturality&#8221; and give particular attention to indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p><b>Box 9:  Good practice on health care 
</b></p>
<p><i>Several reports noted that minorities experience 
disproportionate rates of child and maternal 
mortality and of other diseases, including 
HIV/AIDS.  In response, some states reported their 
efforts to address these inequalities, including: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Establishing MDG Plus Indicators on health 
for the main regions in which marginalized 
minorities live; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Creating a Community Health Mediator 
targeted for minority communities. </i></p>

</p>
<p><i>Goal 7.  Ensure environmental sustainability  
</i></p>
<p>o <i>Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and 
program and reverse the loss of environmental resources. 
</i></p>
<p>o <i>Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking 
water. 
</i></p>
<p>o <i>Have achieved, by 2020, a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million 
slum dwellers. 
</i></p>
<p>62. The issues of water access, adequate housing and land rights attached to Goal 7 are all 
priority concerns for minorities.  Persons belonging to minorities can make up a significant 
proportion of slum dwellers where they have been forcibly displaced or where they have 
migrated to cities in search of improved economic opportunities not available in their regions.  
Forced displacement has also been used as a means of improving access to social services for 
minorities; there is a risk that similar strategies will be used in the name of achieving the MDGs.  
Minorities also often lack legal entitlement to the land and houses they inhabit, making the 
individual or collective land/property rights of minorities particularly weak.  Where governments 
have competing priorities for use of certain land, this can put minorities into conflict with the 
authorities.  The MDG Report for Botswana describes such a conflict between the government 
and the minority indigenous Basawara people over land. 
</p>
<p>63. There are 12 MDG Reports reviewed that give attention to minorities when discussing 
some aspect of Goal 7.  Several reports focused on land.  The Vietnam MDG Report stipulates 
an additional &#8216;Vietnam Development Goal&#8217; focused on minorities, which includes a target to 
&#8220;Ensure that land use rights are given to communities or individuals in ethnic mountainous 
areas&#8221;.  One of the policies implemented to date is the allocation of land to ethnic minorities to 
help address food insecurity:  &#8220;by 2003, about 10,500 households had received over 5,000 
hectares&#8221;.  In Belize, only 69% of the Maya have secure land tenure and the MDG Report 
indicates that &#8220;Security of tenure among the Mayan population requires aggressive action&#8221;.  In 
Nicaragua, the government has adopted a &#8220;Law of Indigenous Territories Demarcation&#8221; to help 
address land security.  In the Philippines, through the Community Based Forest Management 
Programme (CBFMP), the &#8220;participation of local communities, indigenous peoples and other 
stakeholders are strengthened in the protection, management, development and conservation of 
forestlands and resources.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>64. A couple of MDG Reports looked at housing access for minorities.  In Brazil, &#8220;The most 
affected social groups are the poor and the afro-descendant population, who live in areas with 
higher levels of inadequate housing and do not have access to credit for housing purposes&#8221;.  
According to the MDG Report for Brazil, the federal government has responded to this issue 
through &#8220;several programs and actions directed towards the diversification of the forms of access 
to housing, such as:&#8230; building of houses for residents in land reform settlements, indigenous 
and <i>quilombola</i> (slave descendant) communities, in addition to the supply of direct subsidies to 
the poorer population&#8221;.  The MDG Report of Kosovo notes that &#8220;The issue of living conditions 
of the Roma minority also must be monitored&#8221; and suggests that particular attention be given to 
&#8220;the desperate living conditions in Roma IDP camps in several locations across Kosovo&#8221;.   </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>65. The issue of access to water was discussed by Peru, Venezuela and Vietnam.  In Peru, 
there is a serious deficiency in &#8220;indigenous forest communities, where only 12% have water 
supply and 10% have access to plumbing&#8221;.  Vietnam&#8217;s MDG Report makes a commitment to 
ensure continued &#8220;investment in essential infrastructure (&#8230;irrigation, water..)&#8221; for ethnic 
minority regions.   
</p>
<p>66. The fact that country reports do or do not mention minorities (or indigenous peoples) 
cannot be taken as indicative of the actual activities undertaken within that country or through 
development cooperation to help minorities reach the MDGs.  The absence of information on 
minorities is, however, a weakness of MDG reporting and only perpetuates the invisibility of the 
situation of persons belonging to minorities.  Where country reports do mention minorities, this 
gives representatives of those communities a greater opportunity to hold their governments to 
account for commitments made.  The inclusion of minority-specific time-bound targets will 
strengthen the reports even further.  Country reporting is therefore an important tool for minority 
groups.  As the review here of selected reports indicates, there is much more that governments 
and the UNDP (as lead supporting agency) and other stakeholders can do to ensure the MDGs 
are a vehicle for inclusion of minorities and not a cause of further exclusion.   
</p>
<p><b>III.  GLOBAL INITIATIVES ON MINORITIES AND THE MDGS 
</b></p>
<p>67. The integration of minorities into the MDG country reports is weak but there are a 
number of MDG initiatives that aim to bring greater attention to the situation of minorities.  A 
sample of global, regional and national initiatives is highlighted here.  
</p>
<p>68. Decade for Roma Inclusion:  Under the Decade for Roma Inclusion initiative,<b> 
</b>participating States pledge to achieve stated goals for the improvement of the socio-economic 
status of the Roma by 2015 to coincide with progress towards the MDGs.<b>10</b>  There are currently 
nine participating States:  Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia.  Roma representatives have 
inputted into the process from the early stages and have been involved in the international 
Steering Committee of the Decade and preparation of country action plans.  The capacity of 
Roma and governments to make this Decade a success still needs to be strengthened, and the 
supporting international agencies, including the World Bank, UNDP and the Open Society 
Institute are working to this end.  A key component of the Decade is improving the collection of 
disaggregated data on the status of Roma to help monitor progress made towards the goals in 
each country strategy.

<p>69. Inter-Agency Consultation on Race in Latin America (IAC):  The IAC is a consultative 
group of seven international development institutions working together to address issues of racial 
discrimination, social exclusion, and related concerns of African-descendant populations in Latin 
America.  The IAC has recently published a report on <i>Incorporating Race and Ethnicity into the 
Millennium Development Goals</i>,<b>11</b> which highlights the inequalities experienced by

the findings of the report was &#8220;The ability of Latin American States to  monitor progress toward 
MDGs is generally greater for indigenous peoples than for blacks and mulattos because of 
greater data availability.&#8221;  This issue is reflected in the regional <i>Brasilia Declaration:  Proposal 
for Implementing the Millennium Development Goals</i>, the outcome of the <i>Brasilia International 
Conference on the MDGs in Latin America and the Caribbean</i>, in 2003.  The conference was 
cosponsored by members of the IAC and called upon governments to adapt &#8220;the Millennium 
Development Goals to the specific local conditions of each country, including dimensions such 
as equity, <i>ethnicity</i>, gender and those arising from local diversity&#8221; (emphasis added).  
</p>
<p>70. The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII):  the PFII has made the MDGs a key 
focus of its programme of work in recent sessions.  In 2006, for example, the special theme for 
the session was <i>The Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples:  Redefining the 
Goals</i>, from which emerged an extensive number of substantive recommendations for 
United Nations agencies and governments.  Several important consultations, reports and 
recommendations have emerged through the PFII&#8217;s efforts, such as the <i>International Expert 
Group Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals, Indigenous Participation and Good 
Governance</i> (New York, 11-13 January 2006), (E/C.19/2006/7); the <i>Meeting on Indigenous 
Peoples and Indicators of Well-being</i> (Ottawa, 22 and 23 March 2006) (E/CN.19/2006/CRP.3); 
and the <i>Workshop on Data Collection and Disaggregation for Indigenous Peoples</i> (19 to 
21 January 2004) (E/C.19/2004/2).  The PFII also co-organized a 2-day conference with the 
World Bank in May 2006 on <i>Poverty and Indigenous Peoples</i>.  
</p>
<p>71. The United Nations Working Group on Minorities has also made the MDGs a focus of 
recent discussions at its sessions in 2004 and 2005.  The Working Group on Minorities, however, 
does not have the same resources or permanent secretariat at its disposal to organize events on 
the scale of the PFII.   
</p>
<p>72. World Health Organization (WHO):  The regional body of the WHO, the Pan-American 
Health Organisation, organized an important workshop on health, ethnicity and the MDGs in 
Latin America and the Caribbean.  The workshop sought in particular to raise awareness of the 
situation of Afro-descendants in attaining the MDGs related to health.  The Government of 
Brazil&#8217;s Special Secretariat for Racial Equality (SEPPIR) and OHCHR were co-organisers.  This 
workshop was held in Brasilia, Brazil from December 1-3, 2004.  The participants, including 
senior health officials and civil society representatives, reminded governments of &#8220;the 
importance of carrying out actions that take into consideration the special cultural, 
socioeconomic, political, and religious characteristics of Afro-Latin American communities, 
indigenous peoples, and other ethnic groups as one of the fundamental steps to attaining the 
Millennium Goals.&#8221;<b>12

<p>73. The Millennium Campaign:  the Millennium Campaign aims to mobilize political support 
for the Millennium Declaration among developed and developing countries and to encourage 
civil society engagement with the MDGs.<b>13  </b>One of their initiatives has been to work with 
religious groups, including religious minorities, to engage them further on the MDGs.  In 
cooperation with the World Conference of Religions for Peace (WCRP), they have developed a 
toolkit to engage religious leaders and their communities around the MDGs.  The multi-religious 
toolkit, &#8220;Faith in Action, Toward the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals,&#8221; 
introduces the MDGs and the key role of faith communities in advocacy and action to advance 
development. 
</p>
<p>74. Civil society initiatives:  Many NGOs and networks of NGOs are mobilizing to raise 
awareness of the MDGs and to advocate for particular attention to minorities in this context.  In 
Ethiopia, the Pastoralist Forum Ethiopia is one of the leading NGOs in the Poverty Action 
Network for Ethiopia (PANE), established in March 2004.  The PANE has over 70 institutional 
members and aims to coordinate the involvement of civil society groups and to empower citizens 
for active participation in the design, implementation and monitoring of poverty reduction 
policies.  They have elaborated a system of Citizen Report Cards to monitor and evaluate the 
government&#8217;s poverty reduction strategy, the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction 
Programme (SDPRP).  The success of the initiative is recognized in the government&#8217;s invitation 
to PANE to comment on the draft SDPRP II.  
</p>
<p>75. An international consultation on caste-based discrimination resulted in the Kathmandu 
Declaration in December 2004.<b>14</b>  The Declaration offers many recommendations for ensuring 
that governments and development agencies &#8220;Pay particular attention to the needs of Dalit and 
other outcaste communities in the devising and implementation of strategies and plans to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals.&#8221;  In particular, they recommend that actors &#8220;disaggregate 
the data on progress achieved on each and every MDG for Dalits.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>76. Global Rights, an international NGO, has been training young leaders from minority 
populations to use the MDGs to show how minority communities are disadvantaged in realizing 
rights integral to reducing poverty, specifically the right to education, and to advocate amongst 
international and local decision makers to implement policy reforms that will improve their 
ability to realize their rights.  The program seeks to ensure that the benefits of poverty reduction 
strategies are not restricted to privileged and dominant communities, but are extended to the 
most marginalized populations around the world. 
</p>
<p>77. The international NGO, Minority Rights Group International has been advocating on the 
MDGs since 2001, and has advised the UNDP, the EU and the Swiss Agency for Development

</p>
<p><b>IV.  POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY PAPERS (PRSPS) 
AND MINORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>78. The PRSPs are much more detailed documents than MDG country reports so they can 
give a more accurate picture of how governments are addressing poverty and inequality, 
including across groups.  Some good baseline research has been completed on the inclusion of 
minorities and indigenous peoples in selected PRSPs.  Notably, this research has not been 
undertaken by the World Bank or IMF, the two institutions with direct roles in the elaboration, 
monitoring, implementation and evaluation of the PRSPs.  The two key studies, by the ILO and 
by the international NGO Minority Rights Group International, both conclude that minorities and 
indigenous peoples are inadequately reflected in PRSPs, including in the consultation processes 
to draft PRSPs.   
</p>
<p>79. In 2005, the ILO published <i>Indigenous and Tribal Peoples:  An Ethnic Audit of Selected 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers</i>.<b>16</b>  The report examined 14 PRSPs from various regions and 
found that PRSPs better reflected strategies to address the structural causes of indigenous and 
tribal peoples&#8217; poverty and exclusion where:  &#8220;legal frameworks recognize indigenous peoples&#8217; 
group rights; institutions and policies respecting and accommodating cultural diversity have been 
developed; [and] indigenous peoples have organized and mobilized for political change.&#8221;<b>17</b>  
There was a wide variety of practice across regions as well.  In Africa, the report found that 
while increasing efforts were made to address the concerns of pastoralists, other groups, such as 
hunters and gathers, were neglected.  In Asia, the PRSPs range from a total neglect of the issue 
(Sri Lanka) to passing references to it (Pakistan) to a clear concern about enhancing the living 
conditions and status of tribal peoples or ethnic indigenous minorities (Viet Nam and 
Cambodia)&#8221;.<b>18</b>  In Latin America, there was high priority given to indigenous peoples in many of 
the PRSPs (since the report did not examine afro-descendants the comparative attention to the 
two groups cannot be assessed).  A particularly interesting finding is the diversity in the way that 
indigenous peoples&#8217; poverty is understood:   
</p>
<p>Some PRSPs consider societal discrimination and past and present ill-conceived 
development policies as responsible for indigenous [poverty and marginalization].  Other 
PRSPs ascribe the disadvantaged status of indigenous and tribal peoples to their

<p>&#8220;backward&#8221; lifestyles and institutions, as well as to their physical remoteness, dispersion 
and/or non-sedentary lifestyles that make investments costly and inefficient.<b>19</b>  
</p>
<p>80. The starting point for understanding the causes of minorities&#8217; poverty can influence 
greatly the policy response of government.  Where the full range of structural, social, political 
and environmental causes can be identified, PRSPs will be better suited to effectively tackle 
poverty of minorities.   
</p>
<p>81. This was a clear message in the report published by Minority Rights Group International, 
<i>PRSPs, Minorities and Indigenous Peoples:  An Issues Paper</i>.  The paper found that minorities 
and indigenous peoples are rarely consulted in the elaboration of PRSPs:  of the 37 PRSPs 
examined, only 21 mention minority groups.  Moreover, &#8220;even when they are invited to 
participate, or are consulted, their input is often misinterpreted or manipulated in such a way that 
does not effectively address these groups&#8217; needs or rights.  Instead, the result of their 
engagement too often ends up addressing the government (or IFIs&#8217;) existing development 
plan.&#8221;<b>20</b>  The emphasis on critiquing the quality of participation is key:  it is not enough to tick 
the box on participation of civil society if that participation is not genuine and meaningful.  For 
minorities this means ensuring that issues like &#8220;linguistic and cultural differences, as well as 
geographic remoteness and dispersion&#8221; as well as &#8220;active knowledge of their political rights&#8221; are 
integrated into PRSP participation strategies.<b>21</b>  
</p>
<p>82. The weakness of civil society participation in the PRSPs is not unique to minorities.  
Effective participation processes are costly, time-intensive and may not be able to reach 
consensus on priorities for poverty reduction.  Including minorities may make this even more 
difficult.  Nevertheless, minorities have been identified as key potential beneficiaries of the 
PRSPs.  This is evidenced in the monitoring and evaluation guidelines for the World Bank and 
IMF staff when conducting the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of completed PRSPs.  In the JSA, 
staff are to determine whether &#8220;ethnic minorities&#8221; have participated in the drafting process for 
the PRSP.<b>22</b>  A quick glance at a few JSAs, however, reveals that this issue is commonly omitted 
from the evaluation.  Even where PRSPs neglect to give any attention to ethnic minorities, the 
corresponding JSAs rarely raise this point. 
</p>
<p>83. Only a portion of the countries with MDG reports also have PRSPs.  Of the good practice 
examples in MDG country reports highlighted in section III of this report, only Laos, Nepal and 
Vietnam have drafted PRSPs.  These will be reviewed briefly to highlight some good practice in 
each and to offer some recommendations for strengthening the PRSPs from a minority rights

</p>
<p>perspective.  It is acknowledged however that much work remains to be done to assist 
marginalized minorities in each of the countries below and further dialogue is required with 
these and other States to ensure that PRSP commitments are translated into concrete, human 
rights-based progress for minorities.  
</p>
<p>84. The PRSP of Laos PDR, entitled the <i>National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy</i> 
(NGPES) (2004), is based upon the <i>thammasat</i> way of development, described as a harmonious 
&#8220;triangular&#8221; approach to development focusing on the balance of economic growth, 
social/cultural development, and conservation of natural resources.  The PRSP from the outset 
emphasizes the importance of the &#8220;the spiritual and cultural life of the Lao multi-ethnic 
population&#8221; and the desire to safeguard &#8220;the country&#8217;s social, cultural, economic and political 
identity&#8221;.  The PRSP notes that &#8220;poor people are primarily ethnic minority swidden cultivators&#8221; 
and recognizes that &#8220;Ethnicity and vulnerability are directly related, as certain ethnic groups 
have a limited range of assets and mechanisms to manage them.&#8221;  The PRSP makes several 
references to the situation of ethnic minorities in relation to health, education and poverty 
reduction.  It is surprising that inequality experienced by ethnic minorities is not named 
specifically as a cross-cutting issue, in contrast to gender inequality which is recognized as 
cross-cutting, particularly given that the PRSP notes, &#8220;Generally, ethnic disparities are greater 
than gender disparities&#8221;.  Nevertheless, &#8220;cultural and spiritual enhancement; national identity and 
cultural heritage&#8221; are considered cross-sector concerns, albeit without clarifying precisely what 
this means for development practice.  
</p>
<p>85. Several important themes run through the PRSP, including the need for participatory 
development, strong rule of law systems and good governance.  The government seeks to 
&#8220;ensure justice for the remote and disadvantaged peoples&#8221; as a top priority.  It hopes to address 
the language barriers to the legal system and &#8220;is discussing the best means to provide legal 
assistance for the multi-cultural (and multi-lingual) population&#8230;The provision of translation 
services by the Ministry of Justice is necessary, even if the variety of different languages in our 
country makes the financial costs very high.&#8221;  The recognition that realizing rights for the most 
marginalized is sometimes costly but nevertheless necessary is vital to the success of the PRSP.  
On the issue of good governance, the PRSP notes the need for &#8220;creating a productive and 
motivated professional civil service adhering to high ethical standards&#8221;; this could be supported, 
for example, through measures on non-discrimination.   
</p>
<p>86. Participation in planning, monitoring and evaluation is mentioned repeatedly throughout 
the document.  It is never clear whether efforts have been made to ensure that ethnic minorities 
specifically have participated, (the only indication is that &#8220;various segments of the Lao 
multi-ethnic population&#8221; have been consulted) although &#8220;community-led decision-making&#8221; is 
emphasized.  It may be useful to monitor how minorities are participating therein.  The 
government&#8217;s pledge for &#8220;Improving communication with the people, especially in the remote 
areas&#8221; will be helpful for many ethnic minorities.  
</p>
<p>87. The document is weak on disaggregated data by ethnic or religious group but does 
disaggregate poverty data and school enrolment by province.  Ethno-linguistic data on literacy 
rates are also provided.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>88. For poverty reduction, the government is supporting  &#8220;development funds&#8221; for the 
poorest districts, particularly village and district funds, for income generating activities; whether 
ethnic minorities will have guaranteed access to these funds according to need is not made clear 
but would be a useful additional safeguard to ensure the funds reach them without 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>89. Special attention is paid to the situation of ethnic minority women in the document.  It is 
noted that because of language barriers, ethnic minority women &#8220;have few opportunities and will 
be at greater risk of exploitation&#8221; and are limited in their ability &#8220;to engage with health care 
workers, extension workers, traders and others outside the village.&#8221;  The high fertility rates of 
ethnic minority women and low access to health care means &#8220;there is very high risk of health 
complications or death for both mother and child.&#8221;  While several commitments are made on 
gender issues, there does not appear to be any specific plans for addressing the unique situation 
of ethnic minority women.   
</p>
<p>90. The traditional livelihoods of minorities come under scrutiny in the discussion of reforms 
to the agriculture and forest development systems.  Many ethnic minorities practice a system of 
swidden agriculture which the government seeks to limit or eradicate.  The government does 
pledge to do so &#8220;while respecting the traditions of the Lao way of life and the rich diversity of its 
ethnic minorities&#8221; but it is clear from the document that the priority is to find alternative systems.  
The practice of resettlement of communities is not always effective:  the PRSP notes &#8220;Resettled 
populations, even in larger villages, are more vulnerable.&#8221; It is important that the government 
recognize how much ethnic minority livelihoods are tied to cultural identity and survival; 
adherence to participatory principles must seek to balance ethnic minority rights with other 
development interests in a fair and transparent manner.  
</p>
<p>91. The PRSP outlines specific pledges to improve the access to education and health care 
for ethnic minorities.  This includes &#8220;(a) measures to steer teachers to teach in remote areas; 
(b) measures to provide teacher training to persons from remote and ethnic minority 
communities who will return to their communities and teach; and (c) measures to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the teaching/learning processes in ethnic minority communities.&#8221; 
Similar measures will be used to strengthen district health systems &#8220;through incentives for health 
staff to occupy posts in remote areas, with a particular effort to attract female and ethnic 
minority health workers&#8221;; &#8220;establishing village health committees (VHC) in each village [with 
representation] &#8230;reflecting the ethnic composition of the village.&#8221;; and establishing primary 
health care training centres in the Northern Region (populated mostly by ethnic minorities), 
including a &#8220;particular effort to attract trainees from ethnic minority groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>92. Nepal&#8217;s <i>Tenth Plan</i> (2002-2007) serves as its PRSP.  The PRSP is based on four pillars:  
&#8220;broad based high and sustainable growth, social sector development with emphasis on human 
development, targeted programs with emphasis on social inclusion and improved governance&#8221;.  
The Plan recognizes the existence in Nepal of &#8220;about 60 recorded caste and ethnic groups 
(mostly Indo-Aryan and Mongol) and 70 languages and dialects (mostly Indo-Aryan and 
Tibeto-Burman).&#8221;  The Plan also recognizes the inequalities faced by many of these groups, in 
particular the &#8220;many indigenous ethnic (&#8220;Janajaties&#8221;) and caste (&#8220;Dalits&#8221;) groups who have been 
historically disadvantaged, and who continue to lag behind in their income and asset levels, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>educational achievements and human development indicators, and to the extent to which they are 
represented in the power structure.&#8221;  Detailed disaggregated data on poverty rates for different 
ethnic and caste groups are provided.   
</p>
<p>93. The document describes in some detail the series of consultation processes that led to the 
PRSP and indicates that among the participants were &#8220;representatives from socially backward 
classes&#8221;, &#8220;dalits&#8221; and &#8220;ethnic minorities&#8221;.  The government has established consultative bodies to 
assist in addressing the inequalities faced by the most marginalized groups.  During the <i>Ninth 
Plan</i> a Dalit Development Commission was created and a &#8220;National Janajati Development 
Committee was established in 1997 and recently restructured to a more powerful and 
independent Adibasi Janajati Utthan Pratisthan (Indigenous and Ethnic Groups Upliftment 
Academy) in 2002.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>94. The link between protection of minorities and prevention of conflict in Nepal was also 
noted:  &#8220;there is little doubt that among others, the underlying causes include poverty and its 
manifestations, (in terms of regional, gender, ethnic and caste-related inequalities), as well as 
poor governance, and the failure to deliver adequate and essential social services and 
infrastructure to rural communities and marginalized groups&#8221;.  The PRSP recognized that &#8220;To 
bring about a lasting solution to the present [conflict], the nexus of poverty, poor governance, 
and marginalization need to be carefully and urgently addressed.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>95. This is reflected well in the Tenth Plan, which includes a much more targeted approach to 
overcoming marginalization of minorities and other groups than previous Plans:  &#8220;the Tenth Plan 
seeks, as an integral part of its poverty reduction strategy, to bring the marginalized sections of 
the population and backward regions into the mainstream of development, and to make visible 
progress in reducing existing inequalities&#8221;.  The Plan recognizes that &#8220;Women and ethnic groups 
by and large are left out of the mainstream of development, because they lack voice, 
empowerment, representation and access to economic opportunities and resources.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>96. Participation of local communities in the implementation of poverty-related initiatives is 
stressed throughout the document:  &#8220;Strong emphasis is also placed on decentralization and 
maximizing the involvement of local governments and community groups for identifying 
development activities and allocating resources for them in accordance with people&#8217;s needs ... 
and for ensuring better program management, accountability and transparency through people&#8217;s 
participation.&#8221;  The Tenth Plan also states that &#8220;To ensure participation of the poorer and 
deprived groups in decision-making and management processes at the village level, affirmative 
action will be taken to ensure their participation&#8221;.  Taking extra measures to support and monitor 
the participation of marginalized minorities will be important to ensuring their participation is 
meaningful and effective.   
</p>
<p>97. The Tenth Plan aims to balance mainstreaming with targeted policies for minorities:  &#8220;the 
emphasis will be on ensuring social inclusion through normal sectoral programs and activities, 
supplemented by targeted initiatives&#8221;.  For example, &#8220;with regard to service delivery and 
infrastructure development, (such as primary schools, health facilities, drinking water etc.), the 
respective line ministries will be required to give equal attention to deprived communities to 
ensure that they are served as well as others.  They will also be required to monitor and report 
progress achieved annually&#8221;.  Targeted approaches are also needed because &#8220;there will be 
specific groups of people who may either be unable to escape the poverty trap or take an </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>unacceptably long time to do so&#8221;.  The Plan foresees &#8220;Affirmative action in a number of 
important areas (such education, health, participation in public service, administration, political 
life and at the community level) [will] be taken to help achieve progressive results in this regard, 
until such time as these communities become sufficiently empowered to stand on their own, and 
fight for their rights.&#8221; The specialized bodies for Dalits and indigenous ethnic minorities will 
play an important role in monitoring the targeted programmes in cooperation with the Ministry 
for Local Development.  The Village Development Committees (VDCs) &#8220;will be required to 
include in their periodic Plans specific measures for meeting the needs of deprived communities, 
and report annually on their implementation.&#8221;  The Dalit Commission will play a role in devising 
training and guidelines for targeting programs for Dalits in the VDCs and District Development 
Committees.   
</p>
<p>98. The Plan foresees a strengthening of poverty monitoring data.  The National Planning 
Commission &#8220;will undertake a Poverty Mapping exercise, to identify the poor and marginalized 
groups,&#8221; and the 2003 Nepal Living Standards Survey intended to broaden its coverage to 
provide additional information required for poverty monitoring disaggregated by gender, social 
groups and regions.   
</p>
<p>99. On education, the government plans to offer targeted support to some minorities:  there 
will be &#8220;education in mother languages (of communities) up to the primary level&#8221;; and 
&#8220;scholarships in private/boarding schools to students from &#8216;oppressed and backward 
communities&#8217;&#8221;.  A Rural Education Development Fund will be created and will &#8220;be utilized for 
funding the education of marginalized communities&#8221;.  The Plan foresees affirmative action 
policies to increase the number of Dalits in teaching positions and public agencies.   
</p>
<p>100. The government admits in the Tenth Plan that &#8220;neither the civil society groups nor the 
government bodies have yet had much success in significantly improving the educational, 
economic or welfare status of the Dalit and disadvantaged Janajati population.&#8221;  Although the 
Plan is positive in its approach by committing to both mainstreaming and targeted programmes 
to assist these groups, there is a need for further dialogue on the root causes of their 
marginalization, in particular on the issue of discrimination.  The Plan does mention reforms to 
anti-discrimination laws to assist women, but does not appear to discuss how the legal 
framework could be strengthened to support marginalized minorities.  The annex notes that some 
investment will be made in human rights, including the adoption of a human rights Action Plan.  
It will be important that discrimination against minorities is addressed through the legal 
framework, both in terms of harmonizing laws with international human rights standards (as the 
Plan notes) but also in terms of firm implementation of those laws.  The stated intention in the 
Plan to &#8220;strengthen the Dalit Commission&#8221; will also be an important step by giving such a body 
the authority it needs to help protect minorities.   
</p>
<p>101. Vietnam&#8217;s PRSP is <i>The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy</i> 
(CPRGS), adopted in 2002.  Among the major objectives of the CPRGS is &#8220;improving the lives 
of ethnic peoples&#8221;, which it seeks to do through, <i>inter alia</i>, &#8220;investment and other support to 
disadvantaged areas; reduc[ing] the development gap between regions, pay[ing] attention to the 
living conditions of ethnic minority peoples&#8221;.  The CPRGS will &#8220;Ensure that all ethnic 
minorities will benefit directly from the process of economic growth&#8221;.  Although the document 
does not name the ethnic minorities that exist in Vietnam, it does provide some basic 
information, such as:  &#8220;The majority of ethnic minority people live in remote and isolated areas.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>They are geographically and culturally isolated, and lack favourable conditions for developing 
infrastructure and basic social services&#8221;.  The commitment to &#8220;Continue to consolidate and 
expand the education, health care, culture and information activities of ethnic minority peoples&#8221; 
is supported by many specific initiatives named in the CPRGS.  
</p>
<p>102. Disaggregated data on poverty is provided by region, along with a table showing the 
poverty gap between the ethnic majority Kinh people and ethnic minorities (in aggregate).  The 
document recognizes that &#8220;While accounting for roughly 14 per cent of the total national 
population, the representation of ethnic minority groups among the poor is disproportionately 
high at approximately 29 per cent&#8221;.  A disaggregated breakdown of poverty experienced by each 
ethnic or religious group would have made these inequalities clearer.  The PRSP does, however, 
indicate intentions to &#8220;Establish a system of qualitative and quantitative socio-economic 
development and poverty reduction indicators (with breakdown by gender and ethnicity) to 
monitor and supervise the progress of implementing the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Strategy&#8221;.  The monitoring indicators as currently stated in Appendix 1 of the CPRGS 
could include many more indicators disaggregated by ethnicity (at present there is only one, for 
education, and those in relation to minority-specific targets).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>103. The CPRGS includes some discussion of the importance of legal frameworks and rights.  
One of the aims of the government is to &#8220;Ensure that all citizens have access to information 
about the law and their legal rights and obligations, and that the poor have better access to the 
justice system&#8221;.  This could be particularly important for ethnic minorities who may face 
discrimination by public officials or private actors.  The document does not give sufficient 
information on what measures will be taken to enforce non-discrimination laws and practices.  
The Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas may play some role, but no 
information is given on its mandate, composition or powers.  
</p>
<p>104. The issue of participation is given less elaboration than in other PRSPs, but the CPRGS 
does note that &#8220;In developing participatory mechanisms, attention must be given to vulnerable 
groups like elderly, women, disabled and ethnic minority people&#8221;.  Specific details on how this 
commitment will be implemented would be helpful, both for minorities and for those that seek to 
support their participation.   
</p>
<p>105. The PRSP discuses briefly the situation of ethnic minority women and girls, admitting 
that policies on gender equality are failing them and others.  Ethnic minority women and girls  
&#8220;are negatively affected by backward beliefs, customs and practices.  In many areas, they are 
victims of female trafficking and family violence&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>106. The CPRGS notes there has been past success of &#8220;poverty reduction models for ethnic 
minorities&#8221; but does not seem to provide details on these models.  Nevertheless, many specific 
targets for improving the lives of ethnic minorities are listed in the document, including:   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increase the amount of programming and broadcasting hours in the languages of 
ethnic minority peoples. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Raise the social consciousness, preserve and bring into play the traditional cultural 
values of ethnic minority peoples.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sustain and develop the reading and writing ability of ethnic languages in areas with 
high ethnic populations.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide access to kindergarten education to every child from ethnic minority groups 
and opportunities for children from ethnic minority groups to complete the primary 
education program partly in Vietnamese and partly in their own language by 2010.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide support to ethnic minority people to increase their representation in the total 
staff of public agencies.  Increase the proportion of trained staff, workers and public 
servants who are from ethnic minorities in the total staff of public agencies.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure the entitlement of individual and collective land use rights to ethnic minorities 
and mountainous people; prevent buying and selling agricultural land that belongs to 
ethnic minorities.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Continue to consolidate and expand health care, culture, information and related 
activities to reach ethnic minority peoples.  
</p>
<p>107. Land and agricultural development is discussed in relation to ethnic minorities.  The 
overarching plans for rural development aim to &#8220;Implement well the task of fixed-cultivation and 
fixed-residence, restrict free migration, stabilize production and improve the living standards of 
mountainous and ethnic peoples in a manner suitable to their customs and practices based on a 
master plan for population distribution in the direction of establishing concentrated population 
clusters, commune clusters and townships&#8221;.  It is positive that the government seeks to adopt 
plans that would be suitable to the existing &#8220;customs and practices&#8221; of ethnic minorities; the best 
way to achieve this would be to ensure that minorities have direct input into local development 
policies, some of which, like fixed-cultivation, may not be compatible with their traditional 
livelihoods.  The allocation of land to ethnic households also is listed as a priority, including 
both &#8220;individual and collective land use rights&#8221;.  Agricultural extension activities will be 
expanded and the government seeks to &#8220;ensure that poor and ethnic minority peoples will reap 
benefits from extension services&#8221;.  They intend to achieve this in part by training &#8220;those who 
know the languages of ethnic minorities&#8221; to deliver extension services.  Training for extension 
workers on the rights of ethnic minorities and their traditional livelihoods may also be beneficial.   
</p>
<p>108. Several measures are foreseen in the field of education, including for ethnic minority 
women and girls.  Efforts will be made to ensure that women and girls from ethnic minorities 
can increase their school enrolment, including attracting ethnic minority girls to boarding 
schools.  The government will also invest in raising the share of female teachers coming from 
ethnic minorities.  Ethnic minority children will be enabled to become fluent in their own 
language alongside the national language.  In training for skills, the government pledges to &#8220;Give 
priority to training cadre in extremely disadvantaged communes and provide training for targeted 
peoples&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>109. In health care, the government will be &#8220;Expanding training to develop local health staff, 
with priority given to on-site training of ethnic staff in mountainous, remote, and disadvantaged 
areas.&#8221;  Special policies to attract more health care staff to work in remote regions where 
minorities live will be implemented.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>110. Access to information for minorities also figures in the PRSP.  The government pledges 
to &#8220;Disseminate information in both national and ethnic languages&#8221; and to &#8220;Provide information 
on poverty reduction programs in an accessible manner and in places where ethnic peoples can 
have easy access&#8221;.  Among the measures foreseen is to &#8220;Increase the amount of [ethnic 
language] broadcasting and television time and publish ethnic language books and newspapers 
that are suitable for each locality&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i>Promising Practice in the PRSPs 
</i></p>
<p>111. Each of the above PRSPs gives special attention to the situation of marginalized 
minorities.  Their efforts suggest that it is often neither resources nor capacity that prevents 
attention to minorities but rather political will.  These PRSPs commit to paper both 
mainstreaming and targeted measures to ensure that minorities are not left out of poverty 
reduction strategies.  Further information is required on how these commitments are being 
realized in practice, given that in each country there remain serious concerns about the situation 
of marginalized minorities.  There are a number of efforts made within the PRSPs that constitute 
promising practice, however, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; providing background information on the existence of minority groups within the 
country, including especially indicators on poverty, disaggregated by membership in 
an ethnic, religious or linguistic group and also by gender; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; discussing in some detail the rationale behind the need for specially targeted poverty 
reduction measures for minorities, based on an analysis of disproportionate and 
persistent inequalities experienced by certain minority groups over time and the 
failure of previous approaches to benefit these groups; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; including dedicated chapters to outline measures for marginalized minority groups, 
both in terms of mainstreamed approaches and also details on targeted programmes, 
by sector; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; giving specific attention to the situation of minority women and girls and providing 
targeted efforts to overcome the inequalities they experience; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; discussing the importance of participation of minorities, both in the elaboration of the 
PRSP itself and participation in the implementation of PRSP-related development 
programmes and projects, especially at the level of local governance; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; acknowledging the role in poverty reduction of specially appointed government 
bodies established to help protect the rights and legitimate interests of minorities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; including ethnically disaggregated indicators for monitoring progress towards PRSP 
objectives; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; making commitments to improve the legal framework for enabling citizens to better 
access their human rights; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 39 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; taking a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction by including mainstreaming 
and targeted measures for minorities not only in the area of income growth but also 
key issues such as education, health, governance and access to information. 
</p>
<p>112. It is beyond the scope of this paper to give a detailed analysis of how the governments 
are managing to realize <i>in practice</i> their intended policies to support marginalized minorities.  
Overcoming long-entrenched inequalities is very difficult, often requiring not only additional 
and targeted resources but also a serious commitment to tackling underlying causes of this 
inequality, in particular that of direct and indirect discrimination.  On this last point it is clear 
that each of the PRSPs reviewed here can do more to indicate how they intend to address 
discrimination at both the institutional and individual levels in the public and private spheres.  
Nevertheless, the PRSPs suggest that the governments recognize many of the challenges faced 
by minorities to overcoming poverty and genuinely seek to help minorities in their efforts to 
improve their lives.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>113. There is an urgent need to take the situation of persons belonging to minorities fully into 
account in the efforts of the international community to achieve the MDGs and to implement the 
Millennium Declaration.  This review of MDG country reports reveals a serious lack of attention 
to the situation of persons belonging to minorities, who disproportionately experience poverty 
and lower levels of human development.  Only a third of Reports reviewed mentioned minorities 
one or more times and barely 20 per cent of the Reports discussed the situation of minorities 
under four or more of the Goals.  In none of the Reports was the situation of minorities 
mentioned under each of the 8 Goals.  Minorities are mentioned most often in relation to Goal 2 
on access to primary education. 
</p>
<p>114. In all cases, very few examples of specific policies for minorities were noted and 
disaggregated data on progress towards the MDGs was rarely included.  The result is that the 
likelihood of persons belonging to minorities achieving the MDGs (where they have not done so 
already) remains obscured.  This lack of information is not necessarily conclusive of practice on 
the ground, but it does suggest that ensuring strategies for the MDGs include attention to 
minorities, is still a low priority for most governments.  
</p>
<p>115. There is an absence of a comprehensive understanding of the poverty of minorities and 
its manifestations in the social, economic, cultural and political spheres.  In particular, even in 
those Reports where minorities are mentioned, there is a lack of discussion on how and, 
crucially, why, minorities are experiencing disproportionately high levels of poverty and other 
serious inequalities.  Ignoring the root causes of poverty and low human development only 
serves to weaken the effectiveness of MDG policies and PRSPs.  The issue of discrimination, 
both direct and indirect, is noticeably absent in the poverty analyses and also in policy responses 
for poverty reduction.  Discussion of other rights of minorities is rarely evidenced in the Reports. 
</p>
<p>116. Women belonging to minority groups remain invisible in poverty reduction efforts.  The 
compound effects of intersectional discrimination on the basis of gender and a national, ethnic, 
religious or linguistic identity means minority women continue to be among the most excluded.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>While attention to gender issues in many MDG country reports is positive, this does not extend 
to consideration of intersectional discrimination nor targeted policies for marginalized minority 
women.   
</p>
<p>117. It is clear in many of the Reports that reforms to poverty data collection is a high priority.  
Given that most Reports omit disaggregated data on the basis of membership in a national, 
ethnic, religious or linguistic group, efforts to improve poverty data can mainstream ethno-
cultural data collection.  This represents one of the more effective uses of resources in the short 
to medium term for helping to improve the monitoring and evaluation of existing MDG policies.  
Corresponding MDGs Plus targets and indicators disaggregated by social group will be 
supported by these efforts. 
</p>
<p>118. The three PRSPs reviewed here demonstrate that attention to marginalized minorities can 
be integrated into broader poverty reduction strategies.  While resources and capacity are vital 
factors, the starting point for improving the impact of poverty reduction on minorities is political 
will.  MDG country reports and PRSPs are flagships for this political will and if the situation of 
minorities is analyzed better in these documents, accompanied by requisite strategies, this can 
serve to empower minorities to realize their human rights.   
</p>
<p>119. The participation of minorities in the elaboration of PRSPs and MDG related strategies 
risks being tokenistic.  The purpose of their participation is not to satisfy external donors or 
political interests:  it both fulfils their right to participate and their role in determining their own 
future.  If poverty reduction and the MDGs are to make a difference in the lives of the most 
marginalized, they must be given the opportunity to help decide how this will happen.  
</p>
<p>120. Each country will need to consider the particular challenges faced by persons within their 
territory for achieving the MDGs.  There are many factors that make realization of the MDGs a 
challenge, including the need for increased development assistance, better transparency in 
governance and economic, social and political stability.  It is important to recall, however, the 
objective of the Millennium Declaration, to &#8220;strengthen the capacity of all our countries to 
implement the principles and practices of democracy and respect for human rights, <i>including 
minority rights&#8221;</i>.<b>23</b>  This objective must not be forgotten when it comes to devising strategies for 
the MDGs, so that when we reach 2015, marginalized minorities are not left further behind.  
</p>
<p>121. The independent expert on minority issues has made recommendations in the field of 
poverty alleviation and the MDGs in her Annual Report to the Human Rights Council in 
March 2007 (A/HRC/4/9).  Taking into account these recommendations and based on 
consultations, the independent expert makes the following further general recommendations to 
States, the United Nations and its agencies, international development agencies, human rights 
institutions and civil society, including representatives of minorities, on practical steps that can 
be taken in the following key areas:   
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Data collection: 
</b></p>
<p>122. Integrate indictors on the situation of persons belonging to minorities into national 
strategies on data collection.  The United Nations Inter-Agency and Expert Group (IAEG) on 
MDG Indicators should support States in this effort.   
</p>
<p>123. Add a specific indicator under each of the Goals to assess horizontal inequalities in 
progress towards the Goals.   
</p>
<p>124. Review national census questionnaires to ensure that ethno-cultural data is being 
collected. 
</p>
<p>125. Use sampling surveys or participatory impact assessments to gather information on how 
persons belonging to minorities are benefiting (or not) from MDG-related programmes.  
</p>
<p>126. Publish and distribute data on key economic and social indicators for persons belonging 
to minorities as a baseline to enable the elaboration and monitoring of MDG strategies.   
</p>
<p>127. Translate into minority languages data on key economic and social indicators and make 
this information publicly and easily accessible to persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>128. Be sensitive to cultural identity issues when gathering data to ensure that minorities are 
able to participate confidently in data collection activities; ensure that privacy laws are not 
breached in data collection.  
</p>
<p>129. Undertake research on key issues in relation to the achievement of the MDGs by persons 
belonging to minorities, such as analysis of appropriate policies in education, healthcare and 
housing. 
</p>
<p>130. Invest in national statistics offices, to provide training (including to persons belonging to 
minorities) on how to collect data on minorities and to enable the distribution of this data.  
</p>
<p><b>Consultative bodies: 
</b></p>
<p>131. Cooperate with existing national consultative bodies on minorities to improve the 
participation of minorities in MDG-related strategies. 
</p>
<p>132. Establish consultative bodies at the local and national level that enable minorities to 
engage in planning for MDG-related strategies. 
</p>
<p>133. Ensure that minorities are informed about and represented in any thematic-specific 
consultative processes on the MDGs, e.g. on the gender equality MDGs.   
</p>
<p>134. Ensure that marginalized groups within minority communities, in particular minority 
women, are able to participate fully in consultations on the MDGs. 
</p>
<p>135. Facilitate local, national and regional civil society dialogues on the MDGs to enable 
networking and the elaboration of proposals to government on the MDGs. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>136. Engage parliamentarians and the media in dialogues on the situation of minorities and the 
achievement of the MDGs.   
</p>
<p><b>National action plans: 
</b></p>
<p>137. Draft national action plans in cooperation with persons belonging to minorities on how to 
ensure that minorities benefit equally from progress towards the MDGs. 
</p>
<p>138. Devise country-specific MDG Plus indicators pertaining to minorities. 
</p>
<p>139. Ensure that MDG-related strategies are accompanied by measures to strengthen the legal 
and regulatory framework necessary for the protection of human rights, including minority 
rights.  
</p>
<p>140. Adopt affirmative action policies where the gaps in achieving the MDGs are severe for 
minorities, e.g. in relation to access to primary education. 
</p>
<p>141. Civil society should undertake advocacy campaigns pertaining to the MDGs to raise 
public awareness about the situation of persons belonging to minorities.  The media should be 
used as a partner to raise awareness of timely issues of concern to minorities.  
</p>
<p>142. Civil society should consider using legal mechanisms to secure human rights in relation 
to the MDGs, for example, taking legal cases on involuntary displacement of minorities. 
</p>
<p><b>Capacity building: 
</b></p>
<p>143. Disseminate information on the MDGs and MDG-related strategies to minority 
communities, including through publishing public information in minority languages, through 
local radio and traditional meeting processes.  
</p>
<p>144. Provide training for representatives of minorities on monitoring progress towards the 
MDGs, in particular on themes such as budget monitoring. 
</p>
<p>145. Provide training for development professionals and parliamentarians working on 
MDG-related strategies on the situation of minorities and minority rights.  Such training may be 
particularly useful for UNDP Country Teams who play a key role in supporting such strategies.  
</p>
<p>146. Toolkits and guidelines published on the MDGs should integrate consideration of the 
situation of minorities.  
</p>
<p>147. The UNDP should take the lead in establishing an Inter-Agency Task Force on 
Minorities and the MDGs to mobilise United Nations agencies and United Nations Country 
Teams to take further steps to support the integration of minorities into MDG-related strategies.  
</p>
<p>148. Civil society participation in MDG-related strategies should be facilitated through 
specially designated funding lines for this aim.   </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.1 
  page 43 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>149. The UNDP should proceed with the elaboration and adoption of a specific Policy Note on 
Minorities to assist governments and UNDP Country Teams, <i>inter alia</i>, with the integration of 
minorities into MDG strategies.  
</p>
<p><b>MDG country reports: 
</b></p>
<p>150. All MDG country reports should include consideration of the situation of minorities in 
relation to each of the Goals.  Disaggregated data on the progress of minorities towards the 
Goals should be included.   
</p>
<p>151. MDG country reports should aim to include MDG Plus indicators for minorities where 
appropriate.  
</p>
<p>152. MDG country reports should reflect an analysis of the intersection of discrimination on 
the basis of gender and membership in a national, ethnic, religious or linguistic social group. 
</p>
<p>153. The UNDP&#8217;s <i>Guidance Note on Country Reporting for MDGs</i> (2003) should be revised 
to include more in-depth analysis and recommendations on how Country Reports and strategies 
for the MDGs can better support marginalized minorities.  
</p>
<p>154. MDG country reports should be published in minority languages as appropriate and made 
publicly and easily accessible to persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>155. Civil society should consider drafting MDG Shadow Country Reports as one means of 
highlighting issues omitted from the official MDG country reports, such as those issues of 
concern to minorities. </p>
