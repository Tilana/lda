the administration of justice, in particular in post-conflict situations, as a crucial 
contribution to building peace and justice,

profession and the integrity of the judicial system are essential prerequisites for the 
protection of human rights and for ensuring that there is no discrimination in the 
administration of justice, 
<i> Aware</i> of the need for special vigilance with regard to the specific situation of

of their liberty, and their vulnerability to various forms of violence, abuse, injustice and 
humiliation, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all 
decisions concerning deprivation of liberty, and in particular that depriving children and 
juveniles of their liberty should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest 
appropriate period of time, in particular before trial, and the need to ensure that, if they are 
arrested, detained or imprisoned, children should be separated from adults, to the greatest 
extent feasible, unless it is considered in the child&#8217;s best interest not to do so, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the best interests of the child should also be a primary consideration 
in relation to the question of whether and how long children of imprisoned mothers should 
stay with them in prison, and emphasizing the responsibility of the State to provide 
adequate care for women in prison and their children,

well as adequate resources, to ensure the full implementation of those standards, and invites 
them to take into consideration the issue of human rights in the administration of justice in 
the universal periodic review procedure; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Invites </i>Governments to include in their national development plans the 
administration of justice as an integral part of the development process, and to allocate 
adequate resources for the provision of legal aid services with a view to the promotion and 
protection of human rights, and invites the international community to respond favourably </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>to requests for financial and technical assistance for the enhancement and strengthening of 
the administration of justice, including juvenile justice; 
 5. <i>Stresses</i> the special need for national capacity-building in the field of the 
administration of justice, in particular to establish and maintain stable societies and the rule 
of law in post-conflict situations, through reform of the judiciary, the police and the penal 
system, as well as juvenile justice reform; 
 6. <i>Invites </i>Governments to provide for training, including anti-racist, 
multicultural and gender-sensitive and child rights training, in human rights in the

The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous General Assembly and Council resolutions on the right to 
food, in particular Assembly resolution 63/187 of 18 December 2008 and Council 
resolution 7/14 of 27 March 2008, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on Human 
Rights in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>the holding of its seventh special session, at which it analysed the 
negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the realization of the right to 
food for all, and that a follow-up to that issue is being carried out, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger is 
recognized, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, 
adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national 
food security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation 
that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations and that endanger food security, </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>29 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Convinced </i>that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked 
institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities 
are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have a global 
dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made on reducing hunger, and that 
they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted 
action is taken, given the anticipated increase in the world population and the stress on 
natural resources, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
factors contributing to destitution and desperation and have a negative impact on the 
realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at<b> </b>the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development 
assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official 
development assistance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the recent pledges to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, and recalling that the realization of the right to food does not only entail 
increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder 
and traditional farmers and the most vulnerable groups and national and international 
policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
international levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious 
food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be 
free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and 
mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that more than 6 million children still die every year 
from hunger-related illnesses before their fifth birthday, that there are at least 963 million 
undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has 
diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent 
years when, according to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world&#8217;s 
present population; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and 
discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>States, in accordance with their relevant obligations under the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, to take </p>


<p><b>30</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women,<b> </b>in particular where it 
contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full 
and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to 
resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed themselves and their 
families; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> the need to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land 
rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including in particular 
rural women and vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the 
mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations 
bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate and 
effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective into their 
relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reaffirms </i>the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious 
food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take steps with a view to achieving progressively the 
full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for everyone 
to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and<b>, </b>where 
appropriate, to adopt national strategies for the realization of the right to adequate food and 
to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to 
adequate food, with a view to facing them; 
</p>
<p> (b) Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to 
contributing to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> (c) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between 
national and subnational levels of government; 
</p>
<p> (d) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the 
setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that 
require progressive implementation; 
</p>
<p> (e) Ensure the adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure 
segments of the population; 
</p>
<p> (f) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most 
vulnerable segments of society; 
</p>
<p> 10.<b> </b><i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1 and article 11, 
paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses </i>that improving access to productive resources and public investment 
in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-
scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to 
droughts; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 per 
cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, and that these people are especially 
vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm 
incomes, that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing 
challenge for poor producers, and that support by States for small farmers, fishing </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and provision of the 
right to food; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to 
the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries experiencing serious 
drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Also stresses </i>its commitments to promote and protect, without 
discrimination, the economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, in 
accordance with international human rights obligations, and taking into account, as 
appropriate, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and 
acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
communities have expressed in different forums their deep concerns at the obstacles and 
challenges that they face in the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to 
take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger 
and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against 
them; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests </i>all States and private actors, as well as international organizations 
within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the 
effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in 
different fields; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment and international 
assistance, upon request and in cooperation with affected countries, for a better realization 
and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop national protection 
mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or natural or 
man-made disasters affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 
 17. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
food security policies;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 18. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
(A/HRC/10/5), in which he examines how development cooperation and food aid policies 
could make a contribution to the realization of the right to food everywhere; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue cooperating with States in 
order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the 
realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views 
of all stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Stresses </i>that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on his 
mission to the World Trade Organization (A/HRC/10/5/Add.2), and encourages the Special 
Rapporteur to continue to engage with the World Trade Organization to follow up on the 
issues of concern identified in his report; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Recalls </i>the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; </p>


<p><b>32</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites 
once again all Governments, international financial and development institutions, as well as 
the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the 
necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the number, or at least<b> </b>the 
proportion, of people who suffer from hunger, as stated in Millennium Development Goal 
1, as well as the right to food, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all 
people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive 
response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable 
diseases; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of international development cooperation and 
assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency 
situations, such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of 
the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that 
each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national 
programmes and strategies in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive 
impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the 
implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the 
fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution 
of the private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of 
ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Recognizes</i> the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to adequate 
food of insufficient purchasing power and of increased volatility of prices of agricultural 
commodities on the international markets, particularly on people in developing countries 
and on net-food importing countries; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Supports </i>the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as extended 
for a period of three years by the Council in its resolution 6/2 of 27 September 2007; 
</p>
<p> 31. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to continue to provide all the necessary human and financial resources 
for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 32. <i>Welcomes </i>the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment 
No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the 
right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and 
is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill 
of Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of 
appropriate economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and </p>

rights for all; 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Recalls </i>general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right to 
water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant), in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the 
importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture 
in the realization of the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization 
of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security represent a practical 
tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the achievement of 
food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally 
agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 35. <i>Acknowledges</i> the work undertaken by the Advisory Committee on the right 
to food; 
</p>
<p> 36.<i> Requests</i> the Advisory Committee to undertake a study on discrimination in 
the context of the right to food, including identification of good practices of anti-

Rapporteur in his/her task to supply all necessary information requested by him/her and to 
give serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Special 
Rapporteur to visit their countries to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate more 
effectively; 
</p>
<p> 39. <i>Recalls </i>the requests made by the General Assembly, in its resolution 63/187, 
that the Special Rapporteur submit to it an interim report at its sixty-fourth session on the 
implementation of that resolution and to continue his/her work, including by examining the 
emerging issues with regard to the realization of the right to food within his existing

</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the report of the Secretary-General on the status of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (A/HRC/10/86), 
<i> Celebrating</i> the twentieth anniversary of the Convention in 2009 and taking this 
opportunity to call for its effective implementation by all States parties to ensure that all 
children may fully enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
<i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 47 of Council resolution 7/29 and particularly the 
Council&#8217;s decision to consider an omnibus resolution on the rights of the child every four 
years, and to focus on a theme of the rights of the child on an annual basis in the 
intervening period, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the constructive dialogue on &#8220;20 years of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child: achievements and challenges ahead for its full realization&#8221; on the occasion of

remains critical and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is 
needed,

and the Optional Protocols thereto to do so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls on</i> all States parties to withdraw reservations that are incompatible with 
the object and purpose of the Convention or the Optional Protocols thereto, and encourages 
all States parties to the Convention or the Optional Protocols to establish a regular

Optional Protocols, with a view to withdrawing them in order to ensure the fullest possible 
respect for the Convention and the Optional Protocols in all States parties; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the States parties to take effective measures to ensure that their 
obligations arising from the Convention are given effect and comprehensively implemented 
through policy and legislation within their domestic systems and to review their national 
legislation with this aim; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> all States parties to systematically assess any proposed law, 
administrative guidance, policy or budgetary allocation that is likely to have an impact on 
children and their rights, taking into account the interdependence and indivisibility of the 
rights of the child and ensuring appropriate enforcement of their obligations under the 
Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also</i> <i>calls upon</i> all States to ensure that development and evaluation of States 
policies on children are informed by available, sufficient, reliable and disaggregated data on 
children, covering the whole period of childhood and all the rights guaranteed in the 
Convention; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges </i>all States to develop or renew, as appropriate through a process of 
consultation, including with children and young people and their representatives, as well as 
those living and working with them, comprehensive national strategies for children, taking 
into account the Convention, setting out specific goals, targeted implementation measures 
and allocation of financial and human resources and including arrangements for monitoring 
and regular review, and to endorse this strategy at the highest level of government and 
ensure its comprehensive dissemination, including in child-friendly formats as well as in 
appropriate languages and forms; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recognizing</i> that the sufficient allocation of resources in public spending, 
including in primary education and basic health care, is a fundamental condition for the full 
realization of the rights of the child, calls upon States to make children a priority in their 
budgetary allocations, make resources allocated to children visible in the State budget 
through a detailed compilation of resources allocated to them and to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that children, including in particular marginalized and disadvantaged 
groups of children, are protected from the adverse effects of financial downturns;

<p> 8. <i>Calls on</i> States to take all appropriate measures, including legal reforms and 
special support measures, to ensure the enjoyment by children of all their human rights and

mechanisms such as national human rights institutions in accordance with the Paris 
Principles, children&#8217;s ombudspersons, commissioners or focal points on the rights of the 
child in national human rights institutions that are sufficiently funded and accessible to 
children, to promote and monitor the implementation of the Convention and advance the 
universal realization of children&#8217;s rights; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also calls on </i>all States to ensure that child-sensitive procedures are made 
available to children and their representatives so that children have access to means of 
facilitating effective remedies for any breaches of any of their rights arising from the 
Convention through independent advice, advocacy and complaint procedures, including 
justice mechanisms, and that their views are heard when they are involved or their interests 
concerned in justice procedures; 
 12. <i>Further calls</i> <i>on</i> States to develop further, as appropriate, effective 
mechanisms that encourage and facilitate expression by children of their views, in 
particular with regard to the formulation of public policies from the local level up to the 
national level, and to ensure meaningful participation of children and reflection of their 
views in monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon </i>all States to promote and develop, as appropriate, practical and 
systematic education and training for all those involved in the implementation of the 
Convention, government officials, parliamentarians and members of the judiciary, and for 
all those working with and for children as well as continuous specific education for children 
themselves, with the aim of emphasizing the status of the child as a holder of human rights, 
increasing knowledge and understanding of the Convention and encouraging active respect 
for all its provisions;

demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem 
and the Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative 
to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular 
article 49 of that Convention, and recalls that settlements are a major obstacle to the 
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, 
viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Israeli planned settlement construction in the vicinity of the Adam 
settlements in the occupied West Bank, which constitutes a new settlement block; 
</p>
<p> (c) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008 amounting to 1,257, 
including 748 permanent buildings and 509 mobile structures, which obstruct the efforts of 
the international community to advance the Middle East peace process; 
</p>
<p> (d) The implications for the final status negotiations of the announcement by 
Israel that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (e) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would be tantamount to de facto 
annexation; 
</p>
<p> (f) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and 
the restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated 
closures of the crossing points of the Occupied Gaza Strip, which have created an 
extremely precarious humanitarian situation for the civilian population as well as impaired 
the economic and social rights of the Palestinian people; 
</p>
<p> (g) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall inside 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (h) The latest Israeli plan to demolish more than 88 houses in the Al-Bustan 
neighbourhood of Silwan, which will result in the displacement of more than 1,500 
Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (a) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including in East 
Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and 
related activities;

 5. <i>Urges</i> the full implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access of

United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory;

September 2001;

<p> 7. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>in this respect that Islam is frequently and wrongly 
associated with human rights violations and terrorism and, in this regard, regrets the laws or

clearly reaffirms, inter alia, that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality, civilization or group, as well as the need to reinforce the commitment

of Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulated that the prohibition of the 
dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with 
freedom of opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the question of incitement to 
religious hatred;

<p> 12. <i>Strongly condemns </i>all manifestations and acts of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities and migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, including on 
the basis of religion or belief, and urges all States to apply and, where required, reinforce 
existing laws when such xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or expressions occur, 
in order to deny impunity for those who commit such acts;

systems, adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, intimidation and 
coercion resulting from defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in 
general, and to take all possible measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions 
and beliefs; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Underscores </i>the need to combat defamation of religions and incitement to 
religious hatred in general by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local, national, 
regional and international levels through education and awareness-building; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to make the utmost effort, in accordance with their 
national legislation and in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian 
law, to ensure that religious places, sites, shrines and symbols are fully respected and 
protected, and to take additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable to desecration 
or destruction; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Calls for</i> strengthened international efforts to foster a global dialogue for the 
promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human 
rights and diversity of religions and beliefs, and urges States, non-governmental 
organizations, religious leaders as well as the print and electronic media to support and 
foster such a dialogue; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Expresses its appreciation </i>to the High Commissioner for holding a seminar 
on freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, in October 2008, and requests her to continue to build 
on this initiative, with a view to contributing concretely to the prevention and elimination of 
all such forms of incitement and the consequences of negative stereotyping of religions or 
beliefs, and their adherents, on the human rights of those individuals and their communities;

<p> 18. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to report on all manifestations of

recommendations was on this basis.  
</p>
<p>267. The delegation stated that consultations for the establishment of an independent 
national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles had been 
concluded and that the relevant recommendations would be submitted to cabinet for 
consideration. Botswana currently had several institutions that directly addressed human 
rights issues, including the Department of Social Services for Children&#8217;s Welfare, the 
Department of Women Affairs for Gender Issues and the Independent Electoral 
Commission for Universal Suffrage.  </p>


<p><b>128</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>268. Botswana confirmed that the Children&#8217;s Act was still under review and in its final 
stages before Parliament. The delegation noted that corporal punishment was still lawful 
and that the Customary Courts, the Penal Code and the Education Act and Regulations 
governed its administration and contained restrictions on its application. It indicated that 
corporal punishment was not intended to be degrading but was viewed as a legitimate and 
acceptable form of punishment.  
</p>
<p>269. The delegation noted that all indigenous groups in Botswana were accorded 
opportunities guaranteed to every Motswana.  
</p>
<p>270. With regard to the recommendations that it take measures to address all forms of 
discrimination, including that based on sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, colour and 
political opinion, Botswana indicated that the Government maintained that section 15 (3) of 
its Constitution prohibited discrimination against any person on the grounds of race, tribe, 
place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex, and, as such, any person of the view 
that their rights had been violated could, at any time, seek redress before the High Court of 
Botswana. While it acknowledged that Botswana criminalized same-sex sexual activity and 
practices, a reflection of the moral and religious norms of the society, it noted that there 
was no known case of discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>271. Botswana emphasized that, since its ratification of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, it had undertaken various 
initiatives with a view to promoting and protecting the rights of women. It had continued to 
undertake progressive legislative reforms to this end, including the enactment of the 
Domestic Violence Act and the Abolition of Marital Powers Act. The Government 
continued to educate Batswana through seminars and meetings with stakeholders, including 
Kgotla meetings, publications and media. 
</p>
<p>272. Botswana drew the Council&#8217;s attention to the fact that the Marriage Act forbade 
marriage of persons under the age of 18 years without the consent of the parents or 
guardians. The delegation pointed out that Botswana did not accept the recommendations 
implying the existence of harmful practices to women, especially those alleging the 
persistence of early contract marriages and the existence of polygamy. It indicated that 
there were no practices harmful to women and that the law in Botswana forbade polygamy. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>273. Algeria thanked the delegation of Botswana for the comments and complete replies 
to the recommendations made during the Working Group session. Algeria was encouraged 
by Botswana&#8217;s determination to comply with its human rights obligations, despite the 
challenges it faced, particularly in terms of development. Algeria noted that the number of 
recommendations accepted by the country was an excellent example. Algeria shared and 
understood Botswana&#8217;s concern regarding the need to have necessary resources to meet its 
obligations under international instruments. Algeria noted that this was a decisive element 
in the decision by a sovereign Government to accede to an international instrument. Algeria 
praised Botswana&#8217;s efforts to extend the benefits of its pilot project to fight HIV/AIDS to 
refugees and migrants as well as the efforts aimed at reinforcing actions for women. Algeria 
welcomed the decision to accept the recommendations made by Algeria in this respect. It 
stated that the international community had a responsibility to provide support to Botswana 
through provision of sustainable, appropriate technical and financial assistance on the basis 
of the needs expressed by Botswana, with a view to enabling Botswana to fulfil its human 
rights commitments and to improve its performance in seeking to achieve this objective in 
line with its national priorities. 
</p>
<p>274. Senegal thanked the head of the delegation for his clear and detailed presentation on 
his country&#8217;s position on the recommendations formulated during the interactive dialogue. </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>129 
</b></p>
<p>Senegal welcomed the fact that Botswana had accepted most of the recommendations and 
encouraged Botswana to put them into practice in order to make the progress already 
achieved irreversible. Senegal invited Botswana to pay particular attention to issues relating 
to the rights of the child and of women as well as to those concerning the eradication of 
poverty and the promotion of education and health. Senegal wished the authorities of 
Botswana every success in their efforts to ensure the continuing improvement of the human 
rights situation in their country.  
</p>
<p>275. The United States of America commended Botswana for its commitment to 
democratic principles and appreciated its leadership in promoting similar progress in the 
Southern African Development Community region and the continent as a whole. The 
United States recognized Botswana&#8217;s investment in improving health care, access to 
primary education and the higher enrolment rates for children, particularly for girls. It also 
praised the role of women in government and society, and welcomed the implementation of 
the new domestic violence law, noting that increasing the access of women to development 
assistance and provision of better legal protections for women, including for rape, would 
help consolidate the gains for women. It also noted the recent opening of dialogue with the 
San, expressing hope that further discussions with the San and other minority groups would 
be held in order to better address land, education and development assistance issues. The 
United States further commended Botswana for its intent to improve the national capacity 
to promote and monitor human rights, including efforts to address judicial delays. The 
United States stated that it supported Botswana&#8217;s efforts to promote the professionalization 
and human rights training for its security forces and the seeking of assistance in this area. 
</p>
<p>276. Djibouti noted that, like all other countries in the subregion, Botswana faced 
enormous difficulties in effectively implementing its policy to eradicate poverty. Noting 
that Botswana had been severely affected by HIV/AIDS in recent years, Djibouti praised 
the Government for setting up a policy to monitor HIV/AIDS, and indicated that this should 
be shared with other countries affected by the pandemic. Djibouti expressed the view that 
the recommendations emanating from the universal periodic review would help improve the 
general human rights situation in the country. However, the implementation of these 
recommendations would require an internal and external symbiosis to meet the challenges 
faced by Botswana. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>277. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network commended the delegation for its 
acceptance of recommendation 24 on measures to address HIV/AIDS, but expressed its 
disappointment at the rejection of recommendations 18 and 23 on non-discrimination based 
on sexual orientation and the decriminalization of same-sex activity. It urged the 
Government to consider repealing the provisions of its penal code that criminalize same-sex 
conduct between consenting adults. It was noted that the Human Rights Committee had 
found that such provisions violated established international human rights law, in particular 
the rights to non-discrimination and privacy. Noting the comments made by the delegation 
that there was no known case of discrimination on those grounds, he referred to the Human 
Rights Committee, which had found that even when the laws were not actively enforced, 
they stigmatized and marginalized vulnerable groups in society. The struggle against 
HIV/AIDS was also undermined by such provisions. The Human Rights Committee and 
UNAIDS had repeatedly emphasized that they ran counter to efforts to address HIV and 
AIDS by driving marginalized communities underground. In December 2008. 66 States 
from all regional groups, including 6 from the African region, called for an end to laws 
criminalizing homosexuality. The call was supported by the High Commissioner, who 
stated that no human being, simply because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender 
identity, may be subject to discrimination, violence, criminal sanctions or abuse. </p>


<p><b>130</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>Appreciation was expressed for the statement of the Government that no people should be 
subject to discrimination and its expressed willingness to remain open on these grounds.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>278. In conclusion, Botswana expressed its appreciation for the constructive dialogue and 
interaction with all delegations that took the floor, including members of the non-
governmental organizations. Botswana appreciated the suggestions made in December 
2008 and at the present meeting, while noting the short-, medium- and long-term 
implications of implementing the recommendations. Noting the challenges Botswana would 
face in terms of financial and human resources, it stated that, with the support of the 
international community, Botswana would succeed. 
</p>
<p>279. Botswana thanked the President of the Council for his professionalism and for the 
able manner in which the review was conducted, as well as the members of the troika and 
the Secretariat. It indicated that it looked forward to the implementation and follow-up 
phase.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Bahamas 
</b></p>
<p>280. The review of the Bahamas was held on 1 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by the Bahamas in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BHS/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BHS/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BHS/3). 
</p><p>281. At the 27th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the Bahamas (see section C below). 
282. The outcome of the universal periodic review on the Bahamas comprises the report 
of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/70 and 
A/HRC/10/70/Corr.1), the views of the Bahamas concerning the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of 
the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed 
during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/10/70/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>283. The Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, Joshua 
Sears, stated that the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, when it joined the international 
community some 35 years earlier, had made a solemn undertaking to respect sovereignty 
and territorial integrity, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The 
delegation noted that the Bahamas had at every important moment of international 
significance reaffirmed its commitment to those principles &#8211; principles and values that had 
played an indispensable role in the institutionalization and consolidation of democracy, 
political stability and economic and social progress and development of the Bahamas. 
</p>
<p>284. The delegation stated that the Bahamas, the second oldest parliamentary democracy 
in the western hemisphere, had a well-established record of democracy, respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The Government fully understood and 
appreciated that respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights required 
eternal vigilance and actions to ensure that these rights are effectively enjoyed by all 
members of society. The Bahamas also acknowledged the vital role that civil society must 
play in this whole process. </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>131 
</b></p>
<p>285. During the review of the Bahamas, held at the third working session of the Working 
Group in December 2008, the Bahamas had committed to review further the 
recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/10/70), and to 
report on the status of the recommendations at the plenary session of the Council. The 
delegation drew the Council&#8217;s attention to the document that had been submitted by the 
Bahamas as a formal follow-up report (A/HRC/10/70/Add.1). 
</p><p>286. The delegation informed the Council that, since its review in December 2008, the 
Bahamas had signed and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (4 December 2008) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (23 December 2008). Both treaties would enter into force for the Bahamas on 23 
March 2009. In addition, the Bahamas had, on 16 December 2008, signed the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The 
Bahamas intended to ratify the Convention following the necessary review of the legislative 
requirements.  
</p>
<p>287. The Bahamas also highlighted the Police Amendment Act 2009, which permitted 
civilian oversight of the complaints process. 
</p>
<p>288. With respect to the Carmichael Road Detention Centre, the delegation stated that the 
Government continued to implement recommendations designed to enhance the 
environment and management of the facility and continued to maintain close collaboration 
and cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 
this regard.  
</p>
<p>289. The delegation indicated that, during the review, the Bahamas expected to submit 
outstanding reports due under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women by 31 December 2008. It stated that the Bahamas was unfortunately unable 
to meet this self-imposed deadline, but that the consultative process was almost complete, 
paving the way for the submission of those reports in due course. The delegation also 
informed that the preparatory process was also under way for the report due under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>290. The delegation reaffirmed the commitment of the Bahamas to continue to work with 
the human rights treaty bodies and the Council to ensure that there was constructive 
dialogue and to enhance the capacity of the Bahamas to carry out its reporting obligations 
under international human rights instruments. The delegation emphasized the recognition 
by the Bahamas that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms required constant action by the Government and civil society, and that the 
Bahamas was committed to that task. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>291. Egypt welcomed the presence of the delegation of the Bahamas, which was 
testimony to the commitment of the Bahamas to the protection and promotion of human 
rights. On behalf of the African Group, Egypt expressed the importance that the African 
Group always attached to relations with the Bahamas and CARICOM at large. Egypt 
stressed that the fact that the Bahamas had come to Geneva twice (first to present its 
universal periodic review report and then to attend its adoption) showed that the 
Government was seriously committed to human rights and that something serious had to be 
done to assist countries that were not represented in Geneva in following the work of the 
Council. Egypt further expressed, on behalf of the African Group, its utmost support for the 
choices that the Bahamas had made with regard to human rights. Regarding the 
recommendations that the Bahamas had accepted, the African Group acknowledged the </p>


<p><b>132</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>sovereign right of the Bahamas to follow the path convenient to its own society and its own 
values. 
</p>
<p>292. Cuba expressed its appreciation for the presence of the Director-General of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, and endorsed the statement of Egypt. The 
Bahamas, a small country of the Caribbean and a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, 
enjoyed friendly relations with Cuba, and was facing a serious economic situation because 
of, inter alia, lack of resources. Cuba acknowledged the efforts and achievements of the 
Bahamas. Cuba thanked the delegation of the Bahamas for its presence, expressed its 
support and urged the Bahamas to carry on all necessary measures to protect all human 
rights of its people. 
</p>
<p>293. France welcomed the announcement by the Bahamas to bring national legislation 
into line with major international human rights instruments, the efforts in this regard and 
the reference to the police and detention centres. France encouraged the Government of the 
Bahamas regarding the action to be taken on the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. France congratulated the Government of the Bahamas on 
its approach and on the fact that it had committed to accept the recommendations made by 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>294. On behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States, Chile welcomed the presence 
of the delegation of the Bahamas and thanked it for the information on the efforts under 
way to comply with the recommendations made by the Working Group. Chile also thanked 
the Bahamas for its presence, which was the illustration of its firm commitment to the 
promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>295. Barbados welcomed the delegation of the Bahamas, which came to Geneva to 
present its response to the recommendations made by the Working Group. Barbados stated 
that, in doing so, the Bahamas had demonstrated its firm commitment to the protection of 
human rights and the acceptance and consideration of a number of recommendations made. 
Barbados urged the international community to recognize and ensure full support to small 
developing States like the Bahamas, and to assist them in their efforts to implement their 
obligations. Finally, Barbados conveyed to the Bahamas its full support and wished it every 
success in its continuing human rights achievements. 
</p>
<p>296. Algeria warmly welcomed the delegation of the Bahamas and was encouraged by 
the resolve shown by the Government to meet its human rights commitments, despite the 
challenges the country faced, particularly in the field of development. It noted that the 
international community had a duty to support the Bahamas and to provide financial and 
technical assistance, sustainable and appropriate to the needs of the country. 
</p>
<p>297. Pakistan stated that the Bahamas should be encouraged in its efforts to comply with 
its human rights obligations in a comprehensive manner, and was glad that the Bahamas 
had accepted a number of recommendations made during its review. Pakistan believed that 
all stakeholders should make their technical expertise and other resources available to 
deepen cooperation with small developing States on improvement and protection of their 
human rights. Pakistan would continue to deepen its bilateral cooperation with the Bahamas 
to explore possibilities of exchanging technical expertise and knowledge concerning human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>298. Botswana congratulated the delegation of the Bahamas for the comprehensive 
presentation providing additional information on the outcome of the review on the 
country&#8217;s human rights situation. Botswana noted with satisfaction and admiration the fact 
that most of the recommendations made had been accepted. The commitment to the 
continued promotion and protection of human rights was clear from the open and inclusive </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>133 
</b></p>
<p>preparation of the review and from the interactive dialogue in December 2008. Botswana 
welcomed the involvement of civil society in the follow-up. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>299. Amnesty International welcomed the Bahamas&#8217; prompt ratification of the two 
Covenants following the announcement in the Working Group of its intention to do so. 
Amnesty International was disappointed that the Bahamas rejected recommendations 
relating to the death penalty, including the establishment of a moratorium on executions 
and the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political rights. It reiterated its call to the Bahamas to repeal all provisions allowing for 
the death penalty and to declare a moratorium on executions. Amnesty International 
welcomed the endorsement by the Bahamas of recommendations to ensure full and 
effective implementation of the Domestic Violence (Protection Order) Act and to address 
the problem of rape. Amnesty International remained concerned that recommendations to 
criminalize marital rape had been rejected. It urged the Bahamas to act swiftly and to 
conduct an independent investigation into recent allegations of ill-treatment, as recent 
reports indicated that abuses continue to take place at the Carmichael Road Detention 
Centre. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>300. The delegation of the Bahamas thanked the delegations for their constructive 
comments and was pleased by the level of support from the international community. It 
particularly commended the members of the troika &#8212; Djibouti, Malaysia and the 
Netherlands &#8212; for their support during the review process. 
</p>
<p>301. With respect to the issue of the Carmichael Road Detention Centre, the delegation 
said that the addendum to the report addressed a number of issues raised by Amnesty 
International and by other delegations. 
</p>
<p>302. The delegation reaffirmed its commitment to implement its human rights obligations 
and to continue to work closely with the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Burundi 
</b></p>
<p>303. The review of Burundi was held on 2 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Burundi in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BDI/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BDI/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BDI/3). 
</p><p>304. At the 27th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Burundi (see section C below). 
305. The outcome of the review on Burundi comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/71), the views of Burundi concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>306. The Minister for Human Rights and Gender provided replies to various issues raised 
during the review of Burundi. She indicated that Burundi seriously envisaged the </p>


<p><b>134</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance while, in the meantime, all measures had been taken to prevent and punish 
related crimes. Regarding the protection of discrimination based on sexual orientation, the 
amendment proposed by the Lower Chamber of Parliament had been rejected by the Higher 
Chamber and a mixed commission would be set up to determine the final position to be 
adopted. With regard to the training of law enforcement officers on sexual violence, she 
indicated that an ongoing education programme was under way and carried out by the State 
and civil society. In that regard, the new draft penal code criminalized sexual violence. The 
transitional justice mechanism composed of a truth and reconciliation commission and a 
special tribunal had been agreed upon between the Government and the United Nations. 
National consultations, a prerequisite for these mechanisms, were ongoing and would be 
soon concluded. 
</p>
<p>307. The delegation of Burundi further stressed that replies to issues contained in 
paragraphs 81 (1), (3), (6), (8) and (10) of the report of the Working Group had already 
been included in paragraphs 80, 82 and 83 of the report. During the review, in relation to 
paragraph 81 (1), Burundi had indicated that the new draft penal code, soon to be 
promulgated, abolished the death penalty as foreseen in the second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Regarding paragraph 81 (3) and 
discrimination between boys and girls in access to education, Burundi recalled that such 
discrimination had been eliminated and that a cultural education programme was under way 
to eliminate any remaining parental reticence. Referring to paragraphs 81 (6) and 81 (8), 
Burundi indicated that acts of torture and rape were criminalized in the new draft penal 
code. Finally, in relation to paragraph 81 (10), it had been indicated previously that the 
Ministerial Order of 6 October 2008 restricting public meetings had been revoked. 
</p>
<p>308. The delegation also presented new developments in Burundi since December 2008. 
The new draft penal code, which criminalized war crimes, crimes against humanity and 
those of genocide, torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, rape and sexual 
violence, and which guaranteed various children&#8217;s rights, had been recently adopted by the 
Parliament. The network of criminals who killed albino people was being dismantled; seven 
people had been arrested and two others sentenced. 
</p>
<p>309. A national strategy to fight sexual violence had just been adopted by the 
Government, which would, inter alia, provide for a harmonized mechanism to collect data 
and establish financial resources dedicated to fighting this type of violence. 
</p>
<p>310. Regarding the establishment of a national human rights commission in line with the 
Paris Principles, there was growing public opinion in favour of the Government 
commitment in that respect. 
</p>
<p>311. The delegation stressed that new civil and political associations had been created, 
and that the judiciary was protecting civil and political freedoms, as demonstrated by the 
recent release of some prisoners. A national independent electoral commission had recently 
been set up, with the support of all political partners and civil society, a guarantee to free 
and democratic elections in 2010. The President and Vice-President of the commission 
were representatives of the civil society. 
</p>
<p>312. Finally, Burundi had recently been granted an external debt relief, a measure that 
would contribute to raise its resources to protect and guarantee human rights, in particular 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>313. Algeria thanked Burundi for the comprehensive comments on recommendations 
made during the review, as well as for the update on measures taken since then. Algeria 
once again paid tribute to Burundi&#8217;s determination to work for peace through national </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>135 
</b></p>
<p>reconciliation among the different components of society. The number of recommendations 
accepted by Burundi demonstrated its firm commitment to engage seriously in the universal 
periodic review. A number of obligations arose from the recommendations that Burundi 
had accepted. Therefore, Algeria, together with many other countries, reiterated its appeal 
to the international community to increase its support for Burundi to enable it to meet its 
commitment to promote and protect human rights in all circumstances and in accordance 
with its national priorities. 
</p>
<p>314. Senegal reiterated that it had welcomed, in December 2008, Burundi&#8217;s efforts to 
promote and protect human rights, highlighting in particular the measures taken for women 
and children. Senegal stressed that acceptance by Burundi of recommendations concerning 
vulnerable groups demonstrated its willingness to improve the situation of these groups and 
to allow them to fully enjoy their rights. It further encouraged Burundi to effectively 
implement those recommendations and requested technical assistance for this purpose 
where needed. 
</p>
<p>315. The United States of America deeply respected the determination of the people of 
Burundi to escape the devastating remnants of civil war and to build a peaceful, prosperous 
and inclusive society for future generations. In this regard, it supported the recommendation 
that Burundi increase its efforts to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate children involved in 
armed conflict. The Government&#8217;s commitment to promote education was evident in the 69 
per cent increase in enrolment in primary education in the country from 2005 to 2008. With 
respect to recommendations on concerns about recent increases in sexual violence and rape 
in Burundi, the United States appreciated the fact that some 500 individuals, including 
Government officials, were serving sentences for rape or assault, and hoped that impunity 
for sexual violence, including spousal rape, would continue to be addressed. Other 
recommendations reflected concern about freedoms of association, expression, opinion and 
peaceful assembly. While noting that Burundi had an active civil society, the United States 
emphasized the important role played by independent journalists, political parties and civil 
society organizations in ensuring free and fair elections in 2010. It looked forward to the 
establishment of an independent national human rights commission and offered its support 
to Burundi in efforts to promote human rights and democracy. 
</p>
<p>316. Nigeria thanked Burundi for its presentation and was glad to note that Burundi had 
accepted most of the recommendations made, including that of Nigeria to intensify efforts 
to uphold the respect of the rule of law and reform the judicial system. Nigeria hoped that 
Burundi would improve greatly its human rights record, with the support and cooperation 
of the international community, by the second cycle of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>317. Djibouti noted that, following the deep institutional and political crisis of recent 
years, Burundi was now in transition and was making efforts to establish and build a viable 
and sustainable democratic society. Djibouti welcomed the efforts made by Burundi to 
work with the universal periodic review mechanism and appealed to the Council to help 
Burundi in the peace and reconstruction process. 
</p>
<p>318. Burkina Faso commended Burundi for the acceptance of recommendations made 
under the universal periodic review. It noted with satisfaction the continuing improvement 
in the human rights situation in Burundi despite the country&#8217;s crisis. It noted in particular 
the initiatives taken in the field of primary education and health care for children under the 
age of 5, as well as the progress in promoting and protecting women&#8217;s rights. It also noted 
the exemplary cooperation of Burundi with the international community, and particularly 
with United Nations human rights mechanisms. Burkina Faso reiterated its support for 
appeals to the international community to support Burundi&#8217;s efforts in implementing the 
recommendations arising from the review. </p>


<p><b>136</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>319. Amnesty International welcomed Burundi&#8217;s support of recommendations to 
establish an independent national human rights commission, compliant with the Paris 
Principles. It was concerned, however, that the draft bill, drawn up on 27 November 2008 
by the Council of Ministers, would create a commission that would fall far short of the 
Paris Principles by severely restricting its mandate, powers of inquiry, jurisdiction and 
independence. It urged the Government to reconsider the preceding version of the draft bill, 
which provided a higher level of independence and capacity for the commission. Amnesty 
International strongly urged the Government to support the recommendations calling on 
Burundi to ensure that no one was subject to discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation and to reconsider the inclusion of provisions criminalizing same-sex sexual 
relations in the draft criminal code. It regretted that Burundi had not expressly supported 
recommendations to respect freedoms of expression, association and assembly, and 
indicated that several prisoners of conscience remained in detention, among them Juv&#233;nal 
Rududura, Vice-President of the trade union of non-magistrate staff at the Department of 
Justice, and the journalist Jean-Claude Kavumbagu. It called on Burundi to immediately 
and unconditionally release those arrested solely for exercising their right to freedom of 
expression. 
</p>
<p>320. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Action Canada for Population and 
Development, in a joint statement, welcomed recent steps taken to integrate fundamental 
human rights norms into the penal code, in particular the abolition of the death penalty. 
However, they remained concerned that, although the Senate had rejected the provision that 
would have criminalized consensual homosexual conduct, the National Assembly had 
recently voted to restore such a provision. They urged legislators to eliminate the new 
provision or the President to veto it. They added that such provision would place Burundi at 
odds with the overwhelming movement across the world that had seen progress towards 
decriminalization, and violate the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It would severely hamper Burundi&#8217;s 
efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and force a part of Burundi&#8217;s population into 
silence and invisibility. 
</p>
<p>321. Human Rights Watch welcomed the report on Burundi. It noted with concern the 
recent decision by the National Assembly to advance an amendment to the penal code that 
would criminalize homosexuality, contrary to the recommendations made by Belgium, 
Chile and Slovenia. It encouraged the joint committee to eliminate criminalization of 
homosexuality, and if needed, the President to veto such a law. Human Rights Watch was 
deeply concerned about the prevalence of illegal and arbitrary arrests, many of which were 
politically motivated, and considered that Burundi should accept France&#8217;s recommendation 
to ban all secret places of detention. It deeply regretted that Burundi had rejected the 
recommendations of Italy, Switzerland and others to take all measures to guarantee the 
freedoms of expression and association. It added that the judicial system had been abused 
for prosecutions of opposition leaders and others who spoke out against the Government, 
noting in particular the arbitrary detention of Juv&#233;nal Rududura, Pasteur Mpawenayo, 
G&#233;rard Nkurunziza and Jean-Claude Kavumbagu. This called into question the 
independence of the judiciary, a subject of concern for Azerbaijan, the Netherlands and the 
United Kingdom. Human Rights Watch was concerned at the fact that, in the lead-up to the 
2010 elections, attempts to intimidate members of the opposition had been made. Burundi 
should act immediately to put an end to such activities, thereby implementing Japan&#8217;s 
recommendation, supported by Burundi, to do its utmost to ensure that political parties are 
safeguarded in the elections. 
</p>
<p>322. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues requested the reintroduction 
in the bill relating to the national commission on human rights of provisions to guarantee its </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>independence, in particular provisions associating with the Government other actors and 
institutions in choosing, appointing and replacing members of the commission; to enable 
the commission to directly approach the judicial system; to make appearance before the 
commission compulsory and the refusal to cooperate punishable; to grant members of the 
commission immunity from reprisals and sanctions for action taken in the course of their 
official activities; and to facilitate access to relevant documents. It urged the Government to 
take firm action against administrative staff whose negligence or complicity guaranteed de 
facto impunity for authors of sexual violence; and to draft and implement a law 
guaranteeing women&#8217;s rights to inheritance. Regarding the establishment of transitional 
justice mechanisms, it called on the Government to publicly reiterate its commitment to 
ensuring that consultations would not be used to justify decisions or acts contrary to 
international law; and to accept initiatives by the United Nations, the international 
community and civil society to ensure an independent monitoring of these consultations. It 
also called for the adoption of a national policy and specific legislation on the protection of 
the rights of the child, in particular orphans and other vulnerable children, and to adopt a 
juvenile justice system. 
</p><p>323. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine 
congratulated the delegation of Burundi for the quality of its presentation before the 
Working Group. It endorsed the appeal made to countries to show solidarity with Burundi 
and to help it to meet challenges relating to a culture of peace, tolerance and respect for 
human rights. The organization sought the support of Burundi for its draft universal 
declaration on the duties of the person. It noted with regret that the report of Burundi and 
the recommendations made by States did not refer to violence against men, and sought the 
cooperation of Burundi to carry out a study on that matter. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>324. Burundi thanked all those who contributed to the drafting of the national report and 
civil society for its support. It thanked all delegations who made recommendations and 
praised the Council for having established the universal periodic review mechanism, which 
had enabled Burundi to assess its progress in protecting and promoting human rights. 
Burundi pledged to gather all relevant stakeholders in the country to study how to 
implement the recommendations made. Further steps would have been taken for the 
protection and promotion of human rights in Burundi by the next session of the Council. 
Finally, Burundi reiterated its continued appreciation for the support provided by the 
international community. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Luxembourg 
</b></p>
<p>325. The review of Luxembourg was held on 2 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Luxembourg in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LUX/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LUX/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LUX/3). 
</p><p>326. At the 28th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Luxembourg (see section C below). 
327. The outcome of the review on Luxembourg comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/72), the views of Luxembourg 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/10/72/Add.1). </p>


<p><b>138</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>328. The Permanent Representative of Luxembourg to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva stated that it was a privilege for Luxembourg to be one of the first 48 countries to 
go through the universal periodic review process. Luxembourg supported the idea of this 
innovative mechanism, during the negotiations that resulted in the creation of the Council, 
because it sought greater discipline and efficiency in the United Nations system for the 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>329. The Permanent Representative gave a summary of Luxembourg&#8217;s responses to the 
recommendations addressed in the course of the interactive dialogue on 2 December 2008. 
He stated that a more comprehensive response to the recommendations had been provided 
in writing and was available as an addendum to the report of the working group 
(A/HRC/10/72/Add.1). 
</p><p>330. With regard to Luxembourg&#8217;s international obligations, the country had committed 
itself to take into account recommendations and to complete the various processes of 
ratification as soon as possible. However, in the case of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, there 
were major legal obstacles because of European Community competence in migrant worker 
issues, which did not allow the completion of the ratification of the Convention at this 
stage. Luxembourg expressed its hope that a study could be carried out in the European 
Union to determine possible ways and means of finding a solution with the view to the 
ratification of the Convention. Like other European Union partners, Luxembourg will 
continue to participate actively in the international community reflection on the issue of 
migrants. 
</p>
<p>331. The universal periodic review was a dynamic process of consultation of independent 
institutions monitoring compliance of human rights in Luxembourg. This consultation 
process also involved civil society organizations engaged in the promotion and protection 
of human rights. It was a beneficial exercise for the country. Luxembourg pledged to 
continue this consultation on a regular basis in order to ensure an appropriate follow-up to 
the review report and outcome. 
</p>
<p>332. Luxembourg was aware of the challenges in human rights of persons with mental 
disabilities. The country was about to conduct legislative reform to strengthen the 
fundamental rights of persons interned for psychiatric treatment without their consent. A 
law modifying the current regime for persons with mental disabilities was to be adopted 
very soon. The law would amend and update the current provisions to take into account the 
most recent international recommendations made on this issue, and would make the 
involuntary placement of persons with mental disturbances the subject of a court decision, 
which could be appealed at any moment of the procedure. The use of involuntary treatment 
and isolation detention measures would be used in very specific circumstances and as a last 
resort. On child psychiatry, Luxembourg had pledged to increase the number and quality of 
its infrastructures for the therapeutic treatment of children with behaviour or mental 
disturbances. These efforts would be continued to guarantee high-quality child psychiatry 
reflecting the latest developments in medicine. 
</p>
<p>333. Regarding the recommendation to develop legislation on immigration and 
international protection in keeping with the principle of non-refoulement, Luxembourg 
believed that its new legislation was in compliance with the principle of non-refoulement 
both in terms of immigration legislation and also on the rights of asylum. Concerning the 
recommendation to halt the practice of freeing minors at borders, this practice did not exist 
in Luxembourg. With regard to the recommendation on detention measures, Luxembourg 
would soon transpose the return directives of the European Union into its national </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>139 
</b></p>
<p>legislation. Concerning the recommendation on the placing and detention of international 
protection seekers, discussions were ongoing at the European level. 
</p>
<p>334. With regard to the recommendation on the elimination of racial discrimination, 
Luxembourg committed itself to submit the report requested by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination as soon as possible. The country would follow various 
provisions of the civil code and the criminal code, which criminalized and punished various 
forms of discrimination in Luxembourg. As part of ongoing training, human rights courses 
were provided to prison officials. 
</p>
<p>335. Regarding the recommendation to develop coherent strategies and a plan of action to 
prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women, particularly women from the 
immigrant community, and the recommendation concerning prostitution and trafficking in 
human beings, they would be incorporated into the second national plan of action for 
equality between men and women for the period 2009&#8211;2013. In order to make the best use 
of human and financial resources, the Government intended to produce a single plan for the 
implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action, to achieve greater coherence in 
political action to promote gender equality. The family in its various forms played a vital 
role in Luxembourg&#8217;s society. 
</p>
<p>336. Luxembourg pledged to respect the recommendations related to new measures to 
improve the rights of women and children and to implement the recommendation of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to elaborate strategies and 
programmes to combat prostitution and continue the Government&#8217;s efforts to combat sexual 
exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p>337. On the recommendation dealing with trafficking in human beings, Luxembourg 
recalled the three specific initiatives referred to in its national report, in paragraphs 34 to 
</p><p>40. 
</p>
<p>338. Canada recommended that the terminology used in French reflect the shared values 
for gender equality and equality between men, women and children. In this connection, the 
Permanent Representative stated that Luxembourg was totally in line with the terminology 
used in all international conventions to which it was a party. Luxembourg indicated that it 
was aware of the ongoing discussion on the terminology issue and was prepared, when 
appropriate, to align itself with universally recognized terminology, in keeping with the 
principle of non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>339. Luxembourg pledged to include gender dimensions in the review follow-up, such as 
in measures under chapter 9 on fundamental rights of the national plan of action for gender 
equality for 2009&#8211;2013, which was to be adopted after the election in 2009. 
</p>
<p>340. On freedom of religion or belief, Luxembourg stated that all religious communities 
and philosophical beliefs were treated equally. All beliefs were recognized ex officio and 
without discrimination by the Constitution and also in pursuance of the European 
Convention on human rights. Recognition of a particular religion did not give any 
additional rights to the congregation concerned. 
</p>
<p>341. The ban on corporal punishment in the family was effective in Luxembourg and the 
addendum to the report gave the legal reference in this regard. 
</p>
<p>342. The Government had noted the recommendations made with regard to the penal 
sector. Luxembourg did not underestimate the difficulties it faced, and was undertaking a 
policy to improve the conditions for the detention of juveniles in compliance with 
international standards. The placing of juveniles in security units could only be done by the 
judicial authorities. Given the particularly sensitive nature of infrastructures in the security 
units, the need to guarantee security and ensure the necessary educational and therapeutic </p>


<p><b>140</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>treatment, the number of young people placed in such security units could not exceed 12. In 
principle, the placement of children in security units should only be temporary and 
preventive, since extended stays in these units, despite the quality services, may jeopardize 
their family, social, school, professional and cultural reinsertion. 
</p>
<p>343. With regard to the situation of children of prisoners, Luxembourg did not have 
specific legislation, and such situations were treated on a case-by-case basis (currently only 
one case) in order to determine and ensure respect of the best interest of the child. Any new 
legislation would be seen as imposing new constraints and might force all parties to a very 
strict framework. 
</p>
<p>344. The recommendations concerning the hosting conditions for foreigners referred to 
the welcome and integration office in Luxembourg established by a law in December 2008. 
The office was responsible, in coordination with the inter-ministerial committee on 
integration, for the elaboration of a draft national plan of action for integration, and for 
combating discrimination by identifying the main strategic areas for action by the 
Government, identifying the policy measures that needed to be implemented. The draft had 
been submitted to the Government for approval. The Government would present a 
comprehensive strategy and determine targeted measures for the integration of aliens and to 
combat discrimination. Regarding equal treatment on education, any child of compulsory 
school age living in Luxembourg should be registered in school, regardless of nationality or 
status. A child could therefore not be refused access to school on racial, sex, language or 
religious grounds. Because of the specific language situation in Luxembourg, the Ministry 
of National Education had increased the number of measures to ensure that newly arrived 
children had access to school and were taught the three administrative languages of 
Luxembourg.  
</p>
<p>345. With regard to the working conditions of migrants, there were no particular 
problems for migrants, either men or women. Luxembourg&#8217;s legislation on labour issues 
applied in an equal and non-discriminatory manner to all workers in the territory. Equal pay 
for men and women was also guaranteed by the labour code. Neither the Government nor 
the courts had any particular information concerning problems in this area. Luxembourg did 
not see any particular reason to introduce positive discrimination in working conditions, 
since all workers were treated on an equal footing. 
</p>
<p>346. Luxembourg pledged to achieve the human rights voluntary goals enshrined in 
Council resolution 9/12. 
</p>
<p>347. Lastly, with regard to the recommendation that it continue its commitment to official 
development assistance (ODA), Luxembourg confirmed that it would continue to 
strengthen its development cooperation policy with the objective of combating poverty and 
helping developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. In 2009, 
Luxembourg would allocate 0.92 per cent of GNP to ODA. Luxembourg would continue its 
efforts to achieve a rate of 1 per cent in coming years, and also continue to encourage its 
partners in the European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development to respect their commitments to ODA in the United Nations or the European 
Union. Luxembourg felt particular responsibility in this connection, since it was under its 
presidency of the European Council in May 2005 that the States members of the European 
Union had undertaken an historical commitment to set up a new common and strong 
objective of raising ODA to 0.56 per cent by 2010, and to reach 0.7 per cent by 2015. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>348. No views were expressed by States Members and observers of the Council. </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>141 
</b></p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>349. The Consultative Committee for Human Rights of Luxembourg welcomed the fact 
that some of the recommendations made to Luxembourg by the Working Group coincided 
with the recommendations that it had put forward in its written contribution to the review 
summary report, as well as the recommendations made by regional bodies. This proved that 
there were still shortcomings in human rights in Luxembourg in a number of areas. For 
example, on the question of minors in prison, the Consultative Committee continued to be 
of the view that prison was fundamentally an inappropriate institution for juveniles. That 
was also being emphasized by the bodies at the Council of Europe. Regarding immigration 
and international protection, Luxembourg had a national regulation concerning the 
modalities for implementing decisions for removal from the territory under constraint. The 
Consultative Committee noted that the measures that Luxembourg had taken were not 
appropriate to the subject at hand and that a law should cover this kind of matter. It made an 
urgent appeal to Luxembourg authorities to ratify the relevant international conventions, in 
particular the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention against Torture and the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. It encouraged the 
Government of Luxembourg to follow up on the recommendations made by the Council 
under the framework of the universal periodic review. It would monitor their 
implementation as part of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>350. The Arab Commission for Human Rights welcomed the transparent way in which 
the delegation of Luxembourg had responded to the recommendations of the Working 
Group. It recommended that Luxembourg establish an institutional framework and a time 
frame for the implementation of recommendations and report back thereon to the Council 
within a year. It stressed that the participation of non-governmental organizations in the 
universal periodic review process was important. It noted that Luxembourg chaired the 
United Nations Economic and Social Council and hoped that Luxembourg would play an 
increasing role in defending the right of civil society to participate in United Nations 
deliberations. 
</p>
<p>351. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine welcomed 
the report on Luxembourg and commented on paragraph 53 thereto, citing the 
recommendation on the adoption of a comprehensive strategy for the elimination of 
violence against women with a preventive component. In this regard, it asked if there was 
already a comprehensive United Nations strategy concerning violence against women and 
suggested that, if it existed, it could be adopted by Member States. It also asked if such a 
strategy would be exclusively for Luxembourg. Along the same lines, it noted that the 
question of violence approached solely from the standpoint of violence against women 
would constitute discrimination, since violence against men was also a reality around the 
world. Therefore, it would be desirable for Luxembourg and all countries to elaborate a 
comprehensive strategy against violence in general with its three components: men, women 
and children. It mentioned that it was ready to bring its expertise to assist Luxembourg in 
the development of such a comprehensive strategy. It also supported the recommendation 
that Luxembourg cooperate with the adoption of the universal declaration on the duties of 
the person. 
</p>
<p>352. The International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture 
and ACAT Luxembourg had taken note of the date of 2010 for the construction of a closed 
centre for minors in Luxembourg. They saluted remarks made in the Working Group on the 
detention conditions of minors and requested that Luxembourg take into account concerns 
regarding children abandoned at borders. They welcomed the comments made by 
Luxembourg on alternatives to detention, but were concerned about the possible 
discriminatory implementation of such measures. They advocated alternatives to detention </p>


<p><b>142</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>for parents of children affected by these measures, in particular for pregnant women and 
mothers, including when these are foreigners or aliens with an irregular administrative 
status. They shared concerns on allegations of xenophobic or discriminatory behaviour of 
prison personnel towards foreign detainees. They welcomed the recommendation that 
holding measures of persons awaiting expulsion be restricted to cases of risk to national 
security or threat to public order. The two organizations stated that the possibility of placing 
minors in detention was a regressive step and hoped that Luxembourg would respect its 
international obligations in the planning of the new detention centre. With regard to the lack 
of provisions in Luxembourg&#8217;s legislation guaranteeing the principle of non-refoulement, 
they regretted that the response of Luxembourg had not been followed by a commitment in 
this regard. They supported the recommendation that Luxembourg ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>353. In his concluding remarks, the Permanent Representative expressed thanks to all the 
speakers. Luxembourg attached considerable importance to the activities carried out by the 
various commissions and organizations and would take into account the comments made. 
Luxembourg would conduct the follow-up process in cooperation with civil society, and 
report regularly to the Council on the progress made in this regard. Regarding detention 
conditions, Luxembourg reaffirmed its stance taken during the review in December 2008 
and explained in the national report. Regarding violence against women, measures had 
already been taken to address this issue in legislation and the national plan for 2009&#8211;2013. 
</p>
<p>354. The Representative stated that he took to heart the active participation by everyone 
in the universal periodic review and thanked the secretariat of OHCHR for its support, the 
members of the troika who had played a helpful part in the process, all Member States for 
their recommendations and civil society. The promotion and protection of human rights 
remained a continuing challenge for all States and the entire international community. 
Luxembourg was not above criticism and its endeavours to ensure the universal respect of 
human rights should not exempt it from the national efforts that it would expect of others. 
Luxembourg would continue its efforts to overcome difficulties where they existed, and, to 
that end, the review process had laid down an important road map to those goals. In 
cooperation with the international community and civil society, the Government of 
Luxembourg would tirelessly continue to ensure progress in a system that should always be 
ready to take on new challenges, and would continue to work towards improving human 
rights in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Barbados 
</b></p>
<p>355. The review of Barbados was held on 3 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Barbados in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BRB/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BRB/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BRB/3). 
</p><p>356. At the 28th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Barbados (see section C below). 
357. The outcome of the review on Barbados comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/73), the views of Barbados concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/73/Add.1). </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>143 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>358. The delegation of Barbados recognized the efforts of OHCHR in providing Member 
States, especially small delegations like itself, with information and guidance in preparing 
for the follow-up process to the universal periodic review. It acknowledged the work of the 
troika of Japan, the United Kingdom and South Africa, which had provided Barbados with 
a clear sense of the recommendations proposed by delegations. 
</p>
<p>359. The delegation stated the Government and people of Barbados had always been 
aware of the need to ensure a minimum basic level of human rights protection for all 
citizens of the world. The preparation of the report and the consideration of the 
recommendations for the present session reinforced this view and had been a valuable tool 
for Barbados to collectively examine its domestic system for the protection of human rights 
and its international obligations. This assessment exercise provided opportunities, where 
necessary and practicable, to enhance and improve certain areas of its human rights 
architecture. 
</p>
<p>360. It was clear that Barbados would require international financial support and 
technical assistance from OHCHR, other international institutions and the States Members 
of the United Nations to establish and maintain certain aspects listed in the 
recommendations. It called on the international community to support Barbados and other 
developing countries in this regard. 
</p>
<p>361. As a small-island developing country with all related economic, security and 
environmental vulnerabilities, Barbados must approach this process realistically and 
commit only to those actions that are within its ability to take and maintain. Consequently, 
the Government of Barbados could not commit, in the short term, to signing new treaties 
without undertaking a thorough assessment of the nature of the responsibilities involved. 
Barbados would, however, continue to give thoughtful consideration to signing and 
ratifying those treaties and optional protocols that were within the limits of its capability 
and where the reporting obligations were not excessively onerous. 
</p>
<p>362. The delegation gave its assurance that Barbados intended to improve on its human 
rights reporting record and accepted the recommendation to do so. It conceded, however, 
that human resources constraints remained the major impediment to timely reporting and 
said it would continue to support any capacity-building initiatives developed by OHCHR to 
assist developing countries in this regard. It added that Barbados was attempting to 
establish a human rights unit within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade and 
it looked to organizations and Member States with expertise in this area for guidance and 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>363. The Government had undertaken a thorough analysis of the recommendations 
emanating from the universal periodic review, and the Cabinet of Barbados had taken a 
number of important decisions relating to human rights. The Cabinet of Ministers had 
agreed to the abolition of the mandatory application of the death penalty and was in the 
process of amending the relevant laws to reflect this. The death penalty, however, remained 
a sentencing option. Barbados was unable to accept the recommendation of its total 
abolition at this time. It noted that opinion polls and surveys taken in the country showed 
that public sentiment strongly favoured the retention of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>364. As reflected in the formal responses to the review recommendations in the 
addendum to the Working Group report, Barbados was actively looking at revising its 
Constitution further and updating its legislation to conform to its treaty obligations. As this 
exercise unfolded, it would endeavour to keep the Council updated on progress and of any 
assistance required with regard to legislative drafting. </p>


<p><b>144</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>365. The Cabinet of Ministers had recently considered a number of proposals to enhance 
its human rights profile further. They included a proposal to evaluate for implementation 
the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Commission, especially in those areas 
that would enhance the country&#8217;s profile as a staunch defender of human rights. The 
Cabinet had also been asked to consider drafting legislation on discrimination and torture, 
and further legislation on sexual harassment in accordance with the treaty obligations of 
Barbados. In addition, the Cabinet had been requested to consider a method for the 
establishment of an independent national human rights commission and to consider 
providing the Bureau of Gender Affairs with an increased level of human and financial 
resources, within the Government&#8217;s limitations, to enable it to contribute efficiently to the 
promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights. The Cabinet had subsequently referred all of 
these matters for further consideration to the Governance Committee chaired by the 
Attorney General. 
</p>
<p>366. Further consideration would also be given to the topic of migration and movement 
of persons and the rights of such persons, since the Government had already established a 
cabinet subcommittee on immigration and hoped to have, in 2009, a fully revised and 
comprehensive migration policy. This would involve the drafting of relevant legislation and 
the ratification of appropriate treaties. 
</p>
<p>367. The delegation noted that Barbados had received a number of recommendations 
from Member States which they considered could enhance the domestic architecture of 
human rights protection. Given the impact of the global economic challenges on all 
economies, especially the smallest and most vulnerable, it asked that the Government&#8217;s 
efforts to adopt these recommendations be taken into account where possible. There were 
some recommendations that the Government of Barbados was not prepared to accept but of 
which it had taken serious note. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>368. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland said it was pleased to be 
on the troika during the review of Barbados, during which it had been able to observe 
closely the serious manner in which Barbados approached the review. It was impressed by 
the State&#8217;s conduct during the review and its high-level delegation. It thanked the State for 
the serious consideration given to all of the recommendations made, including those by the 
United Kingdom. It was pleased that Barbados had been able to accept a significant number 
of recommendations and looked forward to its ongoing engagement with the review process 
through their implementation. 
</p>
<p>369. The Bahamas commended Barbados for its commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights and for the progress made, particularly with respect to social and 
economic indicators. It congratulated Barbados for its constructive approach to the 
universal periodic review process and the work of the Council, as demonstrated by its full 
and frank participation in the Working Group session and the presentation of its response to 
the report thereof. As a fellow small-island developing State, the Bahamas understood well 
the constraints faced by Barbados in its continuing efforts to implement its obligations 
under international human rights instruments. The Bahamas encouraged the international 
community to heed the request of Barbados and provide the necessary support and 
assistance for enhancing national capacity and to assist Barbados in continuing to 
implement its human rights obligations and the recommendations emanating from the 
review process which it had committed to implement. 
</p>
<p>370. Mexico acknowledged the high level of acceptance by Barbados of the 
recommendations made in the Working Group. It highlighted the serious consideration 
given to those recommendations that it could not accept immediately and trusted that 
Barbados would progressively advance in their consideration and acceptance. It appreciated </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>145 
</b></p>
<p>the commitment demonstrated by Barbados to the universal periodic review and its 
objective evaluation and openness during the review process. It commended the State&#8217;s 
acknowledgment of the challenges and achievements in advancing human rights, and its 
commitment to confronting them. Mexico considered Barbados to be an outstanding 
example within the Caribbean region and appreciated its sharing of experience during 
various regional seminars. Mexico encouraged efforts made concerning the implementation 
of the recommendations, and hoped that Barbados would be supported by the international 
community in this regard. Mexico congratulated the Government for the steps that it had 
already taken in implementing these recommendations, including institutional and 
legislative measures. Lastly, Mexico recalled the importance of the role of the Council and 
the international community as a whole, in supporting the efforts being made by Barbados 
to improve the human rights situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>371. Cuba acknowledged the high level of acceptance by Barbados of the 
recommendations made in the framework of the review and its efforts to follow up on them. 
Cuba praised the efforts made by the Government of Barbados, notwithstanding the 
challenges it faced, as a developing country, owing to material and financial constraints. 
Despite these challenges, Barbados continued with its firm intention to cooperate with the 
human rights system of the United Nations and the universal periodic review in particular. 
Cuba called on the international community to consider positively the request made by 
Barbados for technical support. 
</p>
<p>372. Japan, as a member of the troika for Barbados, congratulated it on its 
constructiveness in preparing for and conducting the review. The Government of Barbados 
had shown its firm commitment to improving its human rights situation. It expected that the 
recommendations that enjoyed the support of the Government would be fully implemented, 
and it encouraged the Government to continue its maximum efforts to improve the human 
rights situation, taking into account the concerns of the international community. It 
expressed its belief that the serious stance of the Government would lead to concrete 
implementation of the recommendations and improve the country&#8217;s human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>373. Algeria reiterated its appreciation for the high quality of the Barbados national 
report on the human rights situation in the country. It was greatly encouraged by the efforts 
made to protect and promote human rights and good governance. It noted the challenges 
facing this small-island developing State and strongly supported the appeal by Barbados to 
the international community for technical and financial assistance to support its efforts to 
implement its human rights commitments.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>374. On behalf of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and the International Gay and 
Lesbian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network expressed 
appreciation for the constructive approach of the delegation and the consideration given to 
all recommendations. With reference to the recommendation on the decriminalization of 
consensual adult same-sex conduct, it noted the State&#8217;s comments in relation to social 
pressure against such decriminalization, but emphasized that human rights must never 
become a popularity contest, and indeed international guarantees of non-discrimination 
were designed precisely to protect the rights of unpopular minorities. Stating that the 
universal periodic review was based on relevant international legal standards, it noted that, 
in May 2007, the Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations, specifically 
stated that Barbados should decriminalize sexual acts between adults of the same sex and 
take all necessary actions to protect homosexuals from harassment, discrimination and 
violence. It urged the delegation to act upon the Committee&#8217;s recommendations as soon as 
possible, citing also comments by the High Commissioner in this regard. The Canadian 
HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed the State&#8217;s commitment in its response to protecting </p>


<p><b>146</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>all members of society from harassment, discrimination and violence regardless of sexual 
orientation, and indicated it would appreciate hearing from the delegation what measures it 
proposed to ensure such protection. It also welcomed the Government&#8217;s support for the 
historic resolution of the Organization of American States in 2008 on human rights, sexual 
orientation and gender identity, and hoped that this commitment would ensure a better 
future for the whole of the community in Barbados. 
</p>
<p>375. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine 
congratulated Barbados, a small-island developing State, on its achievements in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, which could stand as an example. It welcomed 
the initiatives to adopt new legislation on integrity, an initiative that should set an example 
for other nations; it wished Barbados success. It hoped Barbados would be at the forefront 
of States in favour of adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>376. In closing, Barbados thanked delegations and other stakeholders for their 
constructive comments and expressions of support, adding that it had taken careful note of 
all concerns and comments expressed. Barbados reiterated that it had approached the 
review and recommendations in a serious and realistic manner and considered that a 
number of short-term, medium-term and long-term objectives were to be undertaken. 
377. The delegation stated that Barbados was taking the necessary steps within available 
means towards fulfilling these commitments, which would further enhance and reinforce 
the promotion and protection of the human rights of its citizens. It reiterated the 
Government&#8217;s continued commitment to the review process and expressed confidence that, 
with the support and encouragement of the international community, Barbados would be 
able to further honour its international obligations and continue to contribute to the 
strengthening of the international human rights system. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Montenegro 
</b></p>
<p>378. The review of Montenegro was held on 3 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Montenegro in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/MNE/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/MNE/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/MNE/3). 
</p><p>379. At its 28th meeting, on 18 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Montenegro (see section C below). 
380. The outcome of the review on Montenegro comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/74), the views of Montenegro 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and its 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/10/74/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>381. The Minister for Justice of Montenegro, Miras Radovi&#269;, stated that it was a great 
honour to be again in the United Nations and to take part in the debate regarding the human 
rights situation in Montenegro within the universal periodic review.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>147 
</b></p>
<p>382. He recalled that Montenegro had achieved enormous progress in the field of human 
rights since its independence was restored on 21 May 2006, and that it had been pleased to 
receive the recommendations of the States at the Working Group involved in the review 
process. It had taken these recommendations as well meaning.  
</p>
<p>383. In compliance with the procedure, Montenegro responded to the recommendations 
from the draft report of the Working Group. Montenegro drew attention to the overview of 
the most important activities undertaken in the period since the presentation of the national 
report, which were in line with the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>384. The Parliament of Montenegro had ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and, in 
the required time framework, it would establish an effective national mechanism for the 
prevention of torture. The Government had adopted the proposal on the law on ratification 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>385. The Government had appointed an agent to represent Montenegro in the European 
Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and had thus fulfilled another important international 
obligation in the field of the protection of human rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>386. In the field of combating corruption, Montenegro had undertaken significant 
activities, including the passing of the new law on preventing conflict of interests. In 2008, 
judicial bodies had made obvious progress in solving corruption cases. The latest examples 
of cases processed involved persons of high official rank, some of them even holding 
offices in the judiciary, and the intensification of the courts&#8217; work in dealing with cases of 
corruption clearly reflected the intention of the judiciary to be a determining factor in 
fighting this damaging social phenomenon.   
</p>
<p>387. A law on the protection of personal data had been adopted and an independent 
supervisory body would be established with the task of controlling the implementation of 
that law.  
</p>
<p>388. The Parliament adopted a law on foreigners, thereby creating the preconditions for 
the establishment of an efficient system for visas and migration.  
</p>
<p>389. A working group for monitoring the implementation of the national strategy for 
fighting trafficking in human beings had adopted a plan of action for 2009. This strategic 
document incorporated the recommendations of all international organizations. The 
judiciary also attached significant importance to the criminal cases of trafficking in human 
beings and imposed punishments proportionate to their gravity. 
</p>
<p>390. The bureau for the care of refugees was preparing for the re-registration of internally 
displaced persons residing in Montenegro, to be conducted in the first half of 2009. Several 
municipalities would allocate land for the construction of housing units for displaced 
persons. The process of repatriation of 29 families displaced from Kosovo had started. 
Montenegro accepted the recommendation to invite the international community to provide 
technical assistance and financial support in the implementation of the strategy leading to a 
sustainable solution of the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons. This was 
confirmation that the international community had not forgotten that, in the 1990s, 
Montenegro had opened its doors to a large number of persons from war-stricken areas. 
</p>
<p>391. Montenegro was satisfied with the permanent progress in the implementation of the 
strategy for inclusion of Roma population in Montenegrin society. The building of 50 flats 
had already started in two municipalities. In one municipality, the housing issue of this 
population would be completely solved in this way. This was also the municipality in 
which all Roma children went to school. It was also satisfied with the preliminary results of 
the project for the education of the Roma, Ashkalia and Egyptian population, implemented 
with the Red Cross and UNHCR. </p>


<p><b>148</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>392. A draft law on the prohibition of discrimination had been prepared and would soon 
be submitted to the Government for adoption. Montenegro also referred to the conclusions 
of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination adopted on 16 February 
2009, in which it, inter alia, welcomed the fact that Montenegro had taken numerous 
legislative and administrative measures aimed at establishing a framework for the 
promotion and protection of human rights.   
</p>
<p>393. Montenegro provided information on the plan of action for achieving gender 
equality in the period 2008&#8211;2012, which envisaged preparation of a forum for dialogue 
with the civil sector, to be organized three times a year, with a view to establishing dialogue 
and the transfer and exchange of information and views between the Government and the 
non-governmental sector. In March 2009, one Montenegro private university would start 
enrolling the first generation of students in a &#8220;gender studies school&#8221;. The campaign 
entitled &#8220;16 days of activism against domestic violence&#8221; started in cooperation with 
international organizations in late November 2008 and continued in 2009. The drafting of 
the initial report on the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women, coordinated by the Ministry for the protection of human 
and minority rights, was in progress. 
</p>
<p>394. The conditions for exercising the freedom of the media and a good environment for 
freedom of expression had been created in Montenegro. The Parliament had adopted a new 
law on public broadcasting services after the implementation of the old law had shown that 
certain issues important for the work of public broadcasting services had not been regulated 
or regulated in an adequate manner.  
</p>
<p>395. Regarding the recommendation of several States that effective measures be taken to 
investigate attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, Montenegro stated that, in the 
case of the homicide of the director and editor-in-chief of the daily <i>Dan</i>, a trial was in 
progress and, in three cases of assaults on journalists, the criminal procedures had been 
completed. In two of the cases, there were final judgements and prison sentences imposed; 
in the third case, the trial had finished and a judgement would soon be announced.  
396. Judicial authorities were also conducting criminal procedures in four cases of war 
crimes. In three, indictments had been brought, while the fourth one was at the investigation 
stage, aimed at supplementing the request for conducting the investigation proposed by the 
competent State prosecutor. Work on these cases had intensified. In the first of the cases, 
the trial was in progress, in the second it was scheduled and would start in March 2009, 
while the third case was at the stage of deciding on the objections to the indictment. In all 
three cases, it was decided that the defendants would be held in detention.  
</p>
<p>397. Court proceedings for damages in 42 litigations initiated in relation to the 
&#8220;deportation of Muslims&#8221; of 1992 had been finalized through a settlement between the 
plaintiffs and the Government of Montenegro. The plaintiffs settled for an amount of 
&#8364;4,135,000. Montenegro stated that this case of treatment of victims of war events in the 
region could serve as an example for solving the open issues that burdened bilateral 
relations.  
</p>
<p>398. Montenegro fully accepted the recommendation to work more intensively on passing 
the law on protection against domestic violence and to establish close cooperation with 
non-governmental organizations in the procedure of passing this law. According to the 
Government&#8217;s agenda, the draft of the law would soon be issued for public consultation. 
Montenegro stressed that, in this field, judicial bodies had been committed to solving the 
cases involving the criminal offence of domestic violence. Courts had already decided on 
several hundreds of such cases. 
</p>
<p>399. Montenegro referred to the richness of activities in implementing the plan of action 
for the implementation of the strategy for the reform of the judiciary with the report on the </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>149 
</b></p>
<p>implementation of measures from the plan of action for the second half of 2008 currently 
under consideration and the large number of measures completed, particularly in the field 
of strengthening the independence and efficiency of the judiciary. Montenegro was working 
on improving the capacities of the judicial council, the body defined in the Constitution to 
ensure independence and autonomy of the judiciary. A similar situation existed with the 
Council of Prosecutors, the basic function of which was to guarantee independence of the 
organization of State prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>400. Montenegro attached the highest importance to the efficiency of judicial bodies. A 
proposal for the criminal procedural code had been adopted by the Government, creating 
preconditions for the efficient work of judicial bodies in the criminal procedure by 
transferring investigation from the courts to the prosecutors and introducing an alternative 
dispute resolution system. In 2008, the courts increased their efficiency in solving the issue 
of backlog of cases and the clear trend was to continue with such an approach.  
</p>
<p>401. The delegation regretted that time had not permitted an elaboration of a number of 
other activities undertaken in the field of the judiciary and reforms in other sectors.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>402. The United States of America welcomed Montenegro&#8217;s efforts to incorporate human 
rights into its Constitution and the recent creation of an ombudsman institution for the 
protection of human rights and a judicial council to strengthen judicial bodies and ensure 
their independence. It noted the concern documented in the Working Group report by a 
number of delegations about attacks and threats against journalists, and appreciated 
Montenegro&#8217;s expressed commitments to protect media freedoms and its continuing efforts 
to investigate these attacks and prosecute them. The delegation noted that trafficking in 
persons was a problem in Montenegro, and welcomed the plan of action for the fight 
against human trafficking adopted in December 2008 as a positive step to improve the 
protection of victims and the prosecution of perpetrators. It also appreciated Montenegro&#8217;s 
efforts to coordinate its anti-trafficking efforts with other countries in the region. It 
supported the recommendations in the Working Group report with respect to minorities, 
including the Roma, and the need for full protection of their rights under the law and in 
practice.  
</p>
<p>403. Albania emphasized that Montenegro was a functioning democracy, a factor in 
regional stability and a trustworthy partner. It noted that Montenegro&#8217;s report was 
testimony to its immense progress in the promotion and protection of human rights and the 
modernization of its society. It also noted Montenegro&#8217;s clear replies, its genuine 
commitment to bring the country into line with the recommendations made and, in 
particular, the clear objectives set for the future of the country. Albanian and Montenegrin 
police and justice institutions worked closely together, with the support of European 
colleagues, in combating trafficking and organized crime in both countries. It noted that the 
Albanian minority in Montenegro was a bridge of friendship between them and enjoyed all 
the freedoms of a democratic society. In the Balkans, an area which had often suffered 
ethnic problems, this fact represented a giant step towards peace and prosperity. Albania 
noted with satisfaction that Montenegro had provided guarantees for fundamental rights and 
freedoms and had embarked on the right path towards a brighter future for its citizens. 
</p>
<p>404. China appreciated Montenegro&#8217;s sincere and responsible attitude during the 
universal periodic review and thanked it for its cooperation throughout the whole process. 
China noted with appreciation that Montenegro had overcome all the difficulties that 
emerged during the initial stage of the establishment of the country and had made much 
progress in protecting and promoting human rights. Montenegro had a fairly complete 
constitutional and legal framework, had established a unit in charge of protecting minority 
rights and an ombudsman, and had implemented various national strategic plans on gender </p>


<p><b>150</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>equality, protection of persons with disabilities and of minorities. It noted that Montenegro 
had already launched new measures on the prohibition of torture, combating human 
trafficking, and protecting vulnerable minority rights. China believed that Montenegro 
would continue these efforts and continue to implement in all sincerity the feasible 
measures put forward by Member States during the review, and with the assistance and 
support of the international community, would achieve greater progress in the area of 
human rights.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>405. Amnesty International welcomed many of the recommendations, including calls for 
the protection of minorities. In referring to Montenegro&#8217;s obligations under the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, it urged the Government 
to prioritize fulfilment for all members of the Roma, Ashkalia and Egyptian communities, 
without discrimination, for the rights to free and compulsory primary education, access to 
employment and essential primary health care, and to basic shelter and housing. When 
allocating resources, it stated that the Government should prioritize the most vulnerable and 
should seek international cooperation and assistance where necessary to meet these basic 
obligations. It welcomed recommendations relating to the clarification of the legal status of 
refugees and internally displaced persons. It noted that persons originating from Kosovo 
continue to be defined as internally displaced persons rather than refugees, and that many of 
those who arrived after 2003 had not been granted access to a process whereby they may be 
registered as internally displaced persons. It noted that, as a result, they remained in danger 
of statelessness. Amnesty International noted that the authorities had been negotiating with 
the authorities of Kosovo for the return of Roma, Ashkalia and Egyptian persons to 
Kosovo. It urged the authorities to ensure that such individuals be allowed to challenge the 
decision to apply a cessation of protection in their case, and expressed the view that they 
should also be allowed access to a process to assess their continued protection needs in 
order for non-refoulement obligations to be met. While welcoming the addendum to the 
report of the Working Group, in which Montenegro provided further information on the 20 
recommendations made by States, Amnesty International encouraged Montenegro to 
indicate clearly which of these recommendations it supported, as required by paragraph 32 
of the annex to Council resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>406. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine appreciated 
Montenegro&#8217;s replies to the recommendations made within the framework of the Working 
Group. It noted with great interest the replies to recommendation 6, including the initiative 
taken by the Government to approve draft legislation prohibiting discrimination in the first 
quarter of 2009. It drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the fact that the draft law addressed 
12 precise grounds for discrimination, but did not include the case of discrimination linked 
to political choices and associations of the individual. It also pointed out that some human 
rights violations were committed against members of political parties or the opposition and 
unions. It recommended that Montenegro include these forms of discrimination in the draft 
law and ensure that these rights are properly promoted. It also encouraged Montenegro to 
take part in the promulgation of a universal declaration of duties of the individual.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>407. Montenegro thanked delegations and expressed the significance of the universal 
periodic review process for Montenegro. Responding to some of the recommendations 
made, it referred also to responses previously provided.  
</p>
<p>408. Montenegro referred to activities undertaken with regard to the protection of Roma 
populations and emphasized the strategy for social inclusion of Roma, and expressed its 
readiness to ensure all the rights of the Roma. Montenegro noted progress, especially in </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>151 
</b></p>
<p>terms of education, because a significantly larger number of children attended school than 
five years ago. Montenegro stated that all possible activities had to be conducted to 
eliminate barriers and to allow, inter alia, the social inclusion of the Roma population.  
</p>
<p>409. With regard to refugees, Montenegro indicated that, inter alia, it did not consider 
that it would reach a situation of having stateless persons in the country. 
</p>
<p>410. Montenegro stressed that several institutions had had an opportunity to conclude that 
trafficking in persons was not a problem at the present time and that the judicial bodies of 
Montenegro had dealt with cases of trafficking of persons appropriately and pronounced 
sentences that were adequate to the severity of the committed offences. 
</p>
<p>411. In response to a statement by Amnesty International asking which recommendations 
Montenegro accepted and which it did not, Montenegro noted that it did not reject any of 
the recommendations. Montenegro had given its responses and noted the goal of developing 
and strengthening human rights in the country. It considered the recommendations well 
intended and would be of decisive significance for the development of the legal system. It 
believed that, in four years&#8217; time, it would be very satisfied with the situation of human 
rights in the country and in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p>412. The review of the United Arab Emirates was held on 4 December 2008 in 
conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the national report submitted by the United Arab Emirates in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ARE/1); the 
compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/3/ARE/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ARE/3). 
</p><p>413. At the 29th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the United Arab Emirates (see section C below). 
414. The outcome of the review on the United Arab Emirates comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/75), the views of the United 
Arab Emirates concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>415. The head of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates and Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs, Dr. Anwar Mohammad Gargash, reiterated the belief of the United Arab 
Emirates in the universal periodic review process and its determination to improve its own 
human rights record and to contribute effectively at the global level. This aspiration 
stemmed from its cultural heritage and religious values, which enshrined justice, equality 
and tolerance.  
</p>
<p>416. He presented his State&#8217;s plan of action to implement voluntary commitments and 
accepted recommendations on human rights issues, which was designed, through a dialogue 
involving federal and local governments and civil society organizations, to determine the 
scope of work, take follow-up action on the implementation process and submit periodic 
status reports.  
</p>
<p>417. In addition to nine voluntary commitments made by the United Arab Emirates, the 
Working Group, in its report, had made 74 recommendations, at its third session in </p>


<p><b>152</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>December 2008. While 36 had been accepted and 17 were being considered for detailed 
study, the rest did not enjoy the country&#8217;s support because of several social, cultural and 
legal factors. 
</p>
<p>418. The steps taken since December 2008 to realize voluntary commitments and 
recommendations included: (a) ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, in February 2009; (b) preparation of a 
study by a Government committee, presented to the Cabinet, for consideration of acceding 
to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, as well as the protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; (c) the 
signing of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the additional 
protocol thereto, which are in the process of being ratified; (d) opening of a series of human 
rights-related workshops to benefit from international best practices (one such workshop 
had been held in February 2009, in cooperation with the International Organization for 
Migration, to improve the knowledge of human trafficking by law enforcement officials). 
The United Arab Emirates tackled concerns related to temporary contractual workers with 
the International Labour Organization (ILO) through, inter alia, the Decent Work Country 
Programme; (e) the Government had initiated a study of human rights commissions in 
various countries to help formulate its own national institution, in line with the Paris 
Principles; (f) a national media campaign to enhance public awareness of human trafficking 
was being worked out; and (g) two new related institutions had recently been set up: the 
Human Rights Department under the Ministry of the Interior, and the Dubai Community 
Development Authority. 
</p>
<p>419. In relation to recommendations 2, 3, 6, 25, 32 and 36 (A/HRC/10/75, para. 91) 
dealing with strengthening human rights mechanisms, the Universal Periodic Review 
Committee, a multidisciplinary body chaired by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, 
was studying various measures in line with national beliefs and traditions, particularly 
Islamic sharia, and in coordination with relevant authorities. The Federal National Council 
would review these measures. For instance, workshops and training sessions would be 
conducted to draw up a national strategy to spread a human rights culture. A plan of action 
to raise awareness on human rights-related labour issues was outlined by the Ministry of 
Labour in January 2009, in coordination with 17 Government departments and the private 
sector. Furthermore, official invitations had been sent to the Special Rapporteurs on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography and on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The visits are expected to take 
place in 2009. 
</p>
<p>420. With regard to recommendations 4, 8, 19 and 34, the United Arab Emirates was 
actively considering introducing human rights education for students in grades 1 to 12. 
Furthermore, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the higher college of technology was organizing a series of lectures. 
</p>
<p>421. With regard to recommendations 10 and 31, the Universal Periodic Review 
Committee had encouraged civil society organizations to participate in both the build-up 
and compilation of the national report, as well as the plan of action. The Ministry of Social 
Affairs would establish a standing forum with civil society organizations to facilitate 
dialogue and understanding. In February 2009, Du, the country&#8217;s integrated telecom 
operator, and the Ministry of Social Affairs jointly launched Musahama, a comprehensive 
web portal for civil society organizations in the country. 
</p>
<p>422. Regarding the rights of temporary contractual workers mentioned in 
recommendations 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 22, 27, 28 and 35, the Ministries of Labour and the 
Interior continued to strengthen laws on the working and living conditions of expatriate 
workers. A domestic workers&#8217; law, which would have a positive impact on women, was in </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>153 
</b></p>
<p>a very advanced stage. Other measures would include the signing of memoranda of 
understanding and the reinforcement of cooperation with labour-exporting countries, and a 
pilot project focusing on the difficulties faced by expatriate workers. The Government had 
also created an agency to monitor complaints about unpaid wages and to settle wage-related 
conflicts involving expatriate workers.  
</p>
<p>423. On recommendations 16 and 23, the Universal Periodic Review Committee, in 
coordination with the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking, would strengthen 
Federal Law 51 and be part of bilateral and international efforts to combat this crime. Other 
steps included: 
</p>
<p> (a) In January 2009, the Cabinet issued orders to increase the number of 
prosecutors to the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking;  
</p>
<p> (b) In January 2009, 80 police and judicial officials held a brainstorming session 
to discuss the national strategy on human trafficking;  
</p>
<p> (c) 15 law enforcement officials were trained abroad. These efforts are making a 
difference: at least 15 cases, with a minimum of 6 convictions, were registered in 2008 as 
opposed to 10 cases in 2007;  
</p>
<p> (d) The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, released in February 2009 by 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, was funded through a donation from Sheikh 
Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi;  
</p>
<p> (e) On child camel jockeys, a matter that the United Arab Emirates considers 
closed, the Ministries of Social Affairs and the Interior, in coordination with the Special 
Committee for the Rehabilitation of Camel Jockeys and UNICEF, continued the follow-up 
with concerned countries;  
</p>
<p> (f) The United Arab Emirates had decided to invite the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>424. On recommendations 13 and 30, the United Arab Emirates would study ways of 
further protecting women&#8217;s rights, in coordination with relevant authorities, especially the 
General Women&#8217;s Union. The Ministry of Social Affairs was also taking steps to ensure 
that women-related human rights issues were respected, particularly by launching 
awareness-raising programmes. Furthermore, resources for the Dubai Foundation for 
Women and Children and the Abu Dhabi Shelter, established in 2007 and 2008 
respectively, had increasingly been made available and utilized as well.  
</p>
<p>425. With regard to recommendations 11 and 12 pertaining to children&#8217;s rights, the 
Ministry of Social Affairs, in consultation with the concerned departments and civil society 
organizations, was studying a draft law to guarantee better protection for children, 
including through the creation of juvenile justice courts. In addition, an initiative to create 
the first local civil society organization to protect children&#8217;s rights had recently been 
announced, and a department for the welfare of orphans had already been set up.  
</p>
<p>426. With regard to recommendations 1, 17 and 20, a new draft law on media freedom, 
approved in February 2009 by the Federal National Council, protected journalists from 
being imprisoned. The 45-article draft law, which was awaiting constitutional clearance, 
replaced the 1980 law and specifically referred in article 2 to the freedom of expression and 
opinion, whether written, verbal or by other means; and, in article 3, to the fact that there 
was no prior censorship of licensed media. The law did not make it mandatory for 
journalists to reveal their sources, and media offences would be dealt with as civil cases, 
not criminal.  
</p>
<p>427. On the development of remote regions mentioned in recommendations 15, 26 and 
33, the Government had implemented a number of vital projects. A committee, set up in </p>


<p><b>154</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>2005, continued to study infrastructure needs for remote areas, including projects relating to 
construction of houses, roads, health centres and schools.  
</p>
<p>428. On recommendation 24 relating to knowledge exchange, the Universal Periodic 
Review Committee was working on the modalities of organizing workshops and seminars 
with interested countries.  
</p>
<p>429. Of the 17 recommendations under consideration, the United Arab Emirates 
identified recommendations 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 17 mentioned in paragraph 92 of the 
Working Group report as being in direct contradiction with the Constitution, religious code, 
traditional values and national interest, and hence did not enjoy the country&#8217;s support. The 
remaining eight recommendations &#8212; 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 &#8212; continued to be under 
consideration.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>430. Algeria expressed appreciation regarding the positive response by the United Arab 
Emirates to its recommendation on the organization of training sessions and seminars on 
human rights for law enforcement authorities in charge of combating terrorism. The United 
Arab Emirates had accepted recommendations made during the review, which was proof of 
its commitment to ensure equality and social justice for all, spread a culture of human 
rights, improve the situation of women and migrant workers and combat human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>431. Bahrain commended the positive steps taken by the United Arab Emirates to 
implement a number of recommendations and welcomed its accession to the Palermo 
Protocol. Bahrain praised the efforts made to combat human trafficking and the country&#8217;s 
contribution to the publication, by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2009, 
of the world report on trafficking in persons. Bahrain expressed appreciation for the 
invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children to visit the country in 2009. 
</p>
<p>432. Cuba congratulated the United Arab Emirates on its commitment to the universal 
periodic review. A country of peace and solidarity and a member of the Non-Aligned 
Movement, the United Arab Emirates had demonstrated its commitment to the 
implementation of economic and social rights. At the session of the Working Group in 
December 2008, the United Arab Emirates had provided detailed information and 
exchanged opinions with all countries. Cuba emphasized the improvement of the living 
conditions of migrant workers, especially with regard to health, housing rights and dispute 
settlement. Finally, Cuba welcomed the decision of the United Arab Emirates to accept its 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>433. Pakistan thanked the delegation for presenting a comprehensive national plan of 
action, which sought to implement the State&#8217;s voluntary commitments and accepted 
recommendations. Specific steps had been taken, such as the ratification of the Palermo 
Protocol, the commitment to sign the Convention against Torture and the protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and early ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Regarding expatriate workers, Pakistan was encouraged 
to see appropriate responses that sought to ensure improvement of working hours and 
accommodation facilities, new procedures of labour disputes, as well as the introduction of 
a comprehensive compulsory insurance policy. 
</p>
<p>434. The Syrian Arab Republic appreciated the cooperation that the United Arab 
Emirates had extended to the review mechanism and to all other United Nations human 
rights mechanisms. It had presented a comprehensive national report and participated 
professionally in the review. The United Arab Emirates had made great efforts to comply 
with the recommendations, in particular by extending an invitation to the Special 
Rapporteurs on contemporary forms of racism and on the sale of children, and by acceding 
to the Palermo Protocol.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>155 
</b></p>
<p>435. Egypt stated that the accepted recommendations demonstrated the efforts made in 
the promotion of human rights. Egypt emphasized the climate of religious tolerance, where 
all religious and cultural particularities are respected. The United Arab Emirates had 
ensured a climate of freedom for all religions, allowing the communities to practise their 
faiths and traditions and to follow their own education systems. The Government had 
offered free land for schools and cemeteries for other religions.  
</p>
<p>436. Saudi Arabia indicated that the United Arab Emirates had accepted the majority of 
recommendations, demonstrating its commitment to human rights, especially women&#8217;s 
rights. The United Arab Emirates had ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and developed the legal basis to eradicate the 
problem of violence against women. It had also taken a number of steps to ensure social 
services, including education and health, and it praised its efforts to protect those rights. 
</p>
<p>437. Morocco praised the national plan of action of the United Arab Emirates for the 
implementation of review recommendations. The State had accepted most 
recommendations, including the one made by Morocco that it put in place a national 
strategy to disseminate a culture of human rights and to ensure the long-term protection of 
rights. Women&#8217;s issues played a central role in development strategies and the General 
Women&#8217;s Union played an active role in promoting the rights of women. The United Arab 
Emirates had conducted initiatives to harmonize national laws with international 
commitments, and had acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Palermo Protocol. 
</p>
<p>438. Oman thanked the United Arab Emirates for its constructive cooperation with the 
universal periodic review and its positive engagement with the recommendations. It paid 
tribute to the country for the positive measures taken, including its voluntary commitments 
and the national plan of action. 
</p>
<p>439. Kuwait noted the constructive approach for the implementation of review 
recommendations, which proved that the United Arab Emirates was interested in 
cooperating with international mechanisms, in particular the Council. The State had largely 
accepted the recommendations, notably with regard to religious freedoms, education and 
health systems, strategies to promote sustainable development and comprehensive reforms 
aiming at the improvement of labour conditions and the promotion of workers&#8217; rights. 
Kuwait praised the national plan of action, which aimed at implementing the commitments 
and recommendations made during the review with the participation of civil society. 
</p>
<p>440. Yemen thanked the United Arab Emirates for accepting its recommendation on the 
enactment of a national law for the protection of children, and commended it for the 
ratification of the Palermo Protocol. Yemen also commended it for having established a 
national committee to implement the review recommendations, and for inviting the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>441. Qatar welcomed the action taken by the United Arab Emirates to tackle the vast 
majority of recommendations, in particular regarding the improvement of working and 
living conditions of contractual workers, the spreading of a culture of human rights and the 
inclusion of the perspective of equality between men and women. Qatar appreciated the fact 
that, regarding the recommendation it made on the reform of the 1980 Law on Publications 
and all other related laws to take into account the evolution of freedom of expression, a 
press and information law had been adopted and was soon to be promulgated by the head of 
State. Qatar invited all relevant human rights mechanisms to provide the United Arab 
Emirates with the necessary assistance. </p>


<p><b>156</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>442. The Geneva Infant Feeding Association stated that the United Arab Emirates had not 
yet adopted a national law on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes. Adopting a strong 
national law was necessary, as the State was a lucrative market for the baby food industry. 
It acknowledged improvements in maternity protection at work, but paid leave was only for 
eight weeks; the United Arab Emirates should ensure foreign workers were granted the 
same length, also harmonizing legislation throughout the Emirates. The Association 
recommended that all maternity hospitals, public and private, be certified baby-friendly as a 
condition for being allowed to function. It reminded the State that its report to the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child had been due since 2004, and that it had not yet 
ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>443. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion des Grands 
Lacs noted the positive response to numerous recommendations made, and welcomed the 
country&#8217;s efforts in trafficking and related crimes. Significant progress had been made by 
the United Arab Emirates in combating violence against women, the protection of workers&#8217; 
rights and freedom of religion. Its determination to promote the full enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights was demonstrated by the civil society and Emirati 
associations, such as the Emirati Red Crescent and the Muhammad bin Rashed Al-
Maktoum Foundation, particularly in the area of education and health for children in 
several African countries. It invited the international community to support the State in 
ratifying the Palermo Protocol.  
</p>
<p>444. The World Federation of Trade Unions thanked the Government for the efforts made 
to improve the rights of workers, as well as the measures taken to protect migrant and 
domestic workers. It welcomed the fact that, among the many recommendations adopted by 
the Government, there was a commitment to continue strengthening its labour law, improve 
the working conditions and the lives of workers, and in particular migrant and domestic 
workers, including a mechanism to deal with reports and complaints on discriminatory 
treatment. It requested that the Government examine the recommendations made to ratify 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and to reconsider its decision not to accept the 
recommendations regarding the unionizing of workers, collective bargaining and the right 
to strike, as well as to consider ratifying ILO Conventions 87 and 98. 
</p>
<p>445. The Arab Commission for Human Rights welcomed the fact that the United Arab 
Emirates was looking into setting up an independent human rights commission pursuant to 
the Paris Principles, but asked for more information with regard to the time frame 
envisaged, as well as the level of participation of civil society in that process. It also 
welcomed the cancellation of jail sentences on press crimes, and recommended that this be 
extended to electronic media. Regarding political participation, it recommended the 
adoption of recommendation 78 of the report. It recommended the reform of the justice 
system to ensure its independence and welcomed the adoption of a mechanism to follow up 
on review recommendations. It also recommended that the United Arab Emirates support 
OHCHR financially. 
</p>
<p>446. The Hawa Society for Women said it had been involved in all preparations of the 
review process, having submitted remarks and comments. It noted the question of the 
establishment of refuge centres to victims of trafficking, protection of women&#8217;s rights, the 
promulgation of a national law to protect children and the creation of the institutional 
mechanism to provide attention to domestic workers victims of violence. It suggested using 
all available resources to develop a culture of respect, including the Internet, and to set up a 
user-friendly reliable database. </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>157 
</b></p>
<p>447. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies endorsed the pledges to reform the 
1980 Law on Publications and all other related laws in the country, calling upon the United 
Arab Emirates to lift the governmental control over press freedoms and to limit legal 
restrictions on the right to freedom of expression, including the right to political dissent and 
the right to receive information. It invited the State to ratify, in a timely manner, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to ensure the enjoyment of citizens to all 
civil and political rights, and to guarantee their active participation in public affairs. The 
State should ensure the creation of independent trade unions and political parties; that the 
restrictions on the establishment and work of all associations, including human rights non-
governmental organizations, should be lifted; and that the rights of Internet bloggers, 
journalists and human rights defenders to express freely their views on public affairs should 
be ensured. The Institute was concerned about discrimination against women, the right of 
children to a nationality without discrimination based on the parent&#8217;s gender, and invited 
the State to amend its laws in this regard. 
</p>
<p>448. Interfaith International said the large influx of foreign workers and the achievement 
of certain goals related to economic rights favoured a degree of tolerance among the 
population, the opening of temples, churches and other places of religious veneration. The 
United Arab Emirates was one of the rare countries in the region that authorized the 
construction of cemeteries for Christians and crematoria for Sikh and Hindu minorities. It 
congratulated the State on the establishment of a standing forum and website for civil 
society, encouraged it to continue elaborating a programme of compensation, rehabilitation 
and professional insertion of victims of trafficking, and to create a national strategy 
promoting a proper economic citizenship for migrant workers and members of their 
families.  
</p>
<p>449. Comit&#233; international pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte africaine des droits 
de l&#8217;homme et des peuples said it had been involved in the preparation of the national 
report of the United Arab Emirates, and provided remarks that had been included. It also 
provided comments on the recommendations made, and expressed its intention to cooperate 
in implementing the recommendations accepted by the State, in particular those relating to 
ensuring good conditions for workers. It would participate in the dialogue on the follow-up 
to recommendations, especially on foreign workers, victims of trafficking and persons 
released from prisons.  
</p>
<p>450. The Indian Council of South America commended the United Arab Emirates for 
enacting Federal Law 51 in 2006, and for the establishment of a national committee to 
combat human trafficking. The State&#8217;s contribution of $15 million to the United Nations 
Global Initiative to Fight Trafficking and its sponsoring of trafficking conferences in 
Vienna and New York were commendable. It called on the State to continue efforts to 
advance women at all levels of Government, continue to protect foreign workers and 
provide human rights training in combating terrorism. It considered the State&#8217;s commitment 
to accede to the Convention against Torture and to establishing a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles positive steps forward, and urged it to 
ratify other instruments and to continue to include civil society, journalists, and other 
sectors in the follow-up to the review process. 
</p>
<p>451. The African-American Society for Humanitarian Aid and Development emphasized 
the positive role played at the regional and international levels by the State, which had 
made constant progress in the achievement of rights, including women&#8217;s rights. It noted that 
the State was at the top of the list of countries providing aid to others in cases of 
humanitarian disasters, and it paid tribute to the Red Crescent Society and all other 
associations for the tireless efforts made in this connection. </p>


<p><b>158</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>452. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine noted the 
State&#8217;s rapid modernization, and welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to improving 
the human rights situation by sharing its experiences and seeking to draw on the best 
practices of the international community. It supported the recommendation made by 
Canada to uphold the freedom of expression of non-governmental organizations by 
amending the laws limiting it and repealing punitive sanctions.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>453. The delegation of the United Arab Emirates thanked the members of the Council for 
their appreciation as well as their criticism. All comments would help the State to improve 
further its human rights record, which had been commended by many speakers. Through 
the review, the State had gained more awareness about the importance of capacity-building 
and the involvement of civil society. With regard to the review mechanism, the United 
Arab Emirates noted that it was essential to build a credible and constructive process 
without merging human rights with pure political matters.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Israel 
</b></p>
<p>454. The review of Israel was held on 4 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Israel in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ISR/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ISR/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/ISR/3). 
</p><p>455. At the 29th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Council considered the outcome of the 
review on Israel (see section C below). 
456. The outcome of the review on Israel comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/76), the views of Israel concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>457. The Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations at Geneva indicated 
that Israel took its participation in the universal periodic review very seriously, as an 
opportunity for genuine introspection and frank discussions within the Israeli system, 
despite their reservations about some aspects of the Council&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>458. Israel thanked all delegations that had engaged in the dialogue in good faith and had 
shared constructive comments, providing concrete suggestions and ideas. Israel had also 
appreciated the positive and supportive response received from numerous States throughout 
the process. 
</p>
<p>459. Israel had given careful consideration to the recommendations. Certain 
recommendations reflected the challenges that Israel had already identified and was in the 
process of addressing, while others highlighted aspects that would require more detailed 
consideration.  
</p>
<p>460. Israel agreed to adopt recommendation 14, regarding the investigation of allegations 
of violence and killings allegedly committed by the police. Israel also agreed to adopt 
recommendation 18 regarding the law on polygamy, and had recently reinstructed the 
Qaddi&#8217;s of the sharia courts to refer every suspected case of polygamy to the police. It had </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>159 
</b></p>
<p>also decided to adopt recommendation 28, ensuring full protection of the rights of 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>461. Israel had also taken upon itself to promote the following items from the Council's 
recommendations:  
</p>
<p> (a) The ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; 
 (b) Ensuring best protection of human rights and follow-up to the 
implementation of international instruments;  
</p>
<p> (c) Considering strengthening dialogue with the Council and its special 
procedures, and cooperation with all relevant United Nations special procedures and 
mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> (d) Redoubling efforts to increase women&#8217;s representation in society;  
 (e) Continuing and strengthening its efforts to achieve gender equality in 
Government and public services at all levels; to this end, the newly elected Parliament, the 
Knesset, had 21 women, among the largest number of women members in the history of 
Israel, and 3 more than in the previous Knesset;  
</p>
<p> (f) Ensuring prompt and impartial investigations of allegations of ill-treatment, 
in accordance with its obligations under the Convention against Torture;  
</p>
<p> (g) Ensuring all cases are reviewed by a court in accordance with fair 
procedures; 
</p>
<p> (h) Granting the right to those who object to serve in the army on conscientious 
grounds to serve instead with a civilian body independent of the military, such as in the 
form of the newly established and strengthened Public Commission for National Civil 
Service; 
</p>
<p> (i) Further addressing the remaining gaps between the various populations in 
Israeli society;  
</p>
<p> (j) Regarding minorities, Israel intended to strengthen efforts to ensure equality 
in the application of the law, to counter discrimination against persons belonging to all 
minorities, to promote their active participation in public life, such as through additional 
Government resolutions to raise the percentage of the Arab minority in the civil service;  
</p>
<p> (k) Following the universal periodic review process, several measures were 
currently being taken towards further promoting children&#8217;s rights through several 
preliminary means. A draft bill on the establishment of a new youth court had been 
prepared and was currently under review, and additional issues, such as necessary 
adaptations to probation officers&#8217; reports, were being evaluated.  
</p>
<p>462. While Israel also appreciated the spirit of the recommendation to protect the children 
and families of migrants, it did not consider that accession to the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was 
required to achieve that goal, as under Israeli legislation, the rights of children and family 
members of migrants were already protected. 
</p>
<p>463. With respect to the recommendation calling for the acceleration of the process of 
bringing national legislation into compliance with the provisions of the main international 
instruments to which it was a party, Israel noted that, while international treaties were not 
directly incorporated into Israeli legislation, given its dualistic system of law, it remained 
committed to ensuring that domestic legislation, policies and practice complied with its 
international commitments. Therefore, since treaties were not self-executing and required 
legislative implementation, Israel carefully considered whether, and to what extent, the </p>


<p><b>160</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>relevant international obligations were already met by existing legislation and case law, and 
whether passing implementing legislation was needed prior to becoming a party to an 
international treaty. This process involved extensive and meticulous governmental work to 
assess the compatibility of new treaties with domestic law, and where necessary, to 
introduce relevant amendments to the law. Furthermore, Israeli courts recognized and 
applied a presumption of compatibility as an interpretive tool, assuming that the Knesset, 
when enacting new legislation, had no intention of derogating or deviating from 
international obligations; therefore, Israeli legislation should be interpreted in conformity 
with international law, unless an explicit intention to the opposite existed. In addition, 
certain laws integrated some of the human rights treaties into Israeli legislation. It also 
noted that customary law, in contrast to treaty law, was considered part of domestic law; it 
was binding without the need of transformation by a statute, unless it explicitly conflicted 
with an existing statute. 
</p>
<p>464. With regard to the recommendation to evaluate the possibility of ratifying the 
second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the 
abolition of the death penalty, Israel reiterated what was indicated in its national report, that 
while it is not in a position to ratify the Protocol, Israel had applied a de facto moratorium 
on executions, and the only exception that had ever been implemented since the 
establishment of Israel was in the case of the Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann in 1962, 
who was convicted by the Supreme Court of committing genocide under the 1950 
punishment of Nazi and Nazi Collaborators Law. The death penalty had not been applied 
since. This policy complies with the State&#8217;s obligations as a State party under United 
Nations human rights treaties and its sponsorship of United Nations resolutions in support 
of a moratorium on the imposition of the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>465. Israel also took note of the recommendation to intensify its efforts to ensure that 
human rights were respected in the fight against terrorism. This remained an ongoing 
challenge for Israel as it continued to confront the threat of terrorism. Israel was keenly 
aware of the need to find a balance between competing rights and other considerations in 
this regard, and remained ready and willing to share its experience and challenges with 
other countries. 
</p>
<p>466. Israel indicated it would make a concerted effort to incorporate civil society groups 
when considering how to implement further the recommendations received, and would 
continue to explore ways to engage with the members of civil society in the protection of 
human rights in Israel. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>467. Palestine noted that none of the 12 recommendations that it had made on the basis of 
the principles of international humanitarian law and international human rights law had 
been taken into account by Israel. Palestine reminded that Israel was the occupying Power 
of Palestinian and other Arab territories and had recently unleashed a savage attack against 
the Gaza Strip, leading to thousands of deaths, the destruction of homes, places of worship, 
hospitals and even United Nations buildings. Israel had imposed a blockade on Gaza for 
two years, and had already started to demolish 80 other houses and displace more than 
1,500 Palestinians living in East Jerusalem. Due consideration should be given to the 
numerous appeals by the Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, by special rapporteurs, particularly the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, and the presidents of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and of the Federation of the Red Cross and Red 
Crescent, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees 
in the Near East, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, the Organization 
of the Islamic Conference, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Arab League and international </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>161 
</b></p>
<p>and Israeli organizations condemning practices of the occupying Power and its violations of 
human rights. It highlighted calls for inquiry into war crimes committed by Israel against 
the Palestinian people and stated that Israel must comply with its international humanitarian 
and human rights commitments, which are applicable to the Palestinian territories, 
including East Jerusalem. It added that the international community must uphold its moral 
and legal obligations and seek cessation of this occupation.  
</p>
<p>468. Cuba indicated that, during the review of Israel, almost all delegations raised 
concerns about the situation of the Palestinian and Syrian Golan occupied territories, in 
particular regarding the human rights and humanitarian situation. Many recommendations 
had been made, including by Cuba, in a spirit of cooperation. Cuba stated that Israel must 
recognize that the concept of democracy was not compatible with the situation of being an 
occupying Power and negating the human rights of Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories, and that the review must include the human rights situation in the territories. It 
noted that a few days after the review, Israel had unleashed military action against the Gaza 
Strip. Cuba re-emphasized its recommendations and expressed hope that the requests of the 
international community would be met with a view to achieving fair and lasting peace that 
would allow to build a better future for the people in the Middle East, guaranteeing the 
rights of the Palestinian people to live in a free, independent and sovereign State fully 
exercising their human rights.  
</p>
<p>469. The Syrian Arab Republic stated that Israel continued to pursue its violations of the 
most fundamental principles of humanitarian law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
the occupied Syrian Golan. It highlighted that, while it was presenting its national report to 
the Working Group, Israel was preparing its attacks on the Gaza Strip, which took place a 
few days after the review. It said the campaign of disinformation continued at the present 
session. It noted that Israel claimed not to have executed individuals, but said it had been 
responsible for the deaths on a daily basis of thousands of men, women and children. Israel 
had broken the record when it came to violations of international resolutions, especially 
Council resolutions. 
</p>
<p>470. Egypt indicated that the review of Israel showed that it chose to ignore its 
commitments under international human rights and humanitarian law. Its national report 
ignored that it remains the occupying Power of lands of three Arab countries, that since 
1967 more than 20 per cent of the Palestinian population had been detained by Israel and 
that it was currently engaged in building a wall of racial separation on Palestinian 
territories. Regarding the Syrian Golan, Egypt stated that Israel continued the confiscation 
of lands and to impose its citizenship on Syrian people. Egypt repeated some of the 
obligations that Israel was trying to avoid, in particular that it should end its occupation of 
all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem and the Syrian 
Golan; respect the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and to the establishment of 
an independent State, with Jerusalem as its capital; respect the right of Palestinian refugees 
to return to their homelands and to be compensated for losses and damage incurred and to 
retrieve their properties; annul its illegitimate decision to annex the occupied Syrian Golan; 
and end all settlement activities in the occupied Arab territories, in particular and around 
occupied Jerusalem and in the Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>471. The Islamic Republic of Iran stated the universal periodic review could not 
appropriately address this specific situation, and the gross and systematic human rights 
violations over 60 years required the particular attention of the international community. It 
cited human rights and humanitarian violations, such as racist laws and practices, 
extrajudicial killings, the demolition of houses, the imprisonment of innocent people, racist 
and discriminatory policies and practices, torture, the expansion of settlements, increasing 
checkpoints, the closure of crossings and military incursions, the illegal construction of a 
racist apartheid wall, targeted killings, the use of Palestinians as human shields and heinous </p>


<p><b>162</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>aggressions against the Gaza Strip, in flagrant breach of international laws, especially those 
constituting genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It urged the international 
community to take measures to end all forms and manifestations of occupation, aggression, 
racism and human rights violations perpetrated by the occupying Power. 
</p>
<p>472. Yemen recalled the recent Israeli attack against the Gaza Strip and indicated that 
Israel had ignored recommendations since 1948, so it was not surprising that it would 
ignore most review recommendations, especially those related to putting an end to the 
occupation in all occupied Palestinian and Arab territories and to recognizing the right of 
the Palestinian people to self-determination, to an independent sovereign State with 
Jerusalem as its capital, and to the right of return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland 
and their right to compensation and restitution of their properties. Yemen also noted the 
recommendation that Israel implement fully its obligations under international humanitarian 
law, and all Council decisions relating to human rights in the occupied Palestinian and Arab 
territories.  
</p>
<p>473. Malaysia appreciated the opportunity of the universal periodic review for 
delegations to engage in peaceful, constructive and non-confrontational dialogue to better 
understand, assess and ultimately effect tangible improvements to the human rights 
situation on the ground. It regretted that the presentation by Israel had not addressed most 
of the pertinent issues and recommendations raised by the Working Group. Noting that 
Israel had accepted only a small number of recommendations, it stated that the human 
rights of the Palestinian people remained unfulfilled and the humanitarian situation on the 
ground in the Occupied Palestinian Territory remained dire. Malaysia remained convinced 
that the occupation of the Palestinian territories was the root cause of human rights 
violations and called for the immediate end to all forms of occupation and aggression 
against Palestinians. Malaysia emphasized the importance of distinguishing between 
terrorists and legitimate resistance against occupation. The only means of achieving lasting 
peace, security and stability between Palestine and Israel is through peaceful non-
discriminatory and transparent negotiations and dialogue. It reaffirmed its support for the 
constructive role of the Council in monitoring and deliberating the human rights and 
humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p>474. The United States of America noted the energetic civil society in Israel and its 
independent media, and urged Israel to continue to conduct consultations in the follow-up 
to the review outcome. The United States noted the visits by special rapporteurs hosted by 
Israel, which demonstrated its commitment to United Nations human rights mechanisms. It 
commended the State&#8217;s efforts to increase opportunities for inclusion of minority 
communities and its determination to improve the status of women in all sectors of Israeli 
society. It noted the serious and constructive approach that many in the Council took 
towards the review of Israel, although it regretted the politicized nature of many of the 
recommendations. The United States was actively engaged in the international effort to 
establish peace in the region, including the establishment of a Palestinian State, that would 
exist side by side with Israel in peace and security. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>475. Amnesty International shared many of the recommendations made during the review 
and looked forward to learning which recommendations did or did not enjoy the State&#8217;s 
support. It suggested that the recommendations be strengthened, by recognizing the 
applicability to the occupied territories of the State&#8217;s responsibility under international 
human rights and humanitarian law and to investigate war crimes and other violations of 
international law, holding perpetrators accountable and providing reparation to victims; 
lifting the blockade of the Gaza Strip and allowing the unhindered passage of people and 
goods; halting the expansion of Israeli settlements, the destruction of Palestinian homes and </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>163 
</b></p>
<p>the construction of the wall/fence in the West Bank; removing the more than 500 
checkpoints and barriers impeding the movement of Palestinians; and reversing policies and 
practices that undermine the rights to health, education, housing, work and an adequate 
standard of living in the occupied territories, as well as for the Bedouin communities in 
Israel. It stated that many of the recommendations made had taken on an additional urgency 
in the wake of the recent conflict in the Gaza Strip and southern Israel, and it urged their 
full and prompt implementation. 
</p>
<p>476. The Arab Commission for Human Rights stated that the lack of cooperation reduced 
the opportunity for a dialogue and the effectiveness of the universal periodic review. It 
suggested that the Council should not adopt the report. It noted that countries from various 
regions had expressed their concerns and made realistic and measureable requests to end 
the human rights violations against the Palestinians. It indicated that the behaviour of the 
Hebrew State as an occupying Power was in contradiction with its international obligations. 
The Commission stated that the separation wall, the segregation, the fragmentation of the 
Palestinian territories and the expulsion of Palestinians compromised the establishment of 
peace and the right of future generations to solve the problem. The Commission concluded 
by expressing its hope that the Palestinians would one day have an independent and 
sovereign State.  
</p>
<p>477. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims stated that the implications of 
Israeli air strikes and ground invasions went beyond the destruction of infrastructure to the 
loss of innocent people&#8217;s lives, including those of women, children and the elderly. It 
indicated that Palestinians had experienced oppression and continuous traumatic 
experiences and massive destruction, including internal displacement. More than two thirds 
of Palestinian women and children suffered from trauma. It emphasized the necessity of 
respecting international humanitarian law and formation of an independent fact-finding 
delegation as part of the responsibilities of the Council with regard to Palestine. It called 
upon the Council to deliver an independent report on the psychological and mental trauma 
of Palestinian women and children, especially in the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>478. The World Federation of the United Nations, speaking on behalf of the United 
Nations Association of Iran, noted the continued neglect of civilians&#8217; rights as human rights 
violations, in particular in the Gaza Strip. The Federation stated that Israel had violated all 
international human rights and humanitarian instruments. It indicated that children in Gaza 
were facing health epidemics and that, according to the World Health Organization, trapped 
Palestinian children were at risk owing to the lack of vaccination. The Federation referred 
to the likelihood of a health crisis and to the inflicted health trauma caused by the three-
week offensive in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>479. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies commended the engagement of Israel 
in the universal periodic review process. It noted that international bodies and United 
Nations mechanisms, including the Council, had concluded that the confiscation and 
settlement of occupied Palestinian lands by Israel constituted illegal acts under international 
law. It noted that the process of settlement continued unabated. It said that the illegal policy 
of settlement and territorial confiscation had led to the violation of the fundamental rights 
of Palestinians and the endangerment of security and basic rights of all Israeli citizens. It 
asked about steps taken or to be taken by the Government to end this policy and dismantle 
settlements. It said that acknowledgement by Israel of the suffering of the Palestinian 
people caused by the occupation and policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory would 
constitute an important first step in addressing the current political impasse. The State&#8217;s 
unwillingness to adequately address the human rights violations committed by Israeli forces 
within its review report was an ominous sign. 
</p>
<p>480. Conscience and Peace Tax International regretted that the response of Israel to the 
recommendations had not been made available in advance. It expressed its interest in the </p>


<p><b>164</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>recommendation in paragraph 100, subparagraph 22. The Organization welcomed the 
State&#8217;s indication in its introductory remarks that it was planning to introduce an alternative 
civilian service for conscientious objectors to military service. The Organization 
encouraged Israel to bring in legislation consistent with international standards as set out in 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77 and in the jurisprudence of the Human 
Rights Committee. The Organization called on Israel to ensure in particular that 
arrangements be put firmly under civilian control, compatible with the nature of the 
objections, not punitive in nature by comparison with military service, and that it should 
accept declarations of conscience without inquiry. The Organization stated that it would 
follow with interest the progress of bringing forward relevant legislation. 
</p>
<p>481. The Women&#8217;s International Zionist Organization, while noting the steps taken to 
promote human and women&#8217;s rights, stated that barriers remained to the full realization of 
human and civil rights. It noted the establishment of the Commission on Equal 
Employment Opportunities and the Commission of Equal Rights for Persons with 
Disabilities, and that the commissions ensured active participation of non-governmental 
organizations. It called upon Israel to continue in this positive direction and to remove or 
narrow down its reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, particularly on equality in public representation and on 
gender equality in family life. It noted as unjustified the reservation to article 16 and urged 
Israel to provide for civil marriage and divorce. It said more than 300,000 Israeli citizens 
with no religious affiliation could not marry in Israel. The introduction of civil marriage 
would provide them with one of the most basic civil rights. It would also introduce an 
egalitarian divorce law, replacing the existing discriminatory religious laws that currently 
held exclusive jurisdiction over marriage and divorce in Israel. 
</p><p>482. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence referred to the Israeli military 
operation launched against the Gaza Strip and to the death, injuries and displacement of 
Palestinians and the blockaded population. The Organization noted the destruction of 
Government and other buildings as well as the United Nations aid distribution to refugee 
centres. The Organization indicated that Israel had committed genocide according to the 
Geneva Conventions and Protocols; war crimes according to the Charter of the Nuremberg 
International Military Court Tribunal; crimes against humanity according to the Rome 
Statute and the Charter of the Nuremberg International Military Court Tribunal; and a crime 
of aggression, according to General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX).  
483. The Society Studies Centre expressed concern that the outcome of the review only 
addressed the rights of Israeli people, ignoring the gross violations of human rights in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel had tried to avoid its responsibility as an occupying 
State with regard to the violations committed in Gaza and the West Bank and other 
occupied lands in the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon. The Centre stated that the most 
prominent violation committed by the State was to deny the self-determination of a nation 
by occupying the Palestinian lands, which had caused atrocities against the civilian 
population. It noted that 10,000 Palestinians were imprisoned, including Members of 
Parliament, and that a few days after the review, Israel had committed a massacre in Gaza. 
The Centre stated that Israel must be reminded and made accountable for what it had 
committed in Gaza and other parts of Palestine, and that it was unfair for Israel to destroy 
facilities and have European nations and other donors pay for rebuilding them.  
</p>
<p>484. The African American Society for Humanitarian Aid and Development said it 
followed with alarm the tragedy of the Palestinian people as the Israeli occupation 
committed the worst human rights violations, ignoring all international laws and 
international humanitarian law. It appealed to the Council to stop immediately all violations 
contrary to all international laws and to oblige the occupying Power to comply with 
international resolutions in this regard. It said that the lack of respect for these resolutions </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>165 
</b></p>
<p>by Israel demonstrates its disdain for the international community. It appealed to the 
Council to ensure the protection of the Palestinian people and to oblige Israel to put an end 
to the ethnic purification and massacres in which it was engaged in the Palestinian 
territories. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>485. Israel indicated that, while the questions and recommendations were challenging, 
they hoped that they would ultimately serve a constructive purpose for all Israeli citizens. 
Israel was committed to implementing practical measures that, over time, would lead to the 
successful realization of the recommendations that it had accepted.  
</p>
<p>486. Israel noted the remarks of the President of the Council who, citing paragraph 32 of 
Council resolution 5/1, recalled that recommendations that enjoy the support of the State 
concerned would be identified as such, while other recommendations, together with the 
comments of the State concerned thereon, would be noted. The President emphasized how 
important it was for the State under review to indicate whether the recommendations that 
had not been referred to by the delegation were supported or noted.   
</p>
<p>487. In view of these remarks and the Council resolution, Israel indicated that it had 
already referred to the recommendations that enjoyed its support, and that all other 
recommendations had also been noted. 
</p>
<p>488. Israel would continue to consult with representatives of civil society and non-
governmental organizations to ensure the full realization of human rights in Israel. Israel 
believed that strong civil society involvement in the follow-up to the universal periodic 
review would make its vibrant democracy stronger, more resilient and more secure.  
</p>
<p>489. Israel was aware that its human rights record was not perfect; however, it had not 
lost sight of the founding ideals in their declaration of independence and looked forward to 
ensuring the continued growth of a society based upon the rule of law and fundamental 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>490. Before the adoption of the outcome of the review on Israel, statements were made. 
</p>
<p>491. Palestine reiterated its support for the universal periodic review process and noted 
that the applicability of international law, international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law, particularly the fourth Geneva Convention, with regard to the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, made it incumbent upon the occupying 
authority to submit a detailed report on the human rights situation in the territories under its 
occupation, in addition to its report on the human rights situation within its own. Palestine 
questioned the commitment of Israel to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law in view of the fact that it 
occupied Palestinian territories in clear violation of United Nations principles and 
threatened international peace and security. Out of respect for international law and 
resolutions in general, and for the Council in particular, Israel must be obliged to apply all 
resolutions and recommendations adopted by the Council. Israel must respect all human 
rights mechanisms within the Council, in particular special procedures and fact-finding 
missions. Palestine indicated that the fact that Israel, as the occupying Power, had rejected a 
number of recommendations threatened the whole universal periodic review mechanism 
and undermined the work of the Council; it thus expressed its reservations. It noted that, in 
accordance with paragraph 32 of Council resolution 5/1, all recommendations form part of 
the outcome.   
</p>
<p>492. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, noted that the 
universal periodic review was one of the most important mechanisms established by the 
Council to address human rights situations in the country under review in a comprehensive </p>


<p><b>166</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>manner. It noted that the Council should bear in mind that Israel, as an occupying Power, 
had a different status and had obligations flowing from international human rights and 
international humanitarian law, particularly the fourth Geneva Convention. Under 
humanitarian law, the Palestinians were protected people and Israel had an obligation to 
ensure their enjoyment of all human rights. During its review in December 2008, many 
States reminded Israel of this fact and recommended the implementation of its human rights 
and humanitarian obligations, which Israel had chosen to ignore. It should be held 
accountable for persistent violations of all fundamental rights of the people it currently 
occupies and should respond to all the recommendations made. The Council should ensure 
that there will be no impunity for those who violate the rights of occupied people. The 
Organization of the Islamic Conference believed that the Israeli policy of ignoring some 
fundamental concerns relating to its human rights obligations had seriously undermined the 
objective of the universal periodic review exercise. It thus stated its reservations on this 
approach.  
</p>
<p>493. The United States of America noted that it had re-engaged with the Council and 
sought to ensure fairness and that no one country was singled out and treated differently 
from others. It noted that, during the consideration of the outcome of the review of Israel, 
certain procedural questions had been raised that were not raised with regard to any other 
State. They considered efforts to treat one country, any country, differently from all others, 
unacceptable. The United States noted with appreciation the remarks from Palestine, in its 
commitment to sticking with procedure and proceeding in a fair way. It appreciated the 
work of the secretariat and the President in keeping the Council on the right path. The 
founding principles of the Council &#8212; universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-
selectivity &#8212; were not intended to shield countries from criticism but to create an 
environment in which all would be treated fairly, and ultimately make the Council more 
effective. It noted that all should rededicate themselves to the goals and founding principles 
of the Council.   
</p>
<p>494. Australia expressed its deep concern that, during the consideration of the outcome of 
the review of Israel, procedural questions had been raised that were not raised during the 
review of the other 30 States that have undergone the review process. Australia indicated 
that the singling out of one country was unacceptable and regrettable, given the generally 
positive operation of the review process and its contribution to human rights promotion in 
many countries. Australia expressed appreciation for the President&#8217;s efforts to find a way 
through and to ensure the decorum of the Council.  
</p>
<p>495. Cuba indicated its support for the universal periodic review as an effective tool to 
make progress in human rights promotion and protection. Cuba had hoped that Israel would 
follow common practice, respected by all, to react to all the recommendations on which 
their position had not yet been set out during the Working Group review. Cuba would not 
object to the adoption of the report, but wished to put on record its hope that Israel would 
understand the appeals from the international community and would endeavour to respect 
all human rights, including of the Palestinian people living in the occupied Palestine 
territories, as was its obligation as the occupying Power. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Liechtenstein 
</b></p>
<p>496. The review of Liechtenstein was held on 5 December 2008 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Liechtenstein in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LIE/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LIE/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/LIE/3). </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>167 
</b></p>
<p>497. At the 29th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Liechtenstein (see section C below). 
</p><p>498. The outcome of the review on Liechtenstein comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/77), the views of Liechtenstein 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/10/77/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>499. The delegation of Liechtenstein provided an update on relevant developments that 
had occurred since the adoption of the universal periodic review report on Liechtenstein by 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>500. In December 2008, Parliament had approved the accession of Liechtenstein to the 
1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of 
Intercountry Adoption. As a State party to that convention, Liechtenstein would be able to 
also ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>501. On 1 February 2009, the new Children and Youth Act had entered into force. Article 
3 of that act stipulates, inter alia, that children and youth have the right to education free of 
violence, mentioning explicitly that any form of corporal punishment, emotional harm and 
other degrading measures are not tolerable. Liechtenstein stressed that this provision 
complemented the existing prohibition of corporal punishment at school and in public 
childcare institutions, extending it to all settings, including the family. 
</p>
<p>502. The delegation further stressed that, also in February, the Government had 
established an interdisciplinary working group with the specific mandate to examine any 
legislative and other measures required for the domestic implementation of the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. In the same month, the 
Government approved a concept paper entitled &#8220;Persons with disabilities in the working 
process&#8221;, which had been prepared by a working group set up to analyse the current 
situation in Liechtenstein with regard to this more specific area. On the basis of this 
development, the delegation announced the voluntary commitment that Liechtenstein 
would intensify its examination of the necessary implementation measures with a view to a 
possible accession to that convention and its protocol. The commitment was made against 
the background of Liechtenstein&#8217;s general policy with regard to international treaties, which 
consists in adapting the relevant national legislation before ratification in order to allow for 
immediate implementation thereafter. 
</p>
<p>503. Also in February 2009, parliamentary elections were held in Liechtenstein. Among 
the 25 newly elected members of Parliament were 6 women, corresponding to about 24 per 
cent. The result corresponded to the one achieved in the parliamentary elections four years 
ago, and constituted a firm basis for Liechtenstein&#8217;s continued commitment to pay 
particular attention to the promotion of women&#8217;s participation at all levels and in all areas 
of public life. In this context, the delegation added that the new Government to be sworn in 
very soon would have a proportion of 40 per cent of female ministers. Liechtenstein made 
this commitment regarding women&#8217;s participation also as a reaction to the 
recommendations submitted during the session of the Working Group with regard to 
women&#8217;s rights. The delegation announced that Liechtenstein could accept all of the 
recommendations in this area, partly by converting them into voluntary commitments.  </p>


<p><b>168</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>504. The only recommendation with relevance to the situation of women that 
Liechtenstein could not accept concerned the call for an ex officio prosecution in respect of 
all forms of domestic violence. In this regard, the delegation explained that, in 2007, the 
introduction of a new explicit criminal provision on stalking had been approved by 
Parliament. It was a criminal offence to harass a person persistently and for a prolonged 
period in a way that was likely to seriously disrupt her or his way of life. This new 
provision made an important contribution to the prevention of violence against women 
since it allowed the police to intervene already at a very early stage and to prevent 
threatening behaviour from turning into an act of violence. This criminal offence required a 
complaint to be made by the victim for the prosecution to be initiated. The same was true 
for rape in marriage and partnership as well as other forms of domestic violence penalized 
under the criminal code. Since a procedural distinction between stalking and comparable 
forms of domestic violence would undermine the effectiveness of this new provision of the 
criminal code, the Liechtenstein authorities did not intend to establish ex officio 
prosecution for all acts of domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>505. Liechtenstein could therefore not support this recommendation, as one of eight 
recommendations that Liechtenstein could not accept. As underlined by the delegation, 32 
of the recommendations could, however, be accepted or had been converted into voluntary 
commitments, which corresponded to a ratio of accepted to rejected recommendations of 4 
to 1.  
</p>
<p>506. The delegation stressed that Liechtenstein continued to follow up on its commitment 
in respect of international cooperation despite the financial and economic crisis. In 
particular, since December 2008, UNRWA was supported by 100,000 Swiss francs for its 
emergency relief in Gaza. ICRC was supported by 200,000 Swiss francs for its activities in 
Uganda and the Philippines. Another support of 100,000 Swiss francs went to a basic health 
programme in Zimbabwe, while 100,000 Swiss francs had been contributed to the Common 
Humanitarian Action Plan for Sri Lanka. Moreover, 100,000 Swiss francs went to the 
Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre and 50,000 to the ICRC fund for mine victims. 
</p>
<p>507. In conclusion, the delegation referred to the written replies to the recommendations 
provided by Liechtenstein several days before the meeting, which it did not intend to read 
out to save time for the dialogue.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>508. Germany thanked Liechtenstein for its outstanding constructive approach to the 
recommendations. Liechtenstein had set a benchmark on how to deal with 
recommendations, by accepting and supporting many of them, by converting others into 
voluntary commitments, and mostly by giving detailed reasoning for those 
recommendations that could not be accepted. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>509. Amnesty International welcomed many of the recommendations made by States 
during the review, especially that efforts be continued to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination, to draft a law establishing registered partnership for same-sex couples, and 
to ensure the full implementation of the national plan of action against racism. It further 
welcomed Liechtenstein&#8217;s support of these recommendations. It regretted, however, that 
Liechtenstein had rejected the recommendation made by several States to establish an 
ombudsman or national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
Notwithstanding the comments by Liechtenstein in the addendum, Amnesty International 
considered that such an institution would be an important step towards improving the 
coordination on human rights policy between the different institutional levels. Referring to 
the call made by several States for measures to strengthen the integration of foreigners, </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>169 
</b></p>
<p>Amnesty International urged Liechtenstein to amend the new Foreign National Act to avoid 
the creation of additional groups of non-citizens and to ensure that non-citizens were not 
discriminated against, especially with regard to their right to family reunification. It 
welcomed assurances by Liechtenstein that it had honoured all its reporting obligations 
under the United Nations treaty body system, and called on Liechtenstein to ensure that 
regular follow-up was undertaken to the concluding observations and recommendations of 
the treaty bodies. This should include regular human rights training for public servants, 
especially those working with foreign nationals and asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p>510. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine welcomed 
the fact that human rights were defined as one of the priorities of the foreign policy of 
Liechtenstein. It welcomed the setting up of a commission on protection against violence in 
Liechtenstein, and indicated that it would like to cooperate with the commission within the 
framework of the sociological survey under way concerning violence. It suggested that the 
results of the survey be submitted to the Council, as very often the question of violence is 
dealt with only in connection with violence against women. The survey provided an 
opportunity to discuss the fact that violence is a social scourge and should be dealt with as 
such. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>511. Liechtenstein indicated that it had taken note of the comments made and that the 
report would be taken back home. Referring again to the written comments submitted in 
advance by Liechtenstein, the delegation stressed that the dialogue did not end at the 
plenary meeting of the Council, but would be continued in the future. Liechtenstein would 
concentrate on the follow-up to the universal periodic review and the implementation of 
commitments in practice. The delegation indicated that Liechtenstein had decided to pursue 
dialogue at the national level and that meetings with all stakeholders that had contributed to 
the national report were planned at regular intervals. It thanked all delegations, including 
the members of the troika, for their interest in the review, their comments and numerous 
questions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 10. Serbia 
</b></p>
<p>512. The review of Serbia was held on 5 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Serbia in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/SRB/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/SRB/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/SRB/3). 
</p><p>513. At the 30th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Serbia (see section C below). 
514. The outcome of the review on Serbia comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/78), the views of Serbia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/78/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>515. The State Secretary in the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights of Serbia 
presented the reply of Serbia concerning conclusions and recommendations made in the </p>


<p><b>170</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>Working Group report on the review of the country on 5 December 2008. He informed the 
Council that Serbia, upon careful consideration of the report, had accepted most of the 
conclusions and recommendations completely or in part. Detailed explanation of the 
Government&#8217;s position had been provided regarding all the recommendations (see 
A/HRC/10/78/Add.1). 
</p><p>516. The delegate stated that, aware of its responsibility to promote and protect human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, Serbia was ready and willing to implement the accepted 
recommendations and responsibilities, although implementation efforts often face pressing 
challenges, and sometimes an increase in public expenditure. The delegate highlighted the 
fact that Serbia had already begun, in the short period between the interactive dialogue and 
the adoption of the final report, to fulfil certain obligations; preparations for the ratification 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol were 
well under way, as well as development of the initial report to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Furthermore, the Government of Serbia had 
elaborated a draft law on prohibiting discrimination, and a national strategy for the 
improvement of the status of women and gender equality had been adopted. 
</p>
<p>517. The recommendation regarding the adoption of a separate anti-discrimination law 
was accepted, as were the recommendations for the advancement of the position of persons 
with disabilities. In 2006, the Government adopted a national strategy for the advancement 
of the position of persons with disabilities. The same year a law on the prevention of 
discrimination of persons with disabilities was adopted, while a law on the employment and 
professional rehabilitation of persons with disabilities would be adopted soon. 
</p>
<p>518. The recommendations regarding the State&#8217;s commitment to human rights protection 
and raising public awareness regarding human rights were accepted. The Ministry of 
Human and Minority Rights had signed a memorandum of cooperation with more than 150 
non-governmental organizations, by which the parties pledged to ensure regular future 
exchange of information on activities connected with the preparation, adoption and 
implementation of laws and strategies in the area of respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, in connection with the production of reports on the implementation 
of accepted international obligations, as well as with regard to other activities falling under 
the competency of the Ministry. In the future, the Ministry of Education would also take 
part in raising public awareness on the possibilities of using existing legal provisions and 
institutional mechanisms for the protection of human rights. Serbia would continue to take 
all necessary measures to strengthen national mechanisms for the implementation of the 
views of contracting bodies in connection with individual applications or petitions. 
</p>
<p>519. The recommendation regarding the report on the implementation of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was accepted, as the 
Ministry of Human and Minority Rights had already begun to prepare the initial report on 
the implementation of the Convention. Serbia accepted recommendations regarding the role 
of women in high-level decision-making processes. The country was undertaking activities 
towards changing the Family Law by introducing norms that clearly prohibited corporal 
punishment and protected children from all forms of physical punishment, including 
physical punishment in the family environment; therefore, the recommendations regarding 
prohibition of corporal punishment, including in the family, in line with the recent 
recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child were accepted. 
</p>
<p>520. Recommendations regarding implementation of a comprehensive national strategy 
to prevent trafficking and sexual exploitation of children and to take effective measures to 
combat trafficking in women and children in cooperation with countries in the trafficking 
network were accepted. Serbia also accepted the recommendations to develop a legal 
system in line with international standards, in order to strengthen the rule of law. 
Recommendations regarding measures necessary to ensure that allegations of human rights </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>171 
</b></p>
<p>violations were systematically subjected to inquiries and punished where appropriate, as 
well as to strengthen measures for the development of effective mechanisms to help combat 
impunity, including strengthening of the judiciary, were also accepted. 
</p><p>521. The recommendations to ensure the investigation of cases of violence against 
journalists and for creating a climate in which journalists would be able to report freely on 
sensitive issues were accepted, as well as the recommendation to take measures to improve 
socio-economic conditions for refugees and internally displaced persons. Serbia also 
accepted the recommendation to reach the human rights goals set up by the Council in its 
resolution 9/12. 
</p>
<p>522. Serbia expressed its support for the work of the Council and the universal periodic 
report process based on interactive dialogue, which promoted universal human rights and 
their interconnection and contributions to the exchanges on best practices among States and 
other interested parties. On behalf of the Government of Serbia, the delegate expressed 
heartfelt gratitude to all States that had recognized areas for more efficient action for the 
improvement of human rights in Serbia, as well as representatives of the troika (Ghana, 
Pakistan and Ukraine) for their contribution to the preparation of the report. Serbia also 
thanked numerous non-governmental organizations and relevant United Nations bodies that 
had contributed during the review process to determine the status of human rights in the 
country. Finally, Serbia pointed out that it believed that the next cycle of the review 
process, to be carried out in four years, would be a real test showing the extent of fulfilment 
of the commitments made by the country in this process for the improvement of the status 
of human rights and freedoms in society. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>523. Cuba thanked the Serbian authorities for their efforts to present their national report 
and for the extensive and clear information given to the Working Group. It expressed its 
satisfaction with the replies provided by Serbia during the interactive dialogue and for 
sharing its experiences, achievements and challenges in the promotion and protection of 
human rights and for informing the Working Group of its priorities. It commended Serbia&#8217;s 
efforts to promote and protect human rights, especially the prohibition of all forms of 
discrimination, the promotion of tolerance and intercultural dialogue among the various 
ethnic, linguistic and religious groups in the country. Cuba stated that it was useful to learn 
about national measures taken by the Government of Serbia in order to reach the 
Millennium Development Goals, particularly on the poverty reduction strategy and the 
national employment strategy. It congratulated Serbia on the progress made in promoting 
and protecting human rights and encouraged Serbia to continue its efforts to honour the 
commitments made.  
</p>
<p>524. The Russian Federation welcomed the universal periodic review of Serbia, a country 
with which it was linked by many years of close and friendly relations. In particular, the 
Russian Federation welcomed the additional information provided by the representative of 
Serbia. It noted Serbia&#8217;s openness and constructive approach as well as the focus on 
dialogue during the review. 
</p>
<p>525. Algeria thanked the Serbian delegation for the additional information provided on 
the human rights situation in the country. The national report was exhaustive and showed 
the country&#8217;s determination to protect and promote human rights. Algeria encouraged the 
authorities in Serbia to continue along this course and to accept the recommendations made 
in December 2008. The delegate underlined that Algeria and Serbia had a common 
attachment to peace, justice and international legality and to the principles of international 
law, which were the only way to preserve international stability. Algeria recommended the 
adoption of the report on Serbia. </p>


<p><b>172</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>526. Ukraine welcomed and thanked the delegation of Serbia for the comments and 
additional information provided on recommendations and the activities of the Government 
of Serbia aiming at their implementation. Serbia was commended for the efforts made in 
recent years aimed at protecting and promoting human rights and the progress achieved. As 
a member of the troika, Ukraine expressed its appreciation to Serbia for its openness in the 
review process and to the members of its delegation for the cooperation and constructive 
role that they had played in the preparation of the report. Ukraine noted with satisfaction 
that Serbia had adopted the majority of recommendations made during the review and 
welcomed its intention to ensure their full and effective implementation as well as measures 
already taken, and expressed its conviction that Serbia would make further progress.  
</p>
<p>527. The United States of America expressed appreciation that the Constitution of Serbia 
banned direct and indirect discrimination, and urged the Government to intensify its efforts 
to enforce this provision and hoped that Serbia&#8217;s establishment of a Protector of Citizens as 
an independent public authority would prove to be an important step in that direction. The 
United States expressed its continuing concern over the discrimination against minorities in 
education, employment, housing and health, but appreciated Serbia&#8217;s commitment to 
continue to take positive steps to promote equality and non-discrimination. The United 
States noted that corruption remained a serious problem in Serbia and recognized the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to bring several judges and prosecutors charged with corruption to 
justice. It noted as a positive development Serbia&#8217;s engagement with representatives of civil 
society in the reform of the judiciary and in legislative policy. It also noted that trafficking 
remained a significant problem in Serbia, and encouraged adoption of the draft amendment 
of the criminal code that introduces harsher punishment for traffickers. The United States 
shared the concerns of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion 
regarding the limitations on the independence of the media. It hoped that Serbia would 
adopt the recommendation of the Working Group to ensure that journalists were able to 
report on sensitive issues without fear of harassment or reprisal. Finally, the United States 
was of the view that Kosovo was independent and that Serbia did not exercise any 
governing authority over this territory, which should remain outside the focus of future 
universal periodic reports on Serbia.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>528. The representative of COC Netherlands and the Labris-lesbian human rights 
organization of Serbia indicated that, according to the Constitution of Serbia, everyone had 
the right to equal legal protection and non-discrimination, but that Serbia still did not have 
an anti-discrimination law which, like the gender equality law, was still pending. The 
representative recommended their early adoption, and recommended that discrimination 
based on sexual orientation be specifically prohibited in the Constitution, the criminal code 
and other laws. The representative commended Serbia for joining the statement delivered at 
the sixty-third session of the General Assembly, on sexual orientation and gender identity, 
and suggested that Serbia continue adopting and implementing policies in the spirit of that 
statement. The representative indicated that attacks and physical threats to LGBT persons 
and human rights defenders occurred on a daily basis. According to the Serbian criminal 
code, racial and other forms of discrimination were a criminal offence, but sexual 
orientation was not specifically mentioned and hate crimes were not legally recognized.  
</p>
<p>529. Interfaith International appreciated the good responses given by Serbia to 
recommendations and questions resulting from the review process. Nevertheless, the 
representative drew the attention of the Council to the precarious situation in which some 
retirees from Kosovo, who had paid contributions until 1999 in former Yugoslavia, found 
themselves. According to the representative, since the end of the war, those retirees had 
been deprived of their pensions for which they had paid during their labour life in a period 
of 15 to 40 years in the hope of ensuring a retirement in dignity. Since 2000, many </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>173 
</b></p>
<p>initiatives and steps had been taken with all parties concerned. Also, large-scale 
demonstrations had been held. The representative added that, to date, MINUK had provided 
only promises without a follow-up. Consequently, in the follow-up of review 
recommendations and the commitments of Serbia to improve human rights, it called upon 
the international community and the Council to set up a commission which would be tasked 
with taking measures in cooperation with the Governments and institutions responsible for 
the recovery and payment of pension to those retirees, facilitating administrative procedures 
for them. 
</p>
<p>530. The representative of Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne 
humaine stated that it had emerged from their reading of the universal periodic report on 
Serbia that peaceful coexistence among various national entities, which appear to have 
different aspirations in the area of human rights, remained a major challenge for this 
multinational State. In this regard, it welcomed the recommendation made regarding the 
promotion of equality and non-discrimination against national minorities in the country. It 
also referred to the recommendation on combating neo-Nazi and other groups that 
promoted racial hate and violence within the framework of Serbia&#8217;s legislation. It felt that 
the current measures were insufficient to ensure internal stability, and requested Serbia to 
provide the Council with data on the composition of national ethnic groups in political, 
administrative and legal bodies. The experience of countries in similar situations showed 
that unity within diversity was possible if all social groups were represented at the national 
level. It hoped that Serbia would be able to achieve the commitments enshrined in its 
Constitution of November 2006.  
</p>
<p>531. Amnesty International welcomed many of the recommendations made by States to 
Serbia, including calls to ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal 
for the Former Yugoslavia. It also welcomed calls to ensure that allegations of human rights 
violations were investigated, prosecuted and the perpetrators brought to justice. Amnesty 
International noted that, since the establishment of the special war crimes chamber at 
Belgrade District Court, Serbia had made real progress in addressing impunity for the war 
crimes perpetrated during the wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo. 
However, the number of trials completed remained low, and the current capacity and 
resources of the Court were inadequate. It urged that additional resources be allocated to the 
Court and the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor. Measures should be taken to strengthen 
the authority and capacity of the war crimes investigative services, or it should be re-
established as an independent agency or as a unit of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. Amnesty 
International also called upon Serbia to carry out effective, independent and impartial 
investigations into incidents where the actions of the State agents, including police and 
prison officers, may have led to violations of human rights. While acknowledging the 
decline in the number of reported incidents, it expressed its concerns at the long-standing 
failure of Serbia to address impunity in cases of torture and other ill-treatment, and at the 
continued inclusion in the criminal code of a statute of limitations on prosecutions for such 
human rights violations. It urged the Government of Serbia to establish a genuinely 
independent and transparent mechanism to investigate all allegations of torture and other 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>532. Serbia reiterated its commitment to the universal periodic review process and its 
dedication to the promotion and protection of human rights. It would intensify its efforts for 
the fulfilment of the commitment made in the course of this important process for the 
improvement of human rights and freedoms in its society. Serbia expressed its thanks for all 
the comments and recommendations made from different sides, but also mentioned that the 
intervention of the representative of the United States of America regarding the status of the 
Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija was not in accordance with the basic </p>


<p><b>174</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>documents and what was being done in the United Nations. The Council was a United 
Nations forum, and Serbia, as a sovereign State, was a member of the United Nations with 
all its territory, which meant that Kosovo and Metohija were a part of Serbia. Therefore, 
Serbia requested that the forum not be used to negotiate and discuss the status of the 
Autonomous Province of Kosovo and the unilateral declaration of independence. Serbia 
expressed its appreciation to all the delegations that played an active role in the process 
before the Council, as well as civil society representatives. It addressed special thanks to 
the members of the troika, composed of Ghana, Pakistan and Ukraine, who facilitated the 
process. Finally, it thanked the President for the professional conduct of the process. 
</p>
<p><b> 11. Turkmenistan 
</b></p>
<p>533. The review of Turkmenistan was held on 9 December 2008 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Turkmenistan in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TKM/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TKM/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TKM/3). 
</p><p>534. At the 30th meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Turkmenistan (see section C below). 
535. The outcome of the review on Turkmenistan comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/79), the views of Turkmenistan 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or 
issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working 
Group (see also A/HRC/10/79/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>536. The Director of the Institute for Human Rights and Democracy under the President 
of Turkmenistan and head of delegation, Dr. Shirin Ahmedova, expressed gratitude to the 
States and international organizations that had made their recommendations during the 
review. Turkmenistan would bear in mind the comments made in order to carry out further 
reforms in the country and to prepare national reports, including under the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Turkmenistan had closely followed up on 
its international obligations and reformed its national human rights system. 
</p>
<p>537. On 14 December 2008, Turkmenistan held elections to the <i>Mejlis</i> (Parliament), with 
international observers. On 9 January 2009, in conformity with the new Constitution, the 
Parliament held its first session and elected its chairperson by secret ballot. From 125 
representatives of the <i>Mejlis</i>, 21 are women (17 per cent), including the Chairperson of 
Parliament, and the chairpersons of two of the five parliamentary committees. The 
President, in his statement at the opening of Parliament, focused on developing further the 
process of democratization, civil society, the need to reform national legislation to bring it 
into line with the new Constitution and the provisions of the international instruments 
ratified by Turkmenistan. 
</p>
<p>538. In January 2009, the Inter-ministerial Committee submitted its report for 2008. The 
Committee&#8217;s role is to monitor national legislation with regard to human rights and to 
prepare proposals on the implementation of international human rights law and on 
institutional transformation. It addressed proposals to Parliament on the need to reform the 
penitentiary system and the system of juvenile justice; mechanisms of legal protection; the </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>175 
</b></p>
<p>creation of a government body on family, maternal and child protection; work on 
legislation regulating religious organizations and civil society organizations; and on the 
regulation of the media. 
</p>
<p>539. In 2008, Turkmenistan prepared, inter alia, its report under the Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its core document. In accordance with 
recommendations from the Council, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
UNICEF, Turkmenistan undertook to examine adhesion to ILO Convention 182 on child 
labour. 
</p>
<p>540. Turkmenistan proceeded to respond to recommendations forthcoming from the 
universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>541. Turkmenistan was currently examining the Rome Statute and mechanisms of 
adhesion to it. Cooperation was planned with the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime and the European Union/Tacis on this matter as well as for parliamentarians and 
relevant Government bodies. 
</p>
<p>542. With respect to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture, Turkmenistan planned to present its national report to the Committee against 
Torture in December 2009. In the framework of the preparation of that report, 
Turkmenistan was planning to conduct seminars and round tables together with United 
Nations agencies, to learn about the Optional Protocol. Those activities, as well as 
consultations for members of the Inter-ministerial Commission on the mechanisms of 
adhesion to optional international instruments, would be undertaken in the framework of a 
joint project OHCHR/European Commission/UNDP on strengthening the State&#8217;s capacity 
to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>543. The Inter-ministerial Commission, having consulted with relevant government 
bodies and civil society organizations on the effectiveness of adhering to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, transmitted to the Government the necessary materials for Parliament. The 
President wrote to the <i>Mejlis</i> on 21 January 2009 about the need to ratify the Optional 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p>544. Turkmenistan proceeded to respond to the recommendation to establish an 
independent national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles. In the 
framework of cooperation between the relevant Government bodies and the Embassy of the 
United Kingdom, a cycle of seminars was started in January 2009 for parliamentarians and 
Government bodies to examine the experience in other countries of ombudsman systems. 
Turkmenistan was planning to broaden cooperation on gathering knowledge on 
ombudsmen systems, to complete the legislation and further the activities of governmental 
bodies and of the Institute for Human Rights and Democracy under the President of 
Turkmenistan. The Institute also planned to undertake joint activities, including an 
assessment of the complaints system, in the framework of projects with OSCE and UNDP. 
Turkmenistan also planned to hold ongoing consultations with OHCHR on complaint 
procedures. 
</p>
<p>545. On the recommendation of issuing a standing invitation to special procedures, 
Turkmenistan indicated that the relevant Government bodies were currently examining the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, who 
visited the country in September 2008, in order to further improve the system of registration 
of religious organizations and relevant legislation. Currently, Turkmenistan requested a list 
of the special procedures in order to examine the question of issuing them invitations. 
</p>
<p>546. The question of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment 
in places of deprivation of liberty was being examined by the Government commission on </p>


<p><b>176</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>complaints about law enforcement bodies, and the Inter-ministerial Commission on the 
national reports. Implementation had started on a joint project with the Embassy of the 
United Kingdom, the International Centre for Prison Studies and the German Development 
Programme aimed at improving the penitentiary system. Support for the penitentiary 
system was foreseen in the programme of projects to be conducted together with OSCE-
Ashkabad in 2009. Within that framework, seminars were planned for prison staff on the 
1955 United Nations Minimum Standards, follow-up consultations and the development of 
learning materials on that issue.  
</p>
<p>547. Regarding the recommendation to allow access of ICRC representatives to 
detainees, in conformity with their mandate, Turkmenistan had stepped up its cooperation 
with all recognized international organizations, including with ICRC. At present, 
Government representatives were taking part in training sessions and seminars organized by 
ICRC in the country and abroad. The question of visiting penitentiary facilities was being 
permanently discussed by representatives of the Government and ICRC. Turkmenistan had 
proposed a gradual implementation of the ICRC mandate in the country. As a first step, it 
had been proposed to broadly raise awareness among the staff of the relevant Government 
bodies about the international rules and the practice and activities of ICRC in this area. 
</p>
<p>548. On 27 November 2008, the regional representation of ICRC in Central Asia made a 
presentation on its activities in relation to imprisoned and detained persons. From 
Turkmenistan, this presentation was attended by representatives from Government bodies 
in charge of administering and controlling penitentiaries; from the Ministry of the Interior, 
the general procuracy, the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Justice; and the Institute for 
Human Rights and Democracy under the President of Turkmenistan. 
</p>
<p>549. On 7 March 2009, the regional representative of ICRC in Central Asia visited 
Turkmenistan, during which the proposal on a gradual introduction of the ICRC mandate 
on prison visits was discussed and taken into account. 
</p>
<p>550. On the recommendation to defend the human rights of journalists and human rights 
defenders, to let them peacefully carry out their activities without threat of being detained 
or imprisoned, the delegation stated that the human rights of journalists and human rights 
defenders were fully guaranteed and protected by the State&#8217;s fundamental law and by 
existing legislation. According to the new Constitution, citizens had the right to freedom of 
thought and freedom of expression, as well as to receive information, if this information 
was not a State secret or otherwise secret information (art. 28). Moreover, the delegation 
provided information that, inter alia, written press and other public media were free in 
Turkmenistan. 
</p>
<p>551. With regard to the recommendation to establish a constitutional court and 
ombudsman system, Turkmenistan provided information that, inter alia, the UNDAF 2010&#8211;
2015 and the EU/OHCHR/UNDP projects included activities aimed at learning about the 
experience with constitutional courts and constitutional councils in other countries. There 
were also plans to undertake a monitoring of the human rights system in Turkmenistan, 
from which relevant proposals would be formulated regarding institutions and legislation. 
</p>
<p>552. On the recommendation of excluding impunity for torture and other unlawful 
treatment of prisoners and undertaking independent investigations on such cases, 
information was provided on the relevant legal provisions, including part 2, article 23 of the 
Constitution, which stated that no citizen could be subject to torture, cruel or inhuman or 
humiliating treatment or punishment, nor subject without consent to medical or medicinal 
experiments (part 2, art. 23). The delegation also stated that more detailed information on 
this issue would be presented in the national reports of Turkmenistan to the Human Rights 
Committee and to the Committee against Torture. Further information was also provided on 
study visits to penitentiary systems, proposals for reforms and plans for identifying </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>177 
</b></p>
<p>international cooperation partners in this area. At the end of 2008, work had also started on 
a new code of criminal procedure in line with international standards, including the 1955 
United Nations Minimum Standards. A joint project was also being implemented with 
UNICEF on reforming the system of juvenile justice, including on places of detention for 
minors.  
</p>
<p>553. Another recommendation requested Turkmenistan to take measures to liberalize and 
pluralize media and to remove all restrictions on criticizing the Government, without fear of 
retaliation, and to end the practice of Government appointment of editors and managers of 
media. Turkmenistan provided information on a special cabinet of ministers meeting on 26 
January 2009 that was devoted to reforming the activities of the media and, in that context, 
the need to improve media legislation and the question of specialist training were identified 
as important issues to be addressed. Information was also provided on other recent 
developments, such as the invitation of an expert from the BBC in 2008, plans for a series 
of activities including training sessions, seminars, round tables for representatives of the 
media, as well as practice abroad for specialists. Support for the media was also among the 
projects planned in the framework of joint cooperation between the Government and the 
OSCE centre in Ashgabat. Information was provided on, inter alia, a training course from 
30 March to 3 April 2009 on activities of the media, for journalists, editors and staff of 
television and radio. The training would be given by journalists from Hungary, and the 
representative of OSCE on freedom of the media would intervene in the course. Together 
with USAID in Turkmenistan and Internews in Central Asia, cooperation was being 
planned regarding the improvement of laws regulating the media. A cycle of seminars in 
this context was starting in May 2009. 
</p>
<p>554. On the recommendation relating to the removal of restrictions on civil society 
organizations and human rights defenders, the delegation stated that civil society played an 
important role in political life in Turkmenistan. Non-governmental organizations, civil 
society organizations, professional and creative unions actively took part in determining the 
economic, social and cultural policies of organs of the Government. Work was ongoing 
regarding the improvement of existing legislation on civil society organizations and its 
implementation in practice, and learning about international standards and experience from 
other countries in this field. International cooperation between Turkmenistan specialists and 
the International Centre for Not-for-Profit Law was taking place, with the support of 
USAID, aimed at preparing recommendations thereon. 
</p>
<p>555. Concerning the recommendation to recognize conscientious objection to military 
service and with respect to recognizing the right of persons renouncing military service on 
religious grounds, Turkmenistan provided information that conditions existed that allowed 
for guaranteeing the right to freedom of religion and the fulfilment of military duty by 
serving in non-military structures of the Ministry of Defence, such as medical and 
construction units. Turkmenistan also indicated that the process of improving the legislation 
on religious organizations was ongoing. Experts from the International Centre for Not-for-
Profit Law were currently examining the existing legislation regulating the functioning of 
religious organizations with regard to its conformity with international norms. An 
agreement had been reached with the Centre and USAID to hold a number of seminars and 
organize a presentation on the assessment, which was currently being made. The seminars 
were expected to bring together international experts and representatives from Parliament, 
the Ministry of Justice and other relevant bodies of Turkmenistan. Recommendations for 
legislative changes would be made based on the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur, a review of international standards, foreign legislation and the monitoring by 
the experts of the International Centre. </p>

</i>556. The Russian Federation welcomed the successful universal periodic review of 
Turkmenistan, a country with which it was linked by many years of close and friendly 
relations, and thanked the delegation for, inter alia, its very detailed statement and its 
openness and willingness to engage in dialogue during the review of human rights in 
Turkmenistan. The Russian Federation noted that most of the recommendations had been 
accepted thanks also to progress in the sphere of human rights achieved by Turkmenistan in 
recent years. It was confident that the efforts of the Government of Turkmenistan to carry 
out broad reforms to improve its educational, health and social systems, and also to enhance 
the well-being of its people, would be continued. 
</p>
<p>557. Algeria reiterated its appreciation for the efforts made by the Government to 
promote human rights by, inter alia, the establishment of an inter-ministerial commission to 
follow up and implement the State&#8217;s human rights commitments, as well as the review of its 
domestic legislation. Algeria congratulated Turkmenistan on the progress made particularly 
in the field of education, and encouraged the Government to step up its efforts to achieve 
the goals set for the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>558. The United States of America welcomed the State&#8217;s new Constitution and referred to 
several of its provisions. However, it noted that the judicial system, in practice, still lacked 
procedures to ensure fair trials, such as the right for defendants to call witnesses to testify 
on their behalf, the right to a defence attorney or a court-appointed attorney if the defendant 
could not afford one, or the presumption of innocence. Turkmenistan was encouraged to 
adopt the recommendation on the holding of a review of all potentially political cases with 
a view to releasing all individuals incarcerated on politically motivated charges. The United 
States also urged Turkmenistan to accept the recommendations addressing restrictions on 
freedom of the media, assembly, association and religion. It noted that, with its one-party 
rule, Turkmenistan remained politically monolithic; however, the implementation of the 
recommendations aiming at increasing emphasis on education and access to the media 
would permit the realization of the reforms envisioned by the new Constitution.  
</p>
<p>559. Azerbaijan referred to the adoption of the new Constitution and the successful 
parliamentary elections in 2008, which it believed were a clear testimony of the State&#8217;s 
determination to ensure fundamental freedoms. Azerbaijan also highlighted the 
establishment of a State commission on citizen&#8217;s complaints and the State&#8217;s efforts to 
implement better its international obligations and to bring its domestic legislation into 
compliance with international human rights standards. Azerbaijan noted that Turkmenistan 
was in the process of acceding to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It also noted with satisfaction 
that the issuance of a standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders was 
envisaged in the near future by the relevant authorities, and that the Government was 
conducting active discussions on the issue of cooperation with ICRC. Azerbaijan 
encouraged Turkmenistan to continue its efforts aimed at fully engaging in dialogue with 
the international human rights system and measures directed at speeding up the country&#8217;s 
democratic development. Azerbaijan called on the international community to give full 
support to the Government of Turkmenistan in its endeavours, including through technical 
assistance.  
</p>
<p>560. Pakistan welcomed the inauguration of a new era of democratic rule in 
Turkmenistan and commended the steps taken by the Government to promote and protect 
the human rights of all, including the adoption of the new Constitution, which guaranteed 
fundamental freedoms and civil and political rights. It hoped that a follow-up of legal and 
administrative measures would be conducted by the Government. Pakistan also mentioned 
as noteworthy the fact that Turkmenistan had accepted most of the recommendations made 
at the Working Group and was confident that concrete measures would be taken to </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>179 
</b></p>
<p>implement them. Pakistan also noted the initiation of the process to accede to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. Pakistan noted the commitment by Turkmenistan to intensify its cooperation with 
several special procedures and that the recent visit of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief was noteworthy.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>561. Action Canada for Population and Development commended the Government on the 
changes in its political system and the new Constitution. Noting the State&#8217;s commitment to 
cooperate with United Nations agencies and international organizations, it urged the 
Government to, inter alia, report publicly, accurately and comprehensively all health-related 
data, specifically to disclose information about the HIV situation in the country and provide 
access to treatment for people living with HIV, and adequate prevention services and 
information to the general public. With reference to recommendation 29 of the report, it 
called on the Government to review the official policy on infectious diseases and to allow 
for an objective assessment of the country&#8217;s situation, with a view to designing policies that 
would effectively guarantee the right of all Turkmen to the highest attainable level of 
health. It also requested the Government to clarify its position on recommendations 
contained in paragraphs 36 (b) and 40 (e), and called on the Government to repeal article 
135 of the national criminal code to decriminalize consensual same-sex behaviour among 
adults as, according to the Human Rights Committee, the criminalization of such acts 
constitutes a violation of article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which Turkmenistan is a party. It requested that the Government ensure that non-
governmental organizations, including those in the health sector and those supporting 
vulnerable groups, were able to register freely and operate without State interference or fear 
of reprisal.  
</p>
<p>562. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine noted the 
adoption of the new Constitution in September 2008, which established the primacy of 
international treaties over national Turkmen legislation. In this connection, it enquired 
about the measures taken by the Government to ensure that knowledge of international law 
was disseminated among magistrates and judges. 
</p><p>563. Human Rights Watch welcomed the review of Turkmenistan as an opportunity to 
foster positive change in the policies of one of the most repressive Governments in the 
world. It was encouraged by the acceptance of a number of recommendations, including 
against the harassment of journalists, religious communities and non-governmental 
organization registration, and urged the implementation of these recommendations as a 
matter of priority. It urged the Government to implement promptly the recommendation on 
cooperation with the special procedures that had requested an invitation. It also welcomed 
the State&#8217;s commitment to cooperate with ICRC, and called for the clear acceptance of the 
recommendation to allow ICRC to access places of detention and to prevent torture. 
Another area of concern raised during the review was the severe repression of civil society, 
with independent activists and journalists facing a constant threat of Government reprisal. 
Human Rights Watch urged the Government to fully implement the recommendations to 
actually protect human rights defenders from persecution and end restrictions on the media. 
It deeply regretted the decision of Turkmenistan to reject a number of recommendations. It 
commented on the unknown numbers of people languishing in Turkmen prisons following 
unfair trials, with at least two having taken place during President Berdymukhamedov&#8217;s 
rule. It added that some of the cases were well known, such as those of Mukhmetkuli 
Aymuradov, Annakurban Amanklychev, Sapardurdy Khajiev and Gulgeldy Annaniazov, 
and were raised during the Working Group session. Human Rights Watch stated that, while 
some individuals previously prevented from travelling abroad had now been able to travel, 
the system of restrictions de facto remained in place. It urged the Government to reconsider </p>


<p><b>180</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>its position on rejected recommendations and also urged its partners to help ensure adequate 
follow-up and implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>564. Amnesty International welcomed the State&#8217;s express support for recommendations 
to guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly; to seek, receive 
and impart information; to allow independent non-governmental organizations to register 
and work freely; and to end harassment and intimidation of journalists. It was deeply 
concerned about serious violations against human rights defenders, journalists and 
dissidents in Turkmenistan. It had received reports that the two members of the Turkmen 
Helsinki Foundation had their appeal for pardon rejected by the President in 2008 and that 
both had been tortured while in custody. Amnesty International regarded them as prisoners 
of conscience and urged their immediate release, as recommended during the review. It was 
also very concerned that there appeared to have been no independent investigation into the 
unexplained death in custody of their co-defendant Ogulsapar Muradova in September 
</p><p>2006. It urged Turkmenistan to reconsider the recommendation, made during the review 
(paragraph 29 (d) of the report), to hold an independent inquiry into her death. It also noted 
that recommendations made during the review were to be examined by Turkmenistan, 
including calls to protect human rights defenders, eradicate impunity for torture and other 
ill-treatment, and guarantee freedom of the press. Amnesty International urged the 
Government to indicate clearly its full support for these key recommendations and to ensure 
their prompt and full implementation. It also stated that earlier commitments of the new 
Government to carrying out reform to strengthen the protection of human rights were yet to 
be fully realized and called on the Government to use the opportunity of its review to live 
up to those promises.  
</p>
<p>565. With reference to the recommendations contained in paragraph 70 (12) of the report 
of the Working Group, Conscience and Peace Tax International noted, as a first step, the 
preparation of the legislation allowing conscientious objectors to perform unarmed military 
service. It encouraged Turkmenistan to make a careful study of international related 
standards, including the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee, and to bring the 
State&#8217;s legislation into line with them. It drew attention to Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 1998/77, in which the Commission called for instituting alternative services that 
were compatible with the reasons for the objection. It indicated that, while unarmed 
military service met the needs of those whose only objection was to personally bear arms, 
there were many whose conscience would not permit them to act in support of those who 
did. It stated that Turkmenistan should bear in mind the recommendation not to imprison 
conscientious objectors and that any repeated punishment constituted repeated punishment 
for the same offence.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>566. Turkmenistan expressed thanks for the recommendations, critical comments and 
constructive dialogue, and to the troika. Its policy was to pursue further the development 
and democratization of all aspects of civil society and the progressive strengthening of its 
system to protect human rights. With that aim, and with the support of international 
organizations, activities and consultations, efforts were being made to monitor existing 
legislation and to bring it into line with international instruments to which Turkmenistan 
was a party. Within the framework of activities of the Inter-Ministerial Commission, 
Turkmenistan planned to establish a permanent monitoring of the human rights situation 
and to develop a national programme on human rights. 
</p>
<p>567. Replying to Action Canada for Population and Development, the delegation pointed 
out that, concerning health care, under the new Constitution, as it also was under the 
previous one, all citizens of Turkmenistan, without exception, had access to health-care </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>181 
</b></p>
<p>services, and that more detailed information on that could be found in the national report to 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>568. Turkmenistan stated that all recommendations submitted by the delegations and 
international organizations at the review of Turkmenistan would be borne in mind in its 
future work aimed at progressively developing a human rights system. 
</p>
<p><b> 12. Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p>569. The review of Burkina Faso was held on 9 December 2008 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Burkina Faso in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/3). 
</p><p>570. At the 30th plenary meeting, on 19 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Burkina Faso (see section C below). 
571. The outcome of the review on Burkina Faso comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/80 and A/HRC/10/80/Corr.1), the 
views of Burkina Faso concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its 
voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>572. Burkina Faso thanked States for their participation in the interactive dialogue with 
the President of the Council, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, members of the 
troika and the secretariat of the Council. Burkina Faso noted that, during the interactive 
dialogue, most of the recommendations had been accepted and that replies had been given 
to the concerns expressed, although some issues would require further clarification.  
</p>
<p>573. With respect to adopting legislation to bring its national human rights institution into 
line with the Paris Principles, Burkina Faso indicated that there was currently a draft law 
being reviewed by the Council of Ministers before its introduction before Parliament.  
</p>
<p>574. Numerous recommendations called for the abolition of the death penalty and the 
ratification of the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights abolishing the death penalty. Agreeing to the need to abolish the death 
penalty and recalling that Burkina Faso was a de facto abolitionist country, it noted that it 
currently favoured the sensitization of elected representatives in order to guarantee the 
adoption of the draft law. 
</p>
<p>575. With regard to the concerns about the extrajudicial executions in Balpor&#233; and Pi&#233;la, 
Burkina Faso explained that legal procedures had been initiated and were under way, and 
that some people, including policemen, had been indicted. It wished, however, to avoid 
confusing the normal course of justice and impunity, which is when there is no action by 
the State. 
</p>
<p>576. Concerning the recommendations on legislative, administrative and other measures 
to be taken to combat violence against women and girls, Burkina Faso highlighted that such 
measures already existed and were implemented. Burkina Faso intended to strengthen these 
measures and step up its awareness-raising programme in order to root out harmful 
traditional practices, which still impede the full development of women of Burkina Faso.  </p>


<p><b>182</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>577. Regarding polygamy, Burkina Faso noted that polygamist marriage was optional 
whereas monogamy was the rule. It added that, as one of the secular aspects of the culture 
of Burkina Faso, its elimination would require an awareness-raising campaign, otherwise it 
would force people to practise it illegally.  
</p>
<p>578. With regard to women&#8217;s participation in decision-making bodies, Burkina Faso 
indicated that it had adopted a draft law on quotas, taking into account a representation 
level of 30 per cent of either gender for local and legislative elections.  
</p>
<p>579. With regard to the concerns devoted to the rights of indigenous peoples in Burkina 
Faso, the delegation noted that the Government was not discriminating or marginalizing 
any ethnic group on a political, economic, social or cultural level. It indicated that there was 
no ethnic group historically marginalized in the country. Burkina Faso stated that it was 
devoted to promoting all cultures, to ensuring that, despite the shortage of resources, all 
regions of the country would benefit from balanced socio-economic development. It 
underscored that the difficulties linked to health, education, and the condition of women 
and children were not specific to any ethnic group.  
</p>
<p>580. Burkina Faso indicated that, despite the numerous social and economic constraints 
and the adversity of nature, the weight of certain traditions and culture that were not always 
in line with human rights, the promotion and protection of human rights were an ongoing 
and irreversible struggle. The challenges were still numerous and Burkina Faso indicated 
that it would therefore appreciate any support designed to help it implement the 
recommendations made in the framework of the universal periodic review from the 
international community, and thanked in particular Argentina and Brazil in that regard, as 
they had already expressed their willingness to assist Burkina Faso. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>581. Algeria warmly thanked the delegation of Burkina Faso and its head for the 
presentation of the outcome of the universal periodic review. Algeria noted that the good 
quality of the national report of Burkina Faso had allowed Algeria to assess the significant 
progress made in various aspects of human rights since its independence, despite the 
numerous challenges. Algeria encouraged Burkina Faso, as a developing country with 
limited resources, to continue its efforts to implement the commitments mentioned in its 
national report. It called on the international community to support Burkina Faso in meeting 
its challenges.  
</p>
<p>582. The United States of America appreciated the comprehensive approach taken by 
Burkina Faso in the preparation of its national report. It noted that Burkina Faso had 
arrested and sentenced several practitioners of female genital mutilation and their 
accomplices, and welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to eradicate female genital 
mutilation fully and to share best practices with other countries. The United States viewed 
the Government&#8217;s new anti-trafficking law as a positive development. It noted the work of 
the Ministry of Human Rights, especially with regard to its educational campaigns. It 
supported the State&#8217;s request for appropriate international community and OHCHR 
technical assistance in consolidating human rights advancements on the ground.  
</p>
<p>583. Senegal praised the commitments of Burkina Faso to the promotion and protection 
of human rights, and welcomed with great satisfaction the acceptance of most of the 
recommendations made during the discussions of the Working Group. Senegal did not 
doubt the State&#8217;s willingness to implement them, and was convinced that this would 
contribute to further guarantee the full enjoyment of human rights in the country, 
particularly in relation to the rights to health and to education. Senegal appreciated the 
efforts already made by Burkina Faso in the national context to take on board the concerns 
expressed during the discussions of the Working Group. Senegal wished the Government of </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>183 
</b></p>
<p>Burkina Faso every success in implementing those recommendations and called on the 
international community to provide any assistance Burkina Faso would need in this regard.   
</p>
<p>584. Nigeria welcomed the acceptance by Burkina Faso of most of the recommendations 
made to it and its pledge to implement them. Nigeria recalled that, during the review of 
Burkina Faso, it had commended the laudable achievements made by the country in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, particularly in the areas of primary education of 
the girl-child and the fight against female genital mutilation. Nigeria looked forward to the 
improvement of human rights records in Burkina Faso in the second cycle of the review, 
and called on the international community to assist Burkina Faso in its efforts to fulfil its 
human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>585. Cameroon welcomed the presence at the adoption meeting of the Minister for the 
Promotion of Human Rights of Burkina Faso, whose devotion to human rights had been 
constant. Cameroon stated that the State&#8217;s commitment to establish a real culture of human 
rights had been shown at the review in December 2008. It indicated that numerous 
challenges had still to be met, but had no doubt as to the success to come and called on the 
international community to help Burkina Faso to meet its objectives in the field of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>586. Brazil welcomed the presence of the Minister for the Promotion of Human Rights of 
Burkina Faso, whose speech confirmed the will of Burkina Faso expressed during the 
interactive dialogue of the Working Group to the full promotion and protection of human 
rights in the country. Brazil noted, however, the challenges ahead, as acknowledged in the 
national report of Burkina Faso (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/1, para. 95). Brazil noted that the 
international community was responsible for demonstrating its will to give the necessary 
support to help Burkina Faso to implement the recommendations presented during the 
Working Group discussions. On the basis of its capacity and good practice, Brazil 
expressed its commitment to assist Burkina Faso to that end.   
</p>
<p>587. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire thanked the delegation of Burkina Faso for its presentation, which 
reflected the importance given by the country to human rights in general and to the 
universal periodic review in particular. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted with satisfaction that Burkina 
Faso had agreed to most of the recommendations made in the Working Group in December 
</p><p>2008. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire stressed the need to give the necessary support to Burkina Faso, 
helping it in the tremendous amount of reform it needed to carry out to ensure the rule of 
law in a modern democracy. 
</p>
<p>588. Djibouti welcomed the presence of the Minister at the adoption session and 
appreciated the open approach and the constructive attitude prevailing during the review of 
Burkina Faso. Djibouti praised the commitments expressed by Burkina Faso for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. It noted that most concerns and 
recommendations formulated during the interactive dialogue of 9 December 2008 had 
received appropriate responses, and stated that financial resources and technical assistance 
would be appropriate to follow up on certain recommendations. Djibouti expressed the 
hope that attention would be paid to the State&#8217;s appeal for assistance.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>589. Action Canada for Population and Development congratulated Burkina Faso on the 
efforts made to promote human rights and for the consultations held in the framework of 
the universal periodic review. Under paragraph 44 of the Working Group report, it 
reminded Burkina Faso of the need to expedite the building of new reform centres in order 
to improve detention conditions of detainees, as well as to improving education and social 
reintegration of children in conflict with the law. It recalled paragraph 49 of the Working 
Group report concerning the need to mobilize further civil society stakeholders and involve </p>


<p><b>184</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>them in activities to combat female genital mutilation and HIV/AIDS; such a mobilization 
would help reduce the number of HIV/AIDS infections. It stressed the importance of 
disseminating information on the law to combat excision in rural areas and to have this law 
translated into the various local languages. In reference to the Working Group report, 
Action Canada for Population and Development reminded Burkina Faso to step up its 
efforts to include information on human rights in school programmes and to provide youth 
workers with human rights education and training material in order to promote human 
rights education through youth centres.  
</p>
<p>590. Franciscans International welcomed the recommendations concerning trafficking in 
persons accepted by Burkina Faso. It noted the State&#8217;s commitment to intensifying its 
efforts in combating trafficking in women and girls for the purposes of sexual exploitation. 
It stated that trafficking in persons in Burkina Faso also took place for the purposes of 
forced labour, mainly involving children. It indicated that an overall approach to trafficking 
was required, and should be based on the effective implementation of the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
ratified by Burkina Faso. It also noted that Burkina Faso was a country of origin, transit and 
destination for trafficking in persons in rural and urban areas. In addition to stepping up its 
national plan of action, as recommended during the universal periodic review, it highlighted 
the need to apply a regional strategy for combating trafficking in human beings, particularly 
through the effective implementation of the agreements reached on 6 July 2006 in Abuja. 
Fanciscans International encouraged Burkina Faso to invite the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons and urged it to reconsider rejecting the recommendations calling for 
extending a standing invitation to all special procedures mandate holders. It noted that the 
mismanagement of the agricultural sector was one of the reasons for the severe impact of 
the food crisis on Burkina Faso in 2008. Recalling the State&#8217;s commitment to continue its 
efforts to consolidate economic, social and cultural rights, it encouraged the Government to 
pay particular attention to the right to food and recommended that it set up a national body 
to analyse the causes and consequences of the food crisis and to develop guidelines that 
would constitute a framework programme.  
</p>
<p>591. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues noted the numerous 
commitments made by Burkina Faso in the Working Group report, in particular in 
paragraphs 7 to 33. It however deplored the fact that most of the recommendations not 
accepted by Burkina Faso regarded areas of serious concern for the people of Burkina Faso. 
It noted in particular that the recommendation on the independence of justice mentioned in 
paragraph 58 (a) had been rejected, whereas the impediments to the independence and good 
functioning of the judiciary remained considerable, leading to a crisis of confidence in this 
connection. It also noted that the recommendations on the freedom of the press had not 
been accepted by Burkina Faso either. It stressed that, at the beginning of 2009, a number 
of journalists had been threatened because of their investigations into the financial dealings 
of certain public officials. It called on Burkina Faso to take into account all of the 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review, and in particular to guarantee 
the independence of the judiciary, freedom of expression through a free and independent 
press, to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to adopt a law abolishing the death penalty and commuting all death sentences 
already pronounced to alternative penalties and to allow special procedures mandate 
holders to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>592. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine stated that 
the people of Burkina Faso were known to be free and honest and that the Government had 
made the promotion of human rights the focus of its national policy and its legal and 
normative approach. It noted that the Constitution of Burkina Faso proclaims peoples&#8217; 
rights and duties, and congratulated Burkina Faso on being at the forefront of positions </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>185 
</b></p>
<p>defended by it, namely that human rights and duties were indivisible and must be promoted 
conjointly. It indicated that the concept of human duty had been long forgotten by the 
Council, and requested Burkina Faso to assist in the adoption of a draft universal 
declaration on the duties of the human being. It expressed the hope that Burkina Faso 
would spare no effort to implement the conclusions and recommendations formulated 
during the course of the dialogue.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>593. Burkina Faso reiterated its thanks to the members of the troika &#8212; Madagascar, 
Qatar and Switzerland &#8212; and to all States and stakeholders that had participated in the 
discussion. It reaffirmed the will of Burkina Faso to implement the recommendations it 
accepted mentioned in the Working Group report. 
</p>
<p>594. Owing to time constraints, Burkina Faso referred some States and stakeholders to its 
national report (A/HRC/WG.6/3/BFA/1) and to the Working Group report (A/HRC/10/80 
and A/HRC/10/80/Corr.1). As to the recommendation of issuing a standing invitation to 
special procedures mandate holders, Burkina Faso had always cooperated with the special 
procedures and the African special mechanisms and would always carefully consider such 
invitations. As to mismanagement of the agricultural campaign, Burkina Faso indicated that 
the crop season had been excellent and managed to the full satisfaction of rural workers and 
farmers. With regard to freedom of the press, Burkina Faso reaffirmed that the freedom of 
the press was recognized and respected. Regarding death threats to journalists and reporters 
issued on the Internet, Burkina Faso indicated that it was doing its best to find the culprits 
and that it would appreciate any information in this regard. As to the abolition of the death 
penalty, Burkina Faso indicated that it was currently under study and believed that, at the 
next universal periodic review, it would have already become a de jure abolitionist State.  
</p><p>595. Burkina Faso stated that the universal periodic review was an important stage in the 
ongoing and irreversible human rights process. It underscored that Burkina Faso was ready 
to hold discussion with all stakeholders to make progress in human rights and was open to 
all criticism and constructive proposals.  
</p>
<p>596. Burkina Faso reiterated its commitment to permanently and irreversibly promote and 
protect human rights. Together with the support of the international community and the 
civil society, Burkina Faso was convinced that human rights would progressively develop 
in their effectiveness. Therefore, it asked the Council for technical assistance, in particular 
regarding the implementation of the rights to education, including human rights education; 
health and sanitation; housing; information to rural populations; capacity strengthening of 
the Ministry of Justice in order to improve prison conditions, even though enormous efforts 
had already been made to make the judiciary independent; the rights of women and 
children; and the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>597. Burkina Faso added that it was already cooperating with other countries in the 
region to combat trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, and that concrete measures 
had been taken to fight this scourge. Burkina Faso had ratified various international human 
rights instruments in that regard and its national law already sanctioned trafficking in 
children. 
</p>
<p><b> 13. Cape Verde 
</b></p>
<p>598. The review of Cape Verde was held on 10 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the compilation 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/CPV/2); and 
the summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/3/CPV/3). </p>


<p><b>186</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>599. At its 31st meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Cape Verde (see section C below). 
</p><p>600. The outcome of the review on Cape Verde comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/81), the views of Cape Verde 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>601. The representative of Cape Verde reiterated the resolve of the Government to pursue 
the process of the universal periodic review. He thanked all delegations that had intervened 
in the interactive dialogue in December 2008, making relevant comments and 
recommendations, which had allowed an in-depth analysis of the human rights situation in 
the country.  
</p>
<p>602. Cape Verde stated that, as underlined in December, the Constitution enshrined the 
absolute character of the dignity of the human being and ensured that all Cape Verdean 
citizens enjoy rights and freedoms, including the right to life and integrity, the right to 
participate in political life and to exercise rights inherent to citizenship. The Constitution 
also recognized the rights of foreign residents and foreigners temporarily living in the 
country, protected the right to work and the right not to be the subject of discrimination, as 
well as economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>603. Cape Verde had acceded to the main international human rights instruments, such as 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Optional 
Protocols on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict, and the Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children. 
</p>
<p>604. With regard to the recommendations contained in the Working Group report 
(A/HRC/10/81), the representative for Cape Verde stated that recommendations 11, 12, 15, 
24, 38, 40, 41, 45, 47, 49 and 50 had been accepted and measures for their implementation 
would be taken as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>605. Regarding recommendations 1, 13, 18 and 22, he noted that the State&#8217;s domestic 
legislation already prohibited all forms of violence by law enforcement officials, and that 
the monitoring and follow-up of relevant provisions would continue.  
</p>
<p>606. As far as recommendations 2, 16, 19, 21, 28 and 48 were concerned, the State&#8217;s 
judicial system had already adopted a number of instruments for the protection of the right 
of the child and minors, in particular a new criminal code, adopted in 2004, which notably 
repressed violence within the family circle. 
</p>
<p>607. With regard to recommendations 3, 8, 14, 42 and 43, the Government of Cape Verde 
was in the process of implementing a national plan of action against gender violence for the 
period 2009&#8211;2011. The plan included provisions for the integration of foreign women, and 
against all forms of violence, including trafficking.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>187 
</b></p>
<p>608. The Government would also commence or finalize the process of accession or 
ratification of international instruments as mentioned in recommendations 6, 7, 25, 26, 27, 
31 and 39.  
</p>
<p>609. With regard to recommendations 9 and 29, the Government had already adopted 
decree-law No. 2/2006, on 27 November 2006, on protection measures in the social and 
education fields, with a view to educating minors, for their dignified and responsible 
insertion into society. A status law on children and adolescents was being elaborated.  
</p>
<p>610. The Government would pursue its efforts to implement recommendations 10, 18, 22 
and 35. A vast reform programme on the penitentiary system, which included training for 
prison officers and the inauguration of two new detention centres, would solve prison 
overcrowding problems.  
</p>
<p>611. With regard to recommendations 20, 23, 30, 31, 33, 37 and 44, the representative of 
Cape Verde reiterated that all instruments of the domestic legislation guaranteed equality 
between men and women and prohibited all forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>612. Concerning recommendation 34, he noted that the action of the Government was 
guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the relevant ILO conventions and the 
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Indeed, the most recent legislation 
on labour had set the minimum age for admission to work at 15 years.  
</p>
<p>613. The Government of Cape Verde had not recorded any allegations of discrimination 
against the groups mentioned in recommendation 36. Domestic legislation neither forbade 
nor repressed individual behaviours, unless minors were involved.  
</p>
<p>614. The Government had already taken action with regard to the contents of 
recommendations 4, 17 and 46. In conclusion, all recommendations made in the report of 
the Working Group had been accepted, with the exception of recommendations 5 and 32, 
which the Government would continue to examine.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>615. Algeria thanked Cape Verde for the information provided in addition to the 
presentation made to the Working Group in December 2008. Algeria expressed 
appreciation for the efforts made by the authorities to promote human rights domestically, 
and encouraged them to persist in this effort.  
</p>
<p>616. Senegal thanked Cape Verde for its clear presentation and for accepting several 
recommendations made during the review. Senegal stated that the efforts made by Cape 
Verde for the consolidation of its achievements and for the improvement of the rights of its 
citizens deserved its praise and encouragement. Senegal wished the authorities of Cape 
Verde full success in their resolute efforts to ensure that effective consideration was given 
to the rights of the child and women, as well as to the elimination of poverty, the promotion 
of education and health. Senegal expressed its hope that the international community would 
provide Cape Verde with support in its efforts to continue to improve the human rights 
situation.  
</p>
<p>617. Brazil welcomed the openness and the constructive spirit of Cape Verde during the 
review process and its commitment to the full realization of all human rights. Brazil 
highlighted the steps taken and aims of Cape Verde, as stated in the report of the Working 
Group, in the fight against sexual exploitation and ill-treatment of children, as well as 
juvenile justice. Brazil commended Cape Verde for the enactment of the new penal process 
code and the new labour code. Brazil stated its confidence that Cape Verde would continue 
to overcome its main challenges in the field of human rights, along with the objective to 
reach sustainable development and combat poverty. In a constructive and cooperative spirit, </p>


<p><b>188</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>Brazil reiterated its recommendations and highlighted that it was ready to cooperate with 
Cape Verde in the areas the country deemed most necessary and appropriate. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>618. Conectas Direitos Humanos, with the support of the Cape Verdean Women Jurists&#8217; 
Association, expressed regret that Cape Verde had failed to submit a written report and to 
engage in a broad consultation process during the interactive dialogue of the review. It 
conveyed its hope that, for the next cycle, these aspects would be improved. Despite this 
regret, Conectas stressed its appreciation for the efforts made to strengthen democracy and 
human rights, to decrease illiteracy and child mortality rates. It urged Cape Verde to 
continue improvements in women&#8217;s rights, especially in the area of law reform, to accept 
the recommendations made by France and Slovenia with regard to violence against women, 
and to reflect such changes in its penal code. 
</p>
<p>619. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine expressed its 
appreciation for the fact that life expectancy in Cape Verde had risen, but it questioned the 
disparities between life expectancy for men and women. It recommended that Cape Verde 
undertake a global study to explain such disparity and also address the connection between 
life expectancy and the effective enjoyment of human rights. It invited all States Members 
of the Council to cooperate in the realization of this study. 
</p>
<p>620. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network congratulated the country for accepting 
recommendations dealing with programmes to combat HIV/AIDS and promoting greater 
tolerance for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered community. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>621. The representative of Cape Verde stated that the Government was committed to 
continue its cooperation and constructive dialogue with all national and international 
institutions for the reinforcement of human rights in the country. The lack of financial 
resources was the main obstacle that prevented further action in the implementation of 
recommendations, such as human rights education. This obstacle was also affecting the 
struggle for the eradication of poverty, access to water, improving health and satisfying 
other basic needs of the population. The States that made recommendations had good 
mutual relationships with Cape Verde and the Government was relying on them since, 
without their support, it would be difficult to achieve further results. 
</p>
<p><b> 14. Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>622. The review of Colombia was held on 10 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Colombia in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/COL/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/COL/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/COL/3). 
</p><p>623. At the 31st meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Colombia (see section C below). 
624. The outcome of the review on Colombia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/82), the views of Colombia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/10/82/Add.1). </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>189 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>625. The delegation of Colombia thanked Member States and the troika members for 
their active role in its review. Colombia recalled its involvement in the institution-building 
process of the United Nations human rights system, saying it had great faith in 
multilateralism, which reflected the democratic values on which the structures of the 
Colombian State were founded. 
</p>
<p>626. The universal periodic review process had led the country&#8217;s institutions to reflect 
deeply on finding better ways to coordinate efforts to guarantee the rights of all in the 
country. The process of reporting had given Colombia an opportunity to hear the voices of 
social organizations and local authorities, strengthen coordination between institutions, 
review practices, identify achievements and shortcomings and plan for the immediate 
future. It noted the concerns and recommendations made by States and reminded delegates 
that Colombia had accepted most of the recommendations. Over the past three months, the 
Government had undertaken a detailed review of the voluntary commitments made by 
Colombia and the recommendations accepted, enabling it to assign responsibilities and set 
targets. As of 10 June 2009, the webpage of the Presidential human rights programme 
would carry a report on follow-up to the implementation of recommendations and 
commitments. The webpage would be updated every four months. 
</p>
<p>627. The efforts made by Colombia since its review included extending official 
invitations in January to the special rapporteurs on extrajudicial executions, the rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples and the independence of judges and lawyers, 
as well as to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights 
defenders. Colombia had also voluntarily accepted implementation of the mechanism to 
supervise and present reports contained in Security Council resolution 1612 (2005) on 
children and armed conflict. The high-level inter-sectoral commission that defined the 
Government&#8217;s public policy on preventing the recruitment of children had produced a 
report of its first year activities for the United Nations task force on this mechanism. 
Colombia also continued to work with the international community in following up on the 
implementation of the recommendations made by OHCHR in 2008. 
</p>
<p>628. The delegation said Colombia had strengthened its fight against crime and all forms 
of violence. New legislation had been enacted and new practices to prevent violations by 
law enforcement officials had been developed, including public accountability for 
complaints received. Strict measures had been taken with regard to the repeated complaints 
on murders by such officials, and no further complaints had been received since October 
</p><p>2008.  
</p>
<p>629. Progress had also been made in eliminating anti-personnel mines through 
humanitarian demining operations. Work continued in strengthening the justice system and 
eliminating impunity. In recent weeks, the President had approved a new law on 
intelligence gathering, establishing mechanisms to ensure transparency. Efforts to guarantee 
economic, social and cultural rights continued, particularly in the spheres of health and 
education. 
</p>
<p>630. The report of the Inter-American Press Society for 2008 acknowledged the progress 
made in providing guarantees for the exercise of journalism in Colombia. The delegation 
cited the decision by the Constitutional Court, as a result of complaints by civil society, to 
grant equal treatment, in terms of rights and responsibilities before the law, to same-sex 
unions. The decision represented significant progress towards overcoming discrimination. 
</p>
<p>631. Such progress did not mean that the State was unaware of the enormous challenges 
that still existed. The Government shared the Council&#8217;s concerns about the persistence of 
the phenomenon of internal displacement in Colombia. The efforts of national institutions </p>


<p><b>190</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>were focused on reviewing prevention and protection strategies to resolve this difficult 
situation. The Constitutional Court had introduced important developments, addressing 
vulnerable sectors such as indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, children, people 
with disabilities and displaced women. It assured the Council that no resources had been 
spared to tackle this issue, but challenges remained. 
</p>
<p>632. On indigenous communities and their right to life, physical integrity and their 
territory, Colombia noted the massacre in February 2009 of 80 members of the Awa 
indigenous community by the FARC, who wanted to keep the coca plantations in the Awa 
territory. In recovering one of the bodies, 50 anti-personnel mines had to be deactivated. 
</p>
<p>633. Colombia was also concerned about complaints relating to threats and harassment of 
human rights defenders. The Government has asked the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s Office to do 
its best to establish the facts, and to identify and punish those responsible. It hoped that 
dialogue with civil society would help identify effective measures to work together towards 
establishing the right climate for the work of human rights defenders. The Government 
reiterated its conviction that dialogue with and the participation of civil society 
strengthened the enjoyment of human rights in Colombia. 
</p><p>634. Colombia had faced grave threats against its institutions and population with a 
security policy that was compatible with human rights. The universal period review had 
allowed Colombia to share its achievements and challenges. Its achievements were the 
result of efforts by Colombia&#8217;s people, civil society organizations and institutions, and the 
international community, which they also counted on in overcoming the remaining 
challenges in putting an end to violence and organized crime. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>635. The Russian Federation thanked Colombia for its exhaustive and focused approach 
to the issues that it had raised during the review, adding that this attentive and respectful 
attitude could serve as an example. It noted that Colombia&#8217;s main efforts to combat poverty 
were especially significant during the present economic crisis. Colombia&#8217;s voluntary 
commitments to human rights protection had led it to establish a national control 
mechanism for their implementation, a fact that testified to the State&#8217;s firm intention to 
meet high standards of human rights promotion and protection. It expressed respect for 
Colombia&#8217;s great desire to combat the challenges it faced and was convinced by the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure human rights protection and the well-being of its people. 
</p>
<p>636. Brazil welcomed Colombia&#8217;s transparency and constructive spirit in participating in 
the universal periodic review, a sign of its resolve to engage in dialogue and cooperation 
with the United Nations in the field of human rights, which should serve as an example. It 
was also a clear signal of Colombia&#8217;s desire to overcome outstanding challenges. Brazil 
supported Colombia&#8217;s efforts to implement review recommendations by identifying the 
challenges, and noted that it was time for Member States to demonstrate their desire to help 
others in overcoming such challenges. 
</p>
<p>637. The Netherlands commended Colombia&#8217;s strong commitment to the universal 
periodic review process, including its written responses to questions. It welcomed the 
acknowledgement that security forces were responsible for unlawfully killing civilians and 
that steps were being taken by the Government to address these extrajudicial executions. It 
encouraged the Government to ensure that all cases of human rights violations implicating 
the security forces were investigated by the civilian justice system. Noting that Colombia&#8217;s 
voluntary commitments include addressing impunity and guaranteeing access for justice, 
especially in remote and rural areas, it wished to learn more about progress made in this 
regard. It appreciated the Government&#8217;s willingness to engage in constructive dialogue with 
human rights non-governmental organizations, highlighting the recommendations made in </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>191 
</b></p>
<p>this regard. It commended the establishment of a follow-up procedure by the Government, 
suggesting that it give mid-term updates to the Council. 
</p>
<p>638. Spain commended Colombia&#8217;s special interest in the universal periodic review, its 
acceptance of more than 60 recommendations, its individual replies to questions put during 
the review process, its high-level commitment and particularly for the many important 
voluntary commitments. Spain expressed concern about threats to human rights defenders, 
particularly against the Colombian Commission of Jurists, and commended the Government 
for the voluntary commitments made relative to paragraph 91 of the Working Group report. 
</p>
<p>639. The United States of America welcomed Colombia&#8217;s constructive dialogue with 
non-governmental organizations. It joined the Special Rapporteur on human rights 
defenders in strongly supporting civil society efforts to use the universal periodic review as 
a tool for advocacy and accountability. It appreciated Colombia&#8217;s voluntary commitment to 
improve protection for the rights of reporters, trade unionists and human rights defenders, 
adding that prosecution of crimes against them and establishment of a rule of law 
environment for their operation would strengthen security and peace in Colombia. It 
acknowledged the challenges that Colombia faced, particularly violence by illegally armed 
groups. It called on Colombia to continue confronting violence and abuses in conformity 
with its human rights and international humanitarian obligations. Welcoming efforts to 
battle impunity and seek remedies for victims, it encouraged the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to transparent investigations and due process for all accused perpetrators. It 
recommended that Colombia work to prevent and fully prosecute extrajudicial killings, 
forced disappearances and forced displacements, and supported efforts to strengthen the 
national plan for the search for missing persons. 
</p>
<p>640. Switzerland thanked the Government for its commitment and noted how important it 
was that the Colombian parliament adopt a law on victims complying with international 
standards to provide guaranteed access to justice and adequate reparations for all victims, 
including victims of actions by State representatives. While recognizing the efforts made to 
combat murder of civilians by members of law enforcement authorities, it supported 
OHCHR recommendations for greater operational control and for effective, impartial 
investigations to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. It called for a full 
investigation of the murder of Edwin Legarda, husband of the indigenous representative 
Aida Quilque, who had, a few days prior to the murder, participated in the review of 
Colombia in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>641. Belgium stated that Colombia had participated constructively in its universal 
periodic review and hoped the implementation of recommendations accepted by the 
Government would help improve the human rights situation. It welcomed the decision to 
accept visits from various special rapporteurs and the commitment to continue cooperating 
with OHCHR, including in the implementation of recommendations. It acknowledged the 
steps taken to put an end to human rights violations, but noted that considerable challenges 
remained. It encouraged the Government to guarantee, in the framework of ongoing 
legislative proposals, access to justice and the right to reparations in a non-discriminatory 
manner in conformity with international norms. 
</p>
<p>642. France welcomed Colombia&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendation to ratify the 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, encouraging 
further efforts to enable it to enter into force soon. It regretted that Colombia did not intend 
to recognize the jurisdiction of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, since this key 
innovative element would have an important preventive effect. It asked Colombia to 
reconsider and accept its jurisdiction. It also noted that the fight against impunity should be 
prioritized and invited Colombia to reconsider its refusal to accept the jurisdiction of the 
International Criminal Court for war crimes. It urged the Government to reconsider its 
refusal to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. </p>


<p><b>192</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>643. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s positive engagement in the universal periodic review, but added that 
concerns had continued to emerge in its aftermath. It noted the killing of Edwin Legarda, 
extending its condolences to Aida Quilque and calling on Colombia to ensure justice and 
accountability for those responsible. It strongly condemned the massacre in February 2009 
of 27 members of the vulnerable Awa indigenous community by the FARC. Noting with 
concern the continuing threats against trade unionists and others, it said those responsible 
must be vigorously pursued and brought to justice. It urged authorities to do their utmost to 
promote and protect the roles of human rights defenders, journalists, civil society 
organizations, trade unionists and those who represent the most vulnerable, including the 
indigenous population. Defenders should not be stigmatized, officially or otherwise. The 
United Kingdom would continue working with international partners and civil society to 
maintain the positive momentum of the review process in helping Colombia address the 
threat of illegal armed groups and to bring lasting and robust improvements in human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>644. Guatemala commended Colombia&#8217;s positive attitude to the recommendations made. 
It noted the constant challenges that existed for both Colombia and itself, and welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to improving the human rights of its citizens and the openness 
and cooperation shown to treaty bodies, mandate holders and to the Council and its various 
bodies generally. It also welcomed the detailed replies it received to the questions and 
suggestions made. 
</p>
<p>645. China thanked Colombia for its frank, open and constructive attitude to the universal 
periodic review in the presentation of its efforts, achievements and challenges in human 
rights promotion and protection. It welcomed Colombia&#8217;s serious answers and written 
replies to questions raised by States, including China, and the establishment of follow-up 
mechanisms to implement the accepted recommendations. It was convinced that, in the 
light of specific conditions in the country, the Government would overcome difficulties and 
make new achievements in human rights. 
</p>
<p>646. Panama welcomed Colombia&#8217;s replies to questions and recommendations, 
congratulating the Government and civil society on the high quality review, which was 
open, with dialogue, responsibility and great commitment. Panama highlighted Colombia&#8217;s 
establishment of a procedure for follow-up of recommendations accepted and the voluntary 
commitments made. Panama was convinced that the universal periodic review would 
become a practical instrument, serving to continually improve and inspire States like 
Colombia to design and implement mechanisms, enabling progress on the basis of the 
recommendations and by assessing national policies. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>647. The Colombian Commission of Jurists and the World Organization against Torture 
dedicated their statement, on behalf of 1,200 Colombian organizations, to Edwin Legarda, 
who was murdered after his wife participated in the Working Group discussions in 
December 2008. It highlighted the violations of both humanitarian law and human rights 
committed by the guerrilla and the State&#8217;s lack of compliance with its human rights 
obligations and commitments. It noted the human rights issues raised during the review and 
which persisted in Colombia, including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, 
torture, sexual violence, recruitment of children and forced displacement, violations that 
particularly affect indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities, women and 
children. It stressed that paramilitaries linked to the authorities had not been dismantled and 
were benefiting from impunity; the executive meddled in the judicial branch; victims had 
not received compensation owing to the many failures in the implementation of the justice 
and peace law; increased harassment of human rights defenders, unionists and journalists </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>193 
</b></p>
<p>by high-ranking officials; that inequalities had not decreased; and there were no guarantees 
of the rights to health, education, food and adequate housing for many. It hoped the 
Government&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations would result in serious measures and called 
for acceptance of all the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>648. The World Organization against Torture, on behalf of Human Rights First, Front 
Line and the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, stated that the 
treatment of human rights defenders emerged as a key theme of the review, demonstrating 
their precarious situation in Colombia. It welcomed Colombia&#8217;s acceptance of 
recommendations in this regard and its commitment to provide guarantees and protection 
measures for human rights defenders to carry out their work. It stated that defenders, 
however, continued to pay a heavy price, condemning the assassination of Edwin Legarda. 
It urged Colombia&#8217;s adoption of the many recommendations to acknowledge the legitimacy 
of human rights advocacy, but said senior officials continued to falsely label defenders as 
terrorists. It called on the President to issue and enforce a directive prohibiting public 
officials from making false imputations that compromised the security or reputation of 
defenders. It expressed grave concern about the numerous threats and attacks against 
defenders, such as the recent death threats against a member of the Colombian Commission 
of Jurists. It urged Colombia to address the serious problem of baseless criminal 
prosecutions of defenders, saying the Prosecutor-General should pass a resolution enabling 
his human rights unit to review all criminal investigations against human rights defenders in 
line with fundamental due process standards. It urged Colombia to immediately release 
from prison defenders who remained unjustly detained. 
</p><p>649. The World Federation of Trade Unions welcomed statements recommending that 
Colombia protect unionists, human rights defenders, women, displaced persons, journalists, 
children, indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants. It welcomed Colombia&#8217;s acceptance of 
many recommendations, but expressed concern at the increasing number of crimes against 
unionists, from 37 in 2007 to 45 in 2008. In 2009, seven workers had been murdered and 
two had disappeared. It added that indigenous communities continued to be threatened, 
citing a number of threats of social cleansing at the entrance of the Wayuu communities at 
the Guajira department. It noted that the establishment of unions could entail serious 
reprisals, citing the sacking of 22 workers in Cartagena in February 2009 for considering 
unionizing.  
</p>
<p>650. The Social Service Agency of the Protestant Church in Germany, also on behalf of 
OIDHACO, stated that interventions during Colombia&#8217;s review reflected the gravity of the 
situation. It hoped the Council would create effective mechanisms to follow up on 
recommendations beyond the voluntary submissions by reviewed States and without 
waiting for years. It added that the armed conflict had led to disturbing levels of 
degradation caused by all the armed stakeholders, citing the massacre by the FARC of 18 
indigenous Awa in Nari&#241;o in February 2009. It highlighted the high number of extrajudicial 
executions by armed forces and was disturbed by the Government&#8217;s underestimation of the 
seriousness of the situation. It noted the telephone tapping by Colombian information 
services against magistrates of the Supreme Court, members of the opposition, human 
rights defenders and journalists. It also cited the extradition of 17 paramilitary commanders 
as a serious obstacle to justice, preventing important revelations from emerging if they had 
been questioned in Colombia. It added that high-ranking officials&#8217; declarations against 
journalists, rights defenders and unionists resulted in serious threats against them. 
</p><p>651. International PEN and the World Press Freedom Committee welcomed Colombia&#8217;s 
commitments in relation to journalists, including improving guarantees of their rights; 
encouraging investigations of crimes against them; and fostering a culture in which it was 
easier for journalists to work. They noted with satisfaction that there had been no deadly 
attacks on print journalists in Colombia in 2008, unlike the preceding two years, but were </p>


<p><b>194</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>alarmed by the high number of those who continued to be threatened and intimidated in 
relation to their work. They asked that Colombia provide journalists who are threatened and 
attacked with adequate guarantees of their safety, urging the Government to take measures 
ensuring that such journalists were not further endangered by comments made by public 
officials that could exacerbate threats and violence against them. The State must not only 
encourage investigations of such crimes but ensure that such prompt, independent, thorough 
and impartial investigations are held. The pertinent institutions must speed up outstanding 
investigations and bring to justice those who had committed crimes against journalists. 
</p><p>652. Conscience and Peace Tax International noted that Colombia rejected the 
recommendation to recognize the right of conscientious objection to military service. It 
reminded Colombia that no domestic legislation or constitutional provisions could override 
its international treaty obligations, and that article 93 of the Constitution stated that such 
obligations had priority over domestic law. It cited the decision of the Human Rights 
Committee in 2006 that conscientious objection to military service was a protected 
manifestation of religious belief under article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. With specific reference to Colombia, in a 2008 opinion concerning cases 
of forcible recruitment, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had found all three 
cases to constitute arbitrary detention. With regard to two conscientious objectors, it 
believed that their recruitment was in breach of article 18 of the International Covenant and 
a clear violation of their affirmation of conscience. It called on Colombia to urgently 
reconsider its position on this issue. 
</p>
<p>653. Action Canada for Population and Development stated that the Colombian court 
decision giving homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual couples remained a 
dead letter. It noted also the non-implementation of a Human Rights Committee decision 
that a homosexual man should be allowed to receive his partner&#8217;s pension. Regarding 
police abuses, it supported OHCHR comments on the murders of transvestites and 
supported statements by the World Organization against Torture on crimes against 
transvestites. It called on the Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n to create a specific unit for hate 
crimes. It also raised concerns about intersex children, who were dismissed from school and 
even sent away by their families. It called on Colombia to accept the recommendation by 
the Czech Republic that it provide funds to implement court decisions, establish a follow-
up plan for the implementation of human rights and develop policies ensuring equality for 
gays and lesbians. 
</p>
<p>654. Amnesty International noted that many interventions during Colombia&#8217;s review 
reflected concerns repeatedly expressed by Colombian and international human rights 
organizations, OHCHR and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. It also 
noted the widely shared acknowledgement that the human rights and humanitarian situation 
in Colombia remained serious, as it remained in the midst of an armed conflict and 
paramilitary groups continued to operate despite the Government&#8217;s stated efforts to 
demobilize them. It welcomed the acceptance of most recommendations, but regretted the 
rejection of key ones, and asked the Government to reconsider its position, such as to 
accept the jurisdiction of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, to ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture, to withdraw the declaration on article 124 of 
the Rome Statute, and to end the &#8220;soldiers for a day&#8221; programme, which threatened to drag 
civilians further into the conflict. Amnesty International welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to urgently implement in full OHCHR recommendations, but noted the failure 
of successive Governments to do so. It recommended that the Council adopt measures to 
ensure effective monitoring of progress in this regard, in cooperation with civil society. 
</p>
<p>655. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues expressed concern that 
negotiations with paramilitaries had not resulted in the effective dismantling of the 
structures and that the Government denied this fact. It noted OHCHR concerns that </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>195 
</b></p>
<p>describing these structures as gangs did not reflect the complexity, variety, plurality and 
risks of the phenomenon. It said there were at least 76 paramilitary groups with some 9,000 
active members. Extraditions of 17 paramilitary leaders for drug trafficking were frustrating 
for victims. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to generating policies to avoid 
impunity of crimes against humanity but was concerned that the Government continued to 
deny that the demobilization process had allowed a de facto amnesty for most 
paramilitaries, including those who might have taken part in such crimes. Of the more than 
30,000 paramilitaries demobilized, only one had been convicted the day before the meeting. 
At May 2008, only 245 had agreed to submit to the legal process according to the justice 
and peace law. It noted that Colombia, in its comments, avoided recommendations relating 
to the grave attacks against the Supreme Court of Justice, including from the President of 
the Republic, in the context of investigations of Government and Congress members for 
supposed links with paramilitaries. It stated that the Government must stop persecuting 
judiciary members and must provide them with protection. 
</p><p>656. SOS Kinderdorf International, also on behalf of World Vision International, Plan 
International and the International Save the Children Alliance, welcomed Colombia&#8217;s 
acceptance of many child right recommendations. Noting recommendation 65, it added that 
limited State presence in rural areas minimized the identification and reporting of child 
sexual and physical abuse, leading many cases to go unrecorded and unpunished. On 
recommendation 22, it called for increased efforts to ensure effective data collection and 
adequate reporting, policing and juridical measures for such offences. It called for 
continued action on recommendation 19, requesting measures on demobilization through to 
reintegration of child soldiers, and measures to address underlying exclusion, which made 
rural, indigenous and other minority children vulnerable to recruitment. Welcoming the 
Government&#8217;s commitments to the Millennium Development Goals on the health and 
education of children and acceptance of the recommendations on education, it called for 
measures to ensure access to health care and education in rural areas. On recommendation 
62, it further recommended that birth registration fees be waived, that it be made possible to 
register children in areas other than those of their birth, and that communities be educated 
on the importance of birth registration. It requested clarification on the rejection of the 
recommendation in paragraph 37 (c) of the report, referring to the soldiers for a day 
programme and to the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommendations calling for 
an end to children&#8217;s participation in military training activities. Considering the 
complementary relationship between the universal periodic review and treaty bodies, it 
questioned this rejection. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>657. With regard to the situation of trade unionists, Colombia explained that a special 
unit had been established and resulted in 184 trials where those responsible for the murder 
of unionists were convicted. While only 1 conviction had been reached in 2007, in 2008 
this number had increased to 76, and there have already been 14 convictions to date in 
2009. It noted that 216 cases of murder of trade unionists had been revealed in the justice 
and peace process. Some of these had occurred in 2009, such as the murder of the President 
of the fishermen&#8217;s union, and three perpetrators had been arrested, including the 
mastermind. 
</p>
<p>658. The delegation stated that the Government had acknowledged the discussion on the 
law on victims. It pointed out that a programme for compensation through administrative 
means had been established by the Government at a cost of approximately $7 billion. About 
180,000 people had made claims under the law, and progress had been made in 
strengthening the protection programme. A decision by the Supreme Court had impeded the 
executive from handing out partial charges through the justice and peace process, but once </p>


<p><b>196</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>the restriction had been lifted, 62 partial charges were brought against perpetrators. The 
first conviction was secured the day prior to the meeting, and 15 cases were awaiting trial. 
</p>
<p>659. With regard to the murders allegedly committed by law enforcement officials, the 
delegation stated that the Government had discretionally retired 3,500 law enforcement 
officials on its own initiative. Despite the fact that 75,000 tactical missions had been 
undertaken since 2002, only 938 complaints were being investigated, with 1,117 persons 
involved. All cases had been remitted to the ordinary courts. 
</p>
<p>660. The delegation said that the Government had repeatedly expressed regret for the 
death of Edwin Legarda and the investigation was in the hands of the Prosecutor&#8217;s office. 
The events having occurred at 5 a.m. on a highway created a confusing situation and the 
Government was asking the Prosecutor&#8217;s office to establish the facts. The State had 
provided information to ambassadors in Colombia on progress, and a new directive had 
been issued by the Secretary of Defence on how military roadblocks should be established, 
learning from this regrettable experience. The Constitutional Court had ordered 34 ethnic 
safeguard plans for 34 indigenous communities, developing a comprehensive policy to 
provide care for these communities. 
</p>
<p>661. On the relationship between the Government and non-governmental organizations, 
the delegation stated that differences existed in that the Government believed it had done its 
best to address human rights violations, overcome impunity and protect the population, 
although non-governmental organizations might not share this view. Their view was 
respected. It added, however, that, for example, a few years earlier paramilitaries were 
responsible for 250 massacres a year without any reaction from the State authorities, but 
that now all paramilitary leaders were being held in maximum security prisons and tried for 
their crimes, and their demobilization required strict commitments to reveal truth, provide 
reparations to victims and carry out prison sentences. Colombia refused to regard the 
groups that had emerged to take over the control of 500 metric tons of coca, in many areas 
linked to the guerrilla, as paramilitary groups. These groups wanted to be qualified as 
paramilitaries to be subject to negotiation. 
</p><p>662. Colombia regretted the situation regarding the journalist Hollman Morris, but added 
that the statements made by the Government questioning Mr. Morris had been made 
following the claims of two people who had been kidnapped and had questioned the 
behaviour of the journalist. The delegation stated that a pluralistic press existed in 
Colombia, and a great range of opinion could be found in the media. 
</p>
<p>663. Responding to concerns about the cost of education, Colombia reported on the 
establishment of a free subsidy for the poorest children, which would benefit 4.5 million 
children. 
</p>
<p>664. Colombia was aware that legislation had to be enacted to ensure the Constitutional 
Court decision of January on same-sex couples did not remain a dead letter. 
</p>
<p>665. Colombia also affirmed that all challenges could be met if work continued with the 
international community, human rights organizations and civil society in a constructive 
spirit, rejecting all forms of violence and strengthening the institutions.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 15. Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p>666. The review of Uzbekistan was held on 11 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Uzbekistan in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/UZB/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/UZB/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/UZB/3). </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>197 
</b></p>
<p>667. At the 31st meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Uzbekistan (see section C below). 
</p><p>668. The outcome of the review on Uzbekistan comprised the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/77), the views of Uzbekistan 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/10/77/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>669. Uzbekistan was grateful to the members of the Council and the States Members of 
the United Nations for their attention to the situation of human rights in Uzbekistan, as 
reflected in their recommendations and comments. Uzbekistan gave an overview of the 
steps and obligations it had undertaken during the short period since the third session of the 
Working Group in December 2008. The review of Uzbekistan coincided with the end of the 
sixtieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was marked 
by the implementation of a thorough programme of measures taken by presidential decree 
in Uzbekistan. In 2008, Uzbekistan had ratified eight very important international human 
rights documents. In February 2009, the Government had signed the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>670. In 2008, Uzbekistan implemented a wide-ranging educational and awareness-raising 
campaign to monitor the implementation of the most important human rights laws in 
conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Uzbekistan took the 
opportunity to dwell on three of the most recent trends in State policy with respect to 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>671. First, with regard to the global financial crisis and human rights, the Government 
had launched a policy to avoid any reduction in people&#8217;s living standards, by protecting 
them from the negative consequences of the financial crisis and by ensuring that normal life 
proceeded as a foundation for their human rights. Uzbekistan stated that the budget 
allocation in the social sphere had amounted to more than 50 per cent, the majority of 
which was given to education. Uzbekistan had also a continuing tradition of adopting 
integrated State programmes intended to resolve specific problems relating to socio-
economic development as the basis of the whole set of human rights enshrined in the 
fundamental United Nations documents. Uzbekistan recalled that 2008 was declared the 
Year of Youth, and that specific measures had been taken to improve education, health, 
housing and credits for young people and young families, while 2009 had been declared the 
year of development and improvement of the countryside. Uzbekistan intended to bring a 
qualitative improvement to the living conditions and well-being of the rural population, 
since almost half of Uzbek people live in rural areas, and paying attention to life in rural 
areas was in line with the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>672. Second, Uzbekistan pointed out that education was a priority in State policy and it 
had been successfully implementing systemic education reforms at all levels. The whole 
education system was interrelated to the national programme to enhance a culture of legal 
awareness among the masses with regard to newly adopted legislation, and was also laying 
the foundations for human rights education programmes. With technical assistance from 
various United Nations agencies, Uzbekistan was continuing the publication of 
international human rights documents. At the beginning of February 2009, an Uzbek 
language publication was issued with the help of UNICEF of the Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Uzbekistan ratified in December 2008. </p>


<p><b>198</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>673. Thirdly, as a result of consistent development in the area of judicial and legal 
reform, Uzbekistan had started to see concrete results in the application of habeas corpus. 
This institution came into force on 1 January 2008 and had served to strengthen the 
procedural guarantees for the protection of constitutional rights and freedoms for 
Uzbekistan&#8217;s citizens during criminal proceedings. As of 2008, Uzbekistan has been 
implementing a whole set of legal and organizational reforms related to the legal 
profession. It has established a bar association, a chamber of lawyers and an independent 
professional association, which carried out a broad range of tasks, including social 
protection and support for lawyers, educational activities and representation and defence in 
matters related to the State. The guarantee of legal status of lawyers was achieved through 
the introduction of administrative responsibility on the part of public officials for 
hampering activities of lawyers. The Government had taken a decision to support such 
national human rights institutions as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the national human 
rights centre, established in accordance with the Paris Principles and the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action. The institution of habeas corpus, the improvement 
of the status and institution of the legal profession and the national human rights institutions 
should all be seen as consistent steps being taken by Uzbekistan to implement judicial and 
legal reforms and to carry out international obligations in the human rights area. 
</p>
<p>674. Uzbekistan had also submitted a document with its answers and commentaries to the 
recommendations of the Working Group. Uzbekistan had carefully studied all the 
recommendations made by Member States. Uzbekistan was pleased to report that work to 
implement the recommendations accepted following its review had already begun. In 
keeping with the spirit and the principles of the Council, Uzbekistan intended to adopt and 
implement a national plan of action to fulfil the recommendations. It intended to continue to 
work consistently and actively together with the United Nations treaty bodies by submitting 
periodic reports, and with the special procedures and other mechanisms of the Council. In 
December 2008 and January 2009, Uzbekistan had provided its replies to the questionnaires 
from the special rapporteurs on education and on violence against women, and in March 
from the Council&#8217;s Advisory Committee on the draft declaration on human rights education 
and training. 
</p>
<p>675. The universal periodic review mechanism had made it possible for Uzbekistan to 
thoroughly analyse and evaluate State policy on the realization of various human rights and 
to strengthen coordination and interaction among various State bodies and civil society 
structures. In keeping this important principle in mind, the State institutions together with 
civil society bodies would be working on the national plan of action to implement the 
recommendations from its review. Uzbekistan hoped for the understanding of the Members 
and observers of the Council and also for their constructive and fruitful cooperation as 
Uzbekistan implemented the common goals of promoting, realizing and protecting human 
rights at both the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>(b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>676. Azerbaijan noted that a significant step had been taken to uphold the role of 
Parliament, political parties and civil society. Azerbaijan made reference to the growing 
number of non-governmental organizations, the establishment of the role of a human rights 
commissioner for Parliament and the national centre for human rights, the abolition of the 
death penalty, the introduction of habeas corpus and the adoption of several national plans 
of action in various human rights fields, which demonstrated the will of Uzbekistan to 
improve further the human rights situation in the country. Uzbekistan would benefit from 
the universal periodic review mechanism by, inter alia, the successful implementation of 
recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>199 
</b></p>
<p>677. The Russian Federation was grateful to the delegation of Uzbekistan for the 
exhaustive information on the recommendations made. It noted the creation of a full system 
of national human rights institutions in keeping with the Paris Principles: the Ombudsman, 
the national centre on human rights and the institute for monitoring legislation. The national 
human rights protection system in Uzbekistan had been improved, and this had been quite 
clearly shown during the review. The Russian delegation wished the Government of 
Uzbekistan every success on that path. 
</p>
<p>678. Indonesia commended Uzbekistan for embracing the recommendations made during 
the Working Group discussions, and applauded the forthcoming strategies to mobilize 
national resources to accelerate poverty alleviation and eliminate forced child labour and 
trafficking. By working together with concerned stakeholders, including non-governmental 
organizations and members of civil society, Uzbekistan would be able to pursue its efforts 
to advance human rights causes. Indonesia expressed the hope that Uzbekistan would apply 
a balanced and fair approach to human rights norms in the country, especially regarding 
education and the eradication of discrimination against women and female children. 
</p>
<p>679. Ukraine expressed appreciation for the detailed responses to the recommendations 
made. Ukraine noted in particular the positive trends in the interaction between Uzbekistan 
and the special rapporteurs, as well as its intention to continue comprehensive cooperation 
with all special procedures of the Council, and encouraged it to continue its efforts. Ukraine 
hoped to hear, before the next round of the universal periodic review, about their 
achievements. 
</p>
<p>680. Kazakhstan recognized the positive engagement by Uzbekistan with the Council in 
the universal periodic review process. It noted with great satisfaction that the 
recommendations had already been taken into account and measures had been taken to 
implement them. In this regard, Kazakhstan welcomed the recent positive steps by 
Uzbekistan, including the signature of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, in February 2009. Kazakhstan welcomed the gender-specific steps taken, 
including the adoption of a draft law on guarantees of equal rights and opportunities for 
women and men. Kazakhstan strongly encouraged Uzbekistan to continue its cooperation 
with the special procedures and the treaty bodies. It welcomed Uzbekistan&#8217;s firm 
commitments and close cooperation in the review follow-up process. 
</p>
<p>681. Cuba congratulated Uzbekistan on its detailed presentation of ongoing efforts as part 
of the follow-up to the recommendations made during the universal periodic review. Cuba 
noted that, despite the obstacles confronted, Uzbekistan had made important progress, in 
both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. Cuba especially 
acknowledged progress in the areas of education, health, employment, the promotion and 
protection of the rights of children, the rights of persons with disabilities and with low 
incomes, and its fight against any type of discrimination. Cuba also wished to commend the 
ongoing bill in the 2009 legislation plan for equal opportunities and rights for men and 
women, to afford them the equal enjoyment of their rights and freedoms, as recognized in 
the national legislation of Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>682. Belarus took note of the serious work done by Uzbekistan in preparation for the 
universal periodic review. Uzbekistan had established the necessary structural conditions 
for the promotion of human rights, including the Ombudsman, a national centre for human 
rights and the State human rights programmes. Uzbekistan was actively promoting legal 
and procedural practice noting the recent introduction of habeas corpus. Belarus welcomed 
the adoption of the law to combat trafficking in persons in 2008. Belarus also noted the 
establishment of national rehabilitation centres for victims of trafficking. Belarus invited 
the representative of the relevant authorities to take part in training on trafficking in 
persons, which is conducted regularly by the International Migration Training Centre to 
Combat Trafficking based in Minsk. Belarus stated that it would appreciate the steps to be </p>


<p><b>200</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>undertaken by Uzbekistan to implement the recommendations made during the Working 
Group, noting the development of a national plan of action. 
</p>
<p>683. Malaysia was pleased to note that Uzbekistan had accepted a large number of 
recommendations made by Member States, including those focusing on the promotion and 
protection of economic, social and cultural rights. This was particularly important in the 
light of the current global financial crisis affecting the socio-economic conditions of many 
developing countries. Malaysia viewed this as a positive and constructive approach on the 
part of Uzbekistan and encouraged the Government of Uzbekistan to take the necessary 
measures to implement the recommendations effectively. 
</p>
<p>684. The Philippines welcomed the responses of Uzbekistan, particularly its readiness to 
continue its comprehensive cooperation with all special procedures of the Council. The 
Philippines noted that the draft law on guarantees of equal rights and opportunities for 
women and men had been included in the plan of legislative activities of the Government 
for 2009. The Philippines welcomed the steps taken by the Government with regard to the 
promotion and protection of the rights of children by noting Uzbekistan&#8217;s ratification of the 
two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography and on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict, as well as ILO Conventions Nos. 138 and 182 with respect to the minimum age of 
labour and the worst forms of child labour. 
</p>
<p>685. Bahrain noted that Uzbekistan had drawn up a national plan and had also taken 
measures to guarantee the rights of the child through legislation by tackling trafficking in 
persons. It had ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on trafficking in children and on children in armed conflict. Uzbekistan had signed two ILO 
conventions to put an end to child labour and to set up a national programme directed at 
eliminating the worst forms of child labour, while imposing serious penalties on parents 
and others who forced children to work. Bahrain indicated that Uzbekistan, like other 
countries, had signed the Millennium Declaration on an ideal world for children and the 
Government was committed to improving the situation of children and endeavouring to 
establish a programme to this end from 2009 to 2011. 
</p>
<p>686. Algeria congratulated the Government of Uzbekistan on its progress in promoting 
and implementing human rights standards. The constructive participation of Uzbekistan in 
the universal periodic review and its voluntary acceptance of a large number of the 
recommendations was testimony to that commitment. Algeria welcomed the measures 
taken to implement some of the recommendations and encouraged the Government to 
continue its efforts to enshrine human rights standards. Algeria called upon the United 
Nations agencies concerned to cooperate closely with the country to allow it to meet these 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>687. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland sought clarification and 
requested correction on paragraph 48 (c), which did not exist but was referred to in 
paragraph 107 of the report of the Working Group as one of the recommendations not 
accepted by the Government of Uzbekistan. The United Kingdom expressed its ongoing 
concern over the number of imprisoned human rights defenders. It also expressed its 
disappointment that certain paragraphs referred to in paragraph 107 had been dismissed by 
Uzbekistan as factually wrong without due consideration. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>688. Civicus &#8211;<b> </b>World Alliance for Citizen Participation<b> </b>welcomed the new laws adopted 
on non-governmental and non-profit organizations, and asked the Government to report 
publicly, accurately and comprehensively how these laws had been implemented and what 
had been done in relation to various recommendations to improve the protection of civil </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>201 
</b></p>
<p>society space, namely to ensure freedom of expression, assembly, association and the right 
to participate in public and political life, to adopt a national plan of action to improve the 
human rights situation and to implement some of the recommendations of the treaty bodies 
on freedom of peaceful assembly, to investigate all reports of assaults on human rights 
defenders and to bring to justice those responsible. Civicus requested that the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders be facilitated at the earliest 
time possible. 
</p>
<p>689. Action Canada for Population and Development urged Uzbekistan to provide a 
friendly environment, without State interference or fear of reprisal, for non-governmental 
organizations working on the issues of sexual rights, women&#8217;s rights, reproductive health 
and rights, and HIV/AIDS. It also called on the Government to conduct proper investigation 
of closures of non-governmental organizations, punish those responsible for unjustified 
closures and restore their legal personhood to the organizations affected, specifically crisis 
centres for women. It supported the recommendation to invite the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, stressing the importance of examining the situation 
of defenders working on women&#8217;s rights and sexual and reproductive rights. It called on the 
Government to repeal article 120 of the criminal code and decriminalize consensual same-
sex behaviour among adults. 
</p>
<p>690. Amnesty International welcomed Uzbekistan&#8217;s support of the recommendations to 
establish a national independent mechanism to monitor all places of detention and to 
consider complaints. It expressed dismay that Uzbekistan regarded the establishment of an 
independent international investigation into the events of May 2005 in Andijan as 
inconsistent with its obligations under international human rights standards. It noted that, 
during the interactive dialogue, Uzbekistan had rejected as &#8220;unfounded&#8221; the reports that 
excessive and disproportionate force had been used during these events. It also urged 
Uzbekistan to reconsider its rejection of recommendations to release all detained human 
rights defenders and to ensure that everyone, including human rights defenders, peacefully 
exercised their right to freedom of expression in conformity with Uzbekistan&#8217;s obligations 
under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>691. The International Commission of Jurists expressed concern that Uzbekistan had 
accepted only very general and sometimes vague recommendations, and made reservations 
or eventually refused those that were specific and measurable. In particular, it urged the 
Government to permit an effective investigation into the Andijan events through an 
independent international commission of inquiry; to refrain from the prosecution of 
dissenting political and religious activists, journalists and human rights defenders on 
vaguely defined charges relating to terrorism, extremism, separatism or religious practice; 
to narrow the definition of what constitutes &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221; in accordance with the principle 
of legality of offences; to ensure that its legislation on criminal procedure complies with all 
due process guarantees; to ensure the absolute prohibition of torture and to adopt the 
definition of torture in compliance with article 1 of the Convention against Torture; to 
provide for effective access by the public to criminal trials; and to give unhindered access 
to the special procedures that have outstanding requests for visits. 
</p>
<p>692. Human Rights Watch lamented the Government&#8217;s decision to reject the 
recommendations urging the release of human rights defenders and civil society activists. It 
noted that at least 11 human rights defenders were still held in prison. It had been forced to 
suspend its activities in Uzbekistan in July 2008 after the Government&#8217;s denial of work 
accreditation and outright ban on its research. It expressed regret at the Government&#8217;s 
continued refusal to accept responsibility for the massacre in May 2005 in Andijan. Human 
Rights Watch also expressed regret at the Government&#8217;s decision to reject the 
recommendation to stop pursuing the forcible return of Uzbek asylum-seekers from </p>


<p><b>202</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>neighbouring countries. It urged the Government to reserve its approach and to accept and 
genuinely implement all recommendations addressed to it during its review. 
</p>
<p>693. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Aid Network encouraged Uzbekistan to reconsider 
its position in paragraph 105 of the report of the Working Group, where Uzbekistan 
indicated that it would study the conformity of 12 recommendations to its national 
legislation in the light of international human rights standards. It requested Uzbekistan to 
indicate which recommendations of those 12 would be accepted. It also raised Uzbekistan&#8217;s 
refusal to decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults, 
noting that the laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct were not in 
conformity with international obligations of privacy and non-discrimination under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It therefore urged Uzbekistan to 
reconsider its position and to repeal the offending provisions. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>694. In its concluding remarks, Uzbekistan stressed that it upheld its international 
obligations in the fields of human rights and freedoms on the basis of the principles of 
equality, constructiveness, objectivity and transparency. The universal periodic review had 
made it possible for Uzbekistan to have a thorough look at its national policy on human 
rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Uzbekistan had 
instituted cooperation with civil society and established a non-State system for the 
protection of human rights. These institutions provided great support for the development 
of civil society and the rule of law in areas such as the education and care of women and 
children, and people with disabilities and vulnerable people. Uzbekistan had created a 
national association of non-governmental organizations, a social fund for support for non-
governmental organizations and a parliamentary commission. The Government firmly 
intended to conduct a broad-based discussion with all concerned State bodies and non-
governmental organizations, as well as with other civil society institutions and the media, to 
look at the recommendations emerging from the report on Uzbekistan and to develop and 
implement an appropriate national plan of action. 
</p>
<p><b> 16. Tuvalu 
</b></p>
<p>695. The review of Tuvalu was held on 11 December 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by Tuvalu in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TUV/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TUV/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/3/TUV/3). 
</p><p>696. At its 32nd meeting, on 20 March 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Tuvalu (see section C below). 
697. The outcome of the review on Tuvalu comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/10/84), the views of Tuvalu concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were 
not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as 
well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</i></p>
<p>698. The Crown Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General of Tuvalu presented the 
final remarks and conclusions of the Government on its first report in the universal periodic </p>

</b></p>
<p>review process. She reaffirmed Tuvalu&#8217;s commitment to the review mechanism and to the 
upholding of human rights principles. 
</p>
<p>699. Tuvalu expressed a deep appreciation to those who had provided the much needed 
support, from the preparation phase of its national report to the reporting session in 
December 2008, and also for facilitating the presence of Tuvalu in the consideration of the 
outcome. In this regard, the delegation referred to the support of the OHCHR Regional 
Office for the Pacific, the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team, the Social Division of 
the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Permanent Missions of New Zealand and 
Australia in Geneva. Tuvalu extended its warm thanks also to the Council, the Working 
Group and Member States of the troika for the honest reflections and the assistance 
provided to the delegation of Tuvalu. Being one of the first small island States to undergo 
the review process, Tuvalu noted that it had encountered the challenges of underresources 
in terms of technical expertise. With the assistance of the human rights-related offices in the 
region, Tuvalu had been able to participate fully in the review. 
</p>
<p>700. Tuvalu stated that the review process had been an opportunity not only to inform the 
international community of the state of Tuvalu&#8217;s compliance and realization of human 
rights at the ground level, but also to know where Tuvalu stood in the fulfilment of its 
obligation as a State Member of the United Nations in the area of human rights. It regarded 
the process as truly universal, and reaffirmed the commitment of Tuvalu to its success and 
continuity. 
</p>
<p>701. With regard to the 10 recommendations made in December 2008 to be considered by 
the Government, the delegation stated that Tuvalu supported all of them (A/HRC/10/84, 
para. 68). With regard to recommendation 2, to fully incorporate the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, and recommendation 6, on the elimination of discrimination against 
women and to fully incorporate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, Tuvalu stated that careful consideration and broad 
consultation were required at the national level with relevant stakeholders in the 
incorporation of these two conventions. Tuvalu added that some of the recommendations, 
such as regarding children with no parental care and asylum, were not relevant to Tuvalu, 
but the delegation confirmed the support of Tuvalu and that it stood ready to consider them. 
Lastly, Tuvalu stated that it required the financial and technical support of the international 
community in the fulfilment of these recommendations. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome 
</i>702. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland congratulated Tuvalu on 
the adoption of the report of their review. It recognized the capacity constraints that the 
Government of Tuvalu encountered when preparing for the review. The fact that, despite 
these constraints, the Government of Tuvalu had been represented in Geneva in December 
2008 and was in Geneva on 20 March 2009 for the consideration of the outcome was 
commendable. 
</p>
<p>703. New Zealand noted that Tuvalu was the second country in the South Pacific region 
to go through the universal periodic review process. It warmly welcomed the presence of a 
Tuvalu delegate in Geneva to take part in the adoption phase of the review process. It noted 
that Tuvalu had given the review process high priority, with the preparation of a 
comprehensive State report and the input of a number of non-governmental organizations. 
The quality of Tuvalu&#8217;s preparation for the review resulted in a wide-ranging discussion in 
December 2008, in which a number of delegations participated fully. New Zealand 
commended Tuvalu for its acceptance of a very large number of the recommendations 
made in December 2008. It noted that for the small island States of the Pacific, participation 
in the review was a major undertaking, and that Tuvalu was undoubtedly among the 
smallest countries to have gone through the review process to date. New Zealand </p>


<p><b>204</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>recognized the practical difficulties faced by the smallest island States in meeting their 
universal periodic review obligations. For that reason, New Zealand had convened in 
February 2009, in Auckland, a seminar to assist officials of Pacific island Governments to 
work through the review process. At the seminar, Tuvalu representatives, who had already 
gone through the review in December 2008, were able to provide valuable insights for their 
colleagues from other Pacific countries and had contributed greatly to making the seminar a 
success. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</i>704. Amnesty International welcomed many of the recommendations made by States to 
Tuvalu, including on cooperating with OHCHR to strengthen legislation related to family, 
land and sexual offences against children, and to establish a national human rights 
commission based on the Paris Principles. It also welcomed recommendations to develop a 
comprehensive strategy to reduce domestic violence in Tuvalu, including through raising 
public awareness and encouraging greater involvement by Government agencies and civil 
society in efforts to address domestic violence and gender discrimination. It reiterated its 
call to Tuvalu to develop and enact legislation to protect women and children from 
violence, in particular domestic violence. It indicated that prevailing cultural notions of 
women&#8217;s status continued to be a key factor in perpetuating violence against women in 
Tuvalu. It therefore urged Tuvalu to support recommendations to eliminate legislation that 
had a discriminatory effect against women, and to amend the Constitution to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. It considered that gender violence could not 
be eradicated without addressing the underlying factors that cause or contribute to gender 
discrimination. It welcomed Tuvalu&#8217;s support for recommendations to ratify, with the 
assistance of OHCHR, a wide range of human rights treaties, including the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>705. Earthjustice welcomed and encouraged the positive response of Tuvalu concerning 
its efforts to ratify all major human rights treaties and to establish a national human rights 
institution respecting the Paris Principles in order to strengthen human rights in the country. 
It stated that Tuvalu unfortunately illustrated how human rights were affected by climate 
change, such as the right to food, the right to water or the right to adequate housing. 
Earthjustice encouraged Tuvalu to promote access to information, education and public 
participation in environmental and climate change matters. The situation in Tuvalu also 
showed that the right to an ecologically sustainable environment could not be protected by 
national measures alone. The right to assistance in emergency situations and possible 
refugee rights could only be granted by the active involvement of the international 
community, but the responsibility of the international community was not limited to 
assistance measures. Furthermore, it noted that the fate of Tuvalu exemplified how climate 
change mitigation measures were also a direct contribution to the prevention of human 
rights violations. Earthjustice called on the Council to consider the whole range of 
measures needed to make it possible for Tuvalu to protect the human rights of its people. It 
called on Tuvalu to participate actively in the future discussions on this issue at the Council 
as well as in the negotiations of the post-Kyoto regime, where the human rights 
implications of the struggle against climate change would have to be taken into 
consideration. 
</p>
<p>706. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network noted, with reference to paragraph 14 of 
the Working Group report, that during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group, the 
head of the Tuvalu delegation stated that his country respected the rights of persons of all 
sexual orientations, but that the question of legal protection in the Constitution would need 
to be carefully considered. In this regard, the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network 
appreciated the openness of the delegation to discussion and relevant actions of Tuvalu in </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>205 
</b></p>
<p>relation to promoting equality for all people, including on grounds of sexual orientation and 
gender identity. However, it noted that Tuvalu maintained some criminal laws that 
penalized consensual same-sex adult behaviour, and the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal 
Network encouraged the delegation to remain open to revision of these laws in order to 
promote equality and compliance with international obligations of privacy and non-
discrimination. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network would welcome an indication 
from the delegation whether there was any openness to consider these matters. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</i>707. Tuvalu thanked the President, States and stakeholders for their valuable 
contributions. It noted that comments and explanations to a number of issues raised by 
States and stakeholders had already been provided by the delegation of Tuvalu in December 
2008. Tuvalu expressed its commitment to the success and continuity of the review, not 
only in the reporting element of the process but more importantly in the implementation of 
these recommendations on the ground. Tuvalu stated that it therefore sought the support 
and assistance of the international community in the implementation of the 
recommendations. In closing, Tuvalu expressed that it was looking forward to presenting its 
next report to the Council.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Administrative and programme budget implications of 
Council resolutions adopted by the Council at its tenth 
session 
</b></p>
<p><b> 10/33 
Situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
the strengthening of technical cooperation and consultative services 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraphs 5 and 10 of draft resolution A/HRC/10/L.3 (adopted as resolution 
10/33), the Council: 
 (a) Noted the report of the thematic special procedures presented by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, acting on behalf of the other six representatives and special rapporteurs, and 
invited them to report again to the Council on the development of the situation at its 
thirteenth session; 
</p>
<p> (b) Called on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) to increase and enhance, through its presence in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, its technical assistance programmes and activities, in consultation with the 
authorities of the country. 
</p>
<p>2. A total amount of $132,900 would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) to 
implement the activities called for by the Council in paragraph 5, as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the Special Representative to present the report of the seven experts 
to the Council, and one field mission of the seven mandate holders to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo ($74,900); 
 (b) Travel of staff to accompany the mandate holders during the field mission 
($44,000); 
 (c) Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous 
expenses during the field mission ($14,000). 
</p><p>3. The requirements to implement the activities outlined in paragraph 2 above have 
been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 
2008&#8211;2009. Since the period of the terms of the draft resolution extends into the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011, the requirements for that period are expected to be met within the provisions 
included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. No additional 
appropriations would be required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>4. The activities envisaged under paragraph 10 of the draft resolution would be 
implemented on the basis of available resources under the regular programme for technical 
cooperation or voluntary contributions that may be forthcoming under the Voluntary Fund 
for Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of Human Rights. </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>229 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A/HRC/10/L.12 
Assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. Owing to the late submission of the revisions to the draft resolution, a formal 
statement of financial implications could not be prepared. If the draft resolution is adopted, 
there would be financial implications relating to the continuation of work of the 
independent expert. Resources for the work of the independent expert have, however, been 
included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the present 
biennium; thus, there would be no additional appropriations required as a result of the 
adoption of the resolution. 
</p>
<p><b>  10/11 
The use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>6. In paragraphs 13, 16 and 18 of draft resolution A/HRC/10/L.24, the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Requests the Working Group: 
 (i) To consult with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>academic institutions and experts on the content and scope of a possible draft 
convention on private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and other 
military security-related services on the international market, and an accompanying 
Model Law, and other legal instruments; 
</p>
<p> (ii) To share with Member States, through OHCHR, elements for a possible draft 
convention on private military and security companies, requesting their input on the 
content and scope of such a convention, and to transmit their replies to the Working 
Group; 
</p>
<p> (iii) To report to the Council at its fifteenth session on the progress achieved in 
the elaboration of the draft legal instrument for proper consideration and action; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested OHCHR to continue to support the Working Group by convening 
regional governmental consultations on this matter, in conformity with paragraph 15 of 
General Assembly resolution 62/145, with the remaining three to be held before the end of 
2010, bearing in mind that this process may lead to the holding of a high-level round table 
of States, under the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss the fundamental question of 
the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force, with the objective of 
facilitating a critical understanding of the responsibilities of the different actors, including 
private military and security companies, in the current context, and their respective 
obligations for the protection and promotion of human rights and in reaching a common 
understanding as to which additional regulations and controls were needed at the 
international level; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide the Working Group with all the necessary assistance and 
support for the fulfilment of its mandate, both professional and financial, including through 
the promotion of cooperation between the Working Group and other components of the 
United Nations system that deal with countering mercenary-related activities, in order to 
meet the demands of its current and future activities. 
</p>
<p>7. The requirements of the activities of the Working Group are regarded as perennials 
and have therefore been included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008&#8211;2009 
and the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. However, the resource 
requirements with regard to an anticipated regional consultation in Africa have not been </p>


<p><b>230</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p>considered within the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. Should the 
draft resolution be adopted, it is estimated that the additional requirements of $316,600 
would be required in 2010 under sections 2 and 23 (Human Rights), as follows: 
 (a) Travel of five members of the Working Group ($29,200, under section 23); 
 (b) Travel of 52 representatives for two working days ($135,200, under section 
23); 
 (c) Travel of five experts for two working days ($29,200, under section 23); 
 (d) Travel of staff to accompany the members of the Working Group ($10,800, 
under section 23); 
 (e) Conference servicing costs ($112,200, under section 2). 
</p><p>8. The additional $316,600 required to implement the activities for the regional 
consultation in Africa will be presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session 
in a revised estimates report resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the 
Council, in the context of its consideration of the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011. No additional appropriations would be required for the biennium 
2008&#8211;2009 as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to paragraph 18, attention is drawn to the provisions of section IV of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  10/23 
Promotion and protection of cultural rights and respect for cultural 
diversity 
</b></p>
<p>10. In paragraphs 6, 8, 9 and 10 of draft resolution A/HRC/10/L.26 (adopted as 
resolution 10/23), the Council: 
 (a) Decided to establish, for a period of three years, the mandate of independent 
expert on the promotion and protection of cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) Called upon all Governments to cooperate with and assist the independent 
expert in the discharge of his or her mandate, to provide him or her with all necessary 
information requested and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to his or 
her requests to visit their countries in order to enable him or her to effectively fulfil his or 
her duties; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the 
necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the 
independent expert; 
</p>
<p> (d) Requested the independent expert to submit his or her first report to the 
Council at its thirteenth session. 
</p>
<p>11. A total amount of $338,800 per annum or $677,600 per biennium would be required 
to implement the activities arising from the terms of the resolutions, as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the independent expert for consultations/to attend the annual 
meeting of special procedures, to present his or her report to the Council and the General </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>231 
</b></p>
<p>Assembly, two field missions per year and two missions per year to attend and follow up on 
relevant international conferences and events ($109,800 per biennium under section 23); 
 (b) Travel of five experts (one from each region) for each of the three annual 
consultations ($76,400 per biennium, under section 23); 
 (c) Travel of staff to accompany the independent expert during field missions 
($20,800 per biennium, under section 23); 
 (d) Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous 
expenses during field missions ($8,000 per biennium, under section 23); 
 (e) One P-3 staff member to assist the independent expert (12 months per year) 
($311,000 per biennium, under section 23); 
 (f) Conference services for the organization of a two-day consultation meeting in 
each of the three years, involving all relevant stakeholders, to identify proposals enhancing 
international cooperation, overcome obstacles and fill gaps in the promotion and protection 
of cultural rights, as well as to clarify the content and scope of cultural diversity ($111,600 
per biennium: $108,600 under section 2 and $3,000 under section 28 E); 
 (g) Consultant services (two work months each year) to assist the independent 
expert in technical matters relating to the identification of good practices and lessons 
learned and on studies to clarify the content and scope of cultural rights and their 
relationship with respect for cultural diversity ($40,000 per biennium, under section 23). 
</p><p>12. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the independent 
expert have not been included under sections 2, 23 (Human Rights) and 28 E of the 
programme budget for the biennium 2008&#8211;2009. Although the resource requirements are 
estimated at a total amount of $338,800 per annum, the actual implementation of the 
mandate may require a maximum of nine months of resources for 2009. Every effort will be 
made to meet the estimated requirements within the provisions for the biennium 2008&#8211;2009 
and to be reported in the context of the second performance for the biennium 2008&#8211;2009. 
Since the period of the mandate of the independent expert would extend to the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011, the requirements for that period will be presented to the General Assembly at 
its sixty-fourth session in a revised estimates report resulting from resolutions and decisions 
adopted by the Council, in the context of its consideration of the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. No additional appropriations would be required as a 
result of the adoption of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to paragraph 9, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

Korea 
</b></p>
<p>14. In paragraphs 3, 8 and 9 of draft resolution A/HRC/10/L.27 (adopted as resolution 
10/16), the Council: 
 (a) Decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, in accordance with Council 
resolution 7/15, for a period of one year; </p>


<p><b>232</b> GE.09-17451 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with all 
assistance and adequate staffing necessary to carry out his mandate effectively and to 
ensure that this mechanism works with the support of OHCHR; 
</p>
<p> (c) Invited the Special Rapporteur to submit regular reports on the 
implementation of his mandate to the Council and the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>15. A total amount of $58,400 per annum ($116,800 per biennium) would be required 
under section 23 (Human Rights) to implement the activities arising from the terms of the 
draft resolution, as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the Special Rapporteur for consultations and to attend the annual 
meeting of special procedures, to present his/her report to the Council and the General

 (b) Travel of staff to accompany the Special Rapporteur during field missions 
($10,200 per annum, or $20,400 per biennium); 
 (c) Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous 
expenses during field missions ($6,000 per annum, or $12,000 per biennium). 
</p><p>16. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur have been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget 
for the biennium 2008&#8211;2009. Since the period of the terms of the draft resolution extends to

the draft resolution.

resolution 10/27), the Council: 
 (a) Decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions 1992/58 and 2005/10, and Council resolution 7/32; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a progress report to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and to the Council in accordance with its annual 
programme of work; 
</p>
<p> (c) Called upon OHCHR to provide the Special Rapporteur with all necessary 
assistance and resources to enable him to discharge his mandate fully. 
</p>
<p>19. A total amount of $72,700 per annum ($145,400 per biennium) would be required 
under section 23 (Human Rights) to implement the activities arising from the terms of the 
resolution, as follows: </p>


<p>GE.09-17451 <b>233 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Travel of the Special Rapporteur for consultations, to present his/her report to 
the Council and the General Assembly, two field missions per year ($56,300 per annum, or 
$112,600 per biennium); 
 (b) Travel of staff to accompany the Special Rapporteur during field missions 
($10,400 per annum, or $20,800 per biennium); 
 (c) Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous 
expenses during field missions ($6,000 per annum, or $12,000 per biennium). 
</p><p>20. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur have been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget 
for the biennium 2008&#8211;2009. Since the period of the terms of the draft resolutions extends 
to the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, it is considered that the requirements for that period would be 
met within the provisions included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011. No additional appropriations would be required as a result of the adoption of 
the draft resolution.  
</p>
<p>21. With regard to paragraph 21, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. </p>
