<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth session from 
22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Switzerland was held at the 9th meeting, on 
29 October 2012. The delegation of Switzerland was headed by Federal Councillor Didier 
Burkhalter. At its 13th meeting, held on 31 October 2012, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Switzerland: Belgium, Costa Rica and 
Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
were issued for the review of Switzerland: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/CHE/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/CHE/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/CHE/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Denmark, Germany, Finland, Maldives, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Switzerland through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Swiss delegation noted that human rights were part of the core values of the 
country&#8217;s political and legal system. They were enshrined in its Constitution as well as its 
internal and foreign policy. Owing to these rights, Swiss nationals as well as all those who 
had found a safe haven in Switzerland were living together in diversity and freedom, with 
mutual respect and equal opportunities. It was also for that reason that Switzerland was 
proud to host here in Geneva the Human Rights Council and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation noted that the Federal Council considered the level of human rights 
protection in Switzerland to be good. However, no country in the world could afford to be 
complacent in this regard. Respect for human rights remained a permanent task. In that 
regard, Switzerland considered UPR as an opportunity for dialogue. The preparation for the 
review had been characterized by close cooperation with representatives of the cantons as 
well as non-governmental organizations, which had welcomed the open and productive 
atmosphere in which consultations had been held. 
</p>
<p>7. The Swiss State was based on four main principles, namely democracy, rule of law, 
federalism and solidarity. These principles guaranteed the unity as well as the diversity by 
which the Confederation was characterized, the continuation of the tradition of sharing and 
balancing of powers, and the proximity between these powers and the citizens. </p>


<p>8. Democracy ensured the responsibility and engagement of citizens. The Swiss 
democratic system encouraged dialogue and the search for solutions by consensus, with due 
regard to the concerns of minorities. 
</p>
<p>9. The rule of law served as a guarantee for fundamental freedoms, and all efforts were 
taken to preserve and strengthen it. An important step in the unification of laws had been 
the entry into force, in January 2011, of several laws and codes of procedure at the federal 
level, which had replaced corresponding laws of the cantons. These federal laws, which 
included in particular the Criminal Procedure Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure in 
Juvenile Justice, and the Civil Procedure Code, constituted a further step in strengthening 
equality before the law, predictability in the judicial system and human rights protection. 
</p>
<p>10. The third principle, federalism, meant that authority was distributed according to the 
principle of subsidiarity. Thus, it was not the Central State which gave directives to the 
regions, but rather the different cantons of which the Confederation was composed which 
delegated competencies to the Federal State. In this way, public functions were executed at 
the communal and cantonal levels, which brought the State close to the citizens and 
facilitated dialogue between them and the authorities. The interests of different groups 
could thus be taken into account, with due respect for minorities. Federalism and the 
protection of minorities were the institutional expression of the cultural, linguistic and 
religious diversity of Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>11. Finally, the principle of solidarity alluded to the social functions of the State. It was 
reflected in the preamble of the Constitution, which provided that &#8220;the strength of the 
community is measured by the well-being of its weakest members&#8221;. The social 
responsibility of the State thus implied a commitment in favour of the most vulnerable 
individuals, as well as policies promoting job creation and countering exclusion. 
</p>
<p>12. Concerning the commitments made by Switzerland during the first cycle, the 
delegation referred to the completed ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-
CAT) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (OP-CEDAW). In addition, a number of ratification 
procedures were currently under way, including with regard to the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED), and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). 
</p>
<p>13. Switzerland also recognized the importance of giving individuals recourse to 
complaints mechanisms. Complaints on rights violations could be brought before the 
European Court of Human Rights as well as before the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) and 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). 
Where violations were found, measures had been taken to avoid their reoccurrence. 
</p>
<p>14. In addition to existing official and independent consultative mechanisms at the 
federal and cantonal levels, two new institutions had been created in 2010 and 2011, 
namely the National Commission for the Prevention of Torture and the Swiss Resource 
Centre for Human Rights. The establishment of the latter institution had been undertaken 
with a view to creating a national human rights institutions conforming to the Paris 
Principles, on which a decision would be taken by the Federal Council after completion of 
the pilot phase in 2015. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to racial discrimination, the delegation noted that Switzerland followed 
an integration policy that included active measures against all forms of discrimination. 
Thus, by 2014, integration and anti-discrimination programmes had been developed in all 
cantons. The access of victims to judicial protection is a central element of this </p>


<p>development. Aware of the dangers which extremist ideologies could engender, 
Switzerland had initiated a national research programme on the extreme right, the results of 
which had been published in 2010. 
</p>
<p>16. Although the number of incidents of police brutality of a racist nature had risen in 
recent years, the number remained relatively low. In order to obtain their licence, police 
officers had to pass an exam on ethics and human rights. In addition to existing training in 
human rights, trainings in intercultural understanding and diversity had been instituted for 
police personnel. Later, the delegation emphasized that ombudspersons and mediation 
services to deal with cases of police violence existed in several cantons. 
</p>
<p>17. Concerning human trafficking and sexual exploitation, a national information and 
prevention campaign had been conducted in 2008, and cooperation agreements to facilitate 
the identification and protection of victims as well as the prosecution of perpetrators had 
been concluded with 13 cantons in 2011. In addition, a law for the protection of witnesses 
had been adopted. Later, it emphasized the national action plan against human trafficking 
adopted in October 2012, which focused on prevention, criminal proceedings, protection of 
victims and partnerships. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding fundamental freedoms, Switzerland emphasized the existing diversity of 
religions and efforts to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the different religious 
communities, without discrimination or exclusion. Concerning the popular initiative on the 
prohibition of the construction of minarets, the delegation emphasized that the ban touched 
on neither existing minarets nor on the construction of new places of worship and that 
freedom of religion is guaranteed. Since 2009, the federal authorities had engaged in 
dialogue with the Muslim population with a view to addressing fears and preconceptions. 
</p>
<p>19. Further to several milestones it celebrated in 2011 concerning gender equality, 
Switzerland emphasized its efforts with regard to the principle of equal wages, in the area 
of domestic violence, the prohibition of forced marriages and female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>20. Regarding children and youths, Switzerland noted that it had signed, in 2010, the 
Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation 
and Abuse and submitted reports under the optional protocols to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (CRC). It had also taken steps nationally to strengthen legislative and 
practical measures for the protection of children, including on the aspects of international 
child abduction or protection against cybercrime, and to take account more fully of the 
particularities of children during civil procedures or in the juvenile justice system. 
Switzerland reaffirmed that corporal punishment of children in school was prohibited in all 
Cantons and, later, highlighted programmes in place to prevent the suicide of youth. 
</p>
<p>21. Concerning persons with disabilities, Switzerland highlighted existing national 
legislation and policy measures, and progress achieved in eliminating inequalities, 
including with regard to access to buildings, public transport and other services. The 
ratification of the United Nations convention in this area was under way. 
</p>
<p>22. Furthermore, the delegation noted that measures would also be taken in the coming 
years to improve the legal framework for same sex couples. Starting 2013, registered 
partnerships would have the same rights as married couples with respect to name. In 
addition, conditions for the changing of name, sex or civil status would be relaxed. 
</p>
<p>23. In relation to national minorities, the delegation highlighted important improvements 
concerning linguistic minorities, but acknowledged that the question of places of stay and 
transit for travellers remained a delicate subject of discussion. 
</p>
<p>24. In line with its humanitarian tradition, Switzerland aimed to pursue a welcoming 
migration policy, offering good conditions for regular migrants and a functioning asylum 
system. The ongoing public debate in this area had to be seen in the context of the </p>


<p>proportion of foreign residents in the country, which, with 22 per cent, was among the 
highest on the continent. A number of measures were envisaged to further facilitate 
integration and additional resources were allocated to fight discrimination in the areas of 
education and work, and in residential areas. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding victims of domestic violence, the legislation envisaged a right to stay 
after the dissolution of the family in certain circumstances. For victims of trafficking, a 
reflection period of one month and a permit to stay for the duration of the criminal 
procedure could be granted, subject to further extension in the most severe cases. 
</p>
<p>26. In 2011, legislative amendments had also been made with regard to the deportation 
of persons in an irregular situation, which had made the execution of deportations more 
transparent and subject to independent control. 
</p>
<p>27. In conclusion, the delegation emphasized the importance which Switzerland placed 
on defending the universal application of human rights, noting that the federal and cantonal 
governments were actively committed to that purpose. Although not everything was 
perfect, human rights were so intimately linked to the culture and values of Switzerland that 
it was impossible to imagine its very existence without human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>28. During the interactive dialogue, 80 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>29. Maldives thanked Switzerland for the responses to its advance questions. Maldives 
acknowledged the efforts by Switzerland since the last review but stated that human rights 
could always be improved in every country. Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Mauritania stated that, despite legal provisions to guarantee gender equality at all 
level, disparities still existed in the labour sector. It encouraged Switzerland to complement 
political and legal strategy with a sociocultural and educational approach. Mauritania 
encouraged Switzerland to continue to promote a coherent approach for promotion of 
human rights, particularly in the field of treatment of migrants, fight against racism, 
xenophobia and other forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>31. Mexico highlighted the ratification of OP-CEDAW and OP-CAT and the recent 
establishment of a national commission to prevent torture. It hoped for a prompt ratification 
of CPED. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Morocco asked about developments in the consultations on the ratification of CRPD 
and the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR). It encouraged Switzerland to pursue its efforts in the fight against religious

coordination between the Confederation and the cantons for implementation of 
recommendations from UPR and treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>33. The Netherlands commended Switzerland on its good overall human rights record, 
but stated that challenges still remained, one of which was gender equality, especially in the 
labour market. It was pleased to note that many NGOs had been consulted in the process of 
preparing the national report. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. New Zealand welcomed the establishment of the National Commission for the 
Prevention of Torture and acknowledged the existence of bodies working to protect human 
rights. It remained concerned about issues faced by migrant women, particularly the 
residence status of those who become victims of domestic violence. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>35. Nicaragua recalled that during its first review Switzerland had received several 
recommendations regarding social challenges such as the situation of migrants, asylum 
requests and trafficking in persons. It acknowledged the progress achieved in those areas. 
Nicaragua made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Nigeria welcomed the ongoing efforts of Switzerland to ensure that popular 
initiatives to amend the Swiss constitution were more compatible with international law. It 
also welcomed the establishment of the Resource Centre for Human Rights and 
commended Switzerland for granting residence permits to individuals whose repatriation 
would have constituted a violation of the principle of non-refoulement under CAT. It made 
a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>37. Norway was concerned at reports of weak institutional guarantees against 
discrimination and initiatives incompatible with international human rights standards, such 
as the ban on constructing minarets, and the underrepresentation of women in decision-
making positions in public office, political parties, the diplomatic service and the judiciary. 
Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Pakistan expressed concern that the reputation of Switzerland as an open and 
tolerant country embracing diversity had been tarnished following the ban on constructing 
minarets. It was also concerned that no legal measures had been adopted to monitor the 
activities of political parties promoting racism and intolerance. Pakistan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Palestine noted efforts to coordinate measures to prevent racism and xenophobia, but 
was concerned at negative attitudes of part of the population towards foreigners and

xenophobia. Concerning trafficking of women and girls, it noted the adoption of a 
comprehensive strategy prevent such crimes and bring to justice those responsible. 
</p>

concerned that migrants, especially women, remained vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. 
It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>42.<b> </b>Poland welcomed a revision of the Constitution reinforcing guarantees regarding 
access to justice and the independence of the judiciary, and the establishment of the 
National Commission for the Prevention of Torture. It noted, however, a lack of progress in 
combating racist and xenophobic attitudes. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. The Republic of Moldova congratulated Switzerland on its mid-term report on the 
implementation of the recommendations from the first UPR cycle. It wished to know the 
additional measures undertaken to counteract excessive use of force by the police. It also 
congratulated Switzerland for the progress made in the fight against domestic violence. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44.<b> </b>Spain highlighted the Swiss efforts to improve the legislation protecting human

Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. The Russian Federation noted with satisfaction the progress made by Switzerland in 
implementing international obligations on human rights. However, it also noted some </p>


<p>problems in protecting such rights and expressed concern at the recent desecration of the

</p>
<p>46. Rwanda noted that the Federal Constitution recognized respect for human dignity 
and equality as a fundamental principle on which Swiss law was based. It praised

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Slovenia commended Switzerland on its active role in the Human Rights Council, 
on ratifying OP-CAT and on establishing the National Commission for the Prevention of 
Torture. It welcomed the piloting of the Swiss Resource Centre for Human Rights, although 
it was not in accordance with the Paris Principles. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. South Africa noted remaining challenges in the areas of racial discrimination and 
gender equality. It expressed concern about the treatment of non-nationals, inequalities in 
economic, social and cultural rights, violence against women and the situation of foreign 
women remaining in abusive relationships for fear of losing their residence permits. South 
Africa made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Benin welcomed measures adopted to protect child rights and the entry into force of 
the Federal Act on the Criminal Procedure Applicable to Minors. It also welcomed the 
establishment of a federal commission to address migration issues. Benin made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>51. Sri Lanka commended efforts to strengthen institutional frameworks, including

</p>
<p>55. Tunisia noted Government initiatives to ensure that amendments to the Constitution

State officials took a clear stance against the scourge of racism, including hostility towards 
Muslims and racist or xenophobic political discourse. Tunisia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>56. Turkey said that prohibiting minarets was not worthy of the country&#8217;s outstanding 
image and reputation in human rights. It was concerned about growing xenophobia and </p>


<p>intolerance and about the inappropriate use of article 261bis of the Criminal Code against 
persons who had expressed their opinions about historical events. Turkey made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the creation 
of the Swiss Resource Centre for Human Rights and efforts to combat human trafficking. It 
encouraged Switzerland to enact legislation to tackle the sexual exploitation of women and 
girls and ensure that victims received support. It encouraged ratification of CPED and 
CRPD. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>58. The United States of America was concerned at reports of insufficient care, lengthy 
detention and the treatment of migrants held in immigration detention. It was also 
concerned about the lack of detention facilities allowing for unaccompanied minors seeking

groups were deprived of their right to express their cultural and religious traditions. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Uruguay noted the cooperation of Switzerland with the universal human rights

international human rights law. It asked whether child prostitution and the worst forms of 
child labour had been prohibited. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Uzbekistan welcomed the establishment of the Swiss Resource Centre for Human 
Rights, but noted reports of shortcomings in combating racism and xenophobia, including 
the excessive use of force by police against immigrants. It also noted that International 
Labour Organization (ILO) experts had called upon Switzerland to take steps to protect 
children, especially those involved in prostitution. Uzbekistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Viet Nam recognized that Switzerland, a country well known for its peaceful 
environment and human rights record, had spared no efforts in ensuring the rule of law, 
social welfare and gender equality. However, it expressed concern at the reported growth in 
racial discrimination and human trafficking. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>62. Algeria highlighted that even a developed country was not immune to human rights 
weaknesses. It was concerned at an upsurge in racism, intolerance and xenophobia. 
According to Algeria, racism, particularly Islamophobia, was evident in public 
consultations such as those leading to a ban on minarets construction. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Angola noted Swiss efforts and commitment to combating racial discrimination. It 
asked what stage had been reached in consultations on draft amendments to legislation to 
more strictly regulate the right of foreigners to integration and increase their active 
participation. Angola made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. Argentina commended Switzerland on establishing the Swiss Resource Centre for 
Human Rights and welcomed amendments to the Civil Code guaranteeing equality between 
spouses with regard to names and the right to nationality. Argentina made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Switzerland thanked the delegations participating in the interactive dialogue for their 
interest in the functioning of the Confederation and the human rights situation in the 
country. With regard to matters raised during the dialogue and questions submitted in 
advance, the delegation provided the following comments. 
</p>
<p>66. Regarding the compatibility of popular initiatives with human rights, the delegation 
explained that the mechanisms of direct democracy were an essential part of the Swiss 
political tradition. Thus, popular initiatives were critical to secure the confidence existing 
between the State and its citizens. At the same time, Switzerland was aware of the </p>


<p>challenges posed by some popular initiatives vis-&#224;-vis fundamental freedoms. In 2010 and 
2011, the Federal Council had prepared two reports proposing solutions and concrete 
measures to address this situation, envisaging also the possibility of extending grounds to 
invalidate popular initiatives to the infringement of the essence of fundamental 
Constitutional rights. 
</p>
<p>67. In response to recommendations that Switzerland accede to the First Optional 
Protocol to ICCPR, the delegation noted that the European Convention of Human Rights 
provided the same guarantees and a well-established control mechanism. Switzerland had 
joined this mechanism 35 years ago and accession to a parallel mechanism of protection 
thus did not seem urgent or indispensable. However, considering its commitment made 
during the first UPR review, the Government was indeed considering acceding to the 
Optional Protocol and had requested the new Resource Centre for Human Rights to prepare 
a comparative study on the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee and the 
Strasbourg Court. 
</p>
<p>68. On OP-CAT and the national mechanism of protection, the delegation recalled that 
the National Commission for the Prevention of Torture, established in 2010, was 
independent and tasked with visiting places of detention on a regular basis. The 
Commission had established a dialogue with the competent authorities and with national 
and regional partners. In its most recent report, the Commission had concluded that the 
material conditions of detention in Switzerland were generally good, although some gaps 
remained. 
</p>
<p>69. Regarding the situation of persons with disabilities, the process of ratifying CRPD 
ongoing. In that respect, the Federal Council aimed at suggesting to the Parliament the 
accession to the Convention within the ongoing legislative period (2011&#8211;2015). 
</p>
<p>70. Regarding the possible establishment of a national human rights institution, 
extensive consultations by the Federal Council had led to the conclusion that, indeed, the 
support such an institution could bring was necessary. In July 2009, the Federal Council 
had thus decided to launch the Swiss Centre of Expertise in Human Rights as a five-year 
pilot project. The Centre had begun its activities in May 2011 and would be subject to an 
evaluation in 2014, with a view to its possible continuation under the framework of the 
Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>71. Concerning issues of discrimination and integration, Switzerland considered that 
constant efforts were required on the part of the State to address these. Given its legal and 
institutional specificities, Switzerland had adopted a sectorial approach. Instead of a 
national plan or a general law it had opted for a long-term strategy supported by the 
Confederation, the cantons and the communes. In line with the country&#8217;s monistic legal 
tradition, the ICERD provisions were considered framework law in the country and the 
Federal Tribunal had used them in its jurisprudence. The Federal Council and Parliament 
thus considered that the current legislation offered enough protection against the different 
forms of discrimination. Regarding racist organizations, the delegation noted that, although 
Switzerland did not have a specific law banning them, measures were taken against any 
organization pursuing an illegal purpose. 
</p>
<p>72. On the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW), the delegation noted that Switzerland, 
like other European countries, was not considering its accession in the near future. 
</p>
<p>73. Armenia expressed appreciation for the country&#8217;s balanced policy on national and 
religious minorities, as experienced by the Armenian community, with a commitment to 
justice, impartiality and human values. It noted its ongoing policy to protect persons with 
disabilities, but highlighted that migration management remained a challenge. Armenia 
made recommendations. </p>


<p>74. Australia welcomed initiatives to strengthen Swiss protection of human rights, 
particularly for asylum seekers and children, and prevent torture. It commended 
constitutional amendments to reinforce access to justice and the independence of the 
judiciary, gender equality and women&#8217;s rights, and legislation to combat violence against 
</p>
<p>women and trafficking in women. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Bahrain said that human trafficking remained a major challenge and urged 
Switzerland to develop a national strategy to address this phenomenon and protect and 
assist victims. It asked about measures to ensure that female victims of violence were 
protected and had access to redress. Bahrain made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>76. Bangladesh highlighted concerns expressed by several treaty bodies over the 
excessive use of force by police against asylum seekers, migrants and persons of African 
origin, the ban on construction of minarets, violence against women, high unemployment 
among migrants and women, and discrimination against travellers. Bangladesh made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Belarus noted Swiss efforts to fulfil its international human rights obligations, but 
noted that it had entered many reservations on international instruments and did not 
sufficiently cooperate with special procedures concerning country visits. It was concerned 
at the excessive use of force by police against migrants and asylum seekers. Belarus made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Romania commended the national report for reporting both on the position of the 
Government and civil society on the situation of human rights in Switzerland. It noted the 
ratification of various international instruments since the first review. It mentioned Swiss-
Romanian cooperation in combating trafficking in persons. Romania made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
