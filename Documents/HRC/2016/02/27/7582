<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 13/23 on enhancement of international cooperation in the field of 
human rights, the Human Rights Council requested the Human Rights Advisory Committee 
to explore ways and means to enhance international cooperation in the field of human 
rights, taking into account the views of States and other relevant stakeholders, and to 
submit proposals in that regard to the Council at its nineteenth session. In order to give 
effect to that mandate, the Advisory Committee, pursuant to its recommendation 5/4, 
established a drafting group chaired by Dheerujlall Seetulsingh. Emmanuel Decaux was 
appointed the first Rapporteur of the drafting group. Upon his resignation from the 
Committee, he was replaced by Laurence Boisson de Chazournes. Following its 
consideration at its sixth session of a working paper on the subject of the mandate 
submitted to it by the drafting group, the Committee considered a progress report on the 
same subject at its seventh session and submitted that report to the Council at the Council&#8217;s 
sixteenth session. At that session, the Committee also prepared and distributed a 
questionnaire to seek further views from States and relevant stakeholders. Following its 
analysis of the relevant texts and the responses received to its questionnaires, the 
Committee submitted its final report to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session 
(A/HRC/19/74). 
</p><p>2. A multi-stakeholder seminar on the enhancement of international cooperation in 
the field of human rights was organized by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 15 February 2013. The seminar discussed, 
among other things, the final report of the Advisory Committee. Pursuant to Council 
resolution 19/33, a report on the seminar was submitted to the Council at its twenty-third 
session (A/HRC/23/20). 
3. At its twenty-third session, in resolution 23/3, the Council requested the Advisory 
Committee to prepare, in consultation with States, a more focused and in-depth study on the 
ways and means to enhance international cooperation in the field of human rights, 
including, but not limited to, the identification of areas where further progress could be 
made, taking into account responses received as a result of further consultations with States, 
and to submit a progress report to the Council at its twenty-sixth session. 
</p>
<p>4. In order to give effect to resolution 23/3, the Advisory Committee, pursuant to its 
recommendation 11/2, set up a drafting group at its eleventh session consisting of Saeed 
Mohamed Al Faihani, Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Mario Luis Coriolano, Latif 
H&#252;seynov, Alfred Ntunduguru Karokora, Obiora Chinedu Okafor (Rapporteur), Katharina 
Pabel and Dheerujlall Seetulsingh (Chair), as well as Shigeki Sakamoto, whose term ended 
on 30 September 2013. Subsequently, Mikhail Lebedev and Jean Ziegler also joined the 
drafting group. The Committee tasked the drafting group with the preparation of a draft 
progress report to guide the in-depth discussion to be held at its twelfth session, in February 
</p><p>2014. The drafting group also held preliminary discussions on the mandate during that 
session and, after receiving approval from the Advisory Committee as a whole, prepared a 
questionnaire that was then circulated to States. The Rapporteur of the drafting group 
subsequently prepared a draft report, which was considered and endorsed by the drafting 
group in the period between the eleventh and twelfth sessions of the Committee.1 That draft 
formed the basis for the present progress report.

<p><b> II. Some key challenges to international cooperation  
in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. The challenges to international cooperation in the field of human rights are well 
known and therefore will not be discussed here in any depth. Yet, given the ways in which, 
too often, they can seriously set back progress towards the realization of human rights the 
world over, they deserve some measure of discussion in any study on the subject. As the 
Advisory Committee has noted (see A/HRC/19/74, paras. 23-25), the overall tone of the texts 
conferring a mandate on the Human Rights Council is one of constructive international 
dialogue and cooperation. However, such dialogue and cooperation towards the realization of 
human rights everywhere is unlikely to be constructive without mutual tolerance and respect 
(see Council resolution 13/23).2 This kind of cultural sensitivity should not of course imply 
cultural absolutism.3 As importantly, significant levels of selectivity can weaken moral 
authority and capacity to rapidly and robustly foster a culture of human rights in many parts 
of the world. It bears mentioning here that the decision to create and implement the universal 
periodic review process of the Human Rights Council was driven in part by this kind of 
realization (see General Assembly resolution 60/251, para. 4). As the Committee has also 
noted, international cooperation in the field of human rights is also harmed when it is reduced 
in any appreciable degree to a mere juxtaposition of national interests or the logic of power 
relations (A/HRC/19/74, para. 35) A constructive dialogue that drives and reflects meaningful 
international cooperation is far less likely to take place if it is not based on the idea that 
human rights knowledge ought to circulate in a multidirectional way among the world&#8217;s 
peoples. As importantly, there is a growing realization within and beyond the Human Rights 
Council of the seriousness of the negative impact of the inadequate resources available to 
assist certain countries with their participation in the universal periodic review process and in 
their the implementation of the recommendations that result therefrom (see Council 
resolutions 19/33 and 23/3). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Deepening civil society involvement 
</b></p>
<p>6. The important roles played by civil society groups, especially non-governmental 
organizations, in the human rights field are widely appreciated and a detailed discussion of 
that subject need not detain us here. The critical task that is now before the United Nations 
in general and the Human Rights Council in particular is to find ways and means of 
optimally harnessing the potential of those groups to contribute to the human rights work of 
the United Nations. As the Advisory Committee has suggested (see A/HRC/19/74, para. 
49), it is now time to go beyond the usual rhetoric and move towards practical institutional 
changes that will give effect to the apparent consensus in the Council on the need to deepen 
the involvement of civil society actors in international cooperation in the human rights area. 
</p>
<p>7. For one, as the Advisory Committee suggested in its first report on the present 
subject, the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations, a standing committee of the 
Economic and Social Council which is currently made up entirely of States, may need to be 
restructured to include in some, perhaps advisory, form the accredited and legitimate 
representatives of civil society organizations. In this connection, the tripartite model

<p>adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) may be instructive. At ILO, all the 
key stakeholders in the labour relations field (States, employers&#8217; groups and labour unions) 
are significantly accommodated and afforded a meaningful standing and voice within the 
main organs of the organization. 
</p>
<p>8. Second, local civil society organizations, especially those in the developing world, 
tend to be underrepresented among the groups that actually participate directly, actively and 
meaningfully in the human rights work of the United Nations. This raises important issues 
regarding the global inclusiveness, accountability and legitimacy of the cohort of such 
organizations which tends to dominate the space reserved for &#8220;other stakeholders&#8221; within 
the United Nations human rights system.4 Clearly, there is thus a need to find ways and 
means of at least reducing this apparent inclusion-deficit in the representation of civil 
society organizations within that system. One suggestion is to reform the way in which 
access to United Nations debates is afforded to them. For example, rather than requiring all 
such organizations that wish to participate in the human rights work of the United Nations 
to first obtain consultative status, a second path to access could be created which would 
allow local civil society organizations in developing countries that have been granted 
similar recognition and status by their regional and/or national human rights bodies to gain, 
in consequence, automatic access to United Nations human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Enhancing the involvement of national human rights 
institutions 
</b></p>
<p>9. The focus here is on how the contributions of national human rights institutions to 
the human rights work of the United Nations can be optimally enhanced. It should be noted 
at the outset that formal and informal global or regional-level cooperation among such 
institutions is now the norm rather than the exception. Within the framework and the 
structure of the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, which is registered and based in Geneva, and 
at the continental and other levels, national human rights institutions the world over have 
met regularly to share experiences and best practices, and to advocate new themes 
enhancing the cause of human rights.5 There is significant evidence, for instance from the 
International Coordinating Committee&#8217;s engagement with the Nigerian national human 
rights institution, that this way of interaction and cooperation among institutions, and 
especially their mechanisms for classifying and sanctioning those institutions which do not 
meet their laid down standards, can produce important dividends for the effort to realize 
human rights. However, if the full potential of the national human rights institutions to 
contribute to the realization of human rights is to be harnessed by the United Nations 
system, the involvement of those bodies and their various global and regional associations 
in United Nations human rights work must be deepened. This can be done, for example, by 
finding ways to resource them more adequately, including through lending more support 
staff, and information exchanges between similarly situated institutions. Responses 
received to the questionnaires distributed by the Advisory Committee suggest a widespread 
awareness among States of the need to strengthen these bodies. They also tend to

<p>acknowledge that some State-to-State cooperation aimed at achieving these ends already 
takes place. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Enhancing efforts to realize the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>10. There is little disagreement, if any, within and beyond the Human Rights Council 
that international cooperation is required to address the basic structural obstacles, such as 
poverty and underdevelopment, to the realization of many economic, social and cultural 
rights, as well as certain civil and political rights.6 In this regard, the comparative advantage 
enjoyed by United Nations human rights bodies, especially the Human Rights Council, lies 
in the area of finding ways and means to give effect to the right to development both within 
and between States.  
</p>
<p>11. Many States agree that the post-2015 development agenda should adhere to human 
rights principles, including the principle that all peoples are entitled to the enjoyment of the 
right to economic, social and political development, as set out in, for example, the  Declaration on the Right to Development and article 22 of the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights.7 The basic emergent idea here is that the effort to realize the right to 
development ought no longer to be based primarily on a concept of &#8220;charitable giving&#8221; but 
should be founded on the normative entitlement of every human being and society to be 
free from extreme poverty and deprivation, one that ought to be stoutly supported and 
enhanced by a system of accountability. Instructively in this regard, in its recent report, the 
High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda8 called on the United Nations, its 
Member States, regional organizations, civil society and all concerned to make the 
following &#8220;five big transformative shifts&quot;: 
</p>
<p>(a) Move from reducing to ending poverty (with no one left behind); 
(b) Put sustainability at the core of development; 
(c) Transform economies for jobs and inclusive growth; 
(d) Build peace, as well as effective, open and accountable institutions for all;  
</p>
<p> (e) Forge a new global partnership, based at least in part on mutual 
accountability. 
</p>
<p>12. The prominence and emphasis given to accountability in the conception and 
articulation of these &#8220;five big transformative shifts&#8221; reflect the gradual congealing in our 
time of a new consensus on the ways to advance the development agenda. It is a reflection 
of this gradually emerging consensus that the Secretary-General, in his report on the post-
2015 development agenda,9 also called for the entrenchment of accountability in the 
conception and execution of that agenda. Indeed, at the very least, in paragraph 75 of that

contemporary international law: towards a South-North entente&#8221; in <i>African Journal of International 
and Comparative Law</i>, vol. 7 (1995), p. 865. </p>


<p>report, which is itself based in part on the High-Level Panel&#8217;s report, it is stated firmly that, 
if the kind of sustainable development agenda that the Secretary-General desires is to take 
root, there is a need to establish a participatory monitoring framework for tracking progress, 
and mutual accountability mechanisms for all stakeholders. In paragraph 81 of the same 
report, reference is made to the need to ensure that the international community is equipped 
with the right institutions and tools for addressing the challenges of implementing the 
sustainable development agenda at the national level. Thus, the idea that everyone involved 
in the development process the world over must be fully accountable appears to have a 
central, and even critical, place in current United Nations thinking about the ways and 
means of advancing the development agenda post-2015. 
</p>
<p>13. Against this background, one way of enhancing international cooperation in this 
important aspect of the human rights area is to collect and list core violations of the right to 
development (many of which already exist as hard law) in a revised and enhanced 
Declaration on the Right to Development with an in-built and robust tracking, reporting and 
monitoring mechanism, or perhaps even in a new treaty on the right to development (which 
the Council has been exploring for some time now). In this respect, article 22 of the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the increasing number of well-reasoned 
decisions in which it has been interpreted and applied to real-life situations in the African 
context are a kind of forerunner. For example, the now celebrated <i>Endorois </i>case decided by 
the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the fact of the compliance of 
Kenya with it to a significant extent serve as a pointer to what the future could hold in this 
regard at the global level.10 Other important decisions issued by the African Commission in 
the present regard include<i> D. R. Congo v. Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda</i>, 11 where it found a 
violation of the right to development; <i>Association Pour la Sauvegarde de la Paix au 
Burundi v</i>. <i>Tanzania et al</i>;12 and the<i> Southern Cameroons </i>case.13 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Deepening South-South cooperation in the human rights 
area 
</b></p>
<p>14. South-South cooperation is already well recognized within the United Nations 
system as a way of strengthening its work across the board. According to the United 
Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, this form of cooperation is a broad framework 
for collaboration among countries of the South in the political, economic, social, cultural, 
environmental and technical domains. Involving two or more developing countries, it can 
take place on a bilateral, regional, subregional or interregional basis. Developing countries 
share knowledge, skills, expertise and resources to meet their development goals through 
concerted efforts &#8230; Collaboration in which traditional donor countries and multilateral 
organizations facilitate South-South initiatives through the provision of funding, training

<p>and management and technological systems as well as other forms of support is referred to 
as triangular cooperation.14 
</p>
<p>15. According to the same office, the key feature of South-South cooperation is that it 
is initiated, organized and managed by developing countries themselves. Yet non-State 
actors do actively participate. An important goal of this approach to international 
cooperation is to increase the quantity and enhance the quality of international development 
cooperation.  A key benefit of this form of cooperation is the use of experience and capacity 
that already exist and the development of new capacities in developing countries. A second 
benefit is that, as is well recognized now, it tends to rankle less and be received better in the 
receiving country when the donor is a similarly situated country. Another benefit of such 
cooperation is that it is often significantly less expensive to execute than other forms of 
international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>16. Clearly, the human rights field does fit, and indeed is actively included, within this 
rubric. This much is recognized in the concluding section of the report of the seminar on the 
enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights convened by 
OHCHR in Geneva in February 2013 (A/HRC/23/20). The more important questions for 
present purposes are how to expand and deepen the utilization of this important form of 
international cooperation in the human rights field and what role the Human Rights Council 
can play in attaining those objectives. How, for example, can the experience and capacity 
that already exist within certain countries of the South be deployed in other developing 
countries which are not as endowed in the relevant respect, thereby developing new human 
rights resource capacities in the latter countries in a less expensive and more effective way? 
And what role, if any, exists for triangular cooperation in this regard? 
</p>
<p>17. To take the African continent as an example, some of the countries there are much 
richer in terms of human resources than others. It will often be significantly cheaper, more 
socioculturally and politically sensitive and therefore more effective in the long run to find 
ways of deploying human rights experts from countries that are more endowed in this 
regard to assist countries in the region which are not as well endowed. But because none of 
these countries is financially rich, triangular cooperation has an important role to play in 
boosting available funding and providing important technology to such projects. Triangular 
cooperation involving OHCHR could also be utilized as a quality assurance mechanism. 
</p>
<p>18. In this connection, long-existing programmes such as the Technical Aid Corps 
scheme of Nigeria, which is almost entirely funded by that country on its own, serve as 
important models and guides for the kinds of programmes and projects which the Human 
Rights Council, through OHCHR, could take steps to collaborate with, provide greater 
funding and support to and, in the end, harness.15 Already the scheme collaborates actively 
with the Commonwealth Secretariat and has signed a memorandum of understanding with 
that body. Established in 1987, it assists States in Africa, the Caribbean, the 
Commonwealth and other specific regions in their socioeconomic development efforts, 
through the posting of qualified persons to serve for two-year terms in the relevant 
countries, in accordance with their expressed needs. A key expressed goal of this 
programme is to share Nigerian know-how and expertise with the recipient countries. Thus 
far, over 35 countries have benefited from this scheme. 
</p>
<p>19. As some countries suggested in response to the questionnaires distributed by the 
Advisory Committee, these kinds of South-South exchanges should be expanded and

<p>deepened with the support of the international community, especially the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Deepening human rights education 
</b></p>
<p>20. Given that, even with all their limitations, human rights now appear to be all that 
we have to interrogate the barbarisms of power16 and that human rights education and 
training is a key way of realizing human rights, there is an imperative need to take such 
education and training extremely seriously as an aspect of international cooperation in the 
field of human rights. With the help of the Advisory Committee, the Human Rights Council 
has made significant efforts to meet this need. In March 2011, the Council adopted the 
United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training, based on a draft 
produced by the Advisory Committee. This text was later adopted by the General Assembly 
in its resolution 66/137. Among other things, the Declaration makes the important point that 
human rights education should become an integral part of the educational curriculum, a 
point that many States have also emphasized. As importantly, article 12 of the Declaration 
lays stress upon the need for international cooperation at all levels to support and reinforce 
efforts at the local level to implement human rights education and training.17 The emphasis 
on human rights education as being one of the most effective means of promoting human 
rights cannot be gainsaid.18 It is one of the most practical methods of achieving 
international cooperation in the human rights field.19 
</p>
<p>21. Yet a partial paradigm shift may be required if international cooperation in the 
conception and execution of the project of human rights education is to achieve its full 
potential. It bears emphasizing here that human rights education ought to be founded much 
more than has hitherto been the case on a constructive dialogue among peoples and 
civilizations, and far less on an alienating and unhelpful sort of monologue in which one 
section of the world instructs the rest on human rights. While countries do differ in the 
degree to which they respect human rights norms, nowhere in the world is absolute respect 
for human rights as yet a mass cultural fact.20 So every society has something to learn from 
others. Thus, human rights education cannot be a one-way traffic and cannot flow in a 
unidirectional manner from one section of our global neighbourhood to the others.21 
Genuine international cooperation in the area of human rights education ought to involve 
two-way or multidirectional exchanges of information, ideas and knowledge. This much is 
recognized in the concluding section of the report of the seminar on the enhancement of 
international cooperation in the field of human rights, convened by OHCHR in Geneva in 
February 2013 (A/HRC/23/20, para. 52).

<p><b> VIII. Strengthening the global infrastructure for human rights 
cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Universal adherence to human rights texts and bodies 
</b></p>
<p>22. As the Advisory Committee noted in its first report on international cooperation in 
the field of human rights (A/HRC/19/74), a major priority of such international cooperation 
should be securing the universal application of international human rights instruments, in 
line with the objective established at the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights. 
Since the introduction and establishment of the universal periodic review process in 2006, 
the rate of human rights treaty ratification has been increasing exponentially.22 But 
ratification of all such treaties by every State has not yet been attained. In consciousness-
raising activities, including the universal periodic review process itself, increased emphasis 
needs to be placed on the necessity for universal ratification and application. As the 
Committee also noted in its first report, the Human Rights Council should launch a 
&#8220;reservations dialogue&#8221; to persuade States to withdraw reservations that serve no purpose 
and to refrain from entering reservations that are contrary to the purposes and objectives of 
the treaty concerned (ibid. para.41). States should also be encouraged, where necessary, to 
enter declarations submitting themselves to scrutiny by bodies set up under such treaties. 
Additionally, international cooperation should focus on bringing together all States and 
actors to work for the promotion and protection of human rights. Every effort should be 
made to ensure the universal participation of States in such cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Consolidating and synchronizing State reporting 
</b></p>
<p>23. Given that many States, including those surveyed by the Advisory Committee for 
the present report, have complained of excessive reporting obligations, it is increasingly 
being recognized that there is a need to find ways and means of consolidating and 
synchronizing State reporting to the various United Nations human rights bodies, so as to 
reduce the associated workload for States, relieve some of the great pressure that has been 
put on the rather scarce resources of very many developing and smaller countries, promote 
efficiency and enhance holistic reporting by target States.23 This is essential to support their 
ability to engage in international cooperation in the human rights field. One current 
proposal is to find a way to harmonize the periodicity of State reporting by ensuring that 
every State submits only one comprehensive report every set number of years to all the 
treaty bodies.24 For the avoidance of doubt, however, the universal periodic review 
reporting process would remain outside the treaty body reporting system.

<p><b> C. Strengthening the subsidiary bodies and special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>24. As confirmed by the responses of many States to the survey administered by the 
Advisory Committee, there is widespread realization that the financial and human resources 
available to assist the subsidiary bodies and special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council in undertaking their work is at best limited.25 Against this background, the Council, 
in its resolution 16/21, requested the Secretary-General to ensure the availability of 
adequate resources within the regular OHCHR budget to support the full implementation by 
special procedures of their mandates (para. 32). Further, the Council recognized the need 
for extra funding to support the work of the special procedures and welcomed further 
voluntary contributions by Member States, emphasizing that those contributions, to the 
extent possible, should be unearmarked (para. 33). The Council should step up its 
commendable efforts to ensure that its subsidiary bodies and special procedures are 
resourced adequately. Note should also be taken of the fact that there is a particularly 
urgent need to better resource the Advisory Committee, which is not even resourced at the 
inadequate special procedure level and whose members currently have to rely to a 
significant degree on resources from outside the United Nations  system to undertake their 
work in an effective manner. 
</p>
<p>25. Another kind of challenge that is faced particularly by the special procedures is the 
reluctance of all too many States to cooperate with them, especially in the area of issuing 
standing invitations to them to visit their countries.26 This is so despite the Council&#8217;s regular 
reaffirmation of the need for States to cooperate with the special procedures (see Council 
resolution 16/21, para. 23). Thus far, fewer than 40 per cent of Member States have issued 
such standing invitations. Yet standing invitations represent an opportunity for States to make 
a cooperative gesture by inviting special procedure mandate holders to perform their work. 
While maintaining the voluntary character of the issuance of standing invitations, the Council 
should consider establishing an opt-out system in which States that do not wish to issue them 
must take active steps to opt out,  and are taken to have consented to issue standing invitations 
if they do not opt out of doing so before an agreed date. 
</p>
<p>26. There is also a need for greater coordination between the Council&#8217;s subsidiary 
bodies and its special procedures, as well as within each of those categories. There is of 
course a Special Procedures Coordination Committee, established in 2005, whose main 
function is to facilitate coordination among the special procedures, and between them and 
OHCHR, civil society and the broader United Nations human rights system.27 However, 
more could be done in this regard. For example, special procedure mandate holder visits to 
a particular country could be coordinated and conducted jointly to reduce the amount of 
resources and time host States spend cooperating with them, thereby increasing the 
willingness and ability of States to extend such cooperation and ultimately enhancing this 
aspect of international cooperation in the field of human rights. Special procedures and the 
Advisory Committee should also interact regularly, at least annually, to exchange ideas and 
share knowledge.

<p><b> D. Improving coordination with and among regional bodies 
</b></p>
<p>27. As the Advisory Committee observed in its first report on international cooperation 
in the field of human rights, an aspect of international cooperation that is still all too often 
neglected is the role of regional systems (A/HRC/19/74, para. 43).  Two main dimensions 
of this aspect of international cooperation may be emphasized: (a) cooperation among 
regional bodies, including greater interaction among those of a similar socioeconomic and 
political background, and (b) coordination between regional bodies on the one hand and the 
United Nations human rights system on the other. In both cases, the main goals are to share 
best practices among the relevant bodies in as deep and widespread a manner as possible, 
and to create operational efficiencies. 
</p>
<p>28. To that effect, both dimensions seem to require similar kinds of measures to 
broaden and strengthen them. Chief among such measures are the expansion and deepening 
of exchanges of staff, information, knowledge and technology among the relevant bodies, 
and the institutionalization of programmes of joint country visits and other joint activities 
among those bodies. However, such improvements in international cooperation cannot 
yield an optimal harvest unless certain operational steps are taken or enhanced. In this 
regard, it is suggested that each regional body and the Human Rights Council/OHCHR 
should establish a high-level focal point (which can either be a person or an office) to 
provide leadership, impetus and visibility in this crucial area of achieving greater 
coordination and cooperation with and among regional human rights bodies. Second, the 
greater use of technology is recommended to overcome distance, eliminate a significant 
amount of travel time and greatly reduce costs. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Strengthening the universal periodic review system 
</b></p>
<p>29. Although the universal periodic review process has now entered its second cycle, 
and the participation of civil society organizations was generally embraced and seen as a 
positive contribution during the first cycle, cooperation with civil society stakeholders, 
including non-governmental organizations, continues to be a point of disagreement among 
States.28 For one thing, while recognizing the multiple opportunities which already exist for 
stakeholder involvement in the review process, States have found the push for enhanced 
stakeholder involvement in the process to be a difficult topic to agree upon.29 One 
suggestion for enhancing the involvement of civil society organizations in the review 
process was that the Troika should arrange an informal meeting with the relevant national 
civil society organizations and national human rights institutions immediately before 
hearings in the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review in order to become better 
informed about recent developments in the countries at issue and to hear critical evaluations 
of the country reports under review.30 However, such requests for greater cooperation with 
stakeholders were not fulfilled for the second review cycle.31 Second, neither in General 
Assembly resolution 60/251 nor in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 is  the term 
&#8220;stakeholders&#8221; defined.32 In practice, though, the inclusion of stakeholders in the universal 
periodic review process is generally associated with non-governmental organizations. This 
association could be carefully expanded to include other stakeholders, such as the regional

<p>human rights bodies. A more meaningful discussion on the role of regional human rights 
bodies and other entities should help to expand the vague definition of &#8220;stakeholder&#8221; in the 
review process; and cooperation with a broader variety of stakeholders will definitely 
enhance that process. 
</p>
<p>30. The universal periodic review clearly represents an opportunity to foster 
cooperation between Member States, United Nations mechanisms and civil society. The 
review process allows us to identify the areas of human rights that the State under review  
decides to strengthen. There is a lot of practical expertise on human rights in developing 
countries that have recently experienced massive and systematic violations of human rights, 
and which were able to recover quite well in terms of their practice of democratic 
governance and the strengthening of their public policies on human rights. The Council 
should develop a system of fostering cooperation among Member States in order to ensure 
that the recommendations accepted after the review are implemented. 
</p>
<p>31. Another issue that may have to be addressed in this connection is a rationalization, 
tightening and greater focusing of the large number of recommendations that flow from the 
review process so as to make them more manageable for the target States to grapple with. 
This will likely enhance their ability to cooperate as fully as possible in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Improving the follow-up system 
</b></p>
<p>32. It is now widely recognized that the United Nations human rights system is beset 
with significant follow-up problems. There is therefore widespread agreement that, if the 
goals of international cooperation in the field of human rights are to be more rapidly and 
robustly realized, the system of follow-up to the recommendations emanating from, inter alia, 
the special procedures, the universal periodic review process and the treaty bodies requires 
great improvement. The lack of adequate resources for the special procedures to follow up on 
their recommendations has been identified as one major weakness in this regard.33 The 
provision of such resources to the special procedures and greater coordination of their follow-
up efforts with the universal periodic review follow-up processes are among the suggested 
ameliorative measures.34 
</p>
<p>33. In the latter regard, it is particularly noteworthy that, in providing for specific 
amendments to the universal periodic review system to be implemented during its second 
cycle, the Human Rights Council, in resolution 16/21 and decision 17/119, stated that the 
second and subsequent review cycles should focus on follow-up to the accepted 
recommendations from the first cycle. However, despite that proposed emphasis on follow-
up during the second and subsequent cycles, the follow-up phase is still viewed as the 
weakest phase of the review process, as there is little structure to guide States other than a 
suggestion that they provide a voluntary mid-term report to the Council. This lack of 
structure and the voluntary nature of the mid-term report might affect the effectiveness of 
international cooperation in the review process. It is therefore suggested that detailed 
guidelines and/or a model mid-term report be developed by OHCHR to assist States in the 
preparation of mid-term reports. In addition,  rather than merely stating that the submission 
of mid-term reports by States is voluntary, the Council could attach an opt-out requirement 
to that process, which could encourage and foster a greater degree of responsiveness among 
States. States would then be asked to take active steps to opt out of the submission of mid-
term reports and States which did not do so by a set date would be taken to have voluntarily 
assumed an obligation to comply.

<p>34. Another suggestion made by some States with regard to follow-up to the universal 
periodic review is that donor countries that provide foreign aid to other countries should 
tailor their programmes, at least in part, towards addressing specific review 
recommendations made to relevant recipient States. It is hoped that this will help create 
greater and much-needed synergy between international cooperation in the human rights 
field and international development efforts. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to improvement of follow-up to recommendations of the treaty bodies, 
it has been suggested that there should be better coordinated and more inclusive follow-up 
procedures, and increased cooperation between States and those bodies. One possibility is 
the development of a specific inter-committee follow-up mechanism for all the treaty 
bodies.35 Cooperation is not limited to ratification, coordination or dialogue, but also 
concerns compliance with and follow-up on obligations. A monitoring body that would 
dedicate its entire resources to encouraging cooperation in the follow-up phases of the work 
of the treaty bodies would greatly enhance this goal. In this connection some reflection on 
putting existing bodies to use may be required. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Strengthening the voluntary funds 
</b>36. There are two funds at issue here: the Universal Periodic Review Voluntary Trust 
Fund established pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 6/17 to facilitate the 
participation of developing countries, particularly least developed countries, in the 
universal periodic review mechanism; and the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical 
Assistance established pursuant to the same resolution to help, in conjunction with 
multilateral funding mechanisms, countries implement the recommendations emanating 
from the universal periodic review, in consultation with, and with the consent of, the 
country concerned. The contributions that those two funds have made, and can potentially 
make, to international cooperation in the field of human rights are not in doubt. There is in 
fact growing demand from States for access to the inadequate financial assistance available 
from the funds. One indicator of this trend is that, since early in 2013,  OHCHR has 
reviewed more than 20 new requests from various countries for funding from the Voluntary 
Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance to support their implementation of review 
recommendations (see A/HRC/24/56, para.20).  As at early in 2012, 67 requests were at 
various stages of being processed or being funded through the Universal Periodic Review 
Voluntary Trust Fund.36 
</p>
<p>37. It was against this background that the Human Rights Council, in paragraphs 14 
and 19 of its resolution 16/21, called for the strengthening of the two funds. In that 
resolution the Council concluded that the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical 
Assistance should be strengthened and operationalized in order to provide a source of 
financial and technical assistance to help countries implement the recommendations 
emanating from their review. The Council also requested that the Universal Periodic 
Review Voluntary Trust Fund should be similarly strengthened and operationalized. 
</p>
<p>38. Despite the consensus in the Human Rights Council that both the funds need to be 
strengthened, there may not be universal agreement as to the exact measures to be taken in 
this regard. One proposal in respect of both funds is to find more systematic and assured 
ways of increasing the resources available to them. This is absolutely necessary given the 
rising and genuine demand for access to the resources of the two funds, the low incidence

<p>mechanism&#8221;,  available at ww.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/VPUFinancialRequest.pdf.  </p>


<p>of State contributions to them and the gross inadequacy of the resources currently available 
from them. A combination of measures is probably required if the goal of strengthening the 
resource base of the funds is to be attained any time soon. 
</p>
<p>39. First, there is a need to shift from the current opt-in voluntary funding system to an 
equally voluntary opt-out system that could encourage and foster a greater degree of 
responsiveness among States to the resource needs for the two funds. States which do not 
belong to the category of least developed countries would be asked to take active steps to 
opt out of the voluntary obligation to contribute to the funds. States which do not do so by a 
set date would then be taken to have voluntarily assumed an obligation to fund the relevant 
fund by a set moderate baseline amount. 
</p>
<p>40. Second, an expanded notion of what constitutes a contribution to these funds may 
be required, so that in-kind contributions of human resources and technological inputs are 
seen as equally important (see A/HRC/19/50). This should be especially the case for the 
Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, which the Human Rights Council 
in its resolution 6/17, established explicitly to become a source of both financial and 
technical assistance. In-kind contributions may take the form of donations of technically 
qualified and quality-assured human resources from the relevant State. In this connection, 
the Technical Aid Corps scheme of Nigeria can serve as a model. 
</p>
<p>41. Third, as many States and stakeholders have suggested, much more attention than 
hitherto needs to be paid to non-traditional donors and South-South cooperation (see 
Council resolution 23/3 and A/HRC/19/50). As some States and stakeholders have also 
urged, broadening the donor base of the two funds is a necessity in the current 
circumstances and OHCHR should be mandated to enhance its dialogue with the 
representatives of such countries and bodies. Also, if the notion of what constitutes a 
donation is expanded to the degree suggested above, the ability of the Council and OHCHR 
to make progress in this regard will be greatly improved (see A/HRC/19/50). 
</p><p>42. Another proposal with specific regard to the Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
Technical Assistance is that the complementary role played by a wide range of stakeholders 
in the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations needs to be further 
encouraged and supported.  That fund should be re-conceived as a fund that supports not 
only States and regional groups, but a wide range of stakeholders, including national human 
rights institutions and local civil society groups (A/HRC/24/56, para.35). The argument put 
forward is that, with greater technical and financial support, those stakeholders can 
cooperate with States and regional groups to further engage with the universal periodic 
review process and encourage the implementation of review recommendations. It is also 
argued by proponents of this approach that supporting those stakeholders will increase the 
efficiency of the fund. The idea is that certain non-State stakeholders can help facilitate the 
implementation of certain recommendations more effectively than States. However, the 
long-standing debate around the legitimacy, transparency and accountability of civil society 
actors may constitute an obstacle in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Mainstreaming human rights across the global 
institutional system 
</b></p>
<p>43. The need to mainstream human rights of all categories into every aspect of 
international relations and cooperation (including trade, migration, intellectual property 
rights, finance, development and security) is regularly reiterated within the United Nations </p>


<p>system, and in particular by the Human Rights Council and OHCHR.37 While in practical 
terms the comparative advantage of ensuring that this mainstreaming actually occurs in a 
robust and rapid way may not, for various reasons, always lie with either the Council or 
OHCHR, they continue to bear the primary obligation to campaign and push for its 
realization, notwithstanding all the attendant conceptual and practical difficulties. One 
suggested practical way in which the Council and OHCHR can add practical value to this 
mainstreaming project is to enhance the strategy of inter-agency liaison and cooperation 
that they already utilize in this regard, for example through the United Nations 
Development Group&#8217;s human rights mainstreaming mechanism, which is chaired by 
OHCHR. They could do this by establishing a high-level focal point (either a person or a 
unit) as appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Strengthening human rights cooperation  
in the field of migration 
</b></p>
<p>44. The promotion of international human rights cooperation in the field of migration 
presents an opportunity to affect positively the human rights of the 232 million migrants 
worldwide through the better coordination of policymaking and protection efforts. The 
Sixth Meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, which was held in 
Mauritius in November 2012 on the theme &#8220;Enhancing the human development of migrants 
and their contribution to the development of communities and States&quot;, made major 
recommendations to countries of both origin and destination in order to combat labour 
exploitation and human trafficking while protecting victims.  For his part, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, in a report on climate change and migration, 
stressed the need for coordinated international cooperation on climate-change-induced 
migration (A/67/299, paras. 90-93). Receiving States should be encouraged to recognize 
migrant workers as a vulnerable group and to overcome reluctance to grant migrants equal 
treatment with nationals with respect to the protection of their human rights. Furthermore, 
receiving and sending States can work together to create demand-driven systems of 
migration through bilateral or multilateral labour agreements, such as that concluded 
between Mauritius and Canada. The integration of migrants into their host societies must be 
seen as a key component of international cooperation in the field of human rights, since it 
strengthens respect for core universal human rights values. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. Conclusions 
</b>45. <b>The following practical suggestions, many of which could form the basis for 
immediate action by the Council, have been made in the present report: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations of the Economic 
and Social Council, currently made up entirely of States, may need to be restructured 
to include in some advisory capacity the accredited and legitimate representatives of a 
variety of civil society actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Automatic consultative status with the Human Rights Council could be 
accorded to developing country civil society organizations that already enjoy similar 
status with their regional or national human rights institutions; 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>37
 HRC13/012E, 1 March 2013. </p>


<p><b>(c) The Council should take steps to enhance support for national human 
rights institutions, such as increasing funding for existing or new staff and for the 
exchange of knowledge among similarly situated national human rights institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) There is a need to find ways of instituting tracking, monitoring and peer-
review mechanisms, such as through the negotiation of an enhanced Declaration on 
the Right to Development and the mainstreaming of the right to development in the 
universal periodic review process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) South-South cooperation in the area of human rights, both in its regular 
and triangular forms, should be deepened by supporting greater human rights 
cooperation among developing or similarly-situated countries, while using existing 
capacity in one country to help others. The Technical Aid Corps scheme of Nigeria is 
an excellent example of this form of existing South-South cooperation that can be 
deepened and expanded with the support of the Council; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Human rights education should be deepened and enhanced by ensuring 
that it becomes much more of a two-way street than is currently the case; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The global infrastructure for cooperation in the human rights field needs 
to be strengthened by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Greater and more effective international human rights cooperation to 
better protect migrants around the world, for which there is an urgent need; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Encouraging the universal ratification of human rights instruments and, 
as far as possible, the inclusion of all States and actors in the process of 
international cooperation in the human rights field; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Consolidating and synchronizing State reporting to reduce &#8220;reporting 
fatigue&#8221; among States; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv)  Increasing the resources available to the subsidiary bodies of the Council 
and its special procedures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Coordinating and unifying almost all visits by special procedure 
mandate holders to a particular country, in order to reduce the amount of 
resources and time host States spend cooperating with them;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Implementing a voluntary opt-out system for the issuance of standing 
invitations to special procedures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) Improving coordination between the Council and regional bodies, and 
among regional bodies themselves, by encouraging the establishment of focal 
points in each body to concentrate on this task and enhancing the use of 
technology in pursuit of this goal; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(viii) Strengthening the universal periodic review mechanism by mandating 
the Troika to arrange an informal meeting with the relevant national non-
governmental organizations and national human rights institutions 
immediately before hearings in the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review and making more practical efforts to include other stakeholders, such 
as the regional human rights institutions, in the process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ix) Providing more resources for special rapporteurs to follow up on their 
recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) Developing detailed guidelines and/or a model report to assist States in 
the preparation of universal periodic review mid-term implementation reports, 
and utilizing an opt-out system for encouraging the submission of such reports; </b></p>


<p><b>(xi) Encouraging donor countries to tailor their programmes, at least in part, 
towards addressing specific universal periodic review recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(xii) Developing a specific inter-committee follow-up mechanism for all the 
treaty bodies, for example by utilizing an existing body; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(xiii) Shifting from the current voluntary opt-in funding system for the 
Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance and the Universal 
Periodic Review Voluntary Trust Fund to an equally voluntary but more 
structured and effective opt-out system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(xiv) Focusing much more than has been the case on in-kind contributions of 
human resources and technological inputs to the Voluntary Fund for Financial

Technical Assistance and the Universal Periodic Review Voluntary Trust Fund 
to include many more non-traditional donors;
