COMMENTARY ON RESULTS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION 
 
COMMENTARY 
 
Board and Management 
 
There were various changes in the Board during the first quarter of the year. As announced on 12 August 2015, Mr David 
Wheeler and Mr.Giuseppe (Joe) Graziano were appointed as Non-Executive Directors of the Company following the resignation 
of Mr. Brian McMaster and Mr Matthew Wood from the position of Executive Chairman and Executive Director, respectively. 
 
On 10 September 2015, Mr Francesco (Frank) Licciardello and Mr. Lay Ann Ong were appointed as Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company and Mr. Peter Torre was appointed as Company Secretary of the Company following the resignations of Mr. 
Giuseppe (Joe) Graziano and Mr. Jack James from their positions of Non-Executive Director and Non-Executive Director and 
Company Secretary respectively. 
 
The appointments followed the raising of $1,000,000 pursuant to a convertible note as detailed below. 
 
Funding 
 
On August 2015, the Company signed a mandate with CPS Capital Group Pty Ltd to seek to issue a loan/ convertible note 
facility to the Company of up to $100,000. 
 
The Company was subsequently lent $100,000 pursuant to the mandate with CPS via two unrelated lenders. Pursuant to the 
special conditions contained within the loan facilities entered into, the Company was required to issue, free of consideration, 
134,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares to the lenders. These shares were issued to the parties on 3 September 2015 and 25 
September 2015 respectively. 
 
The loan facilities also provided for the Company to issue, subject to shareholder approval, a further 116,000,000 shares to 
the lenders. Shareholder approval  was obtained at the Company’s Annual General Meeting and the shares  were issued 
accordingly as full satisfaction of the Company’s obligation to repay the $100,000 loan amounts and all other monies payable 
associated with the loan. 
 
On 9 September 2015, AWW entered into a Convertible Note Agreement with Mr. Lay Ann Ong or nominees, whereby Lay 
Ann Ong subscribed for redeemable unlisted convertible notes (Convertible Notes) in the Company with a face value of up to 
$1.0  million  to  allow  the  Company  to  review  and  evaluate  a  number  of  potential  acquisitions.  The  salient  terms  of  the 
convertible note were:
The right to convert and issue of shares upon such conversion was subject to shareholder approval for the purposes of the 
ASX Listing Rules and Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 
 
Shareholder approval was obtained for the conversion on 18 April 2016, and with the completion of the acquisition of Precast 
as outlined below, and the reinstatement of the Company’s securities to trading on the ASX, the Convertible Notes plus interest 
were converted into fully paid ordinary shares in the company subsequent to year end. 
 
Operations 
 
On 29 December 2015, the Company was pleased to announce that it had entered into an agreement for the acquisition of 
100% of the shares in Precast Australia Pty Ltd ABN 71 602 022 837 (Precast), a Western Australian business involved in 
the manufacture of precast concrete products (Agreement). 
 
As noted in the Company’s announcement on 26 March 2015 regarding the Company’s sale of 75% of the shares in Copper 
Range (SA) Pty Limited, the Company had been actively looking for alternative investments to provide shareholder value.  
The evaluation culminated in the acquisition of Precast (Acquisition).  Precast is a related party of Antares by virtue of being 
controlled by an entity owned by recently appointed Director, Mr Lay Ann Ong.  
 
The Acquisition involved a significant change to the nature of the Company's main business activity from mineral exploration 
and resource investment to the manufacture of precast concrete products.  Furthermore, the Acquisition involved a significant 
change to the size of the Company's business operations.  Given these circumstances, the Company was required to seek 
shareholder approval to the change in the nature and scale of its main business activity under ASX Listing Rule 11.1.2.  All 
necessary shareholder approvals were sought and approved at a general meeting held on 18 April 2016 (General Meeting) 
including the change of name to WestStar Industrial Limited.

20 million options to acquire Shares, exercisable at $0.10 each on or before the date falling 3 years after their issue

1.  Segment Information
For  management  purposes,  the  Group  is  organised  into  one  main  operating  segment,  which  previously  involved  mining 
exploration. The main undertaking of the Group throughout the year was the process of acquiring Precast Australia Pty Ltd, 
and the reinstatement of the Company’s securities on the ASX, both of which were completed subsequent to year end. All of 
the Group’s activities are interrelated, and discrete financial information is reported to the Board (Chief Operating Decision 
Makers) as a single segment. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Group as one 
segment. The financial results from this segment are equivalent to the financial statements of the Group as a whole. Total 
revenue earned by the Group and its non-current assets reside in Australia.
