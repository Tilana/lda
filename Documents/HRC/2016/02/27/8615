<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that no one

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action strongly 
condemned the fact that slavery and slavery-like practices still exist today in parts of the

practices, which constitute flagrant violations of human rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> Council resolution 6/14 of 28 September 2007,

over 12 million and that the problem appears to be increasing,

States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations is essential for 
effectively countering contemporary forms of slavery,

sources, including on slavery practices and, as appropriate, and in line with the current 
practice, respond effectively to reliable information on alleged human rights violations with 
a view to protecting the human rights of victims of slavery and preventing violations;  
</p>
<p> (c) Recommend actions and measures applicable at the national, regional and 
international levels to eliminate slavery practices wherever they occur, including remedies 
which address the causes and consequences of contemporary forms of slavery, such as 
poverty, discrimination and conflict, as well as the existence of demand factors and relevant 
measures to strengthen international cooperation; 
</p>
<p> (d) Focus principally on aspects of contemporary forms of slavery which are not 
covered by existing mandates of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out his/her mandate, to

impartiality of the judiciary and on the integrity of the judicial system,

independence of judges and lawyers to cooperate closely, within the framework of his or 
her mandate, with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights

<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>,

<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Council on the issue of the human rights and international solidarity, including 
Commission resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005 and Council resolutions 6/3 of 27 
September 2007, 7/5 of 27 March 2008, 9/2 of 24 September 2008 and 12/9 of 1 October 
2009, and taking note of the reports submitted by the independent expert on human rights 
and international solidarity, in particular his latest report,27 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights 
should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations and international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination 
of obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing 
countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective 
international cooperation is essential in order to provide these countries with the 
appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account </i>the fact that article 2 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant 
undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, 
especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view 
to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by 
all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, 
friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political 
systems, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the fact that the widening gap between the economically developed and 
developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in 
the international community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, 
according to its capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the 
process of globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, 
communities and individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of

consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing 
countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official 
development assistance, recalling the pledge of industrialized countries to allocate 0.7 per 
cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and recognizing the 
need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and 
the realization of the right to development call for a more enlightened approach, mindset 
and action based on a sense of community and international solidarity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international 
community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an 
increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Asserting</i> the necessity of establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership 
and intra-generational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a 
vital component of the efforts made by developing countries to realize the right to 
development of their peoples and to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p> <i>Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their 
responsibilities towards future ones, and that a better world is possible for both present and 
future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges must be 
managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, 
deserve help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Affirms</i> that international solidarity is not limited to international assistance 
and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept and 
principle that includes sustainability in international relations, especially international 
economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all members of the international 
community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the 
past, and to hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their 
development endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full 
realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to promote international solidarity 
and cooperation as an important tool to help to overcome the negative effects of the current 
economic, financial and climate crises, particularly in developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for States, 
that it should be implemented without any conditionality and on the basis of mutual respect, </p>


<p><b>32</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>in full compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in 
particular respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national priorities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Affirms</i> that much more is needed, owing to the magnitude of global and local 
challenges, the alarming increase in natural and man-made disasters, and the continuing 
rises in poverty and inequality; ideally, solidarity should be preventive rather than simply 
reactive to massive irreversible damage already caused, and must address both natural and 
man-made disasters; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recognizes</i> that there is an overwhelming manifestation of solidarity by 
States, individually and collectively, civil society, global social movements, and countless 
people of goodwill reaching out to others; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely 
interrelated to the fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development 
within the United Nations human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the 
increasing challenges of international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the 
independent expert on human rights and international solidarity in his mandate, to supply 
all necessary information requested by him and to give serious consideration to responding 
favourably to his requests to visit their country, to enable him to fulfil his mandate 
effectively; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Welcomes</i> the steps taken by the independent expert to identify the primary 
areas to be addressed, the main concepts and norms that can form the basis of a framework, 
and good practices to inform the future development of law and policy with regard to 
human rights and international solidarity; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a 
draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in 
further developing guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting 
and protecting this right, by addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its 
realization;

<p> 13. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all 
major United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic, 
social and climate fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United 
Nations agencies, other relevant international organizations and non-governmental 
organizations in the discharge of his mandate;

exercise due diligence to prevent crimes against migrants, to investigate and punish 
perpetrators and, in accordance with applicable law, to rescue victims and to provide for 
their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind also</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including 
those that refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic 
approaches that take into account the causes and consequences of the phenomenon, as well 
as full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that crimes against migrants and trafficking in persons continue to pose a 
serious challenge and require a concerted international assessment and response and 
genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for its 
eradication,  
</p>
<p> <i>Aware</i> that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to 
circumvent restrictive immigration policies, migrants become more vulnerable to, inter alia, 
kidnapping, extortion, forced labour, sexual exploitation, physical assault, debt servitude 
and abandonment,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants regardless 
of their legal status, and expressing its concern at measures which, including in the context 
of policies aimed at reducing irregular migration, treat irregular migration as a criminal 
rather than an administrative offence where the effect of doing so is to deny migrants full 
enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
 <i>Emphasizing</i> the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of 
migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows have increased in the globalized 
economy and take place in a context of new security concerns,

High Commissioner for Human Rights on challenges and best practices in the

health and adequate housing in the context of migration; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying 
or acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families as a matter of priority, and requests the Secretary-
General to continue his efforts to promote and raise awareness of the Convention;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and the supplementing protocols thereto, namely, the 
Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, to 
implement them fully, and calls upon States that have not yet ratified or acceded to them to

subject them to harm, servitude or exploitation, which may also include debt bondage, 
slavery, sexual exploitation or forced labour, and also encourages Member States to 
strengthen international cooperation to combat such trafficking and smuggling; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> States, recognizing the efforts made in this regard, to ensure respect 
for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and:  
</p>
<p> (a) To effectively promote and protect the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of all migrants, including, in particular, the right to life and physical integrity, 
especially that of women and children, regardless of their immigration status, in conformity 
with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international instruments to which 
they are party; 
</p>
<p> (b) To adopt concrete measures to prevent violations of the human rights of 
migrants while in transit, including in ports and airports and at borders and migration 
checkpoints, to train public officials who work in those facilities and in border areas to treat 
migrants and their families respectfully and in accordance with the law, and to prosecute, in 
conformity with applicable law, any act of violation of the human rights of migrants and 
their families, such as arbitrary detention, torture and violations of the right to life, 
including extrajudicial executions, during their transit from their country of origin to the 
country of destination and vice versa, including their transit through national borders;  
</p>
<p> (c) To undertake, in cooperation with relevant organizations, information 
campaigns aimed at clarifying prospects, limitations, potential risks and rights in the event 
of migration in order to enable everyone, in particular women and children and their family 
members, to make informed decisions and to prevent them from becoming victims of 
trafficking or falling prey to transnational organized networks of smugglers or organized 
criminal groups;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its concern </i>at legislation and measures adopted by some States that 
may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and reaffirms that, 
when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement migratory and border security 
measures, States have the duty to comply with their obligations under international law, 
including international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human 
rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to respect the human rights and the inherent dignity of 
migrants and to put an end to arbitrary arrest and detention and, where necessary, to review 
detention periods in order to avoid excessive detention of irregular migrants, and to adopt, 
where applicable, alternative measures to detention; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reiterates its concern </i>at:  
</p>
<p> (a) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime and 
others who profit from crimes against migrants, especially women and children, without 
regard for dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws 
and international law and contrary to international standards;  
</p>
<p> (b) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices as 
well as other members of organized crime and, in this context, the denial of rights and 
justice to migrants who have suffered from abuse;  
 10. <i>Encourages </i>States to protect victims of national and transnational organized 
crime, including kidnapping, trafficking and, in some instances, smuggling, through, where 
applicable, the implementation of programmes and policies that guarantee protection and 
access to medical, psychosocial and legal assistance;  </p>

</b></p>
<p> 11. <i>Recalls</i> that the Universal Declaration on Human Rights recognizes that 
everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts 
violating their fundamental rights, and therefore:  
</p>
<p> (a) Requests States to prosecute, in conformity with applicable law, any crime 
against or violation of the human rights of migrants and their families, inter alia, arbitrary 
detention, torture and violations of the right to life, including extrajudicial executions, 
during their transit from their country of origin to the country of destination and vice versa, 
including through national borders; 
</p>
<p> (b) Affirms that it is essential to place the protection of human rights at the 
centre of measures taken to prevent and end abuses against migrants, and to protect, assist 
and provide access to adequate redress to victims, in accordance with applicable law, 
including the possibility of obtaining compensation; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Reaffirms</i> the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the obligation of States under the International Covenants on Human Rights, and in this 
regard strongly condemns the manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the stereotypes often applied to 
them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and urges States to apply and, where 
needed, reinforce the existing laws when xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or 
expressions against migrants occur, in order to eradicate impunity for those who commit 
xenophobic and racist acts; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation in 
the protection of the human rights of migrants, and therefore:  
</p>
<p> (a) Encourages States to participate in international and regional dialogues on 
migration that include countries of origin, transit and destination, and invites them to 
consider negotiating bilateral and regional agreements on migrant workers within the 
framework of applicable human rights law and designing and implementing programmes 
with States of other regions to protect the rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p> (b) Also encourages States to take the necessary measures to achieve policy 
coherence on migration at the national, regional and international levels, including by 
ensuring coordinated child protection policies and systems across borders that are in full 
compliance with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> (c) Further encourages States to strengthen further their cooperation in protecting 
witnesses and victims of smugglers and traffickers; 
</p>
<p> (d) Encourages States to allow persons claiming to be in need of protection to 
enter without delay the applicable national procedure for protection, including the national 
asylum procedure, in the country where they are present; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Takes note</i> of actions taken by several special procedures of the Council and 
treaty bodies towards the effective prevention of violations of the human rights of migrants, 
including through joint statements and urgent appeals, and encourages them to continue 
with their collaborative efforts to this end, within their respective mandates;

<p>Nations system and Council resolution 12/17 of 2 October 2009 on the elimination of 
discrimination against women,

<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees 
to ensure the enjoyment by women and men, and girls and boys, of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> by the fact that women everywhere are still subject to significant 
disadvantage as the result of discriminatory laws and practices and that de jure and de facto 
equality has not been achieved in any country in the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that women face multiple forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination 
against women throughout the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life is 
essential for the full and complete economic and social development of a country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the elimination of discrimination against women, in law and in 
practice, is primarily the responsibility of States, and that the United Nations human rights 
system plays an important role in contributing to these efforts,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women requires the 
consideration of women&#8217;s specific socio-economic context, and recognizing that laws, 
policies, customs and traditions that restrict women&#8217;s equal access to full participation in 
development processes and public and political life are discriminatory and may contribute 
to the feminization of poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its resolution 5/1 on institution-building of the Council and resolution 5/2 
on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Council, of 18 June 
2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance

Heads of State to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective 
ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly 
sustainable; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the efforts made by States around the world to reform their 
legal systems in order to remove obstacles to women&#8217;s full and effective enjoyment of their 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the fact that, despite the pledge made at the Fourth 
World Conference on Women and the review conducted by the General Assembly at its 
twenty-third special session to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against 
women and girls, many of these laws are still in force and continue to be applied, thereby 
preventing women and girls from enjoying the full realization of their human rights; 
 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States to fulfil their international obligations and commitments to 
revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in 
the administration of justice, taking into account the fact that those laws violate the human 
right of women to be protected against discrimination; </p>


<p><b>60</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes</i> that women&#8217;s inequality before the law has resulted in the lack of 
equal opportunities for women in education, access to health, economic participation and 
access to labour markets and disparities in, inter alia, salaries and compensation, public and 
political participation, access to decision-making processes, inheritance, ownership of land, 
financial services, including loans, and nationality and legal capacity, as well as increased 
vulnerability to discrimination and violence, and that all countries face challenges in these 
areas;

Rapporteurs of the Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, on 
trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, and on contemporary forms of 
slavery and other relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and mechanisms to eliminate 
discrimination in law and in practice throughout the world; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Emphasizes </i>the significant role that women play in economic development 
and in the eradication of poverty, and stresses the need for promoting equal pay for equal 
work or work of equal value and for promoting the recognition of the value of women&#8217;s 
unremunerated work, as well as for developing and promoting policies that facilitate the 
reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon </i>States to ensure full representation and full and equal 
participation of women in political, social and economic decision-making as an essential 
condition for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and a critical factor 
in the eradication of poverty;

eleventh session of the Council;

some extent, address discrimination against women within their mandates, their attention to 
such discrimination is not systematic;

Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue;

 <i>Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
which provides that, inter alia, in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of 
subsistence,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive 
measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the 
Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations 
among States, in particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which 
create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the 
rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human 
rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects </i>to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 
addition, threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member 
States neither to recognize these measures nor to apply them, and to take effective 
administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial 
application or effects of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain 
powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, 
particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from 
exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and 
social systems;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates </i>its call upon Member States that have initiated such measures to 
abide by the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United 
Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions, and to commit themselves to their 
obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by 
virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their own 
economic, social and cultural development;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also reaffirms </i>its opposition to any attempt aimed at the partial or total 
disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible 
with the Charter;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations, and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in 
its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State 
may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce 
another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind;  </p>


<p><b>64</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reaffirms </i>that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be 
used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be 
deprived of their own means of subsistence and development;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Underlines</i> the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 
obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this 
regard, calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive 
measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the 
principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with 
extraterritorial application, which are not in conformity with international law;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> that the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the 
World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly 
urges States to avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information 
society;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Invites</i> all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the 
Council in the field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within the 
scope of their respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral 
coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Decides</i> to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral 
coercive measures in its task concerning the implementation of the right to development;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
discharging her functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to 
pay due attention and give urgent consideration to the present resolution;  
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a thematic study on 
the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, including 
recommendations on actions aimed at ending such measures, taking into account all 
previous reports, resolutions and relevant information available to the United Nations

out the following statement: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> its solidarity with the Haitian people in the wake of the 
devastating earthquake which struck Haiti on 12 January 2010, and underscores the 
particular circumstances created by this natural disaster, which resulted in nearly 
300,000 casualties, the displacement of more than 2 million people and the 
destruction of a significant proportion of the country&#8217;s infrastructure, with serious 
consequences for the enjoyment by Haitians of their human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recalls</i> the special session on Haiti convened on 27 January 2010 and 
resolution S/13-1, which it adopted on that occasion, and welcomes the report 
prepared pursuant to that resolution by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights44 and the recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Recognizes</i> that the crisis caused by the earthquake has had a real 
impact on the health and security of Haitian women and men, and emphasizes that 
sufficient resources must be mobilized to facilitate access to basic services in order 
to improve the quality of life of the population; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Welcomes</i> the mobilization and contributions of the international 
community in support of reconstruction, applauds the priorities defined by the 
Government in its national recovery and development action plan, which focuses on 
reviving economic, government and social activity, as well as on reducing the 
country&#8217;s vulnerability and placing it back on the path to development, and urges 
donors to honour their commitments without delay; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also welcomes</i> the strengthening of the United Nations Stabilization 
Mission in Haiti, as requested by the Security Council in its resolution 1927 (2010) 
of 4 June 2010 with a view, in particular, to helping the Haitian Government to 
provide adequate protection to the population while devoting special attention to the 
needs of displaced persons and other vulnerable groups, especially women and 
children; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> the need to tackle obstacles that are preventing the people 
from fully exercising their human rights, including access to food, decent housing, 
health care, drinking water, sanitation, education and employment, and that are 
jeopardizing the implementation of obligations related to drinking water and 
sanitation; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Stresses also</i> the need to rapidly restore the system for the issuance of 
identity documents, property deeds and other essential documents, so that the people 
may fully exercise their rights;

<p> 
</p>

preparations for the elections scheduled for November 2010, and stresses the 
importance of ensuring that these elections are carried out under the proper 
conditions; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Applauds</i> the fact that the Haitian authorities have reaffirmed their 
commitment and determination to improve the quality of life of Haitian women and 
men by, in particular, ensuring greater respect for human rights and promoting 
cooperation between the Haitian National Police and the United Nations 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti in curbing violence, including sexual violence against 
women, crime and banditry; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Is aware of</i> the many obstacles to development in Haiti and the 
difficulties encountered by its leaders in daily governance, recognizes that the full 
enjoyment of civil and political, economic, social and cultural human rights is a 
factor of peace, stability and progress in Haiti, and encourages the Government to 
continue to reform the judicial and prison system and to strengthen the rule of law 
and efforts to combat impunity; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Strongly encourages</i> the international community as a whole, and in 
particular international donors, the group of countries known as the Friends of Haiti, 
United Nations specialized agencies, and regional and international organizations, to 
step up their cooperation with the constituted authorities of Haiti for the full 
realization of human rights; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Invites</i> the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the Interim 
Haiti Recovery Commission and other competent international bodies to take full 
account of the recommendations made by the High Commissioner1 concerning 
greater protection of the human rights of displaced persons, women, children, 
persons with disabilities and migrants; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Underscores</i> the need for heightened awareness of human rights 
during the reconstruction process through, inter alia, the integration of a human 
rights-based approach in reconstruction projects, including private and bilateral 
projects and associated calls for tender; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Welcomes</i> the request of the Haitian authorities to have the mission of 
the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti extended until 
September 2011, and decides to approve that request; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Emphasizes</i> that the independent expert&#8217;s mandate falls within the 
framework of technical assistance and capacity-building and, in the light of that fact, 
encourages him to collaborate with international institutions, donors and the 
international community in bringing their expertise to bear and furnishing sufficient 
resources to support the authorities&#8217; efforts to rebuild the country following the 
earthquake of 12 January 2010, and encourages him to continue the work begun in 
2008 and to accomplish his mission by drawing upon his experience to further the 
cause of human rights in Haiti, with particular emphasis on economic, social and 
cultural rights, the rights of persons with disabilities, women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, 
and access to justice; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Invites</i> the independent expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in the 
near future and to report to it thereon at its seventeenth session, and encourages the 
Haitian authorities to cooperate fully with the expert.&#8221; </p>

<p>252. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, Council resolution 5/1 and 
President&#8217;s statements PRST/8/1 and PRST/9/2 on modalities and practices for the 
universal periodic review process, the Council considered the outcome of the reviews 
conducted during the eighth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review, held from 3 to 14 May 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Consideration of universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>253. In accordance with paragraph 4.3 of President&#8217;s statement PRST/8/1, the section 
below contains a summary of the views expressed on the outcome by States under review, 
Member and observer States of the Council, as well as general comments made by other 
relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kyrgyzstan 
</b></p>
<p>254. The review of Kyrgyzstan was held on 3 May 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Kyrgyzstan in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/KGZ/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KGZ/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KGZ/3). 
</p><p>255. At its 14th meeting, on 21 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Kyrgyzstan (see section C below). 
256. The outcome of the review of Kyrgyzstan comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/2), the views of Kyrgyzstan 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>257. The delegation of Kyrgyzstan gave a brief overview of the recent events of April 
and June 2010. It mentioned a number of causes leading to the mass demonstrations in 
April, in particular the decline in the level of social security, the high corruption rate and 
the persecution of the opposition and journalists. After the events of April, the country had 
been shaken by inter-ethnic clashes in June that resulted in the death of hundreds of people 
and the destruction of properties in the south of the country. The situation was being 
stabilized and the Government had taken measures to repair the damage caused and to 
restore business.  
</p>
<p>258. Kyrgyzstan had established a number of bodies with the aim of stabilizing the 
situation, including an inter-agency commission to develop a programme to strengthen 
inter-ethnic relations and a State commission to conduct a comprehensive study on the 
events of April and June 2010. In addition, the Government had accepted an initiative of a </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>121 
</b></p>
<p>number of Scandinavian countries to conduct an investigation by international actors 
regarding the events in the south. In this respect, the delegation thanked the United Nations 
and the European Union for the technical support provided, as well as to all other 
international organizations and donors for their assistance during these difficult times. 
</p>
<p>259. The Government intended to focus its efforts on building a democratic and 
economically prosperous State; a nationwide referendum had been held on 27 June 2010 to 
adopt a new Constitution geared at establishing a parliamentary republic and mechanisms 
to protect human rights and ensure political diversity and Government accountability. The 
delegation highlighted the expansion of the human rights section in the new Constitution, 
which had been positively evaluated by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, 
the European Union, the United Nations, and the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). 
</p><p>260. The delegation referred to a number of international human rights treaties that 
Kyrgyzstan had ratified since its independence, including the United Nations conventions 
relating to women&#8217;s rights. It noted that the monitoring of the implementation of the 
national human rights programme for the period of 2002&#8211;2010 was in progress, and that the 
outcome of the monitoring would be used to develop a new human rights concept for the 
period 2011&#8211;2020. The delegation also mentioned that conditions were in place for a 
constructive dialogue with civil society.  
</p>
<p>261. The Government had been considering the establishment of a national preventive 
mechanism to ensure access by national and international human rights organizations to 
places of detention. The delegation also referred to a number of legal acts adopted to ensure 
protection of rights of children and of women, and to combat domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>262. The delegation noted that 168 recommendations had been put forward during the 
review in the Working Group. Kyrgyzstan expressed its readiness to accept 127 
recommendations as voluntary commitments. A draft national plan of action had been 
developed with the participation of representatives of civil society and international 
organizations to implement the recommendations. The Government had also given 
consideration to the 41 recommendations left pending. 
</p>
<p>263. With regard to recommendation 1 concerning the ratification of the second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Kyrgyzstan had 
already acceded to the Protocol in March 2010. Regarding the recommendation on 
implementation of Council resolution 9/12, the delegation noted that Kyrgyzstan supported 
the norms thereon. Kyrgyzstan accepted part of recommendations 1, 2, 4, 9 and 11 
concerning the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p>264. The delegation stated that recommendation 4 on the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights could only 
be considered after the parliamentary elections. The same applied to recommendation 10 on 
accession to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of 
Europe, and recommendations 8, 10 and 11 on the ratification of the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>265. Kyrgyzstan accepted recommendations 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 on ratification of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. In 
that regard, the delegation emphasized that, in order to comply with the requirements of the 
Convention, important financial investments would be needed. Kyrgyzstan also accepted 
recommendations 12, 14, 15 and 38, as well as all recommendations on bringing the law on 
the Ombudsman into line with United Nations standards.  </p>


<p><b>122</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>266. Kyrgyzstan did not accept recommendations 18, 20 and 21 on the establishment of a 
separate body on gender issues, explaining that the Ministry of Labour, Employment and 
Migration had been already assigned the task of addressing the issue of gender equality.  
</p>
<p>267. The delegation stated that Kyrgyzstan had postponed consideration of 
recommendations 22 to 24 and 26 to 30, on the issuance of a standing invitation to special 
procedures mandate holders, until the holding of parliamentary elections. Kyrgyzstan 
accepted recommendations 13 and 32, 34 to 36 on combating discrimination against 
women, domestic violence and forced marriages, and on national minorities. Kyrgyzstan 
considered that, in view of the financial and technical resources needed to implement 
adequately the recommendations on freedom of movement, and the more flexible 
requirements for equitable access to social security, health care, education and pensions for 
persons changing residence within the country, it would need time to study them further.  
</p>
<p>268. The delegation reported that Kyrgyzstan accepted recommendation 25, to extend an 
invitation to the Special Rapporteur against torture to visit the country in 2010, and 
recommendation 39 on human rights training for the military and police forces. Kyrgyzstan 
also accepted recommendation 31 regarding the implementation of the principle of non-
refoulement, and recommendation 41 on the respect in all circumstances of the principle of 
non-refoulement and guarantees of asylum procedures in accordance with international 
standards. Kyrgyzstan accepted recommendation 37 relating to the review of the law on 
religion, to ensure that the rights to freedom of religion is upheld in compliance with 
international standards, and recommendation 40, to request cooperation and technical 
assistance from relevant United Nations agencies in order to remove landmines and 
demarcate border areas, as well as to improve access to drinking water and sanitation 
services. 
</p>
<p>269. Kyrgyzstan followed a course of action aimed at the protection and promotion of all 
basic human rights and freedoms in accordance with international standards, and stood by 
the established practice of peaceful coexistence of traditional religious groups and strove to 
protect religious and cultural peculiarities. The delegation expressed Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s 
commitment to implement its international obligations and to participate in international 
organizations, with a special emphasis on the Council.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>270. Morocco expressed its appreciation for Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s acceptance of 127 
recommendations in the Working Group. Morocco commended Kyrgyzstan for its efforts in 
favour of vulnerable groups, including women and children. It also welcomed the 
legislative reforms implemented in accordance with international human rights standards. 
Morocco noted the provisional Government&#8217;s commitment to democratic reform, including 
the adoption of a new constitution. 
</p>
<p>271. China thanked Kyrgyzstan for accepting most of the recommendations and for its 
active engagement in the follow-up work. China appreciated Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s measures to 
restore social stability, to strengthen national solidarity and to establish human rights bodies 
for the promotion of social, economic and cultural rights, and for the considerable progress 
achieved in promoting the rights to social security, health and education. China 
acknowledged the challenges faced by Kyrgyzstan as a developing country in ensuring 
economic development and the protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>272. The Islamic Republic of Iran commended Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s constructive engagement in 
the universal periodic review. It noted that Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s responsible approach to the 
recommendations made was a clear indication of the country&#8217;s commitment to human 
rights. It noted that Kyrgyzstan supported or had examined nearly 130 of 140 </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>123 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations. Particular satisfaction was expressed at Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s support for 
recommendations to take steps to eradicate poverty and improve living standards, to 
develop the education system and to strengthen and promote national capacities in human 
rights. Iran encouraged Kyrgyzstan to take effective measures to fulfil its international 
obligations and to speed up its efforts to protect citizens&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>273. The Russian Federation stated that Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s participation in the universal 
periodic review at such a difficult time demonstrated the country&#8217;s commitment to human 
rights protection. It noted with satisfaction that most of the recommendations made in May 
were already in the process of implementation. The Russian Federation found it necessary 
for the international community, and in particular the Council, to continue to provide expert 
and technical assistance to Kyrgyzstan for it to implement the recommendations made 
during the review and to ensure the stabilization of the situation in the country. 
</p>
<p>274. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea thanked Kyrgyzstan for its constructive 
approach to the universal periodic review, including through its acceptance of a large 
number of recommendations. It expressed its appreciation for Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s consistent 
policy aimed at the protection and promotion of human rights for all people, despite 
difficulties and challenges. It also noted Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s efforts to ensure equal rights and 
freedoms for all ethnic and religious minorities and to achieve women&#8217;s rights and gender 
equality, as well as children&#8217;s rights. It noted the achievements made in the area of 
economic, social and cultural rights, such as compulsory and free basic education, and 
further improvements in people&#8217;s livelihoods.  
</p>
<p>275. Algeria expressed its appreciation to Kyrgyzstan for having accepted two 
recommendations made by Algeria, regarding the representation of women in decision-
making bodies and the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. It was not clear whether the recommendation made by Algeria to establish a 
national human rights institution had been accepted by Kyrgyzstan, but Algeria took note 
that the mandate of the ombudsman had been adopted. Algeria regarded the constitutional 
referendum held in June 2010 and the parliamentary elections planned for October as 
positive developments. It expressed the hope that the constitutional order and stability, 
respect for human rights and economic development would be restored. 
</p>
<p>276. Kazakhstan welcomed the fact that Kyrgyzstan had accepted a significant number of 
recommendations and paid equal attention to the realization of civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights. Kazakhstan expressed its support for Kyrgyzstan in overcoming 
its challenges and achieving stability, and extended its cooperation in the implementation of 
the recommendations made at the review.  
</p>
<p>277. Azerbaijan thanked Kyrgyzstan for its participation in the review despite the 
difficult political situation in the country. It noted with appreciation Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s 
acceptance of a significant number of recommendations and that it considered adopting a 
plan of action to implement them. Azerbaijan encouraged Kyrgyzstan to accelerate its 
efforts to promote inter-ethnic harmony and was pleased by the establishment of a 
commission to look into the events of June 2010. Azerbaijan welcomed the constitutional 
referendum and expressed its hope that parliamentary elections to be held in October would 
be successful and open new avenues for building democracy and strengthening the rule of 
law. 
</p>
<p>278. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic noted Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s cooperation with the 
Council despite the difficult political and economic situation. It noted Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s efforts 
to resolve the situation, including ethnic tension, and to reinforce social cohesion with the 
aim of ensuring political stability and economic development for all ethnic groups. The Lao 
People&#8217;s Democratic Republic commended Kyrgyzstan for its efforts to comply with </p>


<p><b>124</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>universal human rights principles and for the acceptance of more than 130 of the 140 
recommendations made.  
</p>
<p>279. Egypt commended Kyrgyzstan for its commitment to the universal periodic review, 
which was demonstrated by its acceptance of 127 recommendations and its cooperative 
spirit towards the remaining 41. It encouraged Kyrgyzstan to continue its efforts to ensure 
human rights protection, in particular with regard to the rights of women and children and 
poverty alleviation, and to ensure appropriate follow-up to the accepted recommendations. 
Egypt reiterated the importance of creating and sustaining a robust human rights 
infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>280. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was pleased to note the 
large number of recommendations accepted by Kyrgyzstan, particularly those that it had 
made on a national preventive mechanism and the organization of elections and 
referendums in accordance with international standards. The United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland requested clarification of Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s position on the 
recommendation relating to the freedom and security of human rights defenders. The 
recommendation was especially important given the recent developments concerning A. 
Askarov. Voicing its dismay about the recent verdict, the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland urged Kyrgyzstan to review this case and to ensure that all future 
trials were conducted in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>281. The United States of America supported Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s efforts to restore law, order 
and the Government&#8217;s legitimacy, and to address social tensions. It supported the 
recommendations made to promote and encourage reconciliation in the wake of recent 
ethnic violence, and hoped that Kyrgyzstan would make these efforts with the participation 
of civil society. The United States of America remained concerned about potential further 
violence and supported the recommendations to investigate land seizures targeting citizens 
of any ethnicity, and encouraged the efforts towards reconciliation. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>282. Amnesty International referred to reports indicating that, during the violent events of 
June 2010 that targeted ethnic Uzbeks, the security forces either failed to prevent or 
colluded in the commission of human rights abuses. It expressed alarm at continuing 
reports that the authorities had attempted to obstruct the work of human rights defenders, 
lawyers and other civil society actors in documenting or otherwise responding to the events. 
Amnesty International welcomed Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s support for recommendations on 
condemning torture and strengthening safeguards against it, ensuring accountability for 
human rights violations, and for guaranteeing that all human rights defenders, journalists 
and other civil society activists may work without fear of intimidation, harassment, 
detention and torture. It welcomed Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s invitation to the Special Rapporteur 
against torture to visit the country in 2010. It noted that Kyrgyzstan would consider further 
the recommendations to extend a standing invitation to special procedures. This would be a 
welcome indication that Kyrgyzstan was prepared to fully cooperate with the United 
Nations. 
</p>
<p>283. Human Rights Watch noted that the implementation of accepted recommendations 
should address the violent incidents of June 2010. The Government&#8217;s investigations into 
those events had been carried out in violation of national and international standards, and 
human rights defenders had faced harassment by authorities and attacks by private 
individuals. It referred to the case of A. Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek human rights defender 
allegedly subjected to ill-treatment in custody and who had been sentenced to life 
imprisonment in a trial which apparently lacked due process and fair trial guarantees. While 
welcoming Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s acceptance of many important recommendations, Human Rights 
Watch called upon international partners to assist Kyrgyzstan to implement them. It noted </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>125 
</b></p>
<p>the importance of encouraging Kyrgyzstan to sign a memorandum of understanding with 
OSCE on the deployment of an international police advisory group.  
</p>
<p>284. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme stated that the violence in 
the country has caused widespread instability and given rise to human rights violations 
affecting ethnic and religious minorities. It remained alarmed at the restrictive measures 
affecting the media and journalists and the threats to human rights defenders and 
opponents. It was imperative that Kyrgyzstan reform the juvenile justice system. It hoped 
that Kyrgyzstan would continue to pursue a national dialogue to implement the vital 
recommendations for the return to normality in the country. 
</p>
<p>285. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network thanked Kyrgyzstan for accepting the 
recommendations on the protection of women against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation and for having included this in the draft national plan of action for 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations. It recommended that 
Kyrgyzstan take measures to punish those responsible for sexual violence against women 
and to provide support for victims. It called upon Kyrgyzstan to accept the recommendation 
made by the Czech Republic, to bring legislation into line with international standards 
regarding the rights of sexual and ethnic minorities.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>286. The delegation stated that recommendations 1, 4, 11 and 36 should be regarded as 
partially accepted and partially noted; recommendations 8, 10, 22 to 24 and 26 to 30 had 
been noted. In response to a question addressed by a representative of the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the delegation noted again that recommendation 38 
had been accepted by Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>287. In response to the case of A. Askarov, the delegation informed the Council that A. 
Askarov had been involved in a local officials&#8217; hostage-taking attempt, with the aim of 
crossing the border. He had also publicly insulted the Kyrgyz nation during the mass unrest 
in June that had led to violence and the death of people. According to the delegation, Mr. 
Askarov was accused of organizing the murder of a law enforcement officer. The first 
instance court had sentenced him to life imprisonment; he was entitled to appeal the court 
ruling to a court of higher instance.  
</p>
<p>288. In conclusion, the delegation thanked the Council for the constructive dialogue 
during the review and expressed its belief that the discussion would contribute to the work 
aimed at further improving the human rights protection in the country, which would be 
carried out in close cooperation with the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guinea 
</b></p>
<p>289. The review of Guinea was held on 6 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Guinea in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GIN/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GIN/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GIN/3). 
</p><p>290. At its 15th meeting, on 21 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Guinea (see section C below). </p>


<p><b>126</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>291. The outcome of the review of Guinea comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/4), the views of Guinea concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/4/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>292. The Minister for Justice of Guinea, Siba Loholamou, congratulated the President of 
the Council and its Bureau on their recent election. 
</p>
<p>293. The Minister stated that his country was pleased to have completed the peer review 
of the universal periodic review. He referred to the announcements made by Guinea during 
the eighth session of the Working Group in May 2010 in relation to the adoption of a new 
Constitution and organic law as solid bases for a new era in the promotion and protection of 
human rights. Guinea was pleased to participate in the final phase of the process, which had 
been prepared in broad consultation among various administrations and civil society. 
</p>
<p>294. Since May 2010, a number of initiatives and measures have been taken; first, the 
promulgation of a new Constitution, including new laws such as the electoral code, a law 
on the freedom of the press and the creation of a high authority for communication. Second, 
a process of national reconciliation had been initiated by the transitional president, General 
Sekouba Konat&#233;, who took this opportunity to apologize on behalf of all his predecessors 
for the violations of human rights committed in the past. Third, an office of OHCHR had 
been opened, a new development in the area of cooperation between Guinea and the United 
Nations system. Fourth, the holding of the first round of elections on 27 June 2010 reflected 
the will of the transitional Government and the population to turn a new page. The Minister 
stated that the postponement of the second round of election by the National Independent 
Electoral Commission was due to logistics and technicalities, and also in order to ensure the 
transparency and accuracy of the process.  
</p>
<p>295. In this context, a number of conferences and seminars had been organized to 
publicize the new Constitution, which contained a human rights charter with 22 articles 
under title 2. The involvement of non-governmental organizations in the preparation of the 
laws was also highlighted. Several non-governmental organizations had already 
commenced the translation and publication of the texts in various national languages. 
</p>
<p>296. The new law regarding the freedom of the press was a breakthrough to protect 
journalists from arbitrary arrest and illegal detention, as it reduced any penal sanction 
against journalist to a simple fine. 
</p><p>297. The Minister referred to the nine pending recommendations mentioned in the 
addendum to the Working Group&#8217;s report and to the forum held on 7 July 2010. The forum 
had brought together members of the administration in charge of human rights, and non-
governmental organizations, in order to acquaint with the 114 recommendations made at 
the session of the Working Group, including the 105 recommendations accepted and the 9 
others for which reservations were expressed. A document was drafted following these 
consultations. 
</p>
<p>298. The recommendations related to the timely submission of periodic reports to treaty 
bodies, the establishment of a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris 
Principles, the establishment of a national plan of action for the rights of children and 
women, the formulation of a national strategy of reconciliation and pardon together with a 
mechanism to fight against impunity, access to international instruments, the withdrawal of 
reservations, strengthening the power of the civil forces of defence and security, the </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>127 
</b></p>
<p>promotion of a culture of knowledge in the field of human rights, the reform of the judicial 
system and the improvement of governance and democracy. 
</p>
<p>299. Guinea noted all nine pending recommendations. Regarding the abolition of the 
death penalty and the adoption of a moratorium, the Minister highlighted the fact that, 
following high-level consultations, it was decided that it was premature to include this 
question in the national debate, especially during such a delicate transitional phase. The 
solution would be to have a de facto moratorium. 
</p>
<p>300. With regard to the invitation to special procedures mandate holders, the Minister 
stressed that, while not opposed to the spirit of the recommendations, it would be preferable 
first to strengthen cooperation with OHCHR in Conakry, to help promote these procedures 
and to set up the basis for their implementation. The invitation to special procedures would 
thus be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
</p>
<p>301. The Minister reiterated that the recommendations made at the Working Group 
session were of a different nature; some were implementable in the short term, while others 
required coordination among various public administration bodies and departments. 
Deadlines and budget constraints were linked to their implementation. 
</p>
<p>302. Given that the promotion and protection of human rights was the cornerstone of 
Guinea&#8217;s new constitutional Government and an ongoing challenge requiring constant 
vigilance and commitment, an inclusive and participative framework of dialogue needed to 
be established to ensure proper space and freedom for human rights defenders. Guinea was 
committed to the universal periodic review process and to the work of the treaty bodies and 
that of the African Union.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>303. Morocco thanked the delegation for the update provided on developments in the 
country since the Working Group session in May 2010, and welcomed the holding of the 
first round of the presidential elections in June 2010. Morocco noted that the high number 
of Guinean people participating in the elections was testament to the determination of the 
people to move forward with development, security and democracy. Morocco also noted 
that the <i>Protocol d&#8217;entente pour une &#233;lection apais&#233;e en Guinea</i>, signed in Ougadougou on 
3 September 2010, reaffirmed that the independent national election commission was the 
only electoral organ and committed both candidates to accepting the results of the second 
round of the presidential elections and to resorting to legal channels in the event of 
disputes.  
</p>
<p>304. China expressed thanks to the delegation of Guinea for its replies and commended 
Guinea&#8217;s attitude towards the universal periodical review. In recent years, Guinea had made 
efforts to stabilize its society and had ratified many human rights conventions. China noted 
that the Government had already accepted many recommendations, although it faced 
special difficulties and challenges in promoting and protecting human rights. China called 
on the international community to provide the necessary financial and technical support to 
Guinea. China recommended that Guinea continue to promote social stability and economic 
development, especially in the agricultural sector.  
</p>
<p>305. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was pleased to note that 
its recommendations on the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture, the guarantee that security forces comply with international human rights law, the 
judicial prosecution of State agents who commit human rights violations, the safety of 
journalists and a free and independent media in the run-up to elections, the implementation 
of the Ouagadougou Agreement all enjoyed the support of Guinea. The United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland strongly supported all efforts to ensure that Guinea held </p>


<p><b>128</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>the postponed second round of presidential elections as soon as possible, and encouraged 
the Government to maintain an atmosphere of peace and stability during this period. It 
welcomed the commitments of Guinea to improve the human rights situation through its 
universal periodic review, and also its commitment to address the recommendations in a 
timely and focused manner. 
</p>
<p>306. France noted that Guinea had accepted almost all recommendations made at the 
session of the Working Group. France recalled that the tragic events of September 2009 had 
led the international community to take action to assist in the fight against impunity. In this 
connection, France recalled Council resolution 13/21 of 26 March 2010, and the opening of 
an office by OHCHR in Guinea, which France supported financially. The priority was now 
the holding of the second round of presidential elections as soon as possible. France 
renewed its support for the efforts made by the Security Council, African organizations and 
especially the joint mission of the United Nations and the Economic Community of West 
African States. France reiterated its call for a peaceful electoral campaign free of incitement 
to hate and violence. It welcomed the message of President Konat&#233; that the military would 
remain neutral, and France renewed its call to candidates and all political parties to conduct 
the electoral process in a congenial and peaceful atmosphere.  
</p>
<p>307. Senegal noted that, by accepting the majority of recommendations, the transitional 
Government had confirmed Guinea&#8217;s determination to continue its efforts to improve its 
human rights situation despite a very difficult national context. In this connection, Senegal 
was in favour of the holding, as soon as possible, of the second round of elections in a 
peaceful atmosphere. Senegal welcomed the adoption of the draft new Constitution, the 
establishment of a national human rights institution and that of an inter-ministerial 
commission responsible for considering the possibility for Guinea to accede to optional 
protocols, as well as the establishment of a favourable environment for the development of 
civil society organizations. Senegal appealed to the international community to increase its 
assistance to Guinea to guarantee the rapid and effective implementation of the 
recommendations that Guinea had accepted.  
</p>
<p>308. Norway welcomed the Minister for Justice and his delegation to the Council. It 
welcomed the expressed commitment to the principles of international human rights law in 
the ongoing process in Guinea, including through the adopted recommendations and the 
establishment of the OHCHR office in the country, and the cooperation between the 
Government and the High Commissioner&#8217;s office. Norway was pleased to have been able to 
provide, through contributions to the High Commissioner, $770,000 to the OHCHR office 
in Guinea. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>309. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme stated that Guinea was at 
a decisive stage in its history with the postponement of the elections. The constraints on the 
implementation of the recommendations were due to a culture of impunity, the release of 
drug traffickers, unfair trials, overcrowded prisons, the use of torture to obtain confessions, 
child abduction and exploitation, the mistreatment of women, the lack of dialogue and 
cooperation among the different stakeholders, the failure to prosecute those responsible for 
crimes, such as killings and rape, in the events during the period 2006&#8211;2008 and the 
massacres of September 2009. The organization congratulated Guinea on having opened 
the OHCHR office, the current reform of the army, the revision of the Constitution, the 
elaboration of an electoral code and of a press law, and on the organization of the first 
round of elections in a peaceful atmosphere. It pleaded for the right and the duty of memory 
for victims of 50 years of dictatorship, torture and arbitrary detention. It called on the 
Government to establish a political climate favourable to the holding of a second round of </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>129 
</b></p>
<p>elections as soon as possible, to elaborate an education programme of human rights, and 
ensure that Guinea was up to date with its treaty body reporting obligations. 
</p>
<p>310. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Pan Africa ILGA urged Guinea to 
give serious consideration to the recommendations in relation to decriminalizing sexual 
activity between consenting adults of the same sex. They noted the statement of the 
Secretary-General at the high-level panel discussions held on 17 September 2010 that 
cultural considerations should not stand in the way of basic human rights. Guinea was also 
urged to promote policies that ensure equality of access to public health services by all 
marginalized populations.  
</p>
<p>311. The African Commission of Health and Human Rights Promoters stated that it was 
very active in Guinea, where a transition council was working to implement a new 
democratic order. The Commission had attempted to identify organizations that could work 
together with the Government, particularly in the field of education, to overcome the 
problems that had beset the country in the recent past. In this critical period, the political 
decision makers should focus on traditional education and teaching. Today, the 
Commission and other non-governmental organizations were struggling to ensure that 
Africans sufficiently focused on African culture. It encouraged Guineans of all political 
affiliations to overcome domestic divisions and partisan personal interests and try to have 
an enlightened vision, and help Guinea steer a steady course.  
</p>
<p>312. Amnesty International noted with appreciation Guinea&#8217;s acceptance of more than 
100 recommendations, although it highlighted two points as essential elements for a 
democratic State respectful of human rights. It called on the Guinean authorities to 
implement all the recommendations accepted in relation to combating impunity with regard 
to the violations committed during the events of September 2009. This would allow the 
victims, and particularly victims of sexual violence, and their families to obtain reparation. 
It was important that Guinea use this period of transition to effect real changes in the 
human rights situation. Noting that Guinea had not carried out executions since 2002, it 
called on Guinea to join the abolitionist group.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>313. The delegation noted with satisfaction the intense interactive dialogue, and 
commended the comments made by the Member States and non-governmental 
organizations as encouraging in their frankness and in-depth analysis. It assured that 
progress would be made in all areas under discussion, and referred to the new Constitution 
and the recent set-up of rules and institutions, including the Constitutional Court, the 
national independent human rights institution and the public mediator as positive 
developments. 
</p>
<p>314. The delegation thanked the President, the members of the Bureau for their calm 
guidance of the discussion, and the secretariat for its assistance, and appealed to the 
international community to provide technical financial assistance on a greater scale not only 
to the Government but also to civil society, including human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>315. The Minister for Justice reaffirmed Guinea&#8217;s will to cooperate fully with the 
Council, and thanked it for the amicable environment in which the proceedings had taken 
place. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
</b></p>
<p>316. The review of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic was held on 4 May 2010 in 
conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the following documents:  </p>


<p><b>130</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in 
accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/LAO/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/LAO/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/LAO/3). 
</p><p>317. At its 16th meeting, on 21 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic (see section C below). 
318. The outcome of the review of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic comprises the 
report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/5), the views of 
the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic concerning the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of 
the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed 
during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/15/5/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>319. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic informed the Council of recent 
developments contributing to the promotion of human rights, noting that it was in the 
process of preparing the seventh national socio-economic development plan and other plans 
of action, which included economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights aspects. The 
Government had made progress in the implementation of the master plan on the rule of law 
and training for village lawyers and law enforcement officers. Referring to its international 
engagement, it intended to sign the Convention against Torture during the forthcoming 
annual United Nations treaty event in New York in September 2010. It was also 
considering acceding to the Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers. With regard to 
other accepted recommendations, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic would continue to 
implement them in good faith and share the results in the next review cycle.  
</p>
<p>320. Recalling that the country had positively responded to 56 of the 107 
recommendations made at the May 2010 session, the delegation stated that it had conducted 
a broad public relations campaign for Government agencies, mass organizations, civil 
society, the diplomatic corps and others on the results of the Lao engagement in the 
universal periodic review. Of the 48 pending recommendations, it supported 15 fully and 15 
in part, as set out in an addendum to the Working Group report. With regard to the 
remaining 18 recommendations, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic could not support 
them, as some of them did not reflect the real situation in the country.  
</p>
<p>321. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic attached great importance to the 
recommendations concerning its accession to international conventions, but would need 
more time to study and prepare the conditions necessary to accede to some treaties, 
including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the Ottawa Convention 
on Landmines.  
</p>
<p>322. With regard to recommendations to invite special procedures, the Lao People&#8217;s 
Democratic Republic would proceed on a case-by-case basis and was in the process of 
considering invitations to certain mandate holders. However, owing to limited resources, it 
was not in a position to extend a standing invitation to all mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>323. The death penalty was maintained only to deter the most serious crimes, in particular 
drug trafficking. At present, the State was not ready to consider ratifying the second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. However, no </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>131 
</b></p>
<p>execution had taken place for many years and rights of appeal were ensured. The State also 
indicated that it would consider revising the Penal Code for it to be in line with the 
obligations under the Covenant and other treaties to which it was a party. 
</p>
<p>324. Religious freedom was guaranteed by the Constitution and a specific decree; all 
necessary measures had been taken to solve the misunderstanding of religious freedom in 
Katen village. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic pursued a consistent policy to 
guarantee freedom of speech, the press, expression and assembly, rights which were 
enshrined in the national legislation. 
</p>
<p>325. With regard to the situation of Hmong returnees, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic 
Republic acknowledged the important role of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in providing humanitarian assistance, but noted that 
the returnees were not persons of concern under international law and that the Government 
would handle the issue. 
</p>
<p>326. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic concluded by expressing its appreciation to 
the international community for its valuable support for the development of the country, 
and its hope that the international community would continue to do so, including with 
regard to the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>327. Viet Nam took note with appreciation of the openness, active cooperation and 
serious commitment displayed by the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in the universal 
periodic review process. Viet Nam recalled that the State had widely disseminated the 
outcome of its review, and was encouraged by its acceptance of the majority of 
recommendations, including those made by Viet Nam. Viet Nam noted that the State&#8217;s 
readiness to take concrete steps and measures to follow up on the recommendations was 
admirable, given the difficulties and hardship encountered by the country. It welcomed the 
master plan on the rule of law and the seventh national socio-economic development plan, 
among others. 
</p>
<p>328. Bhutan expressed its appreciation for the constructive manner in which the Lao 
People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had engaged in the universal periodic review mechanism, 
and was encouraged by its acceptance of most recommendations. Bhutan welcomed the 
realistic approach to implementing the recommendations in a progressive manner. It made 
reference to the acceptance of the recommendation to expedite the reform of governance, 
public administration and the legal system with the aim of deepening and broadening 
democratic principles and standards. Bhutan called on the international community to 
continue to extend support and assistance to the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in the 
implementation of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>329. Malaysia was pleased to note that the State had accepted a large number of 
recommendations and started taking necessary steps to implement many of them, including 
those focusing on promoting employment, economic growth and poverty alleviation. 
Malaysia shared the view that poverty alleviation and human resource development were 
important for the protection and fulfilment of fundamental human rights. It also noted the 
Government&#8217;s preparedness to continue and strengthen its constructive engagement with 
international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>330. Cambodia commended the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic for its achievements 
in advancing the socio-economic development of its people. It was pleased to note that the 
State had accepted a large number of recommendations, including recommendations to 
consider accession to some important international instruments. Cambodia viewed this 
approach as a step towards further progress. It welcomed the continued commitment of the </p>


<p><b>132</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>Government to address remaining challenges, and called on the international community to 
assist the State in this regard. 
</p>
<p>331. Venezuela (Bolivian Republic of) welcomed the spirit of openness and the 
constructive approach demonstrated by the Lao Government during the universal periodic 
review process. It had provided specific answers to the questions raised, particularly 
concerning achievements made in implementing socio-economic policies and in promoting 
the rights of women. It noted that the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had spared no 
effort to overcome the consequences of colonialism and foreign aggression that it had 
suffered, and that it had managed to reduce poverty by 50 per cent over the past two 
decades.  
</p>
<p>332. Cuba congratulated the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic on its acceptance of 
many recommendations, including those made by Cuba. It also welcomed the presentation 
of an addendum to the Working Group report that indicated the State&#8217;s position on some of 
the recommendations and information on voluntary commitments. Cuba and the Lao 
People&#8217;s Democratic Republic shared dreams, aspirations, achievements and challenges, as 
well as the common goal of achieving development with social justice. Cuba wished 
success to the Government and the people, and reiterated its solidarity and respect.  
</p>
<p>333. Myanmar noted with satisfaction that the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had 
accepted a large number of recommendations, and had also agreed to consider acceding to 
the Convention on Migrant Workers and to take measures to improve the situation of 
vulnerable people despite the numerous challenges faced as a developing country. In 
particular, Myanmar noted the efforts to develop proper national mechanisms to promote 
the rights of women and children. It expressed the hope that the State would continue to 
implement programmes to enhance access to education and health services for women and 
girls living in rural and border areas. Myanmar also noted with appreciation the 
commitment to implement internal reforms aiming at good governance and socio-economic 
development. 
</p>
<p>334. Thailand was pleased to learn that the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had 
accepted its recommendations made during the Working Group session with regard to 
poverty alleviation and the incorporation of international human rights conventions into 
domestic laws. Thailand commended in particular the efforts to combat trafficking in 
persons through a national plan of action and regional cooperation. Thailand was ready to 
support the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in assisting victims of cluster munitions. It 
urged the Council to provide technical cooperation and support to the State in its efforts to 
implement the recommendations. It reiterated its readiness to strengthen its partnership with 
the State in this regard.  
</p>
<p>335. Indonesia commended the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic for its efforts to 
promote good governance and improve living standards. It recognized that a history of 
regional conflict had hindered more rapid improvements in these and other critical areas, 
but was encouraged to learn that socio-economic development, poverty eradication and 
economic growth were key priorities on the agenda of the Government. Indonesia also 
commended the State for its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. It thanked the State for accepting two of its recommendations, and expressed 
the hope that the Lao Government would continue to engage constructively with the 
ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights as well as the Human Rights 
Council. The recent invitation to the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and the 
intention to invite other rapporteurs in the future were positive steps.  
</p>
<p>336. China expressed its appreciation for the detailed responses provided by the Lao 
People&#8217;s Democratic Republic to the recommendations. China made reference to the 
tremendous achievements made by the State in promoting economic and social </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>133 
</b></p>
<p>development, as well as in the protection of human rights. As a neighbouring country, 
China understood the unique problems and challenges faced in promoting and protecting 
human rights. China urged the international community to provide the necessary financial 
and technical support. 
</p>
<p>337. The Islamic Republic of Iran applauded the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic for 
supporting most recommendations, including the recommendations made by Iran. It 
expressed its appreciation for the positive achievements in the field of poverty eradication, 
the rights to work, education and health, the rights of women and children, the right to life, 
the right to participate in public affairs, cultural rights and the right to information. It hoped 
that future reports would reflect a continuation of its efforts to promote the rights of women 
and children and to implement existing programmes and projects to enhance socio-
economic rights, with a view to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>338. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea appreciated the efforts made by the Lao 
People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in promoting and protecting human rights. The State had 
intensified its efforts to implement strategies and measures, particularly in the areas of 
poverty eradication, education and human resources. It reiterated its appreciation for the 
commitment demonstrated by the State to the universal periodic review process.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>339. The International Federation for Human Rights Leagues deplored the fact that the 
Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had rejected two recommendations on the creation of an 
independent human rights commission and the release of persons detained for their 
participation in a peaceful demonstration. The release of persons who had participated in a 
peaceful demonstration, particularly those persons arrested in October 1999, would be a 
major step towards freedom of expression and assembly. It regretted that a number of 
countries had praised the State for its achievements in economic, social and cultural rights, 
as well as women&#8217;s rights, without making any specific recommendations in this regard. It 
also regretted that the participation of civil society in the preparation of the Lao report had 
been limited. It called upon the State to accept the principle of universality of human rights 
and to allow for the emergence of an independent civil society. 
</p>
<p>340. The Asian Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Network remained deeply concerned 
about continued human rights violations against the Hmong people, and urged the 
international community to monitor their situation. It was also concerned about the 
trafficking of almost 30 Hmong children in 2005, and urged the authorities to prosecute 
promptly those responsible and ascertain the whereabouts and well-being of these children. 
The Network believed that United Nations human rights experts should be given the 
opportunity to visit victims in the Xaysombune special zone, who were confronted with 
daily military operations. 
</p>
<p>341. Amnesty International welcomed the engagement by the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic 
Republic with the universal periodic review, but regretted that the State had rejected the 
recommendation to release detained peaceful demonstrators. It urged the Lao authorities to 
release, immediately and unconditionally, the three men arrested on 26 October 1999 for 
attempting to hold a peaceful demonstration in Vientiane, and thus to demonstrate its 
commitment to protect human rights in practice. Amnesty International welcomed the 
acceptance by the State of recommendations calling for full implementation of the 
provisions of the ICCPR related to freedom of speech, but was disappointed that the 
recommendations to revoke laws that suppress the right to freedom of expression and 
assembly had been rejected. It made reference to several recommendations concerning the 
Lao Hmong, including refugees and asylum-seekers returned from Thailand in December 
2009, and regretted that the State had only partially accepted these recommendations. It 
urged the Government to ensure unhindered and independent access by UNHCR and </p>


<p><b>134</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>humanitarian agencies to all returnees in resettlement sites at Phalak and Nongsan, in 
Vientiane Province, and Phonkham, in Borikhamsay Province. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>342. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic expressed its appreciation to all delegates 
and all representatives of international organizations and non-governmental organizations 
for their active participation in its review. In spite of the overwhelmingly positive feedback 
by the international community on the human rights situation, a few non-governmental 
observers had tried to paint a false, negative picture of the State. This was contrary to the 
principle of the review, and it firmly refuted these allegations. 
</p>
<p>343. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had learned much through the universal 
periodic review process, which created an opportunity to move forward and promote human 
rights at the national level, while cooperating with others at the regional level and with the 
international community so as to advance human rights globally. The State was fully 
committed to the Charter of the United Nations and the promotion and protection of human 
rights through the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
treaties to which it was a party, or would become in the future. 
</p>
<p>344. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic looked forward to continuing cooperation 
and exchange of experience on human rights with the international community, and hoped 
that the latter would continue to support its efforts, including with regard to the 
implementation of recommendations. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic would 
continue to engage in the process in a responsible way and play an active role in the 
international human rights community with a view to making a greater contribution to 
international human rights development. 
</p>
<p><b>  Spain 
</b></p>
<p>345. The review of Spain was held on 5 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Spain in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/ESP/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/ESP/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/ESP/3). 
</p><p>346. At its 16th meeting, on 21 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Spain (see section C below). 
347. The outcome of the review of Spain comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/6), the views of Spain concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/6/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>348. The delegation of Spain stated that its Government paid significant importance to 
the universal periodic review mechanism, which provided an opportunity to take stock of 
achievements and to identify pending challenges and areas of improvement. The exercise </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>135 
</b></p>
<p>also allowed Spain to compare and contrast its experience with that of other States 
Members of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>349. The delegation welcomed the role played by civil society in the preparation of the 
national report and by the 55 States that intervened during the interactive dialogue and 
which submitted 137 recommendations, 98 of which were accepted by Spain.  
</p>
<p>350. Spain pledged to clarify its position not only in relation to the 34 pending 
recommendations, but also to those it could not accept. A detailed account of Spain&#8217;s 
position was available in the addendum to the Working Group report, which includes the 
reasons why Spain could accept only 13 of the pending recommendations. 
</p>
<p>351. The delegation gave explanations of its position in relation to recommendations for 
which it felt delegations had a particular interest, such as racism, xenophobia and the 
integration of immigrants; human trafficking; the right to asylum; and equality and the fight 
against violence against women. The delegation also acknowledged the support it received 
for its campaign for the abolition of the death penalty and for the alliance of civilizations.  
</p>
<p>352. The delegation recalled the national plan on human rights of December 2008, which 
was based on two main components: equality, non-discrimination and integration; and 
human rights guarantees. A follow-up commission, composed of representatives of the 
Government and civil society, had been set up. The Commission held regular meetings and 
provided progress reports to the Congress. Although Spain was committed to the promotion 
of human rights, it was not in a position to accept all recommendations, and provided 
explanations in that regard. Spain had not signed the Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families because it considered it an 
unbalanced instrument. The Convention gave priority to the interests of the countries of 
origin, and its provisions did not make a distinction between migrant workers in a regular 
situation and those in an irregular situation. Furthermore, Spanish legislation provides 
broad protection to the rights of immigrants.  
</p>
<p>353. The definition of torture in article 174 of the criminal code does not present 
problems of interpretation and contains the basic elements of the definition contained in the 
Convention against Torture. The national definition also contains other features that 
provide further protection. 
</p>
<p>354. Spanish judges and courts investigate and deal with all reports of disappearances 
received under the principles of independence, tenure and responsibility, and in accordance 
with the law. Crimes against humanity and genocide are prosecuted in accordance with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>355. Incommunicado detention has all procedural safeguards in Spain. Its legal regime is 
quite restricted and requires permanent monitoring from the competent judge. 
Incommunicado detention is used for cases of armed bands or terrorist organizations, where 
police and judicial findings can have international implications and are particularly 
complex, without prejudice to the rights of detainees.  
</p><p>356. Spain&#8217;s legislation has the necessary legal means to act in cases of hate, xenophobic 
or defamatory speech and therefore it is not considered necessary to restrict freedom of 
expression.  
</p>
<p>357. Organic Law 1/2004 on measures against gender violence is a more protective and 
effective mechanism than a plan against gender violence. The law provides legal assistance 
and comprehensive social care to victims. Moreover, the strategic plan on equal 
opportunities for the period 2008&#8211;2011 incorporated a series of measures aimed at ending 
violence against women. </p>


<p><b>136</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>358. Spain did not consider the establishment of an additional national mechanism to 
identify victims of trafficking necessary. Highly qualified personnel in the security forces 
are currently tasked with the identification of victims of trafficking and worked in close 
cooperation with specialized non-governmental organizations, ensuring compliance with 
article 10 of the European Convention on Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>359. The Government had no choice but to reject the recommendation that it follow the 
findings of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while 
countering terrorism, since they drew into question, without substantiation, the legal and 
institutional framework under which a democratic State fights terrorism, without offering 
valid alternatives beyond personal opinions, as well as the impartiality and independence of 
the State powers, particularly those responsible for ensuring law enforcement and the 
protection of the rights of the individual. 
</p>
<p>360. Furthermore Spain did not consider it necessary to create another independent body 
to investigate complaints of ill-treatment, because, under the rule of law, judges are in 
charge of investigations. Judges in Spain are autonomous and independent of the 
Government and other public administrations, and have the necessary means and legal 
capacity to act accordingly. 
</p>
<p>361. The delegation recalled that Spain gave special importance to the international 
protection of the human rights of the victims of terrorism. At present, the main human 
rights infringements in Spain derived from the criminal activities of terrorists. The 
Government had the obligation to protect fundamental freedoms by outlawing 
organizations that provided political cover to terrorists, as endorsed by the European Court 
of Human Rights in a landmark decision. 
</p>
<p>362. The delegation concluded by reiterating the Government&#8217;s commitment to cooperate 
with international human rights bodies, and announced that, as a further sign of its 
commitment, it would follow up carefully on the recommendations and report periodically 
to the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>363. The Islamic Republic of Iran thanked Spain for its statement and expressed its 
appreciation that some of its recommendations had been accepted. It expressed concern at 
certain issues raised during the review, including human trafficking, in particular that of 
women and girls for sexual exploitation; discrimination based on ethnicity and religion 
against minorities and immigrants, and especially restrictive measures against the Muslim 
minority, particularly women and girls; the rampant use of torture and the distressing 
conditions in detention centres, in particular those holding foreigners and asylum-seekers; 
and the use of Spanish airspace and airports by a third country in the context of a 
programme of secret rendition and detention. The Islamic Republic of Iran urged Spain to 
adopt laws and measures to implement the recommendations made at the session of the 
Working Group, including those that it had made. 
</p>
<p>364. Algeria welcomed the responses to the recommendations provided by Spain. Both 
countries shared similar challenges, such as the fight against terrorism and the growing 
incidents of racism and xenophobia against migrants, and needed to work together to 
eradicate those threats. Spain had a clear commitment to human rights, as demonstrated in 
its national report, which reflected the progress achieved to date, most notably in the 
improvement of the institutional and legislative framework for the protection of human 
rights and the ratification of most international human rights instruments. Algeria 
appreciated the fact that Spain had accepted two of its recommendations, and encouraged it </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>to accept the recommendation envisaging the ratification of the International Convention on 
the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>365. Belarus expressed its gratitude for the detailed comments made by Spain during the 
eighth session of the Working Group. It noted that, of the 137 recommendations made, 
Spain was of view that 29 had already been implemented. Belarus noted the comments 
made on the recommendations that Spain was unable to support, and expressed its 
understanding in that regard. Belarus welcomed Spain&#8217;s determination to work on the 
implementation of recommendations, and believed that Spain would continue to improve 
the situation of migrants and the protection of migrants&#8217; rights, and that, in particular, it 
would take measures to ensure the well-being of migrant children. Belarus regretted that the 
recommendations relating to the ratification of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which 
guaranteed the rights of migrants, had not been accepted. 
</p>
<p>366. Azerbaijan thanked Spain for the substantive responses provided to the 
recommendations, and welcomed its constructive approach to the universal periodic review. 
It commended the acceptance by Spain of most of the recommendations. It noted with 
satisfaction that the issues of the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the development of a national plan 
of action against racism and xenophobia enjoyed the support of Spain and were in the 
process of implementation. Despite the threat of terrorism, Spain had never abandoned the 
rule of law in its response to it. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>367. The Office of the People&#8217;s Defender of Spain stated that its mandate was provided 
for by the Constitution and that it had been accredited as a national human rights institution 
with status &#8220;A&#8221; by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions, and 
that it was in full compliance with the Paris Principles. It welcomed the efforts made for the 
preparation of the national report; as a whole, the recommendations touched very much 
upon the Office&#8217;s own mandate and would certainly help it to strengthen its activities, 
which in recent years had included issues such as family reunification, living conditions in 
the prison system, training for the police, assistance to victims of trafficking and the 
establishment of a national mechanism for the prevention of torture. 
</p>
<p>368. Amnesty International noted that, though Spain had reformed its criminal code in 
2010, it had failed to align the definition of torture with article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture, and expressed disappointment that recommendations to address this shortcoming 
made during the review had been rejected. It also observed that the Committee against 
Torture had recommended that two elements should be added to the existing definition. 
Despite the ratification of the Convention on Enforced Disappearances in 2009, the 
criminal code still failed to define the crime of enforced disappearances in accordance with 
international law. It also expressed its profound disappointment with Spain&#8217;s refusal to 
review its regime of incommunicado detention. Stating that it regularly received allegations 
of torture and ill-treatment during incommunicado detention, Amnesty International 
strongly urged Spain to reconsider this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>369. Human Rights Watch recalled that, during the review of Spain, five countries had 
raised the issue of impunity of crimes committed during the Franco dictatorship and 
regretted that, to date, the only person prosecuted in relation with those crimes was judge 
Baltazar Garzon, who had sought to investigate cases of enforced disappearances involving 
more than 100,000 victims between 1936 and 1951. Unlike Spanish courts, which had 
routinely applied the 1977 amnesty law which covered all crimes of a political nature 
committed prior to December in 1977, judge Garzon had refused to apply this law. Human 
Rights Watch stated that Governments had an obligation to provide victims of human rights </p>


<p><b>138</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>abuses with an effective remedy, including justice, truth and adequate reparation. Recalling 
2008 Human Rights Committee recommendations, Human Rights Watch called upon Spain 
to repeal the 1977 amnesty law. 
</p>
<p>370. Action Canada for Population and Development noted with appreciation that Spain 
had adopted a law on reproductive health and the voluntary interruption of pregnancy. It 
observed, however, the existence of a number of shortcomings and requested, inter alia, that 
(a) in accordance with international standards, guidelines and recommendations issued 
regarding the prevention and treatment of HIV no longer included the requirement that 
pregnant women be tested; (b) the multi-sector plan on HIV/AIDS be evaluated, based on a 
gender perspective; (c) the State and local governments investigate existing conditions, on 
the basis of HIV status, of women victims of domestic violence who sought access to safe 
homes and who were required to undergo HIV testing; and (d) sexual education with a 
focus on reproductive rights be guaranteed throughout the territory. 
</p>
<p>371. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme noted with satisfaction 
the efforts made by Spain to improve the institutional and normative framework for the 
protection of human rights, the ratification of most international human rights instruments, 
its cooperation with special procedures and its engagement to reach the 0.7 per cent of GNP 
allocated to development aid. It encouraged Spain to protect non-accompanied immigrant 
children, to harmonize the anti-terrorist law with human rights standards, to revise the 
agreement of readmission ratified by African States in order to guarantee respect of human 
rights, to create a national commission to fight racial discrimination, to define torture in the 
penal code in accordance with the Convention against Torture and to fight against the 
violent treatment of women.  
</p>
<p>372. The Islamic Human Rights Commission highlighted its concern that Spain allowed 
local councils to regulate the dress code of their Muslim women citizens by banning the use 
of the Burqa and full-face veils in all non-religious places or events. It added that this 
practice gave local councils free reign to target Muslims without the intervention of 
Congress. It also noted that no causal link existed between security risks and the wearing of 
a Burqa or veil, and that the European Court of Human Rights had held that freedom of 
expression included forms of expression that &#8220;offend, shock or disturb the State or any 
section of the population&#8221;. It requested that Spain lift the ban and take necessary measures 
to safeguard the religious rights of Muslim citizens. 
</p>
<p>373. In a joint statement, the European Region of the Lesbian and Gay Association 
(ILGA-Europe) and Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van 
Homoseksualiteit (COC Nederland) commended Spain for training police and prison staff 
on the rights of persons of minority sexual orientation or gender identity, as recommended 
by the Czech Republic. ILGA-Europe and COC Nederland asked Spain to provide 
information about measures envisaged to implement this recommendation and to include 
civil society in training. They encouraged Spain to implement, as suggested by Sweden, 
legislation granting refugee status on the basis of fear of persecution based on gender or 
sexual orientation. They acknowledged the positive steps taken by Spain to counter 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and encouraged it to share best practices 
in this field and to consider applying the Yogyakarta Principles as a guide to assist in policy 
development.  
</p>
<p>374. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims observed that discrimination 
against women in the workplace persisted, noting that unemployment was approximately 
twice that of men and that the average salary for women was 30 per cent lower than that of 
men. It added that the Roma minority in Spain in particular faced discrimination with 
regard to housing, education and employment. Muslims were also faced with multiple 
forms of discrimination. In conclusion, it urged Spain to take further measures to provide 
police and prison officials with human rights training focusing on the rights of women, </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>139 
</b></p>
<p>children and minorities; to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the Roma 
community, migrants and religious minorities; and to take measures against perpetrators of 
racially motivated acts against these groups. 
</p>
<p>375. The International Federation of the Action of Christians for the Abolition of Torture 
welcomed the quality and level of the Spanish delegation during the review. It regretted, 
however, that Spain had rejected 18 recommendations during the Working Group session, 
without holding consultations with civil society and concerned ministries. It welcomed the 
written submission of Spain&#8217;s position on the pending recommendations, the acceptance of 
recommendations calling for the prevention of torture and ill-treatment, and the measures 
taken to recognize the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances. It 
regretted, however, that Spain had rejected the recommendation asking it to reconsider the 
use of secret detention, which could facilitate torture and constitute a case of ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>376. The European Centre for Law and Justice expressed its disappointment that the 
objection to a compulsory curriculum, which it considered a core issue, had not been 
adequately addressed in the Working Group report. It recalled that over 50,000 families 
objected to the compulsory curriculum in public and private schools. A new subject called 
&#8220;education for citizenship&#8221; included themes that would negatively influence the conscience 
and values of children and had thus been rejected by thousands of parents. The Centre also 
reported that, in 2009, the Supreme Court had ruled against parents objecting to this aspect 
of the curriculum, and that the constitutional court had dismissed their claims. It concluded 
that this was a major issue of freedom of expression to be urgently addressed by Spain. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>377. The delegation of Spain reiterated the State&#8217;s commitment to human rights and 
freedoms and thanked all those who participated in the review of Spain. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lesotho 
</b></p>
<p>378. The review of Lesotho was held on 7 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Lesotho in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/3). 
</p><p>379. At its 16th meeting, on 21 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Lesotho (see section C below). 
380. The outcome of the review of Lesotho comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/7), the views of Lesotho concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/7/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>381. The Minister for Justice, Human Rights and Correctional Services and for Law and 
Constitutional Affairs expressed her appreciation for the opportunity to give an update on </p>


<p><b>140</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>the issues that arose at a successful interactive session with the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review of Lesotho in May 2010. Lesotho appreciated the objective and 
impartial manner in which the review was conducted, applauded the Working Group and 
welcomed its report. 
</p>
<p>382. The delegation stated that Lesotho had received 122 recommendations, of which 36 
recommendations enjoyed its support, 51 were accepted as they were already being 
implemented, 5 because they were inaccurate and lacked factual basis, while the responses 
to 25 recommendations had been deferred for further consideration. 
</p>
<p>383. Lesotho welcomed the recommendation that it ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and allow visits by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture 
in places of detention. It stated its position with regard to the importance of proper 
procedures and conduct being observed during such visits. 
</p>
<p>384. On the recommendation concerning the establishment of preventive mechanisms 
against acts of torture, the delegation stated that mechanisms at the national level were in 
place, such as the office of the Ombudsman, whose mandate entailed, among others, 
inspecting places of detention. The transformation resource centre, a non-governmental 
organization, also advocated for the protection of human rights in various ways, such as 
through the monitoring of human rights in places of detention. 
</p>
<p>385. The recommendation to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights did not enjoy the support of Lesotho because it was a 
least developed country. Chapter III of the Constitution of Lesotho spelled out the 
principles of State policy, which entailed rights of a socio-economic nature. These were not 
enforceable by courts of law, but implemented on an incremental basis, through policy, 
guidelines and social programmes subject to Lesotho&#8217;s economic capacity and 
development.  
</p>
<p>386. The recommendation to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights did not enjoy the support of the Government of Lesotho because 
it called for the abolition of the death penalty. Lesotho retained the death penalty as a 
deterrent for the most serious crimes, such as murder, statutory rape and high treason. 
However, there were appropriate safeguards in the execution of the death penalty, such as 
the pardon committee and the prerogative of mercy by His Majesty the King. No capital 
punishment had been carried out since 1995. 
</p>
<p>387. Lesotho would consider ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities after consultations with relevant stakeholders. However, 
the State would not be time-bound in respect of this recommendation, given that 
implementation of the protocol required infrastructure, technology and resources that 
Lesotho did not currently have. 
</p>
<p>388. During the treaty event to be held by the General Assembly, the Prime Minister 
would sign the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, since Cabinet had already approved its ratification. 
</p>
<p>389. With regard to the recommendation to integrate and incorporate into national laws 
the international human rights instruments to which Lesotho was a State party, the 
recommendation enjoyed the support of Lesotho to the extent that it was an ongoing 
process. Lesotho remained committed to fulfilling its obligations of incorporating 
international instruments into national legislation in compliance with international law. 
</p>
<p>390. Regarding the enactment of the Convention against Torture in national legislation, 
Lesotho supported the recommendation and would enact the Convention fully in 
accordance with a self-determined time frame. The delegation drew attention to the existing 
criminal procedure and Evidence Act of 1981, which lay down procedures and methods </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>141 
</b></p>
<p>that should be adopted to avoid instances of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment 
of suspects of crime. 
</p>
<p>391. Concerning the removal of the reservation to article 2 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Government had initiated a 
discussion, still ongoing, on the issue. Despite the existing reservation, Lesotho had taken 
measures to ensure the elimination of discrimination against women and gender equality by 
reviewing all laws that were discriminatory against women. Lesotho had enacted laws in 
this regard, such as the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act of 2006, which ruled out 
discrimination against women in marriage, and the Sexual Offences Act of 2003, which 
addressed the offence of rape under common law. 
</p>
<p>392. Regarding the recommendation to implement and amend the Sexual Offences Act of 
2003 to ensure the full accountability of offenders, compliance with human rights standards 
and efficient integration of programmes for victims, the delegation stated that Lesotho 
would not amend the Act for the reason that there was no law in Lesotho that barred a 
victim from lodging a civil claim against the offender. However, the Government had 
established a one-stop centre, the Lapeng Centre, for survivors of domestic violence, and 
the Victims of Crime Support Office. Studies on the protection of victims&#8217; rights were 
being undertaken by the law reform commission to inform the enactment of the laws on 
protection of victims and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>393. The Children&#8217;s Protection and Welfare Bill, which was before Parliament, provided 
restorative justice to facilitate reconciliation between offender and victim; intensive 
advocacy programmes were being carried out by parliamentarians and other stakeholders 
for the implementation of the Bill. 
</p>
<p>394. The Government of Lesotho welcomed the recommendation to enhance cooperation 
with treaty bodies and special procedures mandate holders. It would, however, consider it 
further once the implementation of the recommendations made during the African Peer 
Review Mechanism process of 2009 was completed. Lesotho also welcomed the 
recommendation to ensure timely submission of State party reports and drew attention to 
the efforts made to fulfil its reporting obligation. The report for the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women had been submitted, while Lesotho was still 
working on the reports on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Convention against Torture and the periodic report on the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The delay had resulted from the limited resources 
of the country, which would welcome technical assistance and capacity-building in that 
regard.  
</p>
<p>395. The recommendation to end the practice of using the juvenile training centre as a 
form of alternative care did not enjoy the support of Lesotho, since it was factually 
incorrect. The centre was used exclusively for detaining children in conflict with the law 
and were at risk of offending. 
</p>
<p>396. Despite challenges it faced, as described in the national report and during the review, 
Lesotho reiterated its commitment to accelerate sustainable economic growth, to continue 
to work on the establishment of a national human rights commission, to improve access to 
justice for all, to intensify and continue efforts in the fight against corruption, and to strive 
to achieve the objectives of Vision 2020 and the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p><p>397. Lesotho appreciated the opportunity to take stock of its achievements, shortcomings 
and challenges. It welcomed the technical support offered by some Member States in 
response to its calls for assistance. </p>


<p><b>142</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>398. The delegation concluded by reiterating Lesotho&#8217;s commitment to working 
cooperatively with the Council and Member States in promoting and protecting human 
rights for all.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>399. Morocco stated that the review of Lesotho had demonstrated its true commitment to 
the promotion of human rights, despite the difficulties it encountered as a least developed 
country, receiving the lowest rate of official development assistance per capita. Although 
the global economic and financial crisis and climate change had inevitably had a negative 
impact on economic and social rights, Lesotho ensured the best protection and promotion of 
human rights and had had success in a number of areas, such as in tackling trafficking in 
women and children and ensuring better political representation of women. Lesotho&#8217;s 
National Vision 2020 had identified priority areas to reduce poverty, and Morocco thanked 
Lesotho for accepting the recommendations it had made in this regard. 
</p>
<p>400. Algeria expressed its appreciation for the additional information submitted as an 
addendum to the Working Group report and for having accepted a large number of 
recommendations, some of which were already in the process of implementation. It recalled 
the commitment of Lesotho to the African Peer Review Mechanism, in which Lesotho had 
recently participated. Lesotho clearly demonstrated its commitment to the Mechanism, in 
particular in security sector reform, electoral system reform, the promotion of women&#8217;s 
rights and the high rate of literacy in adults. In spite of being a least developed country, it 
had made rapid progress in the area of human rights, and called upon the international 
community to assist the country in facing the challenges created by the current financial 
and economic crisis, in particular in the vital areas of food security, reducing the high 
unemployment rate and the fight against HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>401. Egypt welcomed the serious and open stance of Lesotho, emphasizing its 
commitment to implement the agreed recommendations fully. Egypt was convinced that 
Lesotho&#8217;s positive and constructive engagement would translate into tangible steps to 
achieve the aspirations of the people of Lesotho. Lesotho was making commendable efforts 
to fulfil its obligations. As a land-locked least developed country, it faced particular 
challenges in relation to the fulfilment of some human rights, especially economic and 
social rights. In this regard, Egypt called upon the international community to extend the 
assistance required by Lesotho on the basis of its national priorities and in accordance with 
its international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>402. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was pleased to note that 
Lesotho had accepted a large number of recommendations and, in particular its 
recommendations on establishing the delayed national human rights commission in 
accordance with the Paris Principles, prioritizing the enactment of the draft Children&#8217;s 
Protection and Welfare Bill, ensuring that provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child were fully incorporated into national legislation and prioritizing the enactment of the 
domestic violence bill. It also welcomed the provision of an addendum to the report of the 
Working Group and looked forward to future opportunities to discuss follow-up and 
implementation. It noted that its recommendation to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights did not enjoy Lesotho&#8217;s support 
and expressed its hope that Lesotho would be in a position to reconsider that point in the 
future.  
</p>
<p>403. Nepal welcomed the commitments made by Lesotho and its comprehensive 
engagement with the universal periodic review process. It appreciated the initiatives taken 
by Lesotho in enhancing people&#8217;s participation in law-making, policy formulation and the 
fielding of proposals to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights of its people. The high </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>143 
</b></p>
<p>literacy rates, the political empowerment of women, the improvement in health services and 
freedom of press were indicative of policy successes. The steps taken to establish a national 
human rights commission were laudable.  
</p>
<p>404. Nigeria commended Lesotho for its insightful comments on the Working Group 
report, which demonstrated the country&#8217;s readiness to continue to engage with the United 
Nations human rights system. It commended Lesotho also for the additional information 
provided on the protection of human rights, in spite of the numerous challenges, and on its 
acceptance and work towards the implementation of most recommendations made during 
its review. It called on the international community to support these efforts through 
technical assistance and capacity-building programmes. 
</p>
<p>405. Zimbabwe thanked Lesotho for its acceptance of most of the recommendations and 
to the work in progress with regard to their implementation. This was clear testimony of 
Lesotho&#8217;s full cooperation with the Council with a view to further enhancing and advancing 
the promotion and protection of human rights. Zimbabwe noted that, despite its limited 
resources, Lesotho had made tremendous progress in all fields that had helped consolidate 
human rights. Zimbabwe also noted with satisfaction that Lesotho had rejected 
recommendations which had been made in disregard for Lesotho&#8217;s culture and traditions, 
which were deeply rooted in the promotion and protection of human rights through the 
oneness of the Basotho. 
</p>
<p>406. Botswana commended Lesotho&#8217;s openness, objectivity and constructive engagement 
during the Working Group review, and congratulated the Government on providing 
responses to recommendations. It welcomed the fact that Lesotho had accepted the majority 
of recommendations and noted that a very good number was already being implemented, 
and wished it well in implementing them. Noting that Lesotho was a developing country 
that continued to face challenges in the implementation of its international human rights 
obligations domestically and internationally, it expressed the hope that the Government 
would benefit from the support of the international community in that regard. 
</p>
<p>407. Kenya warmly welcomed the delegation of Lesotho and thanked it for the reply to 
the recommendations made during the Working Group session. Kenya noted that Lesotho 
had made a great effort to accept most recommendations, which was a clear indication of its 
commitment to the promotion and protection of the human rights of its citizens. Kenya took 
note of the commitments made by Lesotho to improve human rights through the universal 
periodic review process, and congratulated it on the conclusion of its review. 
</p>
<p>408. South Africa commended Lesotho for having accepted the many recommendations 
made, and thanked its Government for the constructive approach demonstrated during the 
review process. South Africa regarded the recommendations as a contribution to the 
promotion and protection of human rights in the country, and would assist in the fulfilment 
of its human rights obligations. It recalled that many challenges facing Lesotho were caused 
by the current financial and food crisis and that continued work would be required in the 
provision of health services, especially to combat HIV/AIDS. It welcomed Lesotho&#8217;s 
continued fight against poverty and the steps taken to eliminate discrimination against 
women and to improve the living standards of the people of Lesotho. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>409. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network addressed recommendation 98, paragraphs 
2, 4 and 5, which called for the amendment of the penal code provisions criminalizing 
consensual sexual activity between persons of the same sex, and stated that the 
criminalization of consensual same-sex activity constituted a violation of established 
international human rights law and undermined public health initiatives. It referred to the 
statements of the Nobel peace prize winner, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and of the </p>


<p><b>144</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General, who called for an end to criminal laws against homosexuality, and 
expressed its disappointment that Lesotho had not accepted these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>410. Conectas Direitos Humanos expressed appreciation for the accommodating stance of 
Lesotho to the views of civil society during the review process and its willingness to 
establish a broad-based forum for the inclusion of civil society, academia and other sectors 
in creating governance structures based on respect for human rights. In its view, all 
recommendations made were in line with Lesotho&#8217;s other commitments, particularly under 
the African Peer Review Mechanism and international legal instruments to which Lesotho 
was a party. It noted that the recommendations that did not enjoy support had to do with 
abolishing capital punishment, protecting LGBTI rights, combating trafficking of women 
and children, the decriminalization of defamation, the use of juvenile training centres as 
alternative care for children in conflict with law, as well as withdrawal of its reservation on 
article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>411. The Minister thanked the Working Group for the successful interactive session held 
in May. She appreciated the opportunity to further clarify Lesotho&#8217;s stance on its 
commitment to the promotion and protection of the enjoyment of universal human rights by 
all before the Council. The delegation thanked the troika that had coordinated Lesotho&#8217;s 
review. The delegation reiterated its commitment to work and cooperate with the Council 
and Member States. Lesotho could not implement its human rights obligations at a greater 
pace than that of the entire Lesotho nation. The delegation noted the need to enhance its 
capacity in training and raising awareness on human rights. Capacity and resources 
permitting, Lesotho would continue to carry out its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>412. The review of Kenya was held on 6 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:

</p><p>413. At its 17th meeting, on 22 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Kenya (see section C below). 
414. The outcome of the review of Kenya comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/8), the views of Kenya concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>415. Kenya reiterated its commitment to the universal periodic review and to promoting 
universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. Its new 
Constitution, promulgated on 27 August 2010, addressed governance challenges, renewed 
the faith of Kenyans in the rule of law and established value-driven national institutions. It </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>145 
</b></p>
<p>promised to restore integrity to the executive, judiciary, parliament and electoral system 
and represented a new beginning in the process of political transformation and a unique 
opportunity for national healing and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>416. Recalling that 150 recommendations had been made by delegations during the 
review in May, Kenya had accepted 128 of these recommendations and postponed the 
consideration of 15. Only seven recommendations had not enjoyed the support of Kenya. 
With regard to the postponed recommendations, broad consultations had been held at the 
national level and a number of measures had been taken to implement them, many of which 
related to the holding of a peaceful referendum on the new Constitution, prohibiting 
discrimination on the grounds of sex, and implementation of human rights instruments to 
better protect children, marginalized communities, persons with disabilities and freedom of 
information, in addition to the need for institutional reform. The referendum on the new 
Constitution had been held on 4 August in a peaceful manner. The new Constitution 
guaranteed most of the rights that had been subject to the universal periodic review 
recommendations and also the right of everyone to institute court proceedings where rights 
had been denied or violated. The Government was also taking measures to reform the 
judiciary and the police, and had published a number of bills in this regard, including the 
Independent Police Oversight Authority Bill. 
</p>
<p>417. With regard to the recommendations on the ratification of international instruments, 
an advisory committee was assessing all international instruments, including optional 
protocols, to which Kenya was not a party. The death penalty had been retained in the new 
Constitution; any attempt to abolish it would not enjoy parliamentary approval at the 
present time. 
</p>
<p>418. While no action had yet been taken on the recommendation to establish a local 
tribunal to try the perpetrators of the 2007 post-election violence, Kenya had signed an 
agreement with the International Criminal Court granting it immunity and privileges to 
operate locally, thus allowing it to set up a court in the country to try post-election violence 
suspects should it wish to do so. Kenyan resistance to a local tribunal in preference to the 
International Criminal Court was born out of the mistrust that Kenyans had towards 
national justice mechanisms. It was hoped that the ongoing reforms in the justice system 
would help to change this perception. 
</p>
<p>419. With regard to the seven recommendations that had not enjoyed the support of 
Kenya in May, after national consultations, Kenya was now in a position to accept the 
recommendation on the protection of rights of &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221;, without giving undue 
weight to the terminology, bearing in mind also that the new Constitution recognized the 
existence of marginalized communities, which included indigenous communities. Measures 
had been taken to implement recommendations on extrajudicial executions, including 
through institutional changes in the police and the enactment of new legislation.  
</p>
<p>420. In view of the above developments, of the seven recommendations that did not enjoy 
the support of the delegation in May, only the recommendation on decriminalizing same-
sex unions had been rejected in full. 
</p><p>421. In conclusion, Kenya reaffirmed its commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights and its support for the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>422. Algeria noted that the successful holding of the referendum on the new Constitution 
reinforced democracy in the country and was a major advance in realizing planned reforms. 
Algeria was particularly pleased with the progress made to promote social, economic and 
cultural rights through programmes aimed at achieving the Millennium Development </p>


<p><b>146</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>Goals. The long-term strategy contained in Kenya Vision 2030 guided the national 
development programme and projects promoting national reconciliation, economic 
reconstruction, as well as the fight against poverty and unemployment. 
</p>
<p>423. Egypt stated that it had had the honour of being a troika member for the review of 
Kenya. It noted that there was a high degree of openness on the part of Kenya in its 
consideration of the recommendations, and that such openness was also demonstrated by 
Kenya&#8217;s cooperation with the universal periodic review process, as well as its seriousness 
and political will to sustain national reconciliation and institutionalize the promotion and 
protection of human rights. Egypt congratulated Kenya on the promulgation of its new 
Constitution. It noted the efforts made and challenges faced as described by Kenya in 
fulfilling its human rights obligations, and called on the international community to assist 
Kenya in this regard. 
</p>
<p>424. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was pleased to note that 
four of its recommendations enjoyed the support of Kenya, and welcomed the successful 
adoption of the new Constitution. It expressed disappointment, however, at Kenya&#8217;s hosting 
of President Bashir at its constitutional ceremony, which was in violation of Kenya&#8217;s 
obligations under the Rome Statute. There were numerous reports of impunity causing 
instability in Kenya. Action against impunity was vital to the future of the region. The 
United Kingdom welcomed the commitments made by Kenya to cooperate with the 
International Criminal Court to achieve justice for the victims of the 2007 post-election 
violence, as well as the commitments to improve human rights through the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p>425. Morocco noted the considerable efforts made to promote economic, social and 
cultural rights though an ambitious development agenda. These objectives could not be 
achieved, however, without international assistance, particularly from the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. Joint effort by the United Nations and the 
Government of Kenya were needed to secure implementation of the recommendations and 
voluntary pledges and to reinforce measures taken within the framework of Vision 2030. 
The visionary nature of this project would allow the Government to secure just and 
equitable development in all regions and consolidate the culture of social peace and 
national reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>426. Djibouti noted with satisfaction that most of the recommendations made during the 
Working Group session had been accepted, and encouraged Kenya to continue its efforts to 
secure the promotion and protection of human rights and meet the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>427. Sri Lanka commended the manner in which Kenya had participated in the universal 
periodic review process and the detailed responses provided by the delegation. It welcomed 
the establishment of the National Commission on Gender and Development and the Anti-
Corruption Commission, adding that the strengthening of institutional mechanisms was a 
key element in improving the overall human rights situation. Sri Lanka acknowledged 
Kenya&#8217;s efforts in the promotion and protection of human rights and was pleased to note 
the achievements made. 
</p>
<p>428. Nepal congratulated the Government and people of Kenya on the new democratic 
Constitution, which had been endorsed by the people through a national referendum. Nepal 
welcomed Kenya&#8217;s long-term plan, Vision 2030, and was encouraged to see the progress 
made in national reconciliation. Nepal also noted Kenya&#8217;s active role in and constructive 
contributions to the Council. 
</p>
<p>429. Rwanda noted that Kenya had accepted most recommendations made during its 
review and had taken steps for their implementation. Rwanda had no doubt that the 
recommendations made during the review would continue to be used as guidelines by </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>147 
</b></p>
<p>Kenya in the implementation of its commitments. Rwanda congratulated Kenya on the 
recent promulgation of the new Constitution, which had been adopted by referendum, and 
commended the Government and people of Kenya for the peaceful and transparent manner 
in which the referendum had been conducted. Rwanda believed that the new Constitution 
would provide the Government with better tools to discharge fully its national obligations 
and commitments. 
</p>
<p>430. Nigeria congratulated Kenya on the successful conclusion of its constitutional 
review and the adoption of a new Constitution, and commended the delegation for its 
successful engagement in the universal periodic review process. It was pleased to note the 
undertakings and positive steps taken by Kenya to date in fulfilling its international human 
rights obligations and ensuring the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
Nigeria encouraged Kenya to remain steadfast in pursuing measures in accordance with its 
national priorities to enhance the enjoyment of human rights by its people. Nigeria called 
on the international community to render all assistance necessary to Kenya to fulfil its 
human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>431. Zimbabwe expressed its appreciation for the acceptance by Kenya of most 
recommendations, stating that those recommendations that had been rejected were of 
concern not only to Kenya, but to all Africans, as they were contrary to African traditions. 
Certain aspects of Kenya&#8217;s human rights record had been exaggerated. Zimbabwe 
expressed optimism that the momentum in the promotion and protection of human rights in 
Kenya would be maintained. 
</p>
<p>432. Botswana welcomed the additional information provided in response to some of the 
issues that had been raised during the review, as well as the fact that Kenya had decided to 
accept many of the recommendations made. Botswana understood the challenges that some 
of the recommendations placed on the national legislative process and implementation 
framework, and hoped that Kenya would be accorded the policy space by the international 
community in the efforts to meet its domestic and international human rights obligations. 
Botswana also congratulated Kenya on the adoption of the new Constitution. 
</p>
<p>433. Lesotho noted with satisfaction that Kenya had accepted many of the 
recommendations made, including the recommendation made by Lesotho. It expressed 
appreciation for the measures taken to reduce poverty and to achieve economic 
development goals. Lesotho also noted with appreciation the efforts made in relation to the 
ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Optional Protocol 1, 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Optional Protocol and 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. It welcomed the decision to allow the International Criminal Court to 
investigate the 2007 post-election violence and stated that this, together with the adoption 
of the new Constitution, would go a long way in bringing about the much-needed 
reconciliation among Kenyans. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>434. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights commended Kenya for its 
positive engagement with the universal periodic review process, and would support and 
monitor the implementation of the recommendations. It also commended the people of 
Kenya for having adopted a new Constitution, which would aid the recovery of Kenya from 
its 2007 post-elections trauma. In this regard, punishing high- and middle-level perpetrators 
of the violence was a key part of the recovery process; Kenya should ensure cooperation 
with the International Criminal Court to this end. Kenya should take steps to better enable 
visits and human rights missions by United Nations mandate holders and put in place a 
clear policy framework to this end. The Commission also called on Kenya to seek the 
immediate de jure abolition of the death penalty. </p>


<p><b>148</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>435. Action Canada for Population and Development welcomed the fact that Kenya had 
accepted a number of recommendations and pledged to revise national laws to uphold fully 
the principle of non-discrimination, eradicate the use of torture and ill-treatment by public 
officials, and take effective measures to safeguard the work of human rights defenders. It 
was disappointed, however, that the Government had rejected recommendations to provide 
for the protection and equal treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex 
persons, who were repeatedly discriminated against and continued to face threats of 
violence as well as torture, ill-treatment and harassment at the hands of public authorities. It 
recalled that the Secretary-General had stated that cultural considerations should not stand 
in the way of basic human rights, and urged the Government to respect, protect and fulfil 
the rights of all Kenyans. 
</p>
<p>436. The World Organisation against Torture commended Kenya for the adoption of a 
new Constitution, which provided a favourable legal environment for the protection and 
promotion of human rights. However, it was concerned by Kenya&#8217;s breach of its obligations 
under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court by failing to arrest President Al-
Bashir and by harassing two human rights defenders who publically protested on this 
occasion. Referring to the recent agreement between Kenya and the Court to enable the 
latter to conduct investigations into the 2007 post-election violence, it urged full 
cooperation with the International Criminal Court and the establishment of a domestic 
mechanism to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of other perpetrators, who would 
not be dealt with by the Court. It also urged Kenya to respect the work of human rights 
defenders and to raise public awareness concerning the degrading nature of the death 
penalty and the need for its abolition. 
</p>
<p>437. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme deplored the fact that the 
Government had neither implemented the recommendations of the commission of inquiry 
into the post-electoral violence of 2007 nor the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial killings. It also regretted the persistence of impunity, noting that those 
responsible for the post-electoral violence had still not been identified. At the same time, 
human rights defenders and witnesses of the violence continued to be subject to 
intimidation. It encouraged the Government to continue to strengthen relations between 
different communities and minorities in order to protect their rights and move towards the 
national reconciliation envisaged in the Kenya Vision 2030. It also encouraged the 
Government to combat discrimination against women, particularly in relation to female 
genital mutilation, and to harmonize anti-terrorist measures with international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>438. Franciscans International welcomed Kenya&#8217;s support for a significant number of 
recommendations, particularly those relating to the necessity of effective measures to 
prevent and punish all forms of violence against women, awareness-raising programmes on 
the rights of women, and the strengthening of law enforcement and the judicial system. It 
expressed concern at the situation of single mothers and urged Kenya to develop a policy 
addressing the specific challenges faced by this particular vulnerable group. Franciscans 
International urged Kenya to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It welcomed Kenya&#8217;s support 
for the recommendation made by Spain to ensure the equitable distribution of water and 
food to the entire population. It recommended that Kenya invest in research to prevent the 
negative impact of biofuel production on food production areas. 
</p>
<p>439. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues applauded Kenya for 
supporting 128 recommendations and suggested, in the light of the adoption of the new 
Constitution, that the Government: (a) fully operationalize the provisions of the Persons 
with Disabilities Act 2003 and take measures to ensure the full realization and enjoyment of 
the rights of persons with disabilities; (b) pass the reproductive health bill into law to deal </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>149 
</b></p>
<p>comprehensively with the issues of reproductive health and maternal mortality; and (c) 
track the nature and extent of women&#8217;s participation in the political arena and measures to 
enhance their participation. The Government was also urged to fulfil its obligations in 
respect of the rights to education, health, housing and food, as enshrined in the new 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>440. Conectas Direitos Humanos applauded Kenya for reconsidering the 
recommendations pertaining to the rights of indigenous peoples. It was encouraged by the 
promulgation of the new Constitution and the expansion of its bill of rights to include the 
rights of minorities and marginalized groups. It suggested that Kenya implement fully the 
recommendations relating to minorities and indigenous peoples; commit to the 
implementation of recommendations relating to indigenous peoples made by the Special 
Rapporteur; and consider ratifying ILO Convention No. 169 and adopting the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>441. Kenya stated that the Ministry of Justice had set a timeline to consider the outcome 
of the universal periodic review and to prepare a road map for its follow-up. Referring to its 
constitutional process for ratifications, Kenya noted that the question of ratification of 
international instruments, including the Convention on Enforced Disappearances and ILO 
Convention No. 169, would be considered soon. In this context, Kenya also pledged to 
submit a progress report to the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Armenia 
</b></p>
<p>442. The review of Armenia was held on 6 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Armenia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/ARM/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/ARM/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/ARM/3). 
</p><p>443. At its 17th meeting, on 22 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Armenia (see section C below). 
444. The outcome of the review of Armenia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/9), the views of Armenia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/9/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>445. Armenia thanked all States Members of the Human Rights Council and observers 
that had participated in its review at the Working Group session in May 2010 with a 
constructive attitude, sharing their assessment of the human rights situation in the country. 
Armenia noted that this had reassured the country of its successes on the path to building a 
truly democratic society where the rule of law reigns and all human rights are fully 
protected and promoted. Likewise, the review was a chance to revisit all outstanding issues. </p>


<p><b>150</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>446. Armenia approached the universal periodic review process with a genuine will to get 
the utmost out of this exchange among friends in order to make adjustments to their 
existing policies and adopt new ones, if necessary, to advance further the human rights 
situation in the country. Armenia was the first delegation to respond in writing to all 
advance questions before the review, and hoped that this would become a practice in the 
Council, as it allowed more informed and updated recommendations to be presented to 
Member States under review. 
</p>
<p>447. Regrettably, Armenia&#8217;s open and constructive approach was not entirely 
reciprocated. Attempts had been made at the review to politicize the discussion, diverting it 
to issues that went beyond the scope and mandate of the Working Group. Moreover, the 
unacceptable procedural violations with which the draft report was prepared raised 
numerous concerns with the delegation, making it imperative for the Council to continue its 
work to improve working methods to ensure equal treatment among all States Members of 
the United Nations and to clarify that political considerations should never get in the way of 
clearly defined rules. 
</p>
<p>448. Armenia had received 85 recommendations from 47 countries and expressed its 
position on 80 of them during the Working Group meeting on 10 May. A total of 52 
recommendations were considered implemented or in the process of implementation, and 
27 enjoyed its support as being in line with the policies in place and projected programmes. 
Only one recommendation had been rejected as not corresponding to the actual situation on 
the ground. 
</p>
<p>449. In the follow-up to the universal periodic review discussion, Armenia has again 
closely reviewed the remaining five recommendations. To this end, a round table was 
organized in July 2010 with the participation of the representatives of ministries and all 
international and regional organizations represented in the country. Armenia prepared 
written answers to the remaining five recommendations and those regarded as already 
implemented. Its views had been presented in detail in the document submitted to the 
Council in September 2010 (A/HRC/15/9/Add.1). Armenia was not able to accept in full 
two recommendations, and rejected another two. Armenia had accepted 81 of 85 
recommendations, or 95 per cent of all recommendations. 
</p>
<p>450. Armenia had accepted recommendation 95.1. It rejected recommendation 95.3, since 
politically motivated prosecution is not exercised in Armenia. Moreover, any case of such 
allegations needs thorough consideration, and no international reliable body, including 
those within the Council of Europe, had registered any such cases in Armenia, despite the 
allegations. 
</p>
<p>451. Armenia regarded recommendation 95.4, on granting licences to radio and television 
broadcasters, as implemented. 
</p>
<p>452. Armenia rejected in part two of the remaining recommendations (95.2 and 95.5) that 
were pending the Government&#8217;s position. No separate definition of discrimination against 
women could be introduced to Armenian legislation, as all manifestations of discrimination 
were prohibited by article 14.1 of the Constitution and the criminal, labour and family 
codes. Current legislation was in full accordance with this requirement; the introduction of 
a separate clause referring to one of the sexes would violate the gender neutrality principle 
of Armenian legislation. With regard to the law on conducting meetings, assemblies, rallies 
and demonstrations, Armenia had experienced significant changes in 2008, which had 
allowed for a more clear and unequivocal regulation of relations. All amendments to the 
law had undergone international expertise to ensure that they were in conformity with 
international standards and those of the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>453. Armenia regarded 16 recommendations as already implemented and had presented a 
detailed account of its position in the addendum. Two other recommendations had also </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>151 
</b></p>
<p>been implemented. Recommendation 94.8 had been successfully implemented, and the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had recently concluded its visit to Armenia, held 
from 6 to 15 September 2010. Recommendation 94.23 on the decriminalization of libel had 
also been implemented when the criminal code was amended on 18 May 2010 by the 
National Assembly. Its full implementation was also guaranteed by the respective changes 
introduced into the civil code of Armenia. 
</p>
<p>454. Armenia was willing to comply with the recommendations, review its policies, carry 
on with its commitments to ensuring political rights, continue reforms to protect human 
dignity and freedom of thought, conscience and religion, enforce economic, social and 
cultural rights and strengthen national human rights institutions. Armenia appreciated the 
assessment of the specific steps that the country had taken to improve the lives of its 
citizens, and of women and children in particular. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>455. Algeria noted Armenia&#8217;s commitment to continue to cooperate closely with United 
Nations human rights bodies and its accession to a large number of human rights treaties. 
Algeria praised again the progress made in the fields of health care and the reduction in the 
infant mortality rate, as well as the efforts aimed at combating poverty and improving the 
living conditions of its people. Algeria welcomed the additional information provided by 
Armenia, as well as its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. 
Algeria noted that Armenia had accepted a large number of recommendations, including 
those made by Algeria. 
</p>
<p>456. Azerbaijan noted that 11 of the recommendations it had made had been accepted by 
Armenia, and underscored that their implementation would have a positive impact on the 
overall human rights situation in the country. Azerbaijan regretted that its recommendation 
on measures to eliminate discrimination against the Yezidis had not been accepted because 
it did not correspond to the current situation. It emphasized that the recommendation 
reflected a 2002 concern expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, which had been included in the compilation prepared by OHCHR in the 
context of the review. 
</p>
<p>457. Egypt welcomed the commitment of Armenia to the universal periodic review 
process, which it demonstrated not only by the acceptance of 81 of 85 recommendations 
during the review session, but also by its willingness to cooperate on the remaining 
recommendations. Egypt appreciated in particular the acceptance by Armenia of the four 
recommendations made by Egypt. Egypt was confident that Armenia would spare no effort 
to continue its work to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Egypt 
also welcomed the establishment in recent years of an office of the human rights defender. 
</p>
<p>458. Cyprus noted with appreciation that Armenia had participated in the universal 
periodic review process in good faith and showed a sincere will to discuss its human rights 
record. This constructive approach demonstrated Armenia&#8217;s willingness to engage in a 
genuine dialogue with respect to its international obligations. Cyprus commended Armenia 
for having accepted the overwhelming majority of the recommendations, including those it 
had made. It also noted with appreciation that Armenia had seriously responded and even 
accepted recommendations from countries with which it does not have diplomatic relations, 
thereby demonstrating its respect for the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>459. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland thanked Armenia for its 
responses to the recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group. It 
welcomed the support for their recommendations, namely the signing and ratification of the 
second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; taking </p>


<p><b>152</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>immediate steps to make domestic violence a criminal offence; and the ratification of the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. While welcoming the commitment of 
Armenia to tackle domestic violence, the United Kingdom encouraged Armenia to address 
the full spectrum of discrimination experienced by women. 
</p>
<p>460. According to Belarus, the universal periodic review made it possible to assess the 
success achieved by the country in implementing economic and social rights and in 
developing its legislation. It welcomed the intention of Armenia to work further to 
implement the recommendations, the great majority of which had been accepted. Belarus 
commended the steps taken by Armenia to implement its treaty body obligations as well as 
the Government&#8217;s policy to ensure religious freedom and the measures to combat 
trafficking, including through the recent adoption of the third national plan of action to 
combat trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>461. The Russian Federation welcomed the constructive approach of Armenia to the 
universal periodic review. Armenia had accepted almost all of the recommendations, most 
of which had been or were being implemented. Implementation would serve to build further 
upon the progress achieved on a broad range of human rights protection issues in Armenia. 
It noted the work done in the preparation of the national report, which attested to Armenia&#8217;s 
serious approach to the universal periodic review, and its intention to work to take concrete 
measures to improve human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>462. Kazakhstan stated that the universal periodic review process had been a good 
opportunity to enhance further Armenia&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights, and 
that Armenia had demonstrated its commitment to cooperate constructively with the review 
mechanism. Kazakhstan noted with appreciation that Armenia had supported 81 of 85 
recommendations made during the Working Group review. Kazakhstan expressed its 
conviction that Armenia would continue its efforts to protect human rights, and encourage 
the Government to pay more attention to the improvement of the rights and living 
conditions of the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>463. Italy took note of the recent developments since the review of Armenia, namely the 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the adoption of 
the 2010&#8211;2012 national plan of action for combating trafficking in human beings for the 
period. Italy looked forward to the adoption of the law ensuring equal rights and equal 
opportunities for men and women, the draft of which was under elaboration. The universal 
periodic review outcome could form the basis of further initiatives for the promotion and 
protection of human rights in Armenia, with a view to establishing new forms of 
cooperation with United Nations agencies and regional organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>464. Verein Sudwind Entwicklungspolitik (Sudwind) commended Armenia for its 
acceptance of the majority of the recommendations made during the interactive dialogue, 
including the recommendations regarding the ratification of several international 
instruments and those on the adoption of a law to ensure equal opportunities for men and 
women, and of the third national plan on combating trafficking. Armenia was, however, a 
country with a traditionally patriarchal society and a high rate of violence against women; 
Sudwind thus urged it to pay more attention to this issue and, in particular, to accelerate the 
process of adopting a national law on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>465. In a joint statement, the European Region of the Lesbian and Gay Association 
(ILGA-Europe) and Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van 
Homoseksualiteit (COC Nederland) urged Armenia to ensure compliance with international 
standards by providing public education and awareness-raising programmes on 
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and organizing </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>153 
</b></p>
<p>sensitivity training for police, judicial and other authorities to promote respect for all 
persons, including on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. They also 
urged it to apply the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human 
Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity as a guide to assist 
policymaking in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>466. With regard to a comment made by a delegation, Armenia recalled that the situation 
did not correspond to the current state of affairs on the ground, and that the report presented 
contained outdated information. The most updated information was available in the reports 
of respective Council of Europe bodies, which stated that there was no discrimination 
against any national minority in Armenia. The reports to be submitted to the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 
the near future, which would contain a chapter on the situation of the rights of minority 
children, would confirm the situation and enhance their efforts in this direction. 
</p>
<p>467. Armenia reaffirmed its commitment to implement all its obligations to improve the 
protection and promotion of human rights in the country. Armenia stood ready to fully 
cooperate with the Council, all United Nations special procedures and all actors in the field, 
at the national or international levels, to achieve prosperity and the full enjoyment of all 
rights by all citizens in the country. 
</p>
<p>468. Armenia stated that recommendations 95.2 and 95.5, which had been partially 
rejected, had been noted. 
</p><p>469. Armenia thanked the President of the Council, the troika Member States, OHCHR 
and the secretariat for all the support extended to Armenia in the process.

<p><b>  Sweden 
</b></p>
<p>470. The review of Sweden was held on 7 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Sweden in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/SWE/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/SWE/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/SWE/3). 
</p><p>471. At its 18th meeting, on 22 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Sweden (see section C below). 
472. The outcome of the review of Sweden comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/11), the views of Sweden concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/11/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>473. The Permanent Representative of Sweden to the United Nations at Geneva, Jan 
Knutsson, stated that the promotion and respect of universal human rights was a core value 
and a central priority for Sweden, and a cornerstone of Sweden&#8217;s foreign policy. Sweden </p>


<p><b>154</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>welcomed the opportunity to engage in its human rights work with interested parties, and 
stated that ensuring respect for its international human rights obligations was an ongoing 
process. 
</p>
<p>474. While preparing for the review, Sweden consulted civil society organizations, 
including those representing indigenous peoples and national minorities. The draft national 
report was posted on the Government&#8217;s human rights website, to ensure the broadest 
possible transparency. After the review, Sweden held a first follow-up meeting with civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>475. Sweden received a large number of recommendations, of which it had accepted the 
great majority. Some of the issues deserving further consideration were addressed in the 
addendum to the Working Group report. 
</p>
<p>476. Several States encouraged Sweden to establish a national human rights institution. 
The Delegation for Human Rights was examining this issue, and its findings would be 
presented to the Government by 30 September 2010. Accordingly, pending the result of the 
inquiry, the Government would not yet take a position on the matter. 
</p>
<p>477. With regard to the recommendations relating to racism and the treatment of 
immigrants and members of minority groups, Sweden was committed to be an open and 
inclusive society. Crimes of a racist, xenophobic or homophobic nature ran counter to 
Swedish fundamental values; since the mid-1990s Sweden had taken a number of steps to 
counter worrying indications of an increase in hate crime, and would continue to do so. 
</p>
<p>478. Sweden did not accept the recommendation calling upon it to ban racist 
organizations. Sweden explained that there was a constitutional ban on censorship, so 
public authorities were not allowed to scrutinize texts or other messages prior to their 
dissemination. Sweden had comprehensive legislation in place to address racism. The penal 
code contained provisions covering contempt or discrimination on the grounds of race, 
colour or national or ethnic origin, namely those relating to agitation against a national or 
ethnic group and unlawful discrimination. The Act on Responsibility for Electronic Bulletin 
Boards also counteracted agitation against a national or ethnic group and could be applied 
to racist propaganda. The penal code provided for aggravated sentencing when the motive 
for an offence was xenophobic or otherwise motivated by hatred. Thus, while an 
organization as such may not be illegal, specific statements of a racist character were 
punishable. 
</p>
<p>479. Sweden accepted the recommendation to pay more attention to the issues of 
Islamophobia, hatred towards Muslims and incitement to hatred against Muslims, while 
emphasizing that the Government was already paying continuous attention to these issues. 
</p>
<p>480. Regarding the recommendation to provide health care to persons residing in Sweden 
without a permit on the same basis as to persons domiciled in the country, asylum-seekers 
under the age of 18 years and children who had gone into hiding were entitled to health and 
medical care on the same conditions as all other children domiciled in Sweden. Nobody 
could be denied emergency care on the grounds of inability to pay. A Government inquiry 
was currently examining the issue of subsidized health care for persons staying in Sweden 
without having applied for the necessary permits, and its final report would be released in 
May 2011. Therefore, the issue raised by this recommendation was under review. 
</p>
<p>481. Regarding recommendations related to the S&#225;mi indigenous people, a central tenet 
of Swedish policy was that the S&#225;mi were to enjoy the very same respect for human rights 
as all other persons. Parliament had recognized the S&#225;mi as Sweden&#8217;s only indigenous 
people, and the Government proposed to Parliament in December 2009 that the 
Constitution be amended to give explicit recognition to the S&#225;mi. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>155 
</b></p>
<p>482. Sweden regarded the universal periodic review as part of its national endeavours to 
ensure systematic human rights work, and that recommendations would be an important 
reference point in its work. It would continue to consult stakeholders in the follow-up to the 
review. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>483. Cuba noted that Sweden had rejected an important number of recommendations, 
without providing explanations with regard to many of them. It noted with concern that 
Sweden had rejected Cuba&#8217;s recommendation to put an end to the denial of the right to 
education of children belonging to minorities or children which did not have a residence 
permit. Cuba noted Sweden&#8217;s response, which it considered incompatible with Sweden&#8217;s 
international obligations regarding the rights of the child. It regretted the fact that Sweden 
had also rejected its recommendation to put an end to the utilization of Swedish territory as 
a transit point for the Central Intelligence Agency&#8217;s flights transporting people whose 
human rights had been violated. Sweden had not yet identified those responsible for these 
acts and had not brought them to justice. Cuba encouraged Sweden to strengthen its efforts 
to combat racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance, especially discrimination 
against Sinti and Roma minorities, and migrants and their families. 
</p>
<p>484. Algeria extended its warm greetings to the delegation of Sweden. It noted as a 
welcome sign the fact that Sweden had adopted 88 recommendations at the level of the 
Working Group, including 2 recommendations made by Algeria. However, referring to 
Algeria&#8217;s recommendation to adhere to the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, a core human rights 
instrument, Algeria noted Sweden&#8217;s comments according to which it had already complied 
with most of the principles set out in the Convention. This was fortunate; Algeria recalled 
that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, of which Sweden was a 
member, had adopted recommendation 1731 of 17 March 2006, in which it recommended 
the ratification of the said Convention. Algeria thus stressed that the adherence of Sweden 
to the Convention would make it possible to address the allegations of exploitation of Asian 
migrants in Sweden. 
</p>
<p>485. Belarus noted that the 147 recommendations made provided an overall picture of the 
rights climate, which convinced Belarus that there was no one country spared from 
shortfalls in the promotion and the protection of human rights. Belarus was grateful for the 
submission of detailed comments on the recommendations it had made, but regretted the 
fact that Sweden declined Belarus&#8217; recommendation relating to the development of a policy 
to strengthen the institution of the family and to develop traditional family values. Belarus 
could not agree with Sweden&#8217;s idea that there was no pressing need to step up the 
significance of the family. Belarus regretted the fact that Sweden declined another 
recommendation made on the adoption of measures to prevent the dissemination of views 
and propaganda based on racial hatred. Belarus did not believe that there was a rational 
balance in the national legislation between the protection of freedom of opinion and the 
prohibition of manifestations of racial hatred, including in the mass media. Belarus called 
upon Sweden to continue to work to develop further its migration policy and to bring its 
national legislation into line with international standards. It noted with regret that Sweden 
had rejected all recommendations relating to the accession to the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>486. The Islamic Republic of Iran appreciated the fact that some of its recommendations 
had been accepted or noted. However, it remained concerned over a number of issues, inter 
alia, Sweden&#8217;s rejection of the recommendation to ratify the International Convention on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the </p>


<p><b>156</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>persistent discrimination against Roma and S&#225;mi and the increasing number of racially 
motivated hate crimes; the implementation of a ban on racist organizations; the specific 
needs of migrant children and their rights to education, health and adequate housing; the 
issue of torture in national legislation; and violence against women and the need to develop 
a national plan of action to combat it. It called upon the Government of Sweden to adopt 
and take effective laws and measures to address the recommendations effectively, including 
those provided by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>487. Thailand commended the active contribution of the Government of Sweden to 
human rights and humanitarian activities at both the domestic and international levels. 
Thailand supported the recommendation that the Government consider the establishment of 
a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It also welcomed 
the recommendations relating to measures dealing with violence against women. Thailand 
encouraged Sweden to strengthen further the protection of human rights of migrant 
workers, especially the rights of women victims of trafficking. Thailand urged Sweden to 
take steps to ensure the implementation of its policies on combating sexual violence and its 
law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services, hoping that these laws would be an 
important tool for preventing the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women and children. 
</p>
<p>488. Indonesia thanked the delegation of Sweden for its updates and detailed information. 
It commended Sweden&#8217;s long-standing tradition of promoting human rights, democracy and 
providing international development assistance to countries in need. It noted that Sweden 
had not yet established a national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles, 
and reiterated its recommendation that it continue to work in this area. While expressing 
support for press freedom and freedom of expression, Indonesia stressed that deliberate 
religious-based provocative acts only perpetuated Islamophobia and intolerance and 
undermined collective efforts to promote peace, mutual respect and understanding between 
different communities. Indonesia hoped that such examples of intolerance would not be 
repeated and that Swedish legislation prohibiting such crimes and hate speech would be 
strengthened. Indonesia also welcomed Sweden&#8217;s initiative to establish bilateral dialogues 
on human rights, including with Indonesia. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>489. The International Save the Children Alliance called on Sweden to prioritize the 
rights of undocumented children by, inter alia, implementing recommendations calling it to 
adopt a legislative framework to ensure that all migrant children have access to the same 
health-care services. It stressed the importance of including both undocumented children 
and adults in the right to health care, since the well-being of a child was linked to that of the 
child&#8217;s parents. It referred to recommendation 95.80, and called on the Government to 
ensure that the principle of the best interest of the child would guide all related processes 
and decisions, especially in asylum-seeking cases involving children. The Alliance called 
upon Sweden to appoint an inquiry charged with framing legislation establishing that child-
specific reasons or specific forms of persecution may serve as grounds for granting refugee 
or other protective status. 
</p>
<p>490. The Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom strongly supported the 
recommendations made by treaty bodies that Sweden should allocate sufficient funding for 
the advancement of women and, in this regard, requested the Government to look at 
disarmament and a decrease in military spending as ways to ensure sufficient funds. The 
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action that called on Governments to reduce 
excessive military expenditure and control the availability of armaments with the purpose 
of increasing the amount of available resources for, inter alia, human security, renewable 
energy and sustainable infrastructure. Selling arms to unstable countries undermined the 
principle of the responsibility to protect and facilitated budget allocations contrary to both </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>157 
</b></p>
<p>the letter and the spirit of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Charter of 
the United Nations and the recommendations of treaty bodies. The League called on 
Sweden to reconsider its trade policies, in particular the sale of arms and equipment, so as 
to comply with its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>491. In a joint statement, the European Region of the Lesbian and Gay Association 
(ILGA-Europe) and Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van 
Homoseksualiteit (COC Nederland) commended Sweden in particular for accepting 
recommendations 95.45, 95.87 and 96.9 relating to the protection of all persons against 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. ILGA-Europe and COC Nederland noted that 
the new Discrimination Act was a positive development, however, they remained 
concerned about the existing sterilization requirement for transgender people in order to 
have their gender changed in their passport. They called upon Sweden to adopt legislation 
in order to change this situation. They also recommended that it extend the promotion of 
equality of rights and opportunities in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity to 
legislation, policies and practices concerning people who seek asylum based on their sexual 
orientation, gender identity or gender expression. 
</p>
<p>492. The Indian Council for South America, also on behalf of the Indigenous Peoples and 
Nations Coalition and the International Council for Human Rights, commended Sweden for 
accepting the recommendations calling for the recognition and implementation of the rights 
of the S&#225;mi people. It recalled the importance of the right to self-determination and stressed 
that it was up to the S&#225;mi people to decide whether or not they would like Sweden to adopt 
the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) or to apply it. It also 
commended States for calling on Sweden to recognize S&#225;mi land and territory rights, but 
added that consent and full consultation by S&#225;mi people was required. It reiterated its 
support for the recommendations relating to granting women high-level positions at 
important levels of decision-making. It called upon Sweden to take the recommendations 
regarding combating discrimination against migrants and other peoples in Sweden 
seriously. 
</p>
<p>493. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims, also on behalf of the 
Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, expressed its deep concern about the 
increase of racially motivated crimes and racist propaganda, as well as about the situation 
of unaccompanied migrant children and the lengthy holding of such children in custodial 
centres. It urged the Government of Sweden to pay more attention to Islamophobia, hatred 
towards Muslims and incitement to hatred against Islam and Muslims, including through 
newspaper articles and caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed published by certain media. It 
also called on Sweden to intensify its efforts to punish and prevent discrimination based on 
ethnic grounds in all areas of life, in particular in cases affecting children and women 
belonging to ethnic minorities, refugees and members of migrant families. 
</p>
<p>494. The World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace reiterated the 
importance of the universal periodic review for the human rights of the S&#225;mi people. It 
highlighted the fact that the S&#225;mi were looking forward to the implementation of the United 
Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the legal clarification regarding 
the consequences of the ratification of ILO Convention No. 169, and the S&#225;mi Convention 
to establish a Nordic framework for freedoms and equality. The S&#225;mi believed that a 
national human rights institution would also be an important development to realize their 
rights. The Association was eager to see the implementation of South Africa&#8217;s 
recommendation on the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights of 
the S&#225;mi and their access to land and cultural life. It attached importance to the respect of 
fair trial guarantees in land cases, as highlighted by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination and the Human Rights Committee. </p>


<p><b>158</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>495. Sweden thanked all those who had participated in the outcome of the review and 
expressed its gratitude for the views conveyed, in particular the interventions by non-State 
stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>496. Sweden regarded the universal periodic review as part of its national endeavours to 
ensure systematic human rights work. It had accepted the great majority of the 
recommendations, which it regarded as an important input for its future work related to 
human rights. The follow-up would be a central part of the mandate of the inter-ministerial 
working group for human rights. 
</p>
<p>497. Sweden referred to other important ongoing human rights initiatives being carried 
out, such as the upcoming report of the Delegation for Human Rights, expected by 30 
September 2010, which would include proposals on how to provide continued support to 
work towards ensuring full respect for human rights. It also mentioned the evaluation of the 
second national human rights plan of action during 2010, which would include an 
assessment of the achievements and results of the plan as well as recommendations for the 
continued systematic work with human rights at the national level. Both initiatives would 
be an important input for a future Government communication to Parliament.  
</p>
<p>498. Sweden pledged to consult closely with civil society and other stakeholders in the 
follow-up to the review, and reiterated its continuous engagement with the Council. 
Sweden intended to maintain its ambitions regarding the implementation of human rights 
issues on a national level; the universal periodic review process would continue to 
constitute a vital part of that work. 
</p>
<p><b>  Grenada 
</b></p>
<p>499. The review of Grenada was held on 10 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Grenada in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GRD/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GRD/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GRD/3). 
</p><p>500. At its 18th meeting, on 22 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Grenada (see section C below). 
501. The outcome of the review of Grenada comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/12), the views of Grenada concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>502. Grenada provided its response to recommendations made during the review in the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p>503. With regard to the recommendations on the abolition of the death penalty and to 
establish a formal moratorium on executions, Grenada could not accept these 
recommendations since the death penalty was still part of the legislation, although there </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>159 
</b></p>
<p>was a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. Furthermore, the death penalty was indeed 
no longer mandatory as enunciated in the Privy Council&#8217;s decision in 2006. While it 
remained in the law, the death penalty has not been applied for decades. 
</p>
<p>504. With regard to the recommendations made to extend an open and standing invitation 
to all special procedures mandate holders, Granada was willing to cooperate with all human 
rights mechanisms. However, in view of the burden associated with an open invitation, and 
bearing in mind its limited resources, it could not do so at this time. Nonetheless, Grenada 
acknowledged the pivotal role the special procedures played in ensuring compliance with 
human rights obligations, and hoped to be able to extend the invitation when its resources 
could meet the burden. 
</p>
<p>505. With regard to recommendations to ratify human rights treaties, and in particular 
core instruments such as the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court and other conventions, Grenada would consider the ratification of necessary 
treaties but could not accept recommendations to ratify all of them. There was an ongoing 
review of all treaties and human right instruments with a view to taking a position on them, 
within the context of local laws, available resources and the country&#8217;s priorities. Indeed, a 
counsel had been appointed to facilitate this process; the Government would welcome any 
assistance to moving the process forward, especially in the area of reporting and fulfilling 
its obligations in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>506. On the recommendations that it harmonize domestic laws to meet its international 
obligations, Grenada would consider the harmonization of its local laws to conform to the 
international obligations within the context of available technical resources. This was part 
of an ongoing law reform process. 
</p>
<p>507. On the issue of the establishment of a human rights institution in line with the Paris 
Principles, Grenada would consider recommendations in this regard. As indicated in its 
national report, there was already a human rights institution in Grenada, and the 
Government intended to strengthen its capacity with a view to achieving its conformity 
with the Paris Principles. Grenada also confirmed the existence of an office of the 
Ombudsman, which the Government intended to strengthen to perform its functions in 
accordance with relevant laws. 
</p>
<p>508. With regard to recommendations to take steps to improve prison conditions, 
overcrowding and the housing of detainees, Grenada would accept such recommendations 
and consider taking further steps to alleviate all overcrowding found in the prisons. The 
Government had been taking all steps necessary to address this issue and, in fact, there was 
an ongoing effort in this regard, as a new prison facility was under construction. 
</p>
<p>509. In relation to recommendations to abolish corporal punishment, Grenada informed 
the Council that it could not accept them, since the use of corporal punishment was 
permitted under the local laws of Grenada in certain cases. However, awareness was being 
raised regarding the issue and in order to encourage its non-application. 
</p>
<p>510. On the adequate protection of children under domestic laws, Grenada accepted the 
recommendations to take further appropriate measures to protect children under its laws. 
Under current laws, children (both boys and girls) were given equal protection, although 
harmonization of necessary legislation was being contemplated. All reported abuses 
relating to children were promptly investigated with the Child Welfare Authority working 
together with the police. </p>


<p><b>160</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>511. With regard to the issue of raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 
accepted levels, Grenada would consider these recommendations and attempt to address 
this issue under the ongoing law reform exercise.  
</p>
<p>512. On domestic violence, Grenada accepted the recommendations to increase its efforts 
to prevent domestic violence and to strengthen actions to assist victims of domestic 
violence. In this regard, the Government attached significant importance to crime 
prevention and security, and would continue to strengthen the police force in the pursuit of 
professional excellence. 
</p>
<p>513. With regard to the adoption of domestic legislation to ensure that human trafficking 
was prohibited under the criminal code and the harmonization of legal provisions on the 
punishment and prevention of human trafficking, Grenada would consider the 
recommendations to harmonize the provision of its domestic laws on the punishment and 
prevention of human trafficking. However, though the offence of human trafficking was not 
criminalized under the criminal code, related offences were. Grenada would continue to 
raise awareness of the crime of human trafficking. The Palermo Protocol had been ratified 
and there are ongoing efforts and discussions to specifically criminalize the offence of 
human trafficking under national laws. 
</p>
<p>514. With regard to the decriminalization of sexual offences between consenting adults of 
the same sex, Grenada could not accept these recommendations as this was an offence 
under domestic legislation. The Government would, however, continue to raise awareness 
of the issue and encourage tolerance. 
</p>
<p>515. With regard to the recommendation to strengthen the original programme aimed at 
achieving universal secondary education, Grenada accepted this recommendation and 
would strive to strengthen its ongoing programme aimed at achieving universal secondary 
education. 
</p>
<p>516. On the issue of continuing the implementation of programmes aimed at achieving a 
national health-care system that responded adequately to the needs of the population and 
made efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS possible, Grenada would accept this 
recommendation and continue to implement programmes providing efficient and holistic 
health-care services, with a view to achieving a national health-care system that served the 
needs of the populace. 
</p>
<p>517. Lastly, with regard to seeking assistance to be able to fulfil its international 
obligations, Grenada would seek necessary support and assistance where it was needed to 
fulfil its international obligations. Grenada welcomed any assistance that would assist the 
discharge of not only its international obligations but also, in terms of general assistance, 
enhance its ability to perform better. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>518. Algeria commended Grenada for its participation in the universal periodic review 
process. During the interactive dialogue, it had noted Grenada&#8217;s commitment to good 
governance, accountability, and the rule of law. It had also noted with appreciation the 
efforts made to prevent crime and to train the police. Algeria requested Grenada to clarify 
how many of the 92 recommendations made were regarded as adopted or rejected. In 
particular, Algeria was interested in knowing what decision had been taken regarding the 
recommendation to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Algeria observed that Grenada was 
one of a number of small resource-deficient developing countries facing many challenges. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>161 
</b></p>
<p>519. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed Grenada&#8217;s 
active participation in the universal periodic review process, and noted that Grenada had 
accepted a number of recommendations. It would have, however, welcomed Grenada&#8217;s 
response to its recommendation to continue to work to ensure that domestic legislation 
conformed with international human rights laws, and where necessary, seek the assistance 
of the international community. Noting the de facto moratorium on the death penalty and 
the agreement to invite special procedures mandate holders, when resources would allow, 
the United Kingdom hoped that Grenada would reconsider its recommendations on those 
two issues before its next review. It valued its close relationship with Grenada and hoped 
that the two countries could continue to maintain an active dialogue on the issues raised in 
the report. 
</p>
<p>520. Morocco thanked Grenada for clarifying its position on the recommendations made 
during the Working Group session, the strong commitment to human rights and its spirit of 
openness and frank dialogue demonstrated during the review. Morocco commended 
Grenada&#8217;s efforts, in particular for vulnerable members of the population, such as women, 
children, the elderly, the disabled and the poor. It welcomed Grenada&#8217;s decision to accept 
almost all of the recommendations made, which reaffirmed the country&#8217;s commitment to 
fulfilling its international obligations. It congratulated Grenada on its efforts to build the 
capacity of the national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
Morocco welcomed the strengthening of cooperation between the two countries and 
expressed strong support for Grenada in its implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>521. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network addressed recommendations 82&#8211;86, which 
called on Grenada to decriminalize same-sex conduct between consenting adults, and noted 
that, during the Working Group review, Grenada had acknowledged that laws prohibiting 
consensual same-sex conduct could be viewed as discriminatory, as they took away the 
freedom of the individual. It also noted the recognition by Grenada that, with time, 
increasing tolerance would help to address this issue. It welcomed the acknowledgment that 
consideration needed to be given to repealing such laws, which had a discriminatory 
impact. It noted that, in 2009, the Human Rights Committee had recommended that 
Grenada repeal those provisions. The Committee had also noted that such laws ran counter 
to the implementation of effective education programmes in respect of HIV/AIDS 
prevention by driving marginalized communities underground. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>522. In response to the additional questions asked regarding the ratification of treaties, 
Grenada stated that the issue was being reviewed and that no position had yet been taken. 
With regard to the question of harmonization of internal law, Grenada reiterated that it was 
considering harmonizing all laws that were not in compliance with its international 
obligations and that it would work to ensure that international obligations were met. 
Regarding the question on how many recommendations had been accepted, Grenada 
explained that most recommendations had been considered positively, with the exception of 
certain issues, such as the death penalty, corporal punishment and standing invitations. 
Grenada thanked the participants for their questions.

<p><b>  Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>523. The review of Turkey was held on 10 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Turkey in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/TUR/1);  </p>


<p><b>162</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/TUR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/TUR/3). 
</p><p>524. At its 18th meeting, on 22 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Turkey (see section C below). 
525. The outcome of the review of Turkey comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/13), the views of Turkey concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/13/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>526. The representative of Turkey stated that the Government regarded the protection and 
promotion of human rights as a political priority. An extensive reform process, including 
constitutional amendments, had been undertaken, while an important anti-terrorist effort 
was ongoing. 
</p>
<p>527. Turkey had adopted universal standards by amending its legislation, accelerated the 
ratification of international conventions and intensified the training of law enforcement 
personnel and other civil servants.  
</p>
<p>528. Article 90 of the Constitution was amended in 2004 to stipulate that, in the event of 
conflict between the provisions of national legislation and international agreements, the 
latter would prevail. 
</p>
<p>529. Capital punishment, which had not been applied since 1984, was abolished in 2004. 
Turkey was party to protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights on the 
abolition of the death penalty, and to protocol 13, which abolished the death penalty even in 
time of war. 
</p>
<p>530. Since 1987, Turkish citizens have the right to individual application to the European 
Court of Human Rights. Its compulsory jurisdiction had been recognized in 1990. 
</p><p>531. Relevant legislation on freedom of expression was being harmonized with the case 
law of the European Court of Human Rights and other international instruments. 
</p>
<p>532. Turkey was determined to fight torture and ill-treatment, and had a zero-tolerance 
policy. 
</p>
<p>533. Turkey had issued a standing invitation to special procedures in 2001 and closely 
collaborated with all international monitoring bodies and mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>534. As a result of the provisions contained in the constitutional amendment package 
adopted by referendum on 12 September 2010, human rights and fundamental freedoms 
had been expanded and the constitutional system brought into line with Turkey&#8217;s 
international obligations. The amendments eliminated several shortcomings referred to in 
the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, and enabled the implementation of 
several recommendations of, inter alia, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human 
Rights, the Venice Commission, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, 
the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>163 
</b></p>
<p>535. Improvements brought about by the recent constitutional reform included: 
</p>
<p>(a) The inclusion of positive discrimination as a constitutional right for persons 
who require social protection, such as women, children, the elderly and the disabled; 
</p>
<p>(b) Constitutional guarantees for the protection of personal data; 
(c) Constitutional guarantees for the right of children to enjoy adequate 
</p>
<p>protection and care and to establish and maintain a personal and direct relationship with 
their parents, safeguarding the principle of the best interest of the child; 
</p>
<p>(d) A broadening of the scope and extent of freedom of organization, especially 
union rights; 
</p>
<p>(e) The definition of the right of petition as a constitutional right; 
(f) The overcoming of the problem of unconstitutionality preventing the 
</p>
<p>establishment of an office of the ombudsman; 
</p>
<p>(g) The fact that the dissolution of political parties would not result in the 
automatic banning of parliamentarian members of the dissolved party; 
</p>
<p>(h) Judicial review of the decisions of the Supreme Military Council; 
(i) Judicial review of all disciplinary decisions against civil servants and other 
</p>
<p>public officials, without exception;  
</p>
<p>(j) Introduction of the right to individual application to the Constitutional Court 
regarding fundamental rights and freedoms; 
</p>
<p>(k) Improvement of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Council of Judges 
and Public Prosecutors, to ensure a more effective functioning of the judiciary, and the 
strengthening of its independence;  
</p>
<p>(l) A constitutional guarantee to prevent civilians from being tried by military 
courts. 
</p>
<p>536. The Anti-Terror Law was amended in July 2010 to ensure that all child suspects, 
without distinction of age, would be tried under the same regime in the relevant juvenile 
courts. 
</p>
<p>537. At the adoption of its Working Group report on 12 May 2010, Turkey accepted 95 
of the 152 recommendations made during the review. At the Council session, Turkey 
announced that 25 of the 39 pending recommendations had been accepted, partly accepted 
or already implemented. A detailed assessment of these recommendations was provided in 
the addendum to the report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>538. Yemen noted that Turkey had an important role to play in the political and social life 
in the region and internationally, and was a model to be followed in the field of democracy 
and respect for human rights. Yemen referred to Turkey&#8217;s recent referendum and 
acceptance of 85 per cent of recommendations submitted to it as testimony to the serious 
attitude shown by the Government and people of Turkey to democracy. 
</p>
<p>539. Algeria congratulated Turkey on the recent constitutional amendments adopted by 
referendum, which would strengthen democracy. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to human rights, illustrated by the tangible progress in the economic, social 
and cultural rights of large segments of the population. With regard to the Mavi Marmara 
humanitarian flotilla for Gaza, Algeria noted that it represented a clear gesture of solidarity </p>


<p><b>164</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>towards the Palestinian people, and reiterated its empathy to and support for Turkey. It 
acknowledged Turkey&#8217;s acceptance of the four recommendations made by Algeria. 
</p>
<p>540. Armenia, while appreciating Turkey&#8217;s acceptance of several of its recommendations, 
drew attention to issues of minority rights and further steps needed to address them. 
Armenia referred to, inter alia, limitations on the exercise of religious practices for 
respective minority groups; recent attacks by the general public against Roma, Kurds and 
non-Muslim minorities; xenophobic and racist remarks, particularly towards Armenians, by 
representatives in high authority; and the use of article 301 of the penal code to stigmatize 
dissenting voices. Armenia also regretted the rejection of its recommendation on creating 
conditions for the realization of the right to truth, without which it would be immensely 
difficult to heal historic wounds. 
</p>
<p>541. Azerbaijan commended Turkey&#8217;s open and transparent approach during its review, 
testimony to its commitment to cooperate with the international human rights machinery. It 
had made two recommendations on women&#8217;s rights and intercultural and inter-religious 
dialogue, which had been accepted. It welcomed the comprehensive human rights reform 
undertaken, including the constitutional amendments, and noted with concern that terrorism 
continued to cause problems and reiterated its support in the struggle against it.  
</p>
<p>542. Qatar noted Turkey&#8217;s acceptance of many recommendations, its serious approach, 
positive attitude and its cooperation with various human rights mechanisms. Qatar 
welcomed Turkey&#8217;s human rights achievements. Reference was made to the development 
of a legal framework for human rights protection, the fight against discrimination in all its 
forms and the promotion of the role of women. Qatar commended Turkey for its key 
international role in peace in the region.  
</p>
<p>543. Egypt acknowledged Turkey&#8217;s detailed replies to each recommendation, which was 
indicative of the serious approach adopted by Turkey towards the universal periodic review 
process. It appreciated the recent developments in relation to the provision for positive 
discrimination for certain vulnerable groups. It commended efforts aimed at protecting the 
rights of women and children, and combating trafficking in persons and violence against 
women. Egypt welcomed Turkey&#8217;s determination and willingness to continue its efforts to 
protect human rights while it exercised its sovereign right to enact and implement laws and 
policies in line with its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>544. Cyprus expressed its regret that the human rights recommendations it had made 
during the review of Turkey were openly rejected on purely subjective, political grounds 
and about the apparent failure in the collective responsibility to uphold the credibility and 
integrity of the peer review mechanism. It stressed that international obligations, especially 
those concerning human rights, could in no case be waived simply on the grounds of 
political positions. Cyprus referred to the letter it had addressed to the President of the 
Council (A/HRC/15/G/2) regarding the statements made by Turkey during Cyprus&#8217; review, 
and added that the Council should not allow the universal periodic review mechanism to be 
used for the dissemination of political allegations. 
</p>
<p>545. Bahrain acknowledged that Turkey had adopted a set of measures reflecting the 
extent to which the country was committed to promote human rights and work with the 
United Nations system. It welcomed Turkey&#8217;s acceptance of an important number of 
recommendations, including that put forward by Bahrain. It also noted Turkey&#8217;s reform of 
its legal framework, particularly in the field of human rights, in order to be in line with 
international standards. 
</p>
<p>546. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) highlighted Turkey&#8217;s constitutional reform and 
other efforts to adjust its legal framework to strengthen the promotion and protection of 
human rights, particularly in favour of vulnerable groups. It welcomed the establishment of 
the institution of the ombudsman. It recognized the progress achieved in education, which </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>165 
</b></p>
<p>guaranteed universal access and fought school dropout rates through social subsidies. It 
encouraged Turkey to continue these successful policies. 
</p>
<p>547. Pakistan was pleased to note Turkey&#8217;s acceptance of most recommendations and the 
process for establishing a national human rights institution in full compliance with the Paris 
Principles. Pakistan commended Turkey&#8217;s ongoing human rights reforms, especially its 
anti-discrimination laws, to promote tolerance and inclusiveness, as well as its efforts to 
combat trafficking in human beings. Pakistan valued Turkey&#8217;s international efforts to 
support interfaith dialogue and its readiness to continue to make them. 
</p>
<p>548. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the result of 
the recent referendum on constitutional reform and encouraged its prompt implementation 
and that of other reforms. It noted the improvements made in equality and non-
discrimination legislation, and the efforts to address torture and the disproportionate use of 
force by the police. Turkey&#8217;s acceptance of a large number of important recommendations 
was welcomed, including ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and the development of a national preventive mechanism. It encouraged Turkey to 
consider the positive realization of the right to freedom of expression by abolishing or 
revising articles 301 and 318 of the penal code. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>549. Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l&#8217;amiti&#233; entre les peuples and the International 
Educational Development and International Alliance of Women, in a joint statement, 
regretted Turkey&#8217;s persistent failure to recognize ethnic and other minorities, and the 
restrictions imposed on freedom of expression under the Anti-terrorism Act. They 
encouraged Turkey to continue and strengthen its efforts in the field of human rights, 
including to protect women and girls against violence and discrimination, to reduce 
impunity and to ensure the independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>550. Amnesty International urged Turkey to issue guidance to the courts for 
implementing amendments to anti-terrorism legislation, end the prosecution of children in 
the adult criminal justice system, and investigate all allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
of children. It called for progress in its commitments to establish a national human rights 
board, an independent police complaints commission, an equality and non-discrimination 
commission and a national human rights institution. It called on Turkey to commit to 
continue legal reforms necessary to guarantee respect for freedom of expression, including 
the repeal of articles 301 and 318 of the penal code. 
</p>
<p>551. The Islamic Human Rights Commission welcomed the changes made in the past 
eight years in Turkey, in particular in the domain of combating torture and the treatment of 
minorities. However, the treatment of Muslim women wearing a headscarf remained 
unchanged, despite the fact that 70 per cent of Muslim women in Turkey wore one. It 
mentioned a recent decision by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women in this regard, and urged Turkey to abolish the headscarf ban and provide these 
women with the same rights that other Turkish citizens enjoyed. 
</p><p>552. Sudwind Entwicklungspolitik expressed concern about Turkey&#8217;s unwillingness to 
withdraw its reservation to article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights on minority rights and articles 301 and 318 of the penal code legitimizing the 
harassment and persecution of human rights defenders. Missing and killed people were not 
accounted for. It urged Turkey to devote more attention to regular and participatory 
political processes to solve conflicts peacefully and end aggression against the Kurds. It 
referred to the refugee situation, and in particular, to the financial and other difficulties 
facing asylum-seekers from non-European countries. </p>


<p><b>166</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>553. In a joint statement, ILGA-Europe and COC Nederland urged Turkey to reconsider 
its position on recommendation 102.10 regarding the non-discrimination of women and 
persons of minority ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity. They recommended 
that Turkey explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds for non-
discrimination in the draft law on non-discrimination and the development of an equality 
board. It drew attention to the ongoing hate crimes that targeted transgender people, adding 
that they remained unpunished or uninvestigated. 
</p>
<p>554. Conscience and Peace Tax International raised concerns about freedom of opinion 
and expression in the light of Turkey&#8217;s rejection of recommendations for specific changes 
to articles 301 and 318 of the penal code and the anti-terror law. It referred to activists 
sentenced to imprisonment, under article 318, for demonstrating in support of conscientious 
objectors. It urged Turkey to adopt legislation that provided for conscientious objectors to 
opt for alternative civilian service. 
</p>
<p>555. The Syriac Universal Alliance invited Turkey to open constructive dialogue on 
critical issues that need to be addressed by Turkey and the international community. While 
welcoming Turkey&#8217;s cooperation and replies regarding minority rights, it stressed that 
much work still needed to be done; for instance, group rights were often circumvented or 
misrepresented. Turkey continued to deny the official existence of the Arameans, unlike 
other minorities. The Alliance regretted that the concept of minorities had not been updated 
and aligned with international standards during the recent constitutional reform. 
</p>
<p>556. The European Centre for Law and Justice pointed to concerns raised about the 
discrimination and public hostility suffered by religious minorities. It was the climate of 
hostility maintained by the media that had led to an upsurge in murder of priests. The 
promotion of tolerance and dialogue among civilizations should not only be a product for 
export, but also promoted in Turkish society. 
</p>
<p>557. Human Rights Watch welcomed the constitutional reform. It urged the Government 
to proceed with its long-promised full revision of the Constitution, to remove restrictions on 
freedom of expression and the rights of minority groups, and other limits to fundamental 
rights. It urged Turkey to sign and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to lift the geographical limitation to the 1951 
Refugee Convention. It was concerned that the law to establish a national human rights 
institution was not in line with the Paris Principles, and called on Turkey to reopen 
investigation into the negligence and possible collusion of State officials in the killing of 
journalist and editor Harat Dink. It urged Turkey to implement the law on the protection of 
the family. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>558. The representative of Turkey thanked Council member and observer States and all 
stakeholders. He assured that all comments had been duly noted and that Turkey had the 
political will to overcome all difficulties. 
</p>
<p>559. With regard to criticism on religious freedom, Turkey felt that some of the 
information provided by non-governmental organizations was not up to date.  
</p>
<p>560. On torture and ill-treatment, the Government was adamant in its zero-tolerance 
policy, without exception. The Government did not condone such violations and was doing 
its best to eradicate totally these practices, despite possible remaining marginal cases. The 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture was currently before Parliament, in the 
final stage of adoption, and there was no doubt that it would be ratified. National preventive 
mechanisms were being set up, though it was not possible to say when they would be 
operative. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>167 
</b></p>
<p>561. The representative of Turkey stated that he was part of a group responsible for the 
dialogue with non-Muslim minorities and that, despite what some speakers asserted, there 
was no judgement of the European Court on Human Rights against Turkey on the 
discrimination of religious minorities. Such an assertion was thus a misrepresentation of the 
reality. 
</p>
<p>562. Domestic violence was not tolerated. The establishment of an anti-discrimination 
and equality board and other control mechanisms were priorities in the Government&#8217;s 
programme. Turkey had noted the comments made on freedom of expression. The recent 
amendments to the law required the authorization of the Ministry of Justice for prosecutors 
to pursue prosecutions further. In recent times, the Ministry of Justice had denied 97 such 
authorizations for court action. With regard to the case of Harat Dink, the Government 
would implement the judgement of the European Court on Human Rights and take 
measures to prevent similar violations in the future. 
</p>
<p>563. Turkey had spared no effort to ensure that the universal periodic review was 
conducted in, inter alia, a non-selective, non-confrontational and constructive manner, and 
would continue to do so. The implementation of accepted recommendations should be a 
priority for all States under review. The interactive dialogue and the adoption of the 
Working Group report had provided a useful overview. Turkey reiterated its commitment to 
provide a midterm report within two years. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guyana 
</b></p>
<p>564. The review of Guyana was held on 11 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Guyana in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GUY/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GUY/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GUY/3). 
</p><p>565. At its 19th meeting, on 23 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Guyana (see section C below). 
566. The outcome of the review of Guyana comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/14), the views of Guyana concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/14/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>567. Guyana was pleased to be present and to participate in the adoption of the report on 
its universal periodic review. The delegation recalled that, during the Working Group 
session in May 2010, 112 recommendations were made, 57 of which enjoyed the support of 
Guyana. Of the 57 recommendations, 14 recommendations had already been implemented, 
40 recommendations were at various stages of implementation and 2 were pending 
implementation. During the Working Group session, Guyana pledged to examine 55 
recommendations and to provide its responses to them. </p>


<p><b>168</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>568. With regard to recommendations 70.1 to 70.13, on international human rights 
instruments, Guyana supported recommendations 70.1, 70.3 and 70.12; partially supported 
recommendations 70.4 and 70.6; noted recommendation 70.9 and voluntarily committed to 
consult and report to the Council in two years on the abolition of the death penalty; noted 
recommendations 70.10, 70.11 and 70.12; and voluntarily committed to consult and report 
in one year&#8217;s time in relation to ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>569. With regard to recommendation 70.1, since its review in May 2010, Guyana had 
acceded to the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and 
ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>570. With regard to recommendation 70.14 on the adoption of national refugee 
legislation, owing to limited resources, Guyana did not consider such legislation a priority 
at this time, and indeed did not consider it an issue. Guyana therefore noted 
recommendation 70.14. 
</p>
<p>571. With regard to recommendations 70.15 to 70.18 on extending a standing invitation 
to special procedures, Guyana had noted these recommendations and reiterated its readiness 
to continue to respond to invitations and to offer full collaboration with mandate holders. 
Guyana had made efforts in the past two years to improve its responsiveness to the many 
requests for information made by the mandate holders, and remained committed to submit 
its outstanding State party reports before the end of 2010. 
</p>
<p>572. With regard to recommendation 70.19 on the invitation to the Special Rapporteur on 
torture, Guyana had noted the recommendation and volunteered to consider it further and to 
report to the Council. 
</p>
<p>573. Guyana supported recommendations 70.20, 70.21 and 70.22. With regard to 
recommendations 70.21 and 70.22, the delegation emphasized the appointment of the four 
constitutional human rights commissions (ethnic relations, women and gender equality, the 
rights of the child, and indigenous peoples) with offices and budgetary allocations provided 
for advocacy as change agents, as well as complaints mechanisms with investigative and 
redress mandates. The prohibition of all forms of discrimination in the revised 2003 
Constitution and a bevy of statutory instruments allowed for complaints, redress and 
rectification. Guyana emphasized the State neither condoned nor allowed discrimination of 
any form. 
</p>
<p>574. With regard to recommendations 70.23 to 70.35, all of which related to the abolition 
of the death penalty, public opinion in Guyana strongly favoured the retention of the death 
penalty. Guyana noted these recommendations and voluntarily committed to continue to 
consider and consult on the abolition of the death penalty and to report to the Council in 
two years. With this in mind, Guyana had tabled an amendment to the Criminal Law 
(Offences) Act, which provided for varied sentences for different categories of murder, 
including life imprisonment and lesser sentences of imprisonment, as well as access to 
parole. The bill would be debated in the National Assembly in October 2010. 
</p>
<p>575. With regard to recommendations 70.36 to 70.41 on the abolition of corporal 
punishment, public opinion in Guyana was not in favour of the abolition of corporal 
punishment. Guyana had noted the recommendations and was voluntarily committed to 
consult and report on the results of the consultative process. In this regard, consultations in 
Guyana were ongoing on a draft education bill, which included discussion on the issue of 
corporal punishment. Furthermore, Guyana had tabled amendments to the Training School 
Act and the Juvenile Offenders Act to remove corporal punishment from juvenile detention 
centres, which demonstrated Guyana&#8217;s commitment to protect children from all forms of 
abuse. The bills would be debated in October 2010 in the National Assembly. The 
Protection of Children Act 2009, the Domestic Violence Act 1997 and the Child Care </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>169 
</b></p>
<p>Protection Agency offered a legislative and administrative framework to protect children 
from abuse. 
</p>
<p>576. Guyana supported recommendation 70.42 and referred to constitutional provisions 
that specified that a person could only be detained for a maximum of 72 hours before being 
charged, or three months in the case of an accused to be brought before the courts. Guyana 
also supported recommendation 70.43 on increasing the age of criminality, and volunteered 
to report the outcomes of the ongoing consultations in relation to the new draft juvenile 
justice bill. 
</p><p>577. Recommendations 70.44 and 70.45 had been noted and not accepted by Guyana. 
The reasons for not accepting the recommendations had been elaborated in the addendum to 
the Working Group report. Guyana supported the first part of recommendation 70.46, and 
had noted the second part. In this regard, the delegation reiterated Guyana&#8217;s commitment 
made before the Working Group to continue to investigate, on the basis of available 
information and witnesses, all those responsible for the wave of criminal violence in the 
period 2002&#8211;2008 to decide whether they were part of the violent criminal gangs or of 
phantom death squads. 
</p>
<p>578. With regard to recommendations 70.47 to 70.53 on decriminalizing consensual 
same-sex relations and discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
persons, Guyana had attempted to include &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; in the anti-discrimination 
clause in the revised Constitution, but the proposal was defeated in 2003. While Guyana did 
not discriminate against persons based on their sexual orientation, it did not deny that 
interpersonal prejudices, based on cultural and religious beliefs, existed. Guyana had noted 
these recommendations and voluntarily committed to hold consultations over the next two 
years and to reflect the outcome of this democratic process in its domestic laws. 
Recommendations 70.54 and 70.55 had also been noted. 
</p>
<p>579. Guyana reaffirmed its commitment to holding consultations with civil society, the 
four human rights commissions, various levels of Government and State agencies and the 
National Assembly on the follow-up to the universal periodic review process. It also 
reported its initiatives to strengthen the Government/non-governmental organization 
partnership to reduce and prevent domestic and sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>580. With regard to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the involvement of children in armed conflict, to which Guyana had already acceded, the 
delegation assured the Council that 14-year-olds had not been recruited into the Guyana 
Defence Force for more than 30 years. However, in order to comply with the Protocol, 
Guyana would remove the relevant clause in the Defence Act providing for the recruitment 
of 14-year-olds before the end of 2010. 
</p>
<p>581. The Low-Carbon Development Strategy and its second Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Programme (2008&#8211;2012) formed the basis of Guyana&#8217;s agenda for development. Guyana 
was proud of its socio-economic achievements and its budgetary commitment to poverty 
reduction, although it recognized that there was still much more to be overcome. Guyana 
remained committed to achieving equitable access to the delivery of goods and services, 
especially for its poor, vulnerable and &#8220;differently-abled&#8221; citizens, within available 
resources. 
</p>
<p>582. Guyana, a developing country and a newly emerging democracy facing many 
challenges, was proud of its constitutional and parliamentary reforms and its model of 
shared governance. However, these reforms and the model of shared governance had only 
been introduced seven years earlier. Guyana remained irrevocably committed to democracy 
and the protection of human rights, the rule of law and good governance for its people. </p>

outcome 
</b></p>
<p>583. Cuba noted that the efforts made by Guyana to guarantee basic rights, such as 
education, health, food, housing, water and social security, had been recognized during the 
review. It highlighted the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity of Guyana, which was 
protected by the Constitution. Guyana had accepted several recommendations and another 
large group of recommendations had either already been implemented or was in the process 
of being implemented. This reflected the resolve of the Government to make progress in the 
protection of human rights. Cuba noted, in particular, the priority attached to ensuring the 
right to food and the measures taken to reduce hunger and promote food security. It 
encouraged Guyana to continue its efforts to protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>584. Algeria expressed its appreciation for the measures taken since the presentation of 
the national report. Guyana was an emerging democracy and a developing nation that faced 
a myriad of challenges. Algeria considered of particular value the efforts made by Guyana 
to promote food security and alleviate the impact of the economic crisis. It also welcomed 
Guyana&#8217;s readiness to continue its efforts to address the issue of violence against girls, as it 
had recommended. Algeria expressed satisfaction at the fact that Guyana was in the process 
of implementing recommendations that Algeria had made in relation to reducing poverty 
and promoting access to food, as well as to intensifying programmes aimed at mitigating 
the negative impact of climate change on food security and the environment. 
</p>
<p>585. Morocco stated that Guyana had demonstrated its firm commitment to the social, 
economic and cultural development of its people during its review. It welcomed the 
institutional and legislative measures taken by Guyana, which were aimed at the gradual 
improvement of the structure for the promotion and protection of human rights, as well as 
the projects that had been undertaken, such as the establishment of an independent national 
human rights institution and the review of several human rights instruments with a view to 
their ratification. Morocco highlighted a number of innovative initiatives taken by Guyana, 
including its strategy to reduce carbon emissions, the national strategy for the progressive 
eradication of poverty and its training programmes in human rights for law enforcement 
authorities and personnel. 
</p>
<p>586. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland thanked Guyana for 
expressing its position clearly on outstanding recommendations. It was interested in 
learning of Guyana&#8217;s position on the recommendations that had been noted and subject to 
further consideration. It was grateful to Guyana for having accepted some of the 
recommendations made during the review, in particular those on the abolition of the death 
penalty and the establishment of an independent inquiry into abuses allegedly committed by 
a phantom death squad that had not received the support of Guyana, and stated that these 
recommendations continued to raise important issues that required attention. It thanked 
Guyana for the impressive level of information presented and for its ongoing engagement 
with the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>587. China noted with appreciation that Guyana had given great importance to the 
outcome of the universal periodic review, which was demonstrated in its acceptance of 
most of the recommendations made and its preparation for the follow-up. China expressed 
its gratitude for Guyana&#8217;s efforts to develop the national economy with dedication to the 
realization of the Millennium Development Goals and the implementation of its poverty 
reduction programme. In this regard, Guyana had adopted a series of laws and regulations 
to promote human rights, singling out as a priority relations with the Amerindian 
communities. As a developing country, Guyana faced special challenges. China called on 
the international community to continue to provide support to Guyana. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>171 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>588. Amnesty International regretted the fact that Guyana had not committed to 
establishing an independent inquiry into abuses allegedly committed by death squads. It 
expressed its disappointment that Guyana had rejected recommendations to establish a 
moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. Nevertheless, it 
welcomed Guyana&#8217;s commitment to continue the consideration of this issue over the next 
two years and to report on its findings to the Council. Amnesty International urged Guyana 
to remove legislation that discriminated against individuals on the basis of their sexual 
orientation and to repeal laws that criminalized sexual activity between consenting adults of 
the same sex. It welcomed Guyana&#8217;s commitment to hold consultations on the issue of 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>589. Action Canada for Population and Development on behalf of the Society against 
Sexual Orientation Discrimination, welcomed Guyana&#8217;s commitment to hold consultations 
on issues affecting LGBT people over the next two years, and expressed its willingness to 
work with the Government. The attempt in 2003 to include &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; in 
Guyana&#8217;s Constitution as a basis for discrimination had not been genuine, as the issue had 
been presented in a separate bill to the National Assembly and the Government had 
indicated its intention not to support it. Action Canada added that it would be erroneous to 
say that no State-sanctioned discrimination, based on sexual orientation, existed in Guyana, 
and noted that several provisions of the criminal code criminalized sexual intimacy between 
consenting adult men in private. It called on Guyana to repeal those provisions. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>590. The delegation thanked Cuba, Algeria, Morocco, the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and China for their supportive comments. It also expressed its 
gratitude to Cuba and China for their assistance. With regard to its human rights 
commissions, the delegation explained the democratic process of nominations and 
appointments, which was in accordance with its shared governance, and emphasized that 
nominees were determined by civil society. 
</p>
<p>591. In relation to the statement made by the United Kingdom, the delegation expressed 
Guyana&#8217;s assurance that all efforts were being made to improve and modernize the police 
force and the security sector. Guyana would continue to consult and, on the basis of a 
democratic process, would make changes as determined by the general public. 
</p>
<p>592. In relation to the statement by Amnesty International, the amendment to the 
Criminal Law (Offences) Act would be debated before Parliament in October 2010. The 
amendment allowed for varied sentencing for different categories of murder, in addition to 
the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>593. In relation to the statement by the Society against Sexual Orientation 
Discrimination, the delegation stated that this non-governmental organization appeared to 
have been misinformed about the constitutional process that had taken place in relation to 
the attempt to include sexual orientation in the Constitution. The human rights task force of 
the Constitutional Reform Commission, comprising parliamentary parties and civil society, 
had recommended the inclusion of the phrase &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; in the new anti-
discrimination clause in the Constitution. It was supported by the National Assembly in 
</p><p>2001. However, religious groups then exerted pressure on the Government and the 
opposition, and demanded that the bill be sent back for review. This was done in 2003, after 
a two-year delay. At that stage, the anti-discrimination clause included &#8220;sexual-orientation&#8221;. 
On the day in question, there was a vote of conscience on both sides and the phrase &#8220;sexual 
orientation&#8221; did not win the support of Parliament. The delegation invited the organization 
to verify this account by consulting parliamentary records. </p>


<p><b>172</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>594. The delegation stated that there was no discrimination of LGBT persons in the State 
sector. It emphasized that profound culture and religious beliefs, particularly those of the 
Christian evangelical movement, had strengthened the position against the LGBT issue. 
The willingness of the Government to discuss this issue openly was a clear indication of its 
intention to establish a comfort zone with the people of Guyana. The Government was 
willing to work with civil society on the issue, and emphasized that the final outcome 
would reflect the democratic will of the people. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kuwait 
</b></p>
<p>595. The review of Kuwait was held on 14 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Kuwait in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/KWT/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KWT/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KWT/3). 
</p><p>596. At its 19th meeting, on 23 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Kuwait (see section C below). 
597. The outcome of the review of Kuwait comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/15), the views of Kuwait concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/15/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>598. Kuwait welcomed the very important recommendations made at the Working Group 
session. During the interactive dialogue, Kuwait had shared the measures it had taken to 
promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, without any politicization or 
selectivity. Kuwait had shown that the protection of human rights was reflected in its 
Constitution, including its article 29 relating to equality of rights and duties. 
</p>
<p>599. The delegation had also provided information on the efforts made by the State to 
ensure human dignity for all of those living in Kuwait. Human rights had always been a 
fundamental element in the development of all public policies in the fields of education, 
health, the environment, the rights of workers, foreign workers, the independence of 
women, the rights of children, the elderly and those with special needs. 
</p>
<p>600. Kuwait had approved 114 of the 159 recommendations made during the review in 
the Working Group, a large number of which were already being implemented. Kuwait had 
reviewed a number of other recommendations prior to the fifteenth session of the Council. 
Its response was contained in the addendum to the Working Group report. A number of 
those recommendations were not supported, as they ran counter to the provisions of the 
Constitution, Islamic sharia and other laws, or contained inaccurate or incorrect 
information. Kuwait had approved a further nine recommendations. A total of 123 
recommendations had been approved by Kuwait. The fact that Kuwait had not 
acknowledged certain recommendations did not mean that Kuwait would not apply some of 
them following amendments to some national laws. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>173 
</b></p>
<p>601. Illegal residency was one of the main difficulties and challenges that Kuwait was 
striving to face. State bodies were trying to determine the nationality of these residents, but 
a large number of them hid their identity documents because they feared being deprived of 
benefits. Kuwait had endeavoured to facilitate the lives of these workers in Kuwait by 
providing them with all necessary benefits, particularly in the fields of education and 
health. Despite the difficulties encountered, Kuwait was reviewing very seriously the ways 
to solve these problems in line with the Constitution and national laws. 
</p>
<p>602. Kuwait had noted the recommendation on the Rome Statute, although it had already 
signed it. 
</p>
<p>603. Kuwait had noted some recommendations on domestic workers, and approved the 
recommendation pertaining to the fifth paragraph of the new labour law, which required the 
minister to adopt the necessary decrees for this particular group of workers. The decrees 
came into force with the adoption of ministerial decree 1182 of 2010. Article 8 of the 
decree stipulated the rights and benefits of domestic workers, including salary, maximum 
working hours, leave and living conditions. 
</p>
<p>604. Kuwait has made all the necessary efforts to promote the role of women in society 
and approved the recommendation pertaining to equal opportunities, including for 
diplomatic posts. Kuwait had established a national workplan to ensure gender equality, in 
accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against women. Kuwait was making further efforts to enhance the role of 
women in the judiciary, and had noted this recommendation.  
605. Kuwait had also approved the recommendations to extend a standing invitation to 
the special procedures to abrogate <i>Kafalah</i> law and to set up a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. The establishment of such an institution 
had the support of all at the very highest level. Kuwait reassured the Council that it would 
implement all accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>606. Qatar noted that Kuwait had accepted the three recommendations it had made on an 
independent national human rights institution; sharing information about the experience of 
Bait al-Zakat in the humanitarian field; and juvenile justice. Qatar felt that the acceptance 
of so many recommendations by Kuwait, and its open and cooperative spirit during the 
interactive dialogue, demonstrated the sincerity of Kuwait in its interaction with the 
universal periodic review process and other human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>607. Algeria welcomed the efforts made by Kuwait to raise living standards, which had 
resulted in a high standard of development, as also reflected in its human rights situation. 
Algeria expressed appreciation that Kuwait had accepted the four recommendations that it 
had made, and encouraged Kuwait to continue to strengthen and consolidate its 
achievements in the area of human rights. Algeria drew attention to the role played by 
Kuwait at the international level, in particular the development assistance that Kuwait 
provided to other countries. 
</p>
<p>608. Saudi Arabia noted the positive interaction by Kuwait with all human rights 
mechanisms and its readiness to cooperate and engage in dialogue on human rights, as 
demonstrated by the acceptance of most recommendations. The review of the human rights 
situation in Kuwait had been a useful opportunity to learn about the efforts made by Kuwait 
to develop its legislation and institutions with a view to promoting and protecting human 
rights. Saudi Arabia appreciated these efforts and encouraged Kuwait to continue them. </p>


<p><b>174</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>609. Yemen noted that Kuwait was a pioneer in the region and an example to be followed 
with regard to democracy and respect for human rights. The success of the parliamentary 
elections, which had resulted in a vibrant parliament in which women also participated, was 
a vital sign of the degree of democracy achieved in Kuwait. Yemen also noted that the 
acceptance of a large number of recommendations during the review showed the sincerity 
of the Government of Kuwait in the promotion of human rights principles. 
</p>
<p>610. The Syrian Arab Republic appreciated the seriousness demonstrated by Kuwait in 
the universal periodic review process, referring also to the acceptance by Kuwait of most 
recommendations. It understood the rejection of recommendations not in line with the 
cultural or religious values of Kuwait, or were outside the scope of internationally 
recognized norms. Kuwait had a long-standing record of working to promote and protect 
human rights, without losing sight of its cultural and religious heritage.  
</p>
<p>611. Bahrain expressed appreciation for the positive steps that Kuwait had taken in 
accepting and implementing a number of recommendations made during the review, 
including recommendations made by Bahrain on the rights of persons with disabilities, the 
strengthening of health indicators and providing health services to all sectors of society. 
Bahrain welcomed Kuwait&#8217;s provision of health services to all, especially children and 
elderly persons, and of free education to the university level, in addition to education for 
persons with disabilities and their integration into society. 
</p>
<p>612. Jordan welcomed the positive steps that Kuwait had taken, including with regard to 
the continuing development and amendment of legislation relevant to the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In particular, Jordan appreciated the 
measures taken to strengthen the role of women in society. Kuwait&#8217;s interaction with the 
Working Group had demonstrated the importance it attached to the cooperation with the 
United Nations and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>613. Azerbaijan congratulated Kuwait on having accepted the recommendation to extend 
a standing invitation to all special procedures, particularly its favourable response to the 
request for a visit by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women 
and children. Kuwait had accepted Azerbaijan&#8217;s recommendations relating to the 
establishment of a national human rights institution and a plan of action for the promotion 
of gender equality. 
</p>
<p>614. Egypt noted the efforts made at the national level for the promotion and protection 
of human rights, and Kuwait&#8217;s cooperation with the universal periodic review and other 
human rights mechanisms. Egypt welcomed Kuwait&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations to 
create a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles, and to 
prepare a national plan to promote gender equality. Egypt appreciated Kuwait&#8217;s efforts to 
combat trafficking and to protect the rights of children, as well as the aid that Kuwait 
provided at the international level in response to natural catastrophes and for development 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>615. Morocco welcomed the cooperative spirit demonstrated by Kuwait in accepting 
many recommendations, including those made by Morocco on the environment, human 
trafficking, dialogue between religions and civilizations, education and training on human 
rights. Morocco reiterated its appreciation for the humane approach taken by Kuwait in its 
immigration policy. Morocco noted that the Kuwaiti experience was characterized by a 
good balance between the requirements of democracy and modernity and adherence to 
Kuwait&#8217;s cultural and religious values. Morocco expressed appreciation for the programmes 
designed to protect the most vulnerable sectors of society. 
</p>
<p>616. Tunisia expressed its appreciation for the efforts made by Kuwait to promote human 
rights values in accordance with relevant international instruments. Tunisia appreciated in 
particular the achievements in strengthening the right of women and enabling women to </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>175 
</b></p>
<p>play an important role in the political field, including by allowing them to vote and run as 
candidates in parliamentary elections. Tunisia believed that Kuwait&#8217;s endeavour to achieve 
a balance between the rights of women and family harmony would have a positive effect on 
the further development of society. 
</p>
<p>617. Djibouti encouraged Kuwait to continue to accede to international instruments. 
Djibouti praised Kuwait for the establishment of several funds that had had a positive 
impact on the situation of human rights in developing countries. Djibouti encouraged 
Kuwait to continue its efforts to adopt and develop legislation, particularly the bill aimed at 
combating trafficking in persons. Djibouti also encouraged Kuwait to establish a national 
human rights institution and to promote the rights of children and women.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>618. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la region des Grands 
Lacs welcomed the fact that ratified international treaties have the same binding force as 
domestic law. It noted, inter alia, that Kuwait had an active and free media, was committed 
to providing free health services without discrimination and provided international 
assistance at the rate of more than 0.7 per cent of its GDP. It also noted the measures taken 
to dismantle illegal networks for the exploitation of foreign workers in cooperation with 
ILO, and the crucial role played by Kuwait in developing the Arab plan of action for human 
rights education. 
</p>
<p>619. Comit&#233; international pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte Africaine des droits 
de l&#8217;homme et des peuples welcomed the concrete measures taken by Kuwait to ensure the 
effective enjoyment of all human rights, including through the establishment of the 
Women&#8217;s Affairs Commission, the supreme human rights committee. Kuwaiti international 
assistance in the field of economic and social rights reflected its strong commitment to the 
Millennium Development Goals and its firm resolve to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>620. Verein Sudwind Entwicklungspolitik regretted Kuwait&#8217;s rejection of the 
recommendations to ratify optional protocols to human rights treaties. It welcomed, 
however, the positive developments in the field of international criminal justice and the 
rights of stateless persons. It urged Kuwait to consider a moratorium on the death penalty 
and to reconsider its opposition to ending the death penalty. It expressed concern about the 
inequality of women in Kuwait, particularly of migrant women domestic workers, and 
about human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>621. Human Rights Watch welcomed the Government&#8217;s support for recommendations on 
protecting the labour rights of domestic workers and granting stateless persons permanent 
residence, which would help to address two of the most pressing human rights concerns in 
the country. It contested Kuwait&#8217;s claim that all persons living within its territory who 
described themselves as stateless, also known as <i>Bidun</i>, were in fact illegal residents who 
hid other nationalities. It also noted that the law on the organization of the judiciary 
prohibited courts from reviewing matters relating to State sovereignty, including 
individuals&#8217; claims to nationality, effectively barring stateless residents from contesting 
their legal status in a court of law. It urged Kuwait to grant the <i>Bidun</i> permanent residency 
status and equal access to civil rights as soon as possible, and to expedite a review of 
pending claims to nationality. 
</p>
<p>622. Refugees International noted that the lack of legal status of the <i>Bidun</i> had a negative 
impact on all areas of life, including identity, family life, residence, health, jobs and 
political visibility. <i>Bidun</i> children could not obtain a birth certificate because their parents 
were not issued marriage certificates. They had no access to Government education. Health 
care offered free of charge to citizens was withheld from the <i>Bidun</i>. Refugees International 
urged Kuwait to formulate and implement a plan to secure civil and political rights, </p>


<p><b>176</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>including transparent evaluation of all unresolved <i>Bidun</i> cases, to instruct immediately the 
Minister for Health to register every child at birth, and to revise its nationality law, 
particularly regarding the equal right of women to pass on their nationality to their children. 
</p>
<p>623. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies noted that, while international treaties 
enjoyed the power of law according to the Constitution, Kuwait&#8217;s legislation was in 
contradiction to ratified international treaties, particularly its Press and Publication Law, 
and undermined the independence of the judiciary. No political parties officially existed in 
Kuwait. It called on Kuwait to refrain from violating freedom of expression through 
detention, trial and deportation of individuals exercising these rights, to modify the Press 
and Publication Law, and to strengthen guarantees for judicial independence. 
</p><p>624. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network urged Kuwait to give serious consideration 
to the recommendation that called for the elimination of discrimination against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender persons, and in particular to consider decriminalizing same-sex 
relations between consenting adults with a view to ensuring the rights to privacy and non-
discrimination. It also urged Kuwait to repeal provisions that criminalized dressing as a 
member of the opposite sex. 
</p>
<p>625. The Human Rights Information and Training Centre appreciated Kuwait&#8217;s efforts to 
improve its human rights record, and made a number of suggestions. Regarding the long-
standing issue of persons without citizenship, referred to as <i>Bidun</i>, it recommended that 
Kuwait should take more decisive steps and benefit from the experience of scholars and 
civil society experts specialized in this area, with a view to settling this problem. It also 
recommended the prompt establishment of the Public Manpower Authority under the 
auspices of the Minister for Social Affairs and Labour, with a view to abolishing the 
sponsorship (<i>Kafalah</i>) system. Referring to serious human rights violations against 
domestic workers, the Centre highlighted the urgent need for regulation of their 
employment relations. Lastly, it emphasized the importance of awareness-raising on human 
rights issues. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>626. Kuwait expressed appreciation to all speakers from States and civil society. The 
delegation explained that Kuwait was an open society without political prisoners, a small 
democratic country with a population of 1 million Kuwaitis and 2 million foreigners. While 
it was a developing country pursuing modernization, Kuwait would like to respect its own 
system, traditions and customs, of which it was proud. 
</p>
<p>627. Replying to the points raised by civil society, the delegation pledged to convey their 
statements to the Government. The problem of illegal residents had existed for many years, 
and was one that Kuwaiti authorities at all levels wished to solve. In the short term, Kuwait 
provided illegal residents with their basic rights and services, such as education and health 
benefits. They also had the right to use the justice system and to go to court. A committee 
composed of ex-parliamentarians had been established, and it was hoped that a long-term 
solution to the problem would be found in the near future. The delegation also drew 
attention to the many benefits accruing from citizenship and to the illegal resident issue as a 
matter of national security. 
</p>
<p>628. The delegation recalled that Kuwait spent almost 2 per cent of its GNP on 
international development assistance. 
</p>
<p>629. Regarding the situation of domestic workers, the delegation recognized that abuses 
did occur, since no society was perfect, but that these issues were being handled, including 
by resorting to the courts and cooperating with the relevant authorities of countries of 
origin. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>177 
</b></p>
<p>630. Kuwait enjoyed freedom of information and the Prime Minister had the right to go 
to the court against those who would defame him. 
</p>
<p>631. While capital punishment was in accordance with Islamic laws, Kuwait had not 
applied the death penalty for some time. The judiciary was a separate authority with full 
independence from the executive and legislative branches of Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Belarus 
</b></p>
<p>632. The review of Belarus was held on 12 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Belarus in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/BLR/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/BLR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/BLR/3). 
</p><p>633. At its 19th meeting, on 23 September 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Belarus (see section C below). 
634. The outcome of the review of Belarus comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/16), the views of Belarus concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/16/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>635. The delegation stated that the universal periodic review process was a unique 
opportunity to critically analyse the human rights situation in all countries, including 
Belarus. During the review, Belarus, like other countries, noted the experience of other 
countries in the field of human rights and had the opportunity to share its own achievements 
with them. The main objective, based on the results of the review, was the establishment of 
an effective system for the protection and promotion of human rights at the national level. 
</p>
<p>636. The delegation expressed its appreciation for the active participation and important 
contribution of the Member and observer States of the Council during the review. Belarus 
had received a number of constructive and valuable recommendations concerning the 
improvement of its national system for the protection and promotion of human rights. The, 
open, result-oriented approach of Belarus to the review was demonstrated by its specific 
actions. Belarus was one of just a few countries that had started the implementation of 
recommendations made during the review, even before the adoption of the report of the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p>637. At the initiative of the Government, OHCHR held, in July 2010, a seminar on the 
universal periodic review in Minsk, the result of which was the adoption of a plan to 
develop a road map for cooperation between Belarus and OHCHR and other international 
organizations in view of the effective implementation of accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p>638. The draft report of the Working Group included 93 recommendations concerning 
various aspects of human rights. In a spirit of constructive engagement, Belarus had 
accepted 55 recommendations during the Working Group session held in May 2010. The 
remaining recommendations had been considered and thoroughly studied in view of the </p>


<p><b>178</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>existing capacity and international obligations of Belarus, which had followed the rationale 
of accepting a maximum number of recommendations with the expectation of receiving 
relevant assistance from international organizations. As a result, Belarus had accepted 75 
recommendations of 93, which constituted 70 per cent of all recommendations made. 
</p>
<p>639. Belarus intended to develop an inter-agency plan of action for the implementation of 
accepted recommendations made during the review, which would give the Government the 
opportunity to expand its efforts to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>640. The delegation clarified its position regarding the recommendations that Belarus did 
not accept at this stage. The abolition of the death penalty did not fall within the 
competence of the Government, as the decision on the application of the death penalty 
sentences was adopted through national referendum, which, like in other counties, had the 
highest legal power. In addition, the abolition of the death penalty was not a requirement of 
international law. At the same time, the Government, following the trend in Europe to 
abolish the death penalty, continued its efforts to mould public opinion in favour of 
abolition and cooperated actively with international and regional organizations. An event 
on the abolition of the death penalty was organized in Minsk under the auspices of the 
Council of Europe during plenary session of the Human Rights Council, and was attended 
by representatives of the Government, parliament and civil society. 
</p>
<p>641. A recommendation was made that Belarus should ratify a number of international 
human rights treaties. In this respect, the delegation highlighted the fact that Belarus was 
party to almost all core international human rights treaties. Nevertheless, the Government 
intended to continue to adhere to the conventions, the provisions of which would 
complement and strengthen national legislation and could be implemented with available 
resources at the national level. As an example, the delegation mentioned the acceptance of 
the recommendation that Belarus accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. The domestic procedure for accession to the Convention had been completed 
even before the report was approved by the Council. The issue of ratification of other 
instruments would be considered further at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>642. Belarus attached great importance to the issues of mass-media activities, democratic 
elections and freedom of association. National legislation was fully consistent with the 
international obligations of Belarus, in particular with the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. A new media law, drafted with the consultative assistance of OSCE, 
entered into force in 2009 and was aimed at further strengthening media freedom. The 
electoral code of Belarus was amended in 2010 by taking into account OSCE 
recommendations to ensure more transparency in the electoral system and strengthen the 
guarantees of fair elections. It was still too early to draw any conclusions about the 
effectiveness of those laws. 
</p>
<p>643. The delegation considered insufficiently justified the proposal to revise legislation 
concerning non-governmental organizations. A total of 2,274 non-governmental 
organizations carried out their activities in Belarus, and 68 more organizations had been 
registered in the first half of 2010. These figures clearly proved that there were no legal 
obstacles to the registration and full functioning of non-governmental organizations in 
Belarus. The rate of development of civil society in Belarus was at least not slower than in 
other countries. 
</p>
<p>644. The recommendations made during the review that could not currently be accepted 
by Belarus would remain under the consideration of the Government during the next 
review. In this respect, the fact that a number of recommendations had been rejected did not 
mean that they would not be implemented. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>645. The Russian Federation welcomed the Government&#8217;s decision to expand its 
obligations under international human rights treaties and to take relevant measures at the 
national level, and to contribute to the constructive dialogue on human rights issues at the 
international level. It took note of Belarus&#8217; cooperation in the universal periodic review 
process, which was demonstrated in the discussions of the Working Group and by the 
Government&#8217;s position with regard to recommendations. The Russian Federation was 
confident that the implementation of accepted recommendations would further the progress 
documented in broad areas of human rights in Belarus. 
</p>
<p>646. Algeria commended Belarus for the progress achieved in civil and political rights, as 
well as in economic, social and cultural rights, and noted that the progress would make the 
country one of the first in its region and beyond to achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals. Algeria appreciated the fact that 70 per cent of the recommendations made had been 
accepted, including four recommendations made by Algeria. There had been indications 
that recommendations that had not been accepted were still under consideration, which 
attested to the Government&#8217;s exemplary commitment to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>647. Cuba stated that the review at the Working Group session had confirmed Belarus&#8217; 
political commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. The universal 
periodic review identified some of the achievements made in the area of human rights, such 
as illiteracy eradication, free education and health, the low levels of maternal and infant 
mortality and the drastic reduction of HIV/AIDS. It commended Belarus for having 
accepted a large number of recommendations, including those made by Cuba. It encouraged 
Belarus to continue to work for the improvement of the social and economic development 
of its people. 
</p>
<p>648. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted with appreciation Belarus&#8217; readiness to 
provide thorough information, which had assisted in the constructive discussion on the 
progress made and the remaining challenges to the promotion of human rights. Thanks to 
investments in social policy, Belarus provided guarantees for full enjoyment of social rights 
for all in an inclusive and non-discriminatory manner. Venezuela appreciated the fact that 
Belarus had met the Millennium Development Goals in the areas of poverty reduction, 
gender equality and access to primary education before the set deadlines. The delegation 
encouraged Belarus to continue to invest in the implementation of social policies. 
</p>
<p>649. The Syrian Arab Republic thanked the Government for the detailed information on 
Belarus&#8217; position towards the various recommendations made during the review, and 
demonstrated Belarus&#8217; sincere efforts to implement the greatest number of 
recommendations possible in order to promote and protect human rights for all. It 
encouraged Belarus to continue its efforts and invited it to fulfil its human rights 
commitments in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>650. Bahrain noted that Belarus had taken the measures necessary to implement the 
recommendations made during the review and to strengthen and promote human rights, 
which demonstrated the Government&#8217;s readiness to further progress in the area of human 
rights and its commitment to the United Nations. Bahrain noted with appreciation Belarus&#8217; 
efforts to provide free access to health care and to combat trafficking in human beings, 
including through the establishment of rehabilitation centres for the victims of human 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>651. Viet Nam noted with appreciation Belarus&#8217; achievements in promoting and 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in past years. Belarus was among those 
countries that had implemented the Millennium Development Goals relating to poverty </p>


<p><b>180</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>eradication, gender equality and access to primary school. It welcomed the active 
cooperation of Belarus with international organizations and United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, including the treaty bodies and special procedures. It commended Belarus for 
accepting the majority of recommendations during the review, and appreciated Belarus&#8217; 
commitment to the follow-up to the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>652. Azerbaijan noted Belarus&#8217; comprehensive and substantive responses to the 
recommendations, which clearly showed the country&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. It congratulated Belarus on the adoption by the General 
Assembly of the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons in July 2010, 
which had been initiated and launched by Belarus, and commended the establishment of the 
International Training Centre on Migration and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. 
</p>
<p>653. Egypt commended Belarus for having achieved the Millennium Development Goals 
relating to the eradication of poverty, universal primary education and the promotion of 
gender equality before the set deadline. It acknowledged Belarus&#8217; efforts to combat 
trafficking in human beings and encouraged Belarus to strengthen its active role in this 
issue at the national and international levels. Egypt noted with appreciation the 
Government&#8217;s efforts in the area of the rights of women and children. Lastly, it was 
confident that Belarus would be in a position to sustain its endeavours to promote and 
protect all human rights through a holistic approach and a consolidated national human 
rights infrastructure by engaging relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>654. Morocco appreciated the efforts made by Belarus to combat trafficking in human 
beings, in particular the establishment of the International Training Centre on Migration 
and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. Morocco welcomed the fact that Belarus had 
achieved the development goals set in the Millennium Declaration before the deadline, and 
had taken measures to promote equality between men and women and the rights of 
vulnerable persons. It encouraged Belarus to continue to make constructive progress in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>655. Uzbekistan noted with appreciation that Belarus had accepted two recommendations 
made by Uzbekistan on the improvement of living standards and the fight against racial 
discrimination and intolerance. Belarus had taken many measures to improve the human 
rights situation in the country through the establishment of a legal and institutional basis. It 
acknowledged the fact that Belarus was party to most international human rights 
instruments and applied their provisions in its national legislation. Uzbekistan welcomed 
the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure the rights to health and education, and noted Belarus&#8217; 
achievements in combating trafficking in human beings. The review illustrated that Belarus 
had developed and improved its national human rights system. 
</p>
<p>656. China noted that Belarus had made remarkable progress in economic and social 
development and in human rights, as well as in the Millennium Development Goals 
regarding poverty eradication, gender equality and primary education. It also acknowledged 
the fact that Belarus continued to work to improve its legal system and to invest in public 
health and social security, and had accepted most of the recommendations and pledged to 
implement them, despite the challenges it faced as a developing country. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>657. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme acknowledged the 
positive changes in Belarus since 2008 and led to the improvement in the enjoyment of 
economic and social rights, including the rights to work, to health and to education. It 
noted, however, that obstacles to the freedom of expression and assembly remained, in 
particular the procedures for the registration of human rights defenders, political parties and 
independent media. The situation of the Roma community remained frail. It noted that </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>181 
</b></p>
<p>Belarus was the last European country to apply the death penalty and called for its prompt 
abolition. 
</p>
<p>658. Amnesty International urged Belarus to declare an immediate moratorium on 
executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. Belarus was the only country in 
Europe to continue to carry out executions; Vasily Yuzepchuk and Andrei Zhuk were 
executed in March 2010. Amnesty International was also concerned that prisoners and their 
relatives were not informed in advance of the date of execution. Belarus had committed to 
ensure fair trials and to respect the absolute prohibition of torture; Amnesty International 
welcomed Belarus&#8217; commitment to introduce a definition of torture into national 
legislation. It called on the Government to ensure prompt, impartial and comprehensive 
investigations into all complaints of torture and other ill-treatment, and urged the authorities 
to take the measures necessary to ensure freedom of expression and association for all, 
including by simplifying registration procedures for non-governmental organizations and 
by abolishing article 193.1 of the criminal code. 
</p>
<p>659. The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission recalled that Belarus 
had received recommendations to promote equality, including on the grounds of sexual 
orientation and gender identity, and to include these grounds in anti-discrimination 
legislation and to develop public education and police sensitivity programmes. These 
recommendations were consistent with Belarus&#8217; commitment to the principles of equality 
and non-discrimination; it thus urged Belarus to accept them. It also requested Belarus to 
ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens were treated equally to all other 
citizens. It reiterated the various calls that were made at the Working Group session to 
guarantee freedom of expression, assembly and association for all citizens according to the 
obligations stemming from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>660. CIVICUS noted with regret that the position of Belarus during the interactive 
dialogue had been mostly formal and non-constructive. It regretted the fact that Belarus had 
rejected most of the recommendations concerning urgent issues, such as the abolition of or 
at least a moratorium on the death penalty, guaranteeing freedom of association, and 
simplifying the registration procedure of associations, political parties and non-
governmental organizations. The ban on the activities of unregistered non-governmental 
organizations should be abolished and criminal responsibility for such activities should be 
excluded from the criminal code. CIVICUS hoped that the review of the law on non-
commercial organizations planned for 2011 would improve the situation of civil society and 
that Belarus would implement the recommendations of the Human Rights Committee and 
submit its overdue reports. 
</p>
<p>661. The Northern Alliance for Sustainability welcomed the fact that Belarus had 
accepted recommendation 97.8, which confirmed its intention to continue its action-
oriented policy on environmental protection. It also appreciated the acceptance of the 
recommendation 98.31 made by Norway on violations against human rights defenders, 
journalists and students. It drew to the attention of the Council a number of important issues 
that the environmental movement faced in Belarus, such as the fact that activities aimed to 
protect the environment were not freely carried out because of article 193-1 of the criminal 
code, which criminalized any activity of non-registered organizations, and the fact that 
citizens and interest groups of many cities were not in a position to freely express their 
position on environmental issues. In this respect, it was therefore important that Belarus 
accept recommendation 98.23 made by Belgium. It expressed the hope that the Government 
would return to the discussion of this issue. 
</p>
<p>662. While welcoming Belarus&#8217; announcement concerning the invitation of eight special 
procedures mandate holders, Conscience and Peace Tax International regretted the fact that 
the list did not include the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. It urged 
Belarus to invite this mandate holder, who could investigate persistent reports of </p>


<p><b>182</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>harassment of minority religious denominations and assess progress in the implementation 
of the right of conscientious objection to military service. It encouraged Belarus to continue 
and deepen its engagement with civil society in the drafting of an alternative service law, 
and hoped that this would help to produce a text compatible with international standards on 
the implementation of the right of conscientious objection to military service. Lastly, it 
hoped that, pending promulgation of legislation, the prosecution and imprisonment of 
conscientious objectors would be suspended. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>663. The delegation again thanked all delegations for their active participation and 
support for Belarus&#8217; efforts in the protection of human rights. Belarus would continue its 
cooperation with the Council on various human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>664. In response to the interventions by non-governmental organizations, the delegation 
stated that their comments and concerns would be noted in the implementation of the 
recommendations made in the review. In response to environmental issues addressed by a 
stakeholder, the delegation stated that Belarus paid special attention to environmental issues 
and had an active dialogue with relevant stakeholders in the framework of the Aarhus 
Convention and similar agreements. 
</p>
<p>665. The delegation referred to a number of achievements made by Belarus in the past 20 
years since its independence, including political stability and a well-functioning economy. 
Belarus was ready to continue open discussions on all issues concerning the work of the 
Council and the protection of human rights in general, in view of its national interests.  
</p>
<p>666. In conclusion, the delegation positively assessed the results of the review, and 
expressed its gratitude to OHCHR for its assistance and to the members of troika for their 
constructive support during the review. 
</p>
<p><b>  Guinea-Bissau 
</b></p>
<p>667. The review of Guinea-Bissau was held on 7 May 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Guinea-Bissau in accordance with the annex 
to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GBN/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GBN/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GBN/3). 
</p><p>668. At its 33rd meeting, on 1 October 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Guinea-Bissau (see section C below). 
669. The outcome of the review of Guinea-Bissau comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/10), with the views of Guinea-Bissau 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/15/10/Add.1). </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>183 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>670. The Legal Counsel with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cletche Sanha, thanked 
Council Members for their understanding, noting with satisfaction that the Council had 
acknowledged the difficulties and limitations faced by Guinea-Bissau. The country had 
made major efforts to attend the universal periodic review, which was a crucial phase in the 
adoption of the final document. 
</p>
<p>671. Of the 108 recommendations made during the review, 103 recommendations had 
been accepted, 2 had already been implemented or were in the process of implementation, 
while 5 were rejected.  
</p><p>672. With regard to the ratification procedures of international legal human rights 
instruments, Guinea-Bissau had incorporated into its internal legal framework, and in line 
with the Constitution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, and on the involvement of children in armed conflict; 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto; the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) 
and the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) of ILO; the Convention on Access to 
Information, Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental 
Matters; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; and the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime.  
</p>
<p>673. With regard to the implementation in domestic legislation of instruments to which 
Guinea-Bissau was already a party, the provisions of the above-mentioned conventions 
were reflected in many parts of national legislation, particularly the Constitution, the 
General Labour Law, the Public Servant Law, the Penal Code, the Civil Code and the 
Electoral Law. 
</p>
<p>674. Concerning the issue of reporting to treaty bodies, Guinea-Bissau had submitted 
combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports to the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women at its forty-fourth session, at the 
Committee&#8217;s request. At the request of other committees, particularly the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Human 
Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Guinea-
Bissau restated its readiness to cooperate despite the major difficulties and limitations the 
country was facing.  
</p>
<p>675. Regarding the adoption of specific legislation criminalizing female genital 
mutilation and a law against domestic violence, the process was ongoing, as the country 
had just started awareness-raising campaigns for the targeted population. The Government 
was working in partnership with the Institute for Women and Children and with non-
governmental organizations pursuing the same aim. Once this first stage was completed, the 
authorities would be able to move on to the second stage, namely the adoption of specific 
legislation criminalizing the above-mentioned practices. The country had already a 
preliminary draft bill along these lines. 
</p>
<p>676. In that regard, the delegation emphasized that the fight against practices, such as 
early and forced marriage, in a society such as in Guinea-Bissau should be conducted 
gradually, through awareness-raising campaigns, sensitization and continuous dialogue </p>


<p><b>184</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>with the targeted sectors of the population before legislative measures sanctioning these 
practices could be taken. 
</p>
<p>677. Concerning the issue of humanizing the detention system, prisoners of different 
sexes were imprisoned separately. Efforts were being made, funded by development 
partners, to improve the situation of prisoners.  
</p>
<p>678. With regard to the inclusive educational system, the Government was of the view 
that this could only be achieved through progressive measures. The Constitution guaranteed 
the right to private schools and specialized or general schools, which could be created by 
individuals or associations. The delegation referred to a private initiative school created by 
Associa&#231;ao Guineense de Rehabilita&#231;ao e Integra&#231;ao dos Cegos and various international 
non-governmental frameworks. The association provided special teaching in an institution 
known as Bengala Branca, funded by the Canadian Fund for Local Initiatives and the 
Caritas office in Bissau. There was also another association devoted to special teaching for 
deaf and mute persons.  
</p>
<p>679. Parliament would soon adopt a law to ensure that the existing national human rights 
institution is in conformity with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>680. Regarding child and maternal mortality, trends over recent years had showed that 
this was gradually being reduced. There was a reduction in the death rate of infants between 
0 and 5 years of age, thanks to free vaccination campaigns carried out by the Ministry of 
Health throughout the country. The delegation also confirmed the support of the 
international community to minimize the suffering of those who needed assistance. 
</p>
<p>681. The national human rights commission representative stated that the Government of 
Guinea-Bissau would continue to implement the recommendations made during the 
universal periodic review process. She reiterated the commitment of Guinea-Bissau to 
continue to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>682. Algeria underscored Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s commitment to promote human rights and 
cooperate with the Council. It noted the political instability and extreme poverty the 
country had experienced since independence, as well as the measures taken in the area of 
good governance, drug trafficking, national reconciliation and to establish favourable 
conditions for lasting peace, security and political stability in the country. Despite the re-
establishment of constitutional order in 2009, the process of consolidating stability still 
encountered enormous obstacles, notably the lack of reform in the security sector. Algeria 
called upon the international community to provide Guinea-Bissau with the assistance 
necessary to meet challenges.  
</p>
<p>683. Cuba congratulated Guinea-Bissau on its commitment, and stated that it had been 
engaged in extensive exchanges of opinion, offering information on the human rights 
situation with participating countries. Guinea-Bissau had shed light on the steps taken in the 
areas of health and education, and on programmes aimed at helping the poor. It had 
accepted the majority of recommendations, including those from Cuba. The implementation 
of these recommendations would enhance the well-being of the people; the cooperation and 
financial assistance of the international community were of vital importance. Cuba was 
ready to continue to provide its modest cooperation to Guinea-Bissau. 
</p>
<p>684. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland thanked Guinea-Bissau 
for its responses to the recommendations, and was particularly pleased to note that all its 
recommendations had enjoyed the support of Guinea-Bissau. The United Kingdom 
reaffirmed the importance it attached to Guinea-Bissau working with regional and other </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>185 
</b></p>
<p>international partners to reform the security sector, ensuring the primacy of the civilian 
government and the rule of law. The United Kingdom welcomed the commitment made by 
Guinea-Bissau to improve the human rights situation through its universal periodic review 
and to address the recommendations that enjoyed its support in a timely and focused 
manner. 
</p>
<p>685. Morocco noted the progress made by Guinea-Bissau, but also the difficulties it 
encountered and the unfavourable socio-economic conditions. It underscored Guinea-
Bissau&#8217;s results in the area of good governance, rule of law and democracy, and stressed the 
need for the support of the international community. It paid tribute to the efforts made by 
Guinea-Bissau in seeking peaceful and consensual solutions to its difficulties. Morocco 
encouraged Guinea-Bissau to continue to consolidate its political and judicial institutions in 
order to ensure unity and integrity, and to bring lasting peace and stability. 
</p>
<p>686. Senegal noted the acceptance by Guinea-Bissau of most of the recommendations and 
its commitment to promote and protect human rights further. This commitment should be 
maintained by following through the reforms already embarked upon in several sectors, 
including fighting trafficking in human beings. Senegal invited Guinea-Bissau to continue 
to cooperate fully with the human rights protection mechanisms, including special 
procedures. Senegal called on the international community to provide Guinea-Bissau with 
the aid and assistance it required. 
</p>
<p>687. Nigeria commended Guinea-Bissau for the additional information it had provided 
since the Working Group session in May 2010, as well as its constructive engagement. It 
was encouraged to note that Guinea-Bissau had accepted a substantial number of 
recommendations, and welcomed its initiatives and programmes to ensure that its people 
enjoyed human rights. Nigeria encouraged Guinea-Bissau to follow up on the accepted 
recommendations and to continue to cooperate with the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, and called on the international community to provide assistance and to share 
best practices, which would allow Guinea-Bissau to fulfil its human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>688. The Democratic Republic of the Congo congratulated Guinea-Bissau on having 
accepted the recommendation it made with regard to its adhesion to international human 
rights instruments, and recommended in particular the ratification of the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It encouraged 
Guinea-Bissau to continue to improve the education system, notably the creation of a 
school for persons with disabilities. It called on the international community to support the 
reconstruction efforts in the country. 
</p>
<p>689. Angola acknowledged Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s political commitment to improve the human 
rights situation, even though its recent past had been marked by tragic events. Angola 
recognized the efforts made to combat poverty, and welcomed the series of programmes 
launched to strengthen its institutional capacity. Guinea-Bissau had pledged to reduce 
maternal and child mortality rates. Political and institutional stability was, however, crucial 
and decisive. Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s recovery would come about only when there was political 
stability and peace; it was therefore necessary for the international community to provide 
support for, above all, the reform of defence and security forces.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>690. Amnesty International welcomed Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s support for a number of 
recommendations, including on the adoption of a law criminalizing female genital 
mutilation, and encouraged Guinea-Bissau to reconsider the recommendation to take 
measures to combat other harmful traditional practices. It welcomed Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s 
support for recommendations to ratify international human rights treaties and urged it to 
proceed without delay. It regretted the fact that Guinea-Bissau did not support five </p>


<p><b>186</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>recommendations that were particularly relevant, in the light of the impunity enjoyed by 
members of the armed forces for human rights violations that occurred in March and June 
</p><p>2009. It urged Guinea-Bissau to end prevailing impunity as a matter of urgency.  
</p>
<p>691. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, in a joint statement with the European 
Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation, welcomed Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s 
commitment to equality and non-discrimination. In keeping with that commitment, it 
commended Guinea-Bissau for being one of six African States to have endorsed the 
General Assembly joint statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity. 
It recognized the positive steps taken to end discrimination on these grounds, and 
encouraged Guinea-Bissau to further implement policies that ensured equality of access to 
public health services by all marginalized populations; implement laws to protect lesbians, 
gays, bisexuals and transgender people from discrimination; and implement effective 
education and training for the police, judicial and State officials. 
</p><p>692. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme noted the difficulties 
encountered by Guinea-Bissau in recovering from the civil war. It acknowledged Guinea-
Bissau&#8217;s determination to cooperate with the Council, which should be reflected in the 
country through changes in social, economic and political sectors. It noted that drug 
trafficking and transnational crime threatened not only the existence of the State but also 
the stability and security of neighbouring countries, and welcomed the strategic framework 
for peace consolidation. It regretted the absence of credible investigation into several 
murders of political personalities. It called on Guinea-Bissau to take appropriate measures 
to implement all the recommendations, which would help Guinea-Bissau to recover.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>693. Guinea-Bissau thanked all delegations. Although it faced many difficulties, the 
country had made progress in protecting human rights. The shortcomings were due to 
structural problems that the country had the means to overcome. The State&#8217;s own structures, 
together with the support of the international community, could help to address the 
challenges ahead, which were slowing down the country&#8217;s progress. The delegation once 
again appealed to the international community to help Guinea-Bissau to implement the 
recommendations made. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kiribati 
</b></p>
<p>694. The review of Kiribati was held on 3 May 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Kiribati in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/KIR/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KIR/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KIR/3). 
</p><p>695. At its 33rd meeting, on 1 October 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Kiribati (see section C below). 
696. The outcome of the review on Kiribati comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/15/3), the views of Kiribati concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/15/3/Add.1). </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>187 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>697. Pursuant to the request of Kiribati and on its behalf, the President of the Council 
presented Kiribati&#8217;s views on the recommendations, given that Kiribati was unable to be 
present at the meeting. Kiribati submitted its position and views on the recommendations in 
writing, and were contained in the addendum to the report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>698. Kiribati reiterated its commitment to the universal periodic review process in 
compliance with General Assembly resolution 60/251. When considering the 
recommendations, Kiribati had established a working committee, the members of which 
represented all relevant ministries. The committee&#8217;s findings formed the basis for Kiribati&#8217;s 
response to each recommendation. 
</p>
<p>699. Kiribati had analysed all recommendations and put them into the following 
categories, in accordance with national priorities: human rights and other international 
conventions; legislative reform; human rights institutions; rights awareness; the Kiribati 
national development plan for the period 2008&#8211;2011; child labour policy; human rights 
special procedures; gender and equality; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; health 
and education; and the environment. 
</p>
<p>700. Kiribati had accepted 42 recommendations, not accepted 11, while the remaining 30 
would be considered in due process. 
</p>
<p>701. Kiribati acknowledged that reform was long overdue for many essential underlying 
institutions, noting that a thorough overhaul of the constitutional and legal frameworks 
would soon have to be carried out. Without this, there would be little chance for Kiribati to 
align itself strategically with international conventions and practices. 
</p>
<p>702. Kiribati faced real challenges posed by climate change. National priorities had thus 
evolved around concerted efforts to protect the environment, biodiversity and natural living 
ecosystems. The Government&#8217;s scarce financial resources were diverted to programmes to 
mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, given that rising sea levels threatened the 
very foundations of its fragile islands and livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>703. Kiribati would continue to work closely with the international community as it 
sought to achieve fully the objectives of each accepted recommendation. The realization of 
all recommendations would hinge very much on the availability of resources, both technical 
and monetary, as well as timely capacity-building. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>704. Morocco noted Kiribati&#8217;s request for technical and financial support not only to 
implement universal periodic review recommendations but also to support the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to promote human rights. Such support was essential to establishing a 
national human rights commission in conformity with the Paris Principles, particularly by 
providing adequate training with a view to ensuring that staff were qualified and 
specialized. Such a commission would require a budget that Kiribati did not necessarily 
have; it would also play a role in the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly 
by providing advice to the Government concerning the harmonization of national 
legislation with international instruments; devising national human rights plans of action 
and programmes in general, and for the promotion and protection of human rights of 
vulnerable groups in particular; and training and awareness-raising of the public and State 
officials on human rights. The Council should pay closer attention to technical assistance in 
the universal periodic review.  </p>


<p><b>188</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>705. Algeria stated that Kiribati&#8217;s positions, as provided by the President on its behalf, 
reaffirmed its commitment to the universal periodic review and to strengthening human 
rights. Algeria praised Kiribati&#8217;s efforts to participate in the universal periodic review, 
despite the logistic difficulties. Algeria made an appeal for greater assistance for Kiribati. 
Algeria welcomed the fact that Kiribati had accepted the majority of the recommendations, 
including three made by Algeria. It encouraged Kiribati to examine positively Algeria&#8217;s 
other two recommendations, on examining the possibility of ratifying the main human 
rights treaties, and on seeking technical assistance from the international community and 
specialized United Nations agencies in order to create a national human rights institution 
and to overcome the difficulties and constraints noted in Kiribati&#8217;s national report. Algeria 
called on OHCHR to make additional efforts to facilitate the participation of countries with 
small populations such as Kiribati in the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>706. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland thanked Kiribati, 
through the secretariat, for its participation in the Working Group session. It appreciated the 
fact that Kiribati had been able to study the recommendations and to provide responses to 
them. The United Kingdom recognized that this exercise required a considerable effort by 
Kiribati in view of its obvious resource challenges. The United Kingdom looked forward to 
the implementation of the accepted recommendations, and hoped that Kiribati would accept 
additional recommendations from those that were still under consideration. 
</p>
<p>707. New Zealand stated that the adoption of the universal periodic review report for 
Kiribati highlighted the difficulties that States may face when participating in the process, 
particularly small island States without representation in Geneva. It understood why such a 
long and expensive journey to Geneva for a representative of Kiribati may not be an 
attractive option. As the first cycle of the universal periodic review came to an end and with 
the approaching review of the Council, it was time to consider this issue. New Zealand 
commended Kiribati for accepting the recommendations relating to the participation of 
women in decision-making and the need for an adequate law to prosecute cases of domestic 
violence. It expressed, however, its disappointment that more recommendations relating to 
the rights of women had not been accepted, particularly those aimed at ensuring compliance 
with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
New Zealand was pleased to see that Kiribati was prepared to consider extending a standing 
invitation to all special procedures, while noting the difficulties faced by Kiribati in 
meeting reporting obligations to international instruments.  
</p>
<p>708. Australia commended Kiribati for its comprehensive and considered response to the 
recommendations made in the course of the universal periodic review, which was a major 
effort by Kiribati, given the small size of its public service and limited resources. By its 
active participation in the United Nations human rights machinery, Kiribati had displayed 
its commitment to human rights. Australia was pleased to note that Kiribati had accepted its 
three recommendations, and that the decision not to accept certain recommendations was 
primarily due to national capacity and resource constraints. Australia commended the 
President of the Council for the manner in which he worked with Kiribati to ensure the 
presentation of its responses. The universal periodic review process was an enormous 
challenge for Kiribati, and OHCHR had an important role in helping small States to manage 
this process.  
</p>
<p>709. Maldives welcomed the insightful and honest presentation made by Kiribati on 3 
May 2010, and acknowledged that meeting the deadline for the submission of its position 
on the recommendations was a remarkable effort in the light of the small size of Kiribati&#8217;s 
public service and capacity constraints. Kiribati was a small island developing State with 
shared characteristics and common challenges with Maldives, especially the impact of 
climate change and capacity constraints. Climate change had a wide range of implications 
for the full enjoyment of human rights, and Member States had a responsibility to desist </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>189 
</b></p>
<p>from actions that would knowingly undermine human rights in Kiribati and to take 
meaningful action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to a safe level. Developed 
nations also had a human rights obligation to assist Kiribati in adapting to the inevitable 
effects of global warming. Maldives also highlighted that it was imperative for the 
international community to assist Kiribati in implementing the recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>710. Amnesty International noted with concern the difficulties that had prevented Kiribati 
from attending the adoption of its universal periodic review outcome, and stated that this 
was a reminder that support for small developing countries should be strengthened. It 
regretted the fact that Kiribati considered it not feasible to ratify the international covenants 
and other human rights instruments. Amnesty International welcomed the efforts to address 
violence against women; it urged Kiribati to implement in full its obligations under the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child to protect women and children from violence, and to 
eradicate cultural practices that contributed to discrimination against women and girls. It 
also urged Kiribati to realize its plans to develop specific legislation on eliminating 
violence against women, and encouraged States Members of the United Nations and 
regional bodies to support the Government&#8217;s efforts to protect women and children.  
</p>
<p>711. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and ILGA-Europe commended Kiribati for 
its willingness to positively consider recommendations 66.23 and 66.41, as this would 
strengthen Kiribati&#8217;s commitment to the core principles of equality and non-discrimination. 
They urged Kiribati to act promptly to implement each of the recommendations in 
furtherance of the commitment to the principles of equality and to the values of respect, 
fairness and equal dignity for all. In view of the absence of Kiribati on the podium, they 
requested that written copies of all statements be collated and submitted to Kiribati, as this 
would greatly facilitate communications with it.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>712. The President of the Council stated that Kiribati had noted the 30 recommendations 
that remained under its consideration. 
</p>
<p><b> B. General debate on agenda item 6

<p>744. At the 32nd meeting, on 30 September 2010, the President stated that, in the light of 
the growing number of instances of religious intolerance, such as discrimination, conflating 
a religion with terrorism or desecrating or destroying holy books, religious sites or shrines, 
he had been empowered, by the agreement of all Council Members, to make the following 
declaration: 
</p>
<p> The Council condemns recent instances of religious intolerance, prejudice 
and related discrimination and violence, which continue to occur in all parts of the 
world. The international community should stand united against all forms of 
religious intolerance and should engage in practical steps to end such intolerance. 
The Council encourages efforts to establish collaborative networks to build mutual 
understanding and promote dialogue. The Council stresses that these efforts should 
be made to protect individuals of all religions and beliefs in a non-discriminatory 
way, and should apply to promote understanding among them. The Council also 
recognizes that open, constructive and respectful debate, as well as interfaith 
dialogue, can have a positive effect. The Council reiterates the call by the Secretary-
General on the necessity for the voices of moderation to be heard and for mutual 
respect to prevail.

<p><b>  Administrative and programme budget implications of 
resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council at its 
fifteenth session 
</b></p>
<p><b>  15/2 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraphs 3, 10 and 11 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.9, the Human Rights 
Council would:  
</p>
<p> (a) Decide to renew, for a three-year period, the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and its consequences; 
</p>
<p> (b) Request the Special Rapporteur to submit annual reports on the activities of 
the mandate to the Human Rights Council, together with recommendations on measures 
that should be taken to combat and eradicate contemporary forms of slavery and slavery-
like practices and to protect the human rights of victims of such practices; 
</p>
<p> (c) Request the Secretary-General to give the Special Rapporteur all human and 
financial assistance, from within existing resources, for the effective fulfilment of his/her 
mandate. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that provisions of $56,600 per year would be required to implement the activities called for 
in the draft resolution. The requirements have been included under section 23 (Human 
Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, however experience has 
shown they are at a minimal level. 
</p>
<p>3. While no additional appropriations would be sought from the General Assembly, the 
Secretariat will to the extent possible in implementing the terms of the draft resolution meet 
additional requirements that would arise, such as (a) staff to support the Special Rapporteur 
in undertaking his/her studies and during field visits; and (b) additional travel for the 
Special Rapporteur and/or experts for formal consultations with partners and stakeholders, 
including appropriate conference services for those meetings, within resources available 
under the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>4. Since the period of extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur extends into 
the biennium 2012&#8211;2013, in drawing up the estimates for the proposed programme for the 
biennium 2012&#8211;2013 a thorough review of the expenditure pattern of the activities of the 
Special Rapporteur will be carried out and addressed in that context. 
</p>
<p>5. With regard to paragraph 11, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. </p>

<p><b>  15/6 
Follow-up to the report of the committee of independent experts in 
international humanitarian and human rights law established pursuant 
to Council resolution 13/9 
</b></p>
<p>6. Under the terms of paragraphs 8 and 9 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.34, the 
Human Rights Council would:  
</p>
<p> (a) Decide to renew and resume the mandate of the committee of independent 
experts in international humanitarian and human rights law established pursuant to Human 
Rights Council resolution 13/9, and would request this committee to present its report to the 
Council at its sixteenth session; it would also request the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to continue providing its members with all administrative, 
technical and logistic assistance required to enable them to fulfil their mandate promptly 
and efficiently;  
</p>
<p> (b) Request the High Commissioner to present a report on the implementation of 
the resolution to the Council at its sixteenth session. 
</p>
<p>7. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a total amount of $618,200 would be required to implement the activities called for in 
the draft resolution, as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a)  An estimated amount of $432,800 required under section 2 (General 
Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) would 
provide for processing pre- and post-session documentation of the Committee and 
providing interpretation services during a 10-day mission by the high-level expert to the 
region; 
</p>
<p> (b)  Under section 23 (Human Rights) an estimated amount of $185,400 would 
provide for: (i) travel and daily subsistence allowance of three high-level experts twice to 
Geneva for five days, and one 10-day mission to the region; (ii) travel and daily subsistence 
allowance for three staff members of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) (one P-4 and one P-3, and one administrative assistant) and a 
Security Officer for 10 days to the region; (iii) protection if required for the region: 
armoured vehicles, equipment and close protection while on mission; (iv) replacement for 
two months of OHCHR staff members assisting the experts (salaries of two staff members 
at the P-4 and P-3 levels); and (v) general operating expenses, including communications 
and other related expenses, videoconferencing, rental of vehicles and premises. The 
requirements are summarized below.

</b></p>
<p>8. The requirements have not been included under sections 2 and 23 of the programme 
budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. The Secretariat will, to the extent possible, in 
implementing the terms of the draft resolution meet additional requirements, within 
resources available under the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. The 
expenditure performance will be reported to the General Assembly in the second </p>

Human rights and indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>9. Under the terms of paragraphs 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.5, the Human 
Rights Council would, decide to hold: 
</p>
<p> (a) On an annual basis, and without prejudice to the outcome of the Council&#8217;s 
review of its work and functioning, an interactive dialogue with the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples following the presentation of its report, within existing 
resources; 
</p>
<p> (b) Within existing resources, a half-day panel, at its eighteenth session, on the 
role of languages and culture in the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; well-
being and identity. 
</p>
<p>10. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that requirements of $40,200 would arise to implement the activities called for in 
paragraphs 7 and 8. 
</p>
<p>11. The estimated requirements of $40,200 have not been included under section 23 
(Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011 to carry out the 
activities foreseen in the draft resolution. The Secretary-General will, to the extent possible, 
meet the additional requirements from within the provisions approved for section 23 of the 
programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. Additional requirements are therefore not 
anticipated upon the adoption of the draft resolution by the Council. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to paragraphs 7 and 8, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI 
of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent 
resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which 
the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and 
reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

<p><b>  15/12 
The use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>13. Under the terms of paragraphs 11, 18 and 19 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.31, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decide to renew, for a period of three years, the mandate of the Working 
Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the 
exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, to continue to undertake the tasks 
contained in resolution 7/21 of 28 March 2008, as well as in all other relevant resolutions 
on the subject; 
 (b) Request the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide the Working Group with all the necessary assistance and 
support for the fulfilment of its mandate, both professional and financial, including through 
the promotion of cooperation between the Working Group and other components of the 
United Nations system that deal with countering mercenary-related activities, in order to 
meet the demands of its current and future activities; </p>


<p><b>212</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p> (c) Request the Working Group to consult States, intergovernmental 
organizations, non-governmental organizations and other relevant actors of civil society in 
the implementation of the resolution and to report its findings on the use of mercenaries as 
a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, and to the Council at its 
eighteenth session. 
</p>
<p>14. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a total sum of $327,600 per annum or $655,200 per biennium would be required to 
implement the ongoing activities called for under its terms, as follows: 
</p>
<p><i> United States dollars 
</i></p>

Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva 3 800 
</p>
<p><b>Total 327 600 
</b></p>
<p>15. The estimated requirements enumerated under paragraph 3 above have been 
included under sections 2, 23, and 28 E of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;
2011 for the activities of the Working Group. No additional appropriations are therefore 
required to implement activities falling under the terms of paragraphs 11, 18 and 19 of the 
draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to paragraph 18, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the

<p>17. Under the terms of paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1 (e) and 1 (j) of draft resolution 
A/HRC/15/L.6, the Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decide to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples for a period of three years; 
</p>
<p> (b) Request the Special Rapporteur to work in close cooperation with the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and to participate in its annual session;  
</p>
<p> (c) Request the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of 
his mandate to the Council in accordance with its annual programme of work. 
</p>
<p>18. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that provisions of $59,800 per year would be required to implement the activities called for 
in the draft resolution. The requirements have been included under section 23 (Human 
Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, however experience has 
shown they are at a minimal level. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>213

additional requirements that would arise such as (a) staff to support the mandate holder in 
undertaking his/her studies and during field visits; and (b) additional travel for the mandate 
holder and/or experts for formal consultations with partners and stakeholders, including 
appropriate conference services for those meetings, within resources available under the 
programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011.  
</p>
<p>20. Since the period of extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur extends into 
the biennium 2012&#8211;2013, in drawing up the estimates for the proposed programme for the 
biennium 2012&#8211;2013 a thorough review of the expenditure pattern of the activities of the 
Special Rapporteur will be carried out and addressed in that context.

human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>21. Under the terms of paragraphs 2, 2 (f) and 5 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.7, the 
Human Rights Council would:  
</p>
<p> (a) Decide to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, for a 
period of three years; 
</p>
<p> (b) Request the Special Rapporteur to develop a regular dialogue and discuss 
potential areas of cooperation with Governments and all relevant actors, including 
specialized agencies and programmes with, inter alia, the Counter-Terrorism Committee of 
the Security Council, including its Executive Directorate, the Counter-Terrorism Task 
Force, OHCHR, the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office of Drugs 
and Crime and treaty bodies, as well as non-governmental organizations and other regional 
and subregional institutions, and to report regularly to the Human Rights Council and to the 
General Assembly; 
</p>
<p> (c) Request the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide all the 
necessary human, technical and financial assistance to the Special Rapporteur for the 
effective fulfilment of his/her mandate. 
</p>
<p>22. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, to implement 
the activities called for in the draft resolution, it is estimated that provisions of $74,000 per 
annum or $148,000 would be required including (a) $17,000 per annum or $34,000 per 
biennium under section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and

that there are additional resource requirements in the implementation of the terms of the 
draft resolution. The detailed programme budget implications contained in this oral 
statement is hereby submitted, as a record, to the Council.  
</p>
<p>27. This oral statement is made in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of 
the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>28. Under the terms of paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.24, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p>(a) Decide to extend the mandate of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
for a further period of three years, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions 1991/42 and 1997/50 and with Human Rights Council resolution 6/4; 
</p>
<p>(b) Request the Secretary-General to provide all necessary assistance to the

<p>(c) Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to organize in 2011, within existing resources, a two-day event to commemorate the 
twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the Working Group.

months for organization and participation in the two-day event to be held in 2011, as 
follows:

event have not been included under the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>33. Currently, the Secretary-General has been requested to implement various decisions 
and resolutions of the Human Rights Council, including the fifteenth session of the 
Council, and in response to various mandates of the General Assembly relating to human 
rights issues, which have financial implications on the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011 estimated at $9,527,800 of which, the Secretary-General is proposing to absorb 
an amount estimated at $3,662,700.  
</p><p>34. The Council is also informed that there are other mandates that are likely to 
command additional requirements in the programme budget in the bienniums 2010&#8211;2011 or 
2012&#8211;2013, as follows: (a) the entry into force of the International Convention on the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; (b) the decision of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to request the General Assembly to authorize 
the Committee to meet for an additional week per session (two additional weeks of 
sessional meetings per year) in 2012 and 2013; and (c) the decision of the Committee 
against Torture to request the General Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an 
additional week per session in 2011 and 2012. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to the biennium 2012&#8211;2013, in his report (A/65/333), the Secretary-
General also stated that an additional amount of $283,100 would be required in the 
biennium 2012&#8211;2013 relating to Council resolution 14/8. It is also estimated that the 
programme budget implications of draft resolutions tabled at the current fifteenth session of 
the Council will command new resources in the biennium 2012&#8211;2013 of about $4,963,300. 
</p><p>36. Against this background of the various mandates and its related additional resource 
requirements in the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, the Council is hereby informed that, since at this 
juncture the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011 has been tasked with 
absorption of significant amounts of requirements for additional resources, it is proposed 
that General Assembly approval be sought for all additional resources arising from the 
Council&#8217;s mandates that cannot be met from within available resources. Although the 
Secretariat will endeavour to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet 
the additional requirements, the Secretariat, after having exhausted all possibilities of 
absorption, may have to seek additional resources under the programme budget for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011, through established procedures. 
</p>
<p>37. The Human Rights Council will recall that the General Assembly, in part V of its 
resolution 63/263, endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions that there is merit in presenting an 
annual report on the revised estimates arising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the 
Council (A/63/541). As such, the programme budget implications of the decisions and </p>


<p><b>216</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>resolutions of the current session will only be presented to the Assembly at its sixty-sixth 
session. Given that some of the draft resolutions of the current session require immediate 
action and that their implementation requires additional resources, including those for 
conference services, which are not included in the calendar of conferences for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011, the Secretary-General could issue an addendum to his report (A/65/333) only 
upon the timely submission of the Council&#8217;s report on the decisions and resolutions of its 
fifteenth session to the Assembly at the main part of its sixty-fifth session. 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to paragraph 12, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

<p>39. Under the terms of paragraphs 9 and 10 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.17, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p>(a) Decide to extend by one year the mandate of the special procedure on the 
situation of human rights in Cambodia, and request the Special Rapporteur to report on the 
implementation of his mandate to the Council at its eighteenth session, and to engage in a 
constructive manner with the Government of Cambodia for the further improvement of the 
situation of human rights in the country; 
</p>
<p>(b) Request the Secretary-General to report to the Council at its eighteenth 
session on the role and achievements of OHCHR in assisting the Government and people of 
Cambodia in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>40. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a sum of $49,800 per annum would be required to implement activities under the terms 
of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>41. Estimated requirements of $49,800 per annum or $99,600 per biennium have been 
included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011 for the activities of the Special Rapporteur. No additional appropriations would 
be required should the Council adopt the draft resolution.

<p>(i) Gathering all relevant information, including national practices and 
experiences, relating to the protection and promotion of the rights to freedom of </p>

</b></p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association, and to study trends, developments and 
challenges in relation to the exercise of these rights, and to make recommendations 
on ways and means to ensure the promotion and protection of the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association in all its manifestations; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Incorporating, in his or her first report, an elaboration of the framework 
through which he or she will consider best practices, including national practices and 
experiences, that promote and protect the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
of association, taking into account in a comprehensive manner the relevant elements 
of work available within the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Seeking, receiving and responding to information from Governments, non-
governmental organizations, relevant stakeholders and any other parties who have 
knowledge of these matters, with a view to protecting and promoting the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Integrating a gender perspective throughout the work of his or her mandate; 
(v) Contributing to the provision of technical assistance or advisory services by 
OHCHR to better promote and protect the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
and of association; 
</p>
<p>(vi) Reporting on violations, wherever they may occur, of the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association, as well as discrimination against, threats or 
use of violence, harassment, persecution, intimidation or reprisals directed at persons 
exercising these rights, and draw the attention of the Human Rights Council and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to situations which are of 
particularly serious concern; 
</p>
<p>(vii) Undertaking his or her activities such that the present mandate will not 
include those matters of specific competence of the International Labour 
Organization and its specialized supervisory mechanisms and procedures with 
respect to employers&#8217; and workers&#8217; rights to freedom of association, with a view to 
avoiding unnecessary duplication; 
</p>
<p>(viii) Working in coordination with other mechanisms of the Human Rights 
Council, with other competent United Nations bodies and with human rights treaty 
bodies, and to take all necessary measures to avoid unnecessary duplication with 
those mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>(b) Request the Special Rapporteur to submit each year to the Council a report 
covering activities relating to his/her mandate; 
</p>
<p>(c) Request the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide all the 
necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate by the 
Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>44. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, an estimated 
total amount of $511,800 would be required to implement activities in response to the terms 
of the draft resolution, as follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) An estimated amount of $51,900 required under section 2 (General Assembly 
and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) would provide for 
conference services for the organization of a two-day consultation each year (interpretation 
for two days each year in English/French/Spanish; translation in English/French/Spanish 
for a concept note and background paper; translation of agenda and compendium of best 
practices into the official languages of the United Nations; </p>


<p><b>218</b> GE.11-17043

provide for (i) travel and daily subsistence allowance for the Special Rapporteur, on two 
field missions each year to Geneva to attend the annual consultation meeting of special 
procedures mandate holders; to submit a yearly report to the Human Rights Council; to 
New York, to submit a yearly report to the General Assembly and to attend annual 
consultations with member States and other relevant stakeholders; (ii) travel and daily 
subsistence allowance for OHCHR staff to accompany the expert during field missions; (iii) 
travel of one treaty body member or special procedures mandate holder to Geneva to 
participate in each of the three annual consultations; (iv) travel of five experts (one from 
each region) for each of the three annual consultations; (v) consultant services (9 months at 
P-3 level each year) to support the special rapporteur with highly specialized expertise; (vi) 
one staff member at P-3 level (12 months per annum), one staff member at G-5 level (12

Section 23, Human Rights 458 200 
Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva 1 700 
</p>
<p><b>Total 511 800

<p>45. The requirements of $511,800 have not been included under sections 2, 23 and 28 E 
of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>46. Currently, the Secretary-General has been requested to implement various decisions 
and resolutions of the Human Rights Council, including those of the fifteenth session of the 
Council, and in response to various mandates of the General Assembly relating to human 
rights issues, which have financial implications for the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011 estimated at $9,527,800, of which the Secretary-General is proposing to absorb 
an amount estimated at $3,662,700.  
</p><p>47. The Council is also informed that there are other mandates that are likely to 
command additional requirements in the programme budget in the bienniums 2010&#8211;2011 or 
2012&#8211;2013 as follows: (a) the entry into force of the International Convention on the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; (b) the decision of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to request the General Assembly to authorize 
the Committee to meet for an additional week per session (two additional weeks of 
sessional meetings per year) in 2012 and 2013; and (c) the decision of the Committee 
against Torture to request the Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an 
additional week per session in 2011 and 2012. 
</p>
<p>48. With regard to the biennium 2012&#8211;2013, in his report (A/65/333), the Secretary-
General also stated that an additional amount of $283,100 will be required in the biennium 
2012&#8211;2013 relating to Human Rights Council resolution 14/8. It is also estimated that the 
programme budget implications of draft resolutions tabled at the fifteenth session of the 
Council will command new resources in the biennium 2012&#8211;2013 of about $4,963,300. </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>219

</p>
<p>50. Since the mandate is for a three-year period, provisions of $1,023,600 would be 
required for the biennium 2012&#8211;2013. The requirements for 2012&#8211;2013 would be 
considered within the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012&#8211;
</p><p>2013. 
</p>
<p>51. The Council will recall that the General Assembly, in part V of its resolution 63/263, 
endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Administrative and Budgetary Questions, that there is merit in presenting an annual report 
on the revised estimates arising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human 
Rights Council (A/63/541). As such, the programme budget implications of the decisions

(A/65/333) only upon the timely submission of the Council&#8217;s report on its decisions and 
resolutions adopted at its fifteenth session to the Assembly during the main part of its sixty-

</p>
<p>52. With regard to paragraph 8, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the

<p>53. Under the terms of paragraphs 1, 12, 13 and 14 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.28, 
the Human Rights Council would:  
</p>
<p>(a) Decide to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
for a further period of three years; 
</p>
<p>(b) Request the Special Rapporteur, with the assistance of OHCHR, in 
consultation with States, relevant United Nations agencies, national human rights 
institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to prepare, within existing resources, a thematic 
study on the realization of the right to health of older persons, including main existing 
challenges and best practices; </p>


<p><b>220</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>(c) Decide to address the thematic study requested in paragraph 12 above, within 
existing resources, in a panel within the programme of work of its eighteenth session, and 
invites OHCHR, the World Health Organization, Advisory Committee members and other 
relevant United Nations bodies and agencies to participate in an interactive dialogue on the 
study in the Council; 
</p>
<p>(d) Request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue to provide all necessary resources for the effective fulfilment of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate. 
</p>
<p>54. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that provisions of $133,300 per annum or $266,600 per biennium would be required to 
implement the activities under its terms, including (a) $51,800 per annum or $103,600 per 
biennium under section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and 
Conference Management); (b) $79,800 per annum or $159,600 per biennium under section 
23 (Human Rights); and (c) $1,700 per annum or $3,400 per biennium under section 28 E 
(Administration, Geneva). The requirements have been included under the aforementioned 
sections of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011; however, experience has 
shown they are at a minimal level. 
</p>
<p>55. While no additional appropriations would be sought from the General Assembly, the 
Secretariat will to the extent possible in implementing the terms of the draft resolution meet 
additional requirements that would arise such as (a) staff to support the Special Rapporteur 
in undertaking his/her studies and during field visits; and (b) additional travel for the 
Special Rapporteur and/or experts for formal consultations with partners and stakeholders, 
including appropriate conference services for those meetings, within resources available 
under the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>56. Since the period of extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur extends into 
the biennium 2012&#8211;2013, in drawing up the estimates for the proposed programme budget 
for the biennium 2012&#8211;2013 a thorough review of the expenditure pattern of the activities 
of the Special Rapporteur will be carried out and addressed in that context. 
</p>
<p>57. With regard to the paragraphs of the draft resolutions cited in paragraph 53 above, 
attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B 
of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 
64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee

</p>
<p>(c) To make recommendations on improvement of legislation and 
implementation of law and to contribute to the realization of the Millennium Development 
Goals, in particular goal 3 on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of 
women; 
</p>
<p>(d) To work in close coordination, in the context of the fulfilment of its mandate, 
with other special procedures and subsidiary organs of the Council, relevant United Nations 
entities, including the Commission on the Status of Women and UN-Women, and in 
particular the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and other 
treaty bodies, within their respective mandates, with a view to avoiding unnecessary 
duplication; 
</p>
<p>(e) To take into account the views of other stakeholders, including relevant 
regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights institutions and civil society 
organizations; 
</p>
<p>(f) To submit an annual report to the Council, starting at its twentieth session, on 
the issue of discrimination against women in law and practice, and on good practices in 
eliminating such laws, drawing upon the findings of the United Nations human rights 
machinery and the broader United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>59. Under the terms of paragraph 22 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.15, the Human 
Rights Council would request the working group to contribute to the provision of technical 
assistance or advisory services by OHCHR to better promote the elimination of 
discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>60. Under the terms of paragraph 23 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.15, the Human 
Rights Council would request the Secretary-General and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial 
assistance to the working group for the effective fulfilment of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>61. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a total amount of $1,621,400 would be required to implement activities in response to 
the terms of the draft resolution, as follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) An estimated amount of $592,500 required under section 2 (General

<p>73. Under the terms of paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.22, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p>(a) Decide to establish an intergovernmental open-ended working group with a 
mandate to elaborate a legally binding instrument on the regulation, monitoring and 
oversight of the impact of the activities of private military and security companies on the 
enjoyment of human rights, on the basis of the principles, main elements and the draft text 
for a possible convention proposed by the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a 
means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of peoples to self-
determination; </p>


<p><b>224</b> GE.11-17043 
</p>
<p>(b) Also decide that the intergovernmental open-ended working group should 
meet every year until the fulfilment of its mandate, that it should have a session of five 
working days a year and that its first session would take place no later than May 2011; 
</p>
<p>(c) Affirm the importance of providing the intergovernmental open-ended 
working group with the necessary expertise and expert advice to fulfil its mandate, and 
would decide that the members of the Working Group on the use of mercenaries who were 
involved in the elaboration of the principles, main elements and the draft text for a possible 
convention should participate in the intergovernmental open-ended working group as 
resource persons; 
</p>
<p>(d) Request the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide the working group with all the necessary financial and human 
resources for the fulfilment of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>74. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a total amount of $242,700 would be required to implement activities in response to its 
terms as follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) An estimated amount of $135,600 required under section 2 (General 
Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) would 
provide for conference services in all official languages for five days per year; 
</p>
<p>(b) Under section 23 (Human rights), an estimated amount of $103,200 would 
provide for (i) travel and daily subsistence allowance for members of the working group to 
Geneva to attend the annual consultation meeting of special procedures mandate holders, to 
submit a yearly report to the Human Rights Council; to each of the three annual 
consultations; to New York, for consultation with Committee on the Status of Women, UN-
Women and other relevant entities and bodies; and (ii) three months&#8217; general temporary 
assistance at the P-4 level, and two months&#8217; general temporary assistance at the General 
Service level; 
</p>
<p>(c) Under section 28 E (Administration, Geneva), an estimated amount of $3,900 
would provide for conference-servicing support services. 
</p>
<p>The estimated requirements are summarized as follows: 
</p>
<p><i> United States dollars 
</i></p>
<p>Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs 
and Conference Management 135 600 
Section 23, Human Rights 103 200 
Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva 3 900 
</p>
<p><b>Total 242 700 
</b></p>
<p>75. The requirements enumerated in paragraph 74 above have not been included under 
the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>76. Currently, the Secretary General has been requested to implement various decisions 
and resolutions of the Human Rights Council, including those adopted at the fifteenth 
session of the Council, and in response to various mandates of the General Assembly 
relating to human rights issues, which have financial implications for the programme 
budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011 estimated at $9,527,800, of which the Secretary-
General is proposing to absorb an amount estimated at $3,662,700.  
</p><p>77. The Council is also informed that there are other mandates that are likely to 
command additional requirements in the programme budget in the bienniums 2010&#8211;2011 or </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>225 
</b></p>
<p>2012&#8211;2013, as follows: (a) the entry into force of the International Convention on the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; (b) the decision of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to request the General Assembly to authorize 
the Committee to meet for an additional week per session (two additional weeks of 
sessional meetings per year) in 2012 and 2013; and (c) the decision of the Committee 
against Torture to request the General Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an 
additional week per session in 2011 and 2012. 
</p>
<p>78. With regard to the biennium 2012&#8211;2013, in his report (A/65/333), the Secretary-
General also stated that an additional amount of $283,100 would be required in the 
biennium 2012&#8211;2013 relating to Human Rights Council resolution 14/8. It is also estimated 
that the programme budget implications of draft resolutions tabled at the fifteenth session of 
the Council would command new resources in the biennium 2012&#8211;2013 of about 
$4,963,300. 
</p><p>79. Against this background of the various mandates and its related additional resource 
requirements in the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, the Council is hereby informed that, since at this 
juncture the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011 has been tasked with 
absorption of significant amounts of requirements for additional resources, it is proposed 
that General Assembly approval be sought for all additional resources arising from the 
Council&#8217;s mandates that cannot be met from within available resources. Although the 
Secretariat will endeavour to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet 
the additional requirements, the Secretariat, after having exhausted all possibilities of 
absorption, may need to seek additional resources under the programme budget for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011 through established procedures. 
</p>
<p>80. Since the mandate is for a three-year period, provisions of $485,400 would be 
required for the biennium 2012&#8211;2013. The requirements for 2012&#8211;2013 would be 
considered within the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012&#8211;
</p><p>2013. 
</p>
<p>81. The Council will recall that the General Assembly, in part V of its resolution 63/263, 
endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Administrative and Budgetary Questions, that there is merit in presenting an annual report 
on the revised estimates arising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human 
Rights Council (A/63/541). As such, the programme budget implications of the decisions 
and resolutions of the current session will only be presented to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-sixth session. Given that some of the draft resolutions of the current session requires 
immediate action and that their implementation requires additional resources, including 
those for conference services which are not included in the calendar of conferences, for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011, the Secretary-General could issue an addendum to his report 
(A/65/333), only upon the timely submission of the Council&#8217;s report on the decisions and 
resolutions of its fifteenth session, to the Assembly during the main part of its sixth-fifth 
session.  
</p>
<p><b>  15/27 
The situation of human rights in the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>82. Under the terms of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.35 (amendment to A/HRC/15/L.3), 
the Human Rights Council would decide to renew the mandate of the independent expert on 
the situation of human rights in the Sudan for a period of one year, who shall assume the 
mandate and responsibilities set out by the Council in its resolutions 6/34, 6/35, 9/17 and 
11/10; request the independent expert to engage with the newly created human rights 
forums in the Sudan as well as the human rights sections of the African Union, the United </p>

</p>
<p>Nations Mission in the Sudan and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in 
Darfur and to submit a report to the Council for consideration at its eighteenth session; and 
request the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary 
assistance to discharge the mandate fully. 
</p>
<p>83. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a sum of $77,700 per annum would be required to implement activities under its terms. 
</p><p>84. Estimated requirements of $77,700 per annum or $155,400 per biennium have been 
included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011 for the activities of the independent expert. No additional appropriations would 
be required should the Council adopt the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p><b>  15/28 
Assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>85. Under the terms of paragraphs 10 and 15 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.2, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p>(a) Call upon OHCHR and all stakeholders to assist Somalia to adequately 
prepare for the forthcoming universal periodic review in May 2011, including through the 
allocation of financial resources from the universal periodic review Trust Fund; 
</p>
<p>(b) Decide to extend the mandate of the independent expert for one year with a 
view to maximizing the provision and flow of technical assistance to Somalia in the field of 
human rights, in order to support the efforts of the transitional federal Government and its 
subnational authorities to ensure the respect of human rights and strengthen the human 
rights regime in its work to complete the outstanding task of the transitional mandate, and 
request him to report to the Council at its eighteenth session on the implementation of 
technical cooperation inside Somalia. 
</p>
<p>86. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that requirements of $86,200 per annum would arise in response to its terms. 
</p><p>87. Estimated requirements of $86,200 per annum or $172,400 per biennium have been 
included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011 for the activities of the independent expert. No additional appropriations would 
be required should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council.  
</p>
<p>88. With regard to paragraph 10, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Decision 15/116 
Human rights and issues related to terrorist hostage-taking 
</b></p>
<p>89. Under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 3 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.20, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decide to convene, within existing resources, a panel discussion at its 
sixteenth session on the issue of human rights in the context of hostage-taking, ransom 
payments and impunity for terrorists involved; </p>


<p>GE.11-17043 <b>227 
</b></p>
<p> (b) Request OHCHR to liaise with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism and all concerned parties and 
stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to 
ensuring their participation in the panel discussion. 
</p>
<p>90. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a sum of $28,800 would be required to implement activities under its terms. 
</p><p>91. The requirements of $28,800 estimated to provide for the travel and daily 
subsistence allowance expenses of five experts to participate in the panel discussion have 
not been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011. The additional requirements are proposed to be met from within 
available resources approved under section 23 of the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011. No additional resources would therefore be required should the Council adopts 
the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>92. With regard to paragraph 1, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions,

Nelson Mandela International Day 
</b></p>
<p>93. Under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 3 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.21, the 
Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decide to hold a high-level panel discussion during its seventeenth session to 
reflect on the current human rights situations worldwide in respect of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, drawing inspiration from the exemplary 
example of Nelson Mandela to promote and protect human rights without distinction to 
race, colour or national or ethnic origin; 
</p>
<p> (b) Request OHCHR to take the necessary measures for the observance by the 
Council of Nelson Mandela International Day. 
</p>
<p>94. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated 
that a sum of $35,200 would be required to implement activities foreseen under the terms of 
the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>95. The requirements of $35,200 estimated to provide for the travel and daily 
subsistence allowance for three high-level speakers from different regions to participate in 
the high-level panel discussion and for printing 500 copies of <i>A Long Walk to Freedom: 
The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela</i> in English have not been included under section 23 
(Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. The additional 
requirements are proposed to be met from within available resources approved under 
section 23 of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. No additional resources 
would therefore be required should the Council adopt the draft resolution. </p>
