<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 10/2, human rights in the 
administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice, requested the Secretary-General to 
submit a report to the Council on the latest developments, challenges and good practices in 
human rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice and conditions for 
women and children in detention, and in the activities undertaken by the United Nations 
system as a whole. The present report responds to that request, and is the first such report 
requested by the Council. An earlier report on the topic (A/HRC/4/102) was presented to 
the Council at its fourth session on the basis of previous requests made by the Commission 
on Human Rights (most recently in resolution 2004/43), and decision 2/102 of the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council also has before it a report of the High Commissioner on the 
implementation of resolution 10/2, as requested in paragraph 19 of the resolution. The High 
Commissioner&#8217;s report (A/HRC/14/35 and Add.1) focuses on implementation of the 
resolution at the national level, and is based on information received from Member States. 
The present report should be read in conjunction with the report of the High Commissioner 
to provide the most complete contemporary picture of human rights and the administration 
of justice. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights in the administration of justice 
</b>3. The promotion and protection of human rights in and through the administration of 
justice has been a matter of concern of the United Nations since the Organization&#8217;s 
inception. Key human rights relevant to the administration of justice were set down in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in particular in article 3 (the right to life, liberty 
and security of person), article 5 (the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment), article 6 (the right to recognition everywhere as a person before 
the law), article 7 (equality before the law), article 8 (the right to an effective remedy), 
article 9 (prohibition on arbitrary arrest or detention), article 10 (the right to a fair trial), and 
article 11 (presumption of innocence and non-retroactivity).1 These rights found legally 
binding expression in the subsequent human rights treaties adopted by the General 
Assembly, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as 
a number of other texts giving detailed guidance on the implementation of human rights 
guarantees in the administration of justice, such as the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners, approved by the Economic and Social Council in 1957. 
</p>
<p>4. A consideration of the state of protection of human rights in the administration of 
justice has remained a preoccupation of the United Nations in the decades since, with 
periodic resolutions on the issue adopted by the General Assembly2 and the Commission on 
Human Rights.3 In its most recent resolution on human rights in the administration of 
justice, the General Assembly invited the Human Rights Council to continue consideration 
of the topic. The work of the Commission on Human Rights was further developed by the

<p>work of its special procedures including (but not limited to) the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights while countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention. Contributions were also made by the Subcommission on Prevention of 
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, in particular through its sessional working 
group on the administration of justice established in 1994,4 and the studies and working 
papers produced by Subcommission members, such as a series of reports on discrimination 
in the criminal justice system.5 The United Nations human rights treaty bodies play a 
leading role in highlighting the general nature of human rights guarantees in the justice 
administration systems of the States parties to the relevant treaties, through their 
consideration of periodic reports, individual communications and general comments and 
recommendations. Other parts of the United Nations system have examined, and continue 
to examine, the link between human rights and the administration of justice, in particular 
the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. 
</p>
<p>5. The work of the United Nations to date has clarified in some detail the links between 
human rights protection and the administration of justice, and has provided standards by 
which to assess new phenomena and challenges as they arise. At the core of the 
administration of justice is the formal criminal justice system. The Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 
1993 stated: &#8220;Every State should provide an effective framework of remedies to redress 
human rights grievances or violations. The administration of justice, including law 
enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and especially an independent judiciary and legal 
profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human 
rights instruments, is essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights 
and indispensable to the processes of democracy and sustainable development.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6. The specific human rights involved in the criminal justice system are extensive. 
Rights on arrest and during pretrial detention include those relating to conditions of 
detention (including the prohibition of torture), the legal basis for the detention and judicial 
review thereof, and the presumption of bail. Criminal trials are assessed against fair trial 
guarantees laid down in human rights law, including the right to a public hearing by a 
competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law and a presumption of 
innocence, the right to counsel, equality of arms and the right to appeal. Sanctions imposed 
by courts in criminal matters raise further rights issues, for example ensuring a focus on 
rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders, the impact of imprisonment on groups 
particularly vulnerable to human rights violations, and the use of the death penalty. The 
principle of non-discrimination forms a background to the entire criminal justice process. 
The administration of justice extends beyond the criminal justice system to other means of 
administering justice, such as military justice, administrative justice and transitional justice 
mechanisms. Each of these provides a means for realizing the right to a remedy and the 
State&#8217;s obligation to provide a means for vindicating individuals&#8217; rights. In their 
application, however, they can also lead to human rights violations.

<p><b> III. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p>7. In the time since the report of the Secretary-General to the fourth session of the 
Council in March 2007, there have been a significant number of developments in the field 
of human rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice. As requested by 
the Council, this chapter of the report sets out the most important of those developments, 
notably in the areas of juvenile justice and conditions for women and children in detention. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Developments in international law 
</b></p>
<p>8. In respect of international treaties, a key development was the adoption by the 
General Assembly in resolution 63/117 of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 10 December 2008. Although 32 
States parties to the Covenant have signed the Optional Protocol, there have been no 
ratifications to date and the instrument is thus yet to come into force. Once in force, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will have competence to receive and 
consider communications from (or on behalf of) individuals or groups of individuals 
claiming to be victims of a violation by a State party of any of the economic, social and 
cultural rights laid down in the Covenant. The Optional Protocol will thus provide a further 
mechanism for ensuring that the human rights of all (including, for example, detainees&#8217; 
right to food) are respected, protected and fulfilled. 
9. The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 2006, requires two further 
ratifications to enter into force.6 Once in force, States parties to the Convention will be 
required, inter alia<i>,</i> to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence under the 
national criminal law, and to take the necessary measures to hold criminally responsible all 
those responsible for the crime, including superiors. The Convention recognizes the 
continuing nature of the crime of enforced disappearance. Under article 9 of the 
Convention, States parties are obliged to establish competence to exercise jurisdiction over 
the offence of enforced disappearance not only in any territory under their jurisdiction, but 
also when the alleged offender or victim is one of their nationals. When the alleged 
offender is present in any territory under the State party&#8217;s jurisdiction, the State has an 
obligation to either extradite or surrender the individual to another State or to an 
international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized. 
10. The 50th ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture in 
2009 allowed the membership of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture to be 
expanded. This enables the Subcommittee to broaden its range of activities, which include 
making unannounced visits to places of detention and providing technical advice to States 
on the establishment of national independent preventive bodies. 
</p>
<p>11. The international community has also taken the opportunity of the anniversaries of a 
number of human rights instruments to reflect on the links between human rights and the 
administration of justice. For the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights in December 2008, the High Commissioner for Human Rights designated a 
&#8220;Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week&#8221;, calling on all partners to pay special attention to 
the civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights of persons deprived of their liberty 
in prisons and other places of detention. A number of activities were undertaken in country 
offices of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, some of which are 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 On 7 March 2010, 18 of the required 20 ratifications had been deposited. Article 39 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, General Assembly resolution 61/177. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13137 
</p>
<p>reported in section C below. Initiatives have also marked the thirtieth anniversary of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 
December 2009, the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 
November 2009 and the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition 
of the death penalty, in December 2009. 
</p>
<p>12. Following an initiative of the Government of Thailand, the United Nations 
Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in April 2009 decided to establish 
an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts to develop rules specific to the treatment 
of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings.7 Any new rules would 
be supplementary to and consistent with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for 
the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted in 1955. The Commission was mindful that existing 
rules might not adequately address the issue of female detainees.8 The expert group, 
convened by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), has prepared a 
draft to be submitted to the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and 
Criminal Justice in April 2010. As part of awareness-raising on the issue, the Government 
of Thailand organized a side event at the twelfth session of the Human Rights Council on 
&#8220;Inspiring Women&#8217;s Rights in Prison&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. The General Assembly has recently adopted a number of resolutions which directly 
address the role of human rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice,9 
the coordination of United Nations rule of law activities,10 and moratoriums on the use of 
the death penalty.11 In addressing the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, the General Assembly12 urged States while countering terrorism 
to, inter alia, ensure the application of human rights law to those deprived of their liberty, to 
interrogation methods and to trial procedures, and to ensure that laws criminalizing acts of 
terrorism are non-discriminatory, non-retroactive and in accordance with international 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p>14. On the issue of juvenile justice and human rights, the United Nations Commission 
on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice has considered reports of the Secretary-General 
on support of national efforts for child justice reform, in particular through technical 
assistance and improved United Nations system-wide coordination,13 and on 
Implementation of the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and 
Witnesses of Crime.14

</p>
<p>8
 These concerns have been raised by a number of actors. For example, in June 2008, the Quaker 
</p>
<p>United Nations Office in Geneva published &#8220;A commentary on the UN Standard Minimum Rules for 
the Treatment of Prisoners&#8221; (QUNO, Geneva, 2008), which highlighted the lack of a gender 
perspective in the Standard Minimum Rules.

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Developments in the work of the human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>15. The human rights treaty bodies continue to address the human rights aspects of the 
administration of justice in their consideration of the periodic reports of States parties, in 
individual communications procedures, and in their general comments and 
recommendations. In 2007 the Human Rights Committee adopted a general comment on 
article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which sets out in detail 
the Committee&#8217;s views on the right to equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair 
trial.15 The Committee has more recently addressed the obligations of States parties under 
the Optional Protocol to the Covenant,16 including the nature of interim or provisional 
measures granted by the Committee when an action taken or threatened by the State party 
would appear likely to cause irreparable harm to the author or the victim of the alleged 
violation. 
</p>
<p>16. In its general comment No. 20 on non-discrimination in economic, social and 
cultural rights,17 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasized the 
desirability of States parties providing training to judges and candidates for judicial 
appointment on the principle of non-discrimination as a means of fulfilling obligations 
under article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In 
its general comment No. 19 on the right to social security,18 the Committee indicated its 
view that any persons or groups who have experienced violations of their right to social 
security should have access to effective judicial or other appropriate remedies at both 
national and international levels, and that judges, adjudicators and members of the legal 
profession should be encouraged by States parties to pay greater attention to violations of 
the right to social security in the exercise of their functions. 
</p>
<p>17. The Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted its general comment No. 12 on 
the right of the child to be heard in 2009,19 in which it addressed, inter alia, the 
implementation of article 12 (2) of the Convention, which specifies that children must be 
provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings 
affecting the child. In the general comment, the Committee emphasized a number of points, 
including the importance of providing an environment in which the child can be heard 
effectively and not be intimidated (for example, through the use of overly formal court 
proceedings), and the Committee&#8217;s recommendation that wherever possible, the child be 
given the opportunity to be directly heard in any proceedings rather than through a 
representative. 
</p>
<p>18. A general recommendation on women migrant workers adopted by the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2008 addresses a number of human 
rights challenges faced by this group in the administration of justice, including vulnerability 
in detention,20 and access to justice.21

Covenant, the Human Rights Committee has continued to address the functioning of justice

<p>administration systems, including recent cases involving: individuals whose names were 
placed on the Consolidated List of the United Nations Sanctions Committee, resulting in a 
freezing of their assets and limitations on their freedom of movement;22 ethnic profiling by 
police in stop and search;23 failure to adequately investigate a killing;24 judicial procedures 
for extradition of individuals involving a risk of the death penalty;25 house arrest as 
arbitrary detention;26 failure to establish procedures on the arrest of juveniles that take 
account of their age and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation;27 lack of reasons 
for dismissal of an appeal as a violation of article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant;28 and 
procedural fairness in the dismissal of a judge.29 
</p>
<p><b> C. Developments in the work of the special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>20. The special procedures of the Human Rights Council address human rights and 
administration of justice issues from the perspective of their thematic or geographic 
mandates. This significant work is provided to the Council in the reports of the individual 
mandate holders and working groups, such as mission reports. Some developments of 
particular interest are set out below. 
</p>
<p>21. In 2009 the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances adopted a 
general comment in which it expressed its view that the definition of &#8220;crime against 
humanity&#8221; set out in article 7 (1) of the Statute of the International Criminal Court now 
reflects customary international law and can thus be used to interpret and apply the 
provisions of the Declaration for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances. Thus enforced disappearance may amount to a crime against humanity 
where the criteria listed in article 7 (1) of the Statute are met, namely where it is committed 
as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with 
knowledge of the attack. 
</p>
<p>22. In his final report to the Human Rights Council submitted in 2009, the former 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers explored guarantees of 
judicial independence (A/HRC/11/41), setting out a number of recommendations on judges&#8217; 
appointment, tenure, conditions of service, freedom of expression and association, and the 
national budget allocated to the judiciary. He also called for the adoption of a 
comprehensive set of principles on the independence of the judiciary to further the Basic 
Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary endorsed by the General Assembly in 1985 
(A/RES/40/146). The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2009 report to the General Assembly similarly 
addressed safeguards for the independence of lawyers and the legal profession (A/64/181). 
</p><p>23. A number of the special procedures have continued to draw attention to issues which 
they identify as current challenges to the protection of human rights within the context of 
the administration of justice. Thus the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions has recently explored the phenomenon of mob justice (A/64/187), and

<p>the use of lethal force in the process of policing public assemblies (A/HRC/11/2). The 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment has recently addressed the use of the death penalty from the point of view of 
the norm prohibiting torture, together with the treatment of drug users in the criminal 
justice system (A/HRC/10/44), in particular the possibility that the denial of medical 
treatment in situations of detention may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment (para. 71). A more complete study on the phenomena of torture, cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment in the world, including an assessment of conditions 
of detention, has been submitted by the Special Rapporteur to the Council in 2010.30 
</p>
<p>24. In 2010 the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of 
internally displaced persons submitted to the Council a revised Framework on Durable 
Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons.31 The Framework aims to provide clarity on the 
concept of a durable solution for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and provides general 
guidance on how it can be achieved. Inter alia, the Framework recognizes effective 
remedies for violations linked to displacement, including access to justice and, where 
appropriate, reparations, as one of the key conditions determining whether a durable 
solution has been reached. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Developments in the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>25. Across the United Nations system, a number of developments since 2007 have a 
direct bearing on human rights protection in the administration of justice. The Rule of Law 
Coordination and Resource Group, created in 2007 following a decision of the Secretary-
General, aims to increase coherence and minimize fragmentation across rule of law 
activities in the United Nations system. To date, the Group has, among other things, 
developed four Guidance Notes of the Secretary-General, each with an explicit foundation 
in international human rights norms: United Nations Assistance to Constitution-making 
Processes; United Nations Approach to Rule of Law Assistance; United Nations Approach 
to Transitional Justice; and United Nations Approach to Justice for Children. 
</p>
<p>26. The last-mentioned Guidance Note represents a major development for the United 
Nations system in respect of juvenile justice, providing the guiding principles and 
framework for United Nations work in the area of juvenile justice. In doing so it sets such 
activities within the United Nations mandate to promote the realization of human rights. 
The guiding principles and framework it adopts are grounded in relevant human rights 
norms, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in the work of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and its general comment No. 10. The common United 
Nations approach set down in the Guidance Note is being rolled out at country level. Some 
of these activities are reported in section C above. 
</p>
<p>27. As part of a series of tools to support States in implementing the rule of law and the 
development of criminal justice reform, UNODC published a <i>Handbook for Prison 
Managers and Policymakers on Women and Imprisonment</i> in 2008. The Handbook draws 
to some extent on the international human rights norms relevant to detention and women 
and on the general comments of the Human Rights Committee. 
</p>
<p>28. The World Health Organization&#8217;s European office, as part of its Health in Prison 
Project, together with UNODC, has addressed the health needs of women prisoners in a 
publication entitled <i>Women&#8217;s Health in Prison: Correcting gender inequity in prison

Declaration on Women&#8217;s Health in Prison, adopted following a conference in November 
2008 co-organized by, inter alia, the World Health Organization and the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime. The Declaration stresses that &#8220;the underlying importance of 
human rights should underpin all thinking and all policy development for all those in 
compulsory detention&#8221;. Although focused on European countries, the Health in Prison 
Project could be replicated in other regions of the world. 
29. Recent years have also seen the continued rolling out of a set of 15 juvenile justice 
indicators (together with a manual for implementation) developed by the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and UNODC in 2006 together with a manual.33 Roll-out took 
place in the South East Asia region in 2008 and the Middle East and North African regions 
in 2009.34 
</p>
<p>30. The Interagency Panel on Juvenile Justice (IPJJ) continued to facilitate and enhance 
country and global level coordination in the provision of technical advice and assistance in 
juvenile justice in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other 
relevant norms and standards.35 Mandated by the Economic and Social Council,36 the IPJJ 
has, since 2008, encouraged States to adopt a comprehensive approach to juvenile justice 
reform in a manner that upholds the rights of the child in contact with the justice system, in 
line with the Secretary-General&#8217;s Guidance Note on the United Nations Approach to Justice 
for Children. The Panel&#8217;s work includes increasing the availability of existing technical 
resources on juvenile justice (primarily through its website, www.juvenilejusticepanel.org) 
and building and maintaining a juvenile justice expert roster, a revised version of which 
was developed in 2008 and published online in early 2009. 
</p>
<p>31. In October 2008 the Ninth International Conference of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, held in Nairobi, focused on the role of national 
human rights institutions in the administration of justice. The Conference adopted a 
Declaration which identifies the main areas and means by which National Human Rights 
Institutions in exercising their mandates can work to strengthen the administration of justice

<p>organizations &#8212; that work to ensure that child justice systems comply with the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and other international norms and standards: the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), 
the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), the United Nations

Secretariat to further develop, strengthen and support the work of its members, and in 2008 the Panel 
accepted three new members: the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 
the International Association of Youth and Family Judges and Magistrates and the International

<p>at the national level. The recommendations are focused on the judiciary and access to 
justice, legal aid, law enforcement and detention. 
</p><p>32. A large number of initiatives on human rights and juvenile justice have been 
undertaken by non-governmental and civil society actors in recent years. One example is 
the First World Congress on Restorative Juvenile Justice, held in Lima in November 2009. 
The Declaration adopted by the Congress urged the adoption of a restorative justice 
approach to juvenile justice, as an approach which focuses on repairing the individual, 
relational and social harm caused by the offence committed. Also of note are a series of 
papers on various aspects concerning children of prisoners published by the Quaker United 
Nations Office.37 
</p>
<p><b> IV. United Nations system activities 
</b></p>
<p>33. As a whole, the United Nations system has undertaken a large number of activities 
and initiatives which have a bearing on the protection of human rights in the administration 
of justice. This chapter outlines some illustrative examples of these activities, with a focus 
on juvenile justice and on those practices identified by their implementers as promising in 
terms of effecting change. 
</p>
<p>34. In 2009, UNICEF further strengthened its focus on upstream policy advocacy and 
legal reform work, supporting new or amended pieces of legislation in Kenya, Central 
African Republic, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Djibouti and Sri Lanka. In Ethiopia, the agency 
assisted in developing a National Criminal Justice Policy, designed to extend special 
attention to children in conflict with the law, child victims and other vulnerable groups 
throughout all stages of the criminal justice procedure. In Liberia and in Papua New 
Guinea, UNICEF has led the development of a national common approach to justice for 
children, with a view to leveraging the work of other United Nations entities on the issue. 
</p>
<p>35. UNICEF continues to focus its efforts on the reduction of the number of children in 
detention, for example through the setting up of mechanisms for diversion from judicial 
proceedings and alternatives to deprivation of liberty. In Togo the work of the UNICEF 
country office in promoting diversion has resulted in an increase of 83 per cent in 
alternatives to detention sentences. Building the capacity of justice for children 
professionals (including ministry staff, the police, judges, lawyers, paralegals and social 
workers) also remains a major strategy in UNICEF justice interventions, through both pre- 
and in-service training and the inclusion of justice for children issues in regular professional 
curricula. The agency has also emphasized a shift from juvenile justice to justice for 
children, implying a focus beyond children in conflict with the law to also include child 
victims and witnesses of crime. New tools for policymakers and professionals working with 
child victims and witnesses of crime, such as a model law and an implementation 
handbook, have been developed with UNODC. At country level, UNICEF offices have also 
further strengthened their support to child victims and witnesses of crime, through the 
establishment of child-friendly courts and police procedures, victim support units, toll-free 
telephone lines, legal support and counselling. With UNICEF&#8217;s assistance, Swaziland has 
established its first child-friendly court.

<p>36. In the Philippines UNICEF supports a comprehensive approach to juvenile justice 
which has resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of children in detention, from more 
than 2,000 in 2006 to 387 in 2008. This result has been achieved through a systemic 
approach to the issue, encompassing the development of a Juvenile Justice and Welfare 
Act, assistance to the National Police Commission in developing a police manual on 
handling of children in conflict with the law focused on diversion, and development of 
community-based diversion programmes for children in conflict with the law in 298 
barangays, small administrative divisions. 
</p>
<p>37. In promoting a comprehensive approach to juvenile justice, UNICEF has worked in 
Indonesia to incorporate into the National Strategy on Access to Justice provisions on 
children in contact with the law. In Liberia, UNICEF has led the development of a national 
common approach to child justice in Liberia that was endorsed by the Rule of Law Group 
in the context of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2008&#8211;2012) and 
led to the establishment of a child justice forum chaired by the Ministry of Justice. 
</p><p>38. In 2008, UNODC implemented programmes on juvenile justice in Egypt, Jordan and 
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. A programme that started in Egypt in 2003 is now focusing on 
the vocational training and social reintegration of boys, including pre-release and post-
release preparation, and provides for specific action targeting girls in conflict with the law. 
The programme in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has led to the adoption and implementation 
of a national strategy on juvenile justice. 
39. At the request of the Economic and Social Council,38 UNODC is preparing an 
intergovernmental meeting of experts to study ways and means of strengthening access to 
legal aid in the criminal justice system, together with the possibility of developing an 
instrument such as a declaration of basic principles or a set of guidelines for improving 
access to legal aid in criminal justice systems. 
40. As noted above, a number of events were held in country offices of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) within the context of the 
Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For example, the United Nations Assistance 
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), in partnership with UNODC and the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), organized a series of events in Afghanistan 
aimed at raising awareness of the findings and recommendations of a report produced by 
UNAMA on arbitrary detention in the country. Activities included a joint UNAMA-
UNODC press conference on detention; the broadcast of a round-table discussion on 
national television on the rights of detainees; and two joint UNAMA-UNODC-UNIFEM 
workshops on arbitrary detention and impunity and arbitrary detention and women. 
</p>
<p>41. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has submitted <i>amicus curiae</i> briefs 
before national and international tribunals in cases where the provision of her expertise 
under her mandate may assist the court in dealing with human rights issues. Most recently, 
briefs related to the administration of justice were submitted in two jurisdictions. In June 
2008 a brief was filed in proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cambodia addressing 
fair trial issues under article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
A second brief was filed in August 2008 in proceedings before the Constitutional Court of 
Guatemala addressing the crime of enforced disappearance and its characteristics under 
international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>42. In 2008 OHCHR published an addendum to its joint publication <i>Human Rights in 
the Administration of Justice: A Manual on Human Rights for Judges, Prosecutors and 
</i></p>
<p>

 Resolution 2007/24. </p>

<p><i>Lawyers</i>, which was first published in 2003. The addendum covered major developments 
on human rights in the administration of justice from 2003 to 2007. The OHCHR series of 
rule-of-law tools for post-conflict States expanded to include publications on reparations 
programmes, the legacy of hybrid courts, amnesties, and national consultations on 
transitional justice. 
43. OHCHR has conducted a number of activities at the national level including training 
of judges, prosecutors, police, and lawyers on human rights in the administration of justice. 
In Timor-Leste, the Human Rights and Transitional Justice Section of the United Nations 
Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) supported a week-long training course on the 
protection of human rights in the judicial process for 14 future judges, prosecutors and 
public defenders. The training included material on fair trial guarantees and the rights of 
victims. In Colombia, OHCHR assisted the Supreme Court of Justice in the organization of 
national events to support the independence of the judiciary and visits by Colombian judges 
to other high courts in the Latin American region with a view to exchanging experiences on 
judicial investigations of human rights violations by armed groups. 
44. The protection of human rights in the administration of justice requires a sound 
legislative basis. OHCHR is regularly involved in providing support and advice to national 
law reform efforts with a view to improving compliance with international human rights 
standards. Following the ratification by Lebanon of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture (OPCAT) in late 2008, OHCHR assisted the Government in the formation 
of a Steering Committee of the Lebanese Ministry of Justice to draft a law to establish a 
national preventive mechanism as provided for under OPCAT. OHCHR, as a member of 
the Committee with consultative status, has been involved in the drafting of the proposed 
law. Similar assistance was provided in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia. 
</p>
<p>45. OHCHR works with a range of other actors, including judges, governments, civil 
society and United Nations agencies, to promote a jurisprudence of national courts which is 
in line with international human rights standards. In Cambodia, OHCHR has worked with 
UNICEF in the area of juvenile justice, particularly with the aim of reducing custodial 
sentences for persons under the age of 18, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. A landmark ruling by the country&#8217;s Constitutional Council in July 2007 
reaffirmed that courts should take into account the age of the perpetrator in order to impose 
lesser sentences. 
</p>
<p>46. A further means of promoting human rights protection is through the monitoring of 
the criminal justice system and the development of indicators to assess gaps in protection. 
With regard to the former, OHCHR regularly monitors places of detention and criminal 
trials at the national level. Systematic monitoring of the legal system in the context of 
United Nations Peace Operations is undertaken in partnership with the Rule of Law Units 
of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, on the basis of the OHCHR <i>Rule of Law 
Tools for Post-Conflict States: Monitoring legal systems</i>.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>47. <b>The developments and activities set out in this report illustrate the crucial role 
human rights protection plays in ensuring a fair and efficient system of administration 
of justice and the key role justice mechanisms play in ensuring respect for human 
rights. The long-standing interest of the United Nations and its Members in the role of 
human rights in the administration of justice continues and deepens, with the 
development of more detailed normative guidance, and a greater focus on 
implementation at the country level of existing human rights standards.  </b></p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-13137 
</p>
<p>48. <b>A number of challenges however remain, and new challenges arise. 
Implementation of the existing standards remains one of the greatest concerns. For 
example, the detention of children continues to be used as a routine response rather 
than as an option of last resort, leaving children exposed to a number of human rights 
violations including physical and sexual violence. The need for alternative solutions to 
the detention of children was one of the priority issues identified by the Interagency 
Panel on Juvenile Justice at its annual meeting in 2009, the other two being gender 
issues and social reintegration. The specific vulnerability of women in detention to 
human rights abuse has been highlighted in a number of forums, including the 
Human Rights Council, as being a challenge requiring urgent action.</b> 
</p>
<p>49. <b>The work of the treaty bodies and the special procedures also underscore 
ongoing lack of implementation of State obligations to ensure the independence of the 
judiciary, the complete prohibition on torture, the right to legal representation in 
criminal matters and the presumption of bail over the use of pretrial detention.</b>
