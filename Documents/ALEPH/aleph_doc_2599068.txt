1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Scott  Wilson  Roscoe  Postle  Associates  Inc.  (Scott  Wilson  RPA)  was  retained  by  Mr. 
Mark Petersen, Vice President, Exploration, of New Gold Inc. (New Gold), to prepare an 
independent  Technical  Report  and  Feasibility  Update  on  the  New  Afton  Cu-Au-Ag 
Project  (the  Project)  near  Kamloops,  British  Columbia,  Canada.    The  purpose  of  this 
report  is  to  support  the  public  disclosure  of  updated  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral 
Reserves  for  the  Project.    This  Technical  Report  conforms  to  NI  43-101  Standards  of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).  Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on 
September 3 and 4, 2009. 
 
New  Afton  is  a former  producer  which  operated an  open  pit  mine from  1977  to  1987.  
New Gold acquired an option on the New Afton property in 1999 and began exploration 
work  in  2000.    The  Project  is  in  the  development  stage  and  is  a  planned  11,000  tpd 
(nominal)  block  cave  operation  scheduled  to  commence  milling  in  mid-2012.    Copper 
and gold in concentrates will be produced at the Project.  Development commenced in 
2007 but, except for engineering and other limited activities, was halted due to the global 
economic  conditions  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008.    Underground  development 
recommenced in the first quarter of 2009 and was underway at the time of the site visit.  
Surface construction is scheduled to restart in 2011.
CONCLUSIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA has carried out an audit of the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimates for the New Afton Project, and makes the following conclusions:
•  The drilling has been conducted in a manner consistent with industry standards.
•  The  core  handling,  logging  and  sampling  have  been  carried  out  in  a  manner
consistent with industry standards.
•  Sampling  and  assaying  has  been  conducted  in  a  manner  appropriate  for  the
deposit type and mineralization, and using industry-standard practices.
•  Assay  quality  assurance/quality  control  (QA/QC)  protocols  are  consistent  with 
common industry standards, and no evidence of persistent or systematic errors 
has  been  found.    However,  the  QA/QC  has  been  inconsistently  monitored  and 
requires more timely review.

x  Density measurements are made in sufficient numbers and with an appropriate
methodology.
x  The database is generally free of serious errors, although several inconsistencies 
have  been  found.    At  the  time  of  writing,  a  new  database  system  was  being 
installed, which will implement more rigorous validation procedures.
x  The Mineral Resource estimate has been carried out using generally reasonable
assumptions and parameters, and accepted practices.
x  Geological  interpretation  has  resulted  in  improvements  to  the  understanding  of 
several  features  of  the  deposit,  particularly  the  faulting  and  the  De-mineralized 
Zone (DMZ).  However, interpretations of the mineralized zone boundaries have 
not been maintained, resulting in the implementation of a grade shell approach to 
constraining the grade interpolation.  In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, it would be 
preferable  to  base  the  resource  boundaries  on  lithological  and  mineralogical 
characteristics, if possible.
x  The updated Mineral Resource estimate is not materially different from the 2006 
estimate  used  in  the  Feasibility  Study  completed  by  Hatch  Ltd.  in  2007,  and 
should not result in a major change to the Mineral Reserves.
x  The assay database for deleterious elements has been markedly improved since 
the last estimate but still lags behind the economic elements in terms of numbers 
of samples and coverage.  Improvements could still be made to the block grade 
estimates for deleterious components.
x  The Mineral Resources should be quoted at a CuEq cut-off rather than a Cu cut-
off.
x  The  Mineral  Reserve  is  estimated  to  47.4  million  tonnes  of  Probable  Mineral
Reserves grading 0.95% Cu, 0.69 g/t Au, and 2.03 g/t Ag.
x  The  Mineral  Reserves  are  considered  to  be  amenable  to  underground  mining
through the use of block caving at a production rate of 4 Mtpa of ore.
x  The preproduction capital cost is estimated to be C$460.9 million plus sustaining
capital of $172.3 million and not including sunk expenditures.
x  The estimated Life of Mine (LOM) operating cost is C$17.27 per tonne milled.
x  Considering the Project on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted after-tax cash 
flow  totals  C$707  million  over  the  mine  life,  and  simple  payback  occurs 
approximately 4.5 years after the start of production.
x  The Total Cash Cost is US$0.84 per pound of copper.   The mine life capital unit 
cost is US$0.69 per pound of copper and the byproduct credits are US$0.89 per 
pound of copper, for a Total Production Cost of US$0.64 per pound of copper.  
Average annual production during operation is 72 million pounds of copper and 
76,000 ounces of gold.

  The after-tax net present value (NPV) at a 5% discount rate is C$374 million, and
the internal rate of return (IRR) is 19%.
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA makes the following recommendations:
  Based  upon  the  assumptions  and  estimates  within  this  study,  the  continued
development of the Project is recommended.
  Database validation protocols should be enhanced and rigorously observed.
  Geological  interpretation  and  wireframing  should  continue  with  focus  on  the 
zones  of  mineralization,  in  order  to  improve  the  constraints  to  the  grade 
interpolations.    If  possible,  the  grade  shell  should  be  replaced  by  wireframes 
based on geological characteristics.
  The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  should  be  quoted  at  a  0.4%  CuEq  cut-off.
Changing the cut-off does not materially affect the Mineral Reserves.
  Analytical  work  on  the  deleterious  elements  should  continue  in  order  to  allow
improvements to be made to the block models for these components.
  The review of the project execution plan which is currently underway should be 
continued and completed including incorporation of all of the modifications since 
completion of the 2007 Feasibility Study.
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
A  Cash  Flow  Projection  has  been  generated  from  the  LOM  production  schedule  and 
capital and operating cost estimates, and is summarized in Table 1-1.  A summary of the 
key criteria is provided below. 
 
ECONOMIC CRITERIA

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 
Considering  the  Project  on  a  stand-alone  basis,  the  undiscounted  after-tax  cash  flow 
totals C$707 million over the mine life, and simple payback occurs after approximately 
4.5 years.
The Total Cash Cost is US$0.84 per pound of copper.   The mine life capital unit cost is 
US$0.69  per  pound  of  copper  and  the  byproduct  credits  are  US$0.89  per  pound  of 
copper, for a Total Production Cost of US$0.64 per pound of copper.  Average annual 
production during operation is 72 M pounds of copper and 76,000 ounces of gold.
The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate is C$374 million, and the IRR is 19%.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic 
risks were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:
x  Metal prices 
x  Operating costs (Total Cash Cost) 
x  Capital costs
The  after-tax  5%  NPV  sensitivity  over  the  base  case  has been  calculated  for  -20%  to 
+20% variations.  The sensitivities are shown in Figure 1-1 and Table 1-2.  The Project is 
most sensitive to metal price and less sensitive to capital and operating costs, which are 
almost equally sensitive.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The New Afton Project is located at Latitude 50°39’ north and Longitude 120°31’ west, 
approximately 350 km northeast of Vancouver and 10 km west of the City of Kamloops, 
in the South-Central Interior of British Columbia.  Trans-Canada Highway No. 1 passes 
through the middle of the Afton mining lease several kilometres west of its junction with 
the Coquihalla Highway No. 5.  Access to the mine site is by a mine road located off of 
the Trans-Canada Highway.  
 
New Gold’s holdings in the Project area comprise two groups, Afton and Ajax.  The New 
Afton  deposit  lies  within  the  Afton  Group.    The  Afton  Group  consists  of  44  mineral 
claims, a portion of which have been surveyed and are included in a mining lease issued 
on November 9, 2006.  Total area of all claims and the lease is 7,352.7 ha.   
 
New Gold holds surface rights on approximately 4,300 acres surrounding the New Afton 
Project, purchased from subsidiaries of Teck Resources Limited (Teck) on October 25, 
2007.  The terms of the purchase agreement provide title to fee simple land, a covenant 
to obtain a release of grazing leases, and access to surface improvements, including a 
water pipeline to the site from Kamloops Lake. 
 
HISTORY 
Exploration  in  the  Afton area  began  in the mid-1800s,  as  prospectors  pushed  into the 
interior of British Columbia following the Fraser and Caribou gold rushes.  The Iron Mask 
property,  staked  in  1896,  was  the  first  in  the  Kamloops  district.    The  Afton  property 
claims were staked over the Pothook workings in 1949.  This was followed by sporadic, 
and  largely  unsuccessful,  exploration  work  by  a  number  of  parties  through  the  1950s 
and 1960s.   
 
In  1970,  a  private  company  called  Afton  Mines  Ltd.  (Afton  Mines)  obtained  a  drill 
intersection of 170 ft of 0.4% Cu from what ultimately became the Afton deposit.  For the 
next three years, over 150,000 ft of drilling was carried out by a number of operators.   
 
Teck  Corporation  and  Iso  Mines  Ltd.  bought  acquired  the  Afton  property  in  1973,  and 
initiated  engineering  and  metallurgical  studies.    A  production  decision  was  taken  in

October 1975, with production commencing at the Afton open pit mine in late 1977.  At 
the start of production, the reserves were 34 million tons grading 1% Cu, 0.016 oz/ton 
Au, and 0.12 oz/ton Ag (30.8 million tonnes grading 1% Cu, 0.58 g/t Au, and 4.2 g/t Ag).  
Mining took place on the property at the Afton, Crescent, Pothook, and Ajax pits.  The 
mine closed in 1991, reopened again in 1994, closing finally in 1997.   
 
In 1999, the Afton mining leases expired and the ground was staked by two geologists. 
Later that year, DRC Resources Corporation (DRC) acquired an option on the property, 
surrounded  it  with  additional  staking,  and  carried  out  surface  drilling  in  the  New  Afton 
deposit. 
 
In  February  2001,  DRC  completed  a  Scoping  Study  based  on  drilling  results  to  date.  
Further  definition  drilling  was  recommended 
the 
mineralization.  An Advanced Scoping Study completed in February 2004 contemplated 
an underground mine, using a block caving method, feeding a conventional flotation mill 
operating at a rate of 9,000 tpd.  Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were 68.7 
million tonnes grading 1.08% Cu, 0.85 g/t Au, and 2.62 g/t Ag.  
 
In  late  2004,  a  portal  was  collared  on  the  south  wall  of  the  Afton  pit,  and  1,915  m  of 
decline and drift were driven to provide access for definition drilling and bulk sampling of 
the deposit.  Diamond drilling, both from surface and underground, has been carried out 
more or less continuously up to the time of writing of this report.  At the cut-off date for 
the 2006 Mineral Resource estimate, the total amount of diamond drilling was 84,755 m 
in 182 holes. 
 
DRC  underwent  a  name  change  to  New  Gold  Inc.  in  May  2005.    New  Gold 
commissioned  a  Feasibility  Study  from  Hatch  Ltd.  in  2005.    The  study,  completed  in 
2007, contemplated a block cave mine and conventional grinding/flotation mill operation 
with  a  daily  throughput  of  11,000  tonnes.    Mineral  Reserves  comprised  44.4  million 
tonnes in the Probable category grading 0.98% Cu, 0.72 g/t Au, and 2.27 g/t Ag.  Mine 
life was estimated to be 12 years, with preproduction capital costs of $268 million and 
Life of Mine (LOM) sustaining capital of $215 million

Exploration  drilling  during  2006-2007  resulted  in  the  discovery  of  the  C  Zone  located 
below the main body of mineralization.   
 
At  the  time  of  writing  of  this  report,  underground  development  was  underway,  the  mill 
building had been erected with exterior cladding installed, and mill foundations had been 
poured.    Surface  construction  was  suspended  until  late  2010,  and  underground 
development was expected to be completed in 2012.   
 
GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
The Afton area is underlain primarily by rocks of the Upper to Lower Palaeozoic Quesnel 
Terrane,  a  package  of  island-arc  sedimentary  rocks,  volcanic  assemblages  and 
associated intrusive phases.  Quesnel Terrane was accreted onto the North American 
continental  margin  during  the  Early  to  Mid-Jurassic  and  is  distributed  throughout  the 
entire length of British Columbia.  It forms part of the Intermontane Belt, which is host to 
many porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposits including Copper Mountain, Afton, Highland Valley, 
Mount Polley, Gibraltar, Kemess, and Galore Creek.  
 
In  the  immediate  Project  area,  the  Quesnel  Terrane  comprises  Late  Triassic  to  Early 
Jurassic Nicola Group island-arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks and coeval alkalic to 
subalkalic intrusions of the Iron Mask batholith. 
 
The  New  Afton  deposit  is  hosted  within  the  Cherry  Creek  member  of  the  Iron  Mask 
batholith complex.  The Iron Mask complex is a multi-phase plutonic body exposed in a 
southeast-trending belt measuring 34 km long by 5 km wide.  The Cherry Creek phase is 
a partially fault-bounded body trending east-northeast through the deposit area, curving 
to east side of the property to a more southeasterly trend.  At Afton, the Cherry Creek 
intrusive is a variably and multiply brecciated assemblage of porphyritic and equigranular 
monzonite-monzodiorite.  Cherry Creek rocks include fine- to medium-grained pyroxene-
hornblende  monzodiorite  and  fine-grained  biotite-monzonite,  varying  to  more  dioritic 
composition,  and  minor  syenite.    The  principal  host  phase  of  the  Cherry  Creek  is  a 
magnetic fine-  to  medium-grained  porphyritic  pyroxene-hornblende  monzodiorite  which 
forms a wedge of intrusive breccia between the Nicola and Pothook rocks.  Contacts to 
the  west  and  southwest  are  with  Nicola  Group  volcanic  rocks  and  to  the  east  and 
southeast with the Pothook diorite.

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
The Project area is traversed by regional-scale fault zones which are believed to be the 
principal  control  to  intrusion  of  the  batholithic  rocks,  as  well  as  the  mineralization 
processes.    North-  to  northwest-trending  steep  to  moderate-dipping  fault  zones  are 
primary  controlling  structures  for  emplacement  of  the  Iron  Mask  intrusives.    East-  to 
northeast-trending 
to  hydrothermal  alteration  and 
mineralization.    The  faulting  and  associated  fracturing  also  provided  conduits  for 
meteoric  waters,  which  gave  rise  to  weathering  and  supergene  enrichment  of  the 
primary sulphide mineralization. 
 
A steeply dipping body of serpentinized and sheared picrite has been entrained within 
the Hanging Wall Fault, a major structural control to the New Afton deposit.  This unit 
separates  strongly  mineralized,  pyrite-poor,  potassically  altered  monzodiorite  to  the 
northwest 
the 
southeast.  Ground conditions within the picrite are poor, which has hampered efforts to 
drill  through  it.    As  a  result,  drill  information  on  the  hanging  wall  side  of  the  picrite  is 
limited.  
 
The  bulk  of  the  deposit  occupies  a  large  tabular  mass  measuring  900  m  long  by 
approximately  100  m  wide  and  spanning  a  vertical  distance  of  approximately  350  m.  
The zone dips vertically to steeply south-southeast and plunges at moderate angles to 
the southwest.  Two subsidiary satellite bodies occur to the northeast of the Main Zone.  
One of these zones appears to branch off of the Main Zone and strikes in a somewhat 
more easterly trend, dipping steeply to the south-southeast.  The other, which is further 
away from the Main Zone has a similar strike to the Main Zone but dips at a flatter angle 
(approximately 60° southeast). 
 
The  deposit  is  porphyry-style,  with  very  distinct  structural  controls.    The  primary 
mineralizing  event  was  preceded  by  development  of  disseminated  magnetite-pyrite.  
Primary  economic  sulphide  mineralization  occurred  in  association  with  potassic 
alteration  (principally  K-spar)  resulting  in  destruction  of  the  earlier  magnetite-pyrite 
assemblage.    Following  this,  carbonate  veinlets  (principally  ankerite)  developed  along 
and  surrounding  the  faults,  along  with  varying  amounts  of  pyrite,  clay  gouge,  and 
sericite.

Subsequent faulting reshuffled portions of the deposit in a manner that is not completely 
understood.  This has resulted in truncation of the zone along the Hanging Wall Fault in 
places, and apparent displacement of mineralized blocks.  These blocks may occur as 
isolated  pods  in  the  hanging  wall  or  may  also  be  situated  adjacent  to  the  Main  Zone 
such that they appear to comprise a continuous body of mineralization crossing the fault. 
 
DRILLING 
All drilling completed to date on the Project has been diamond core drilling, conducted in 
a series of programs over a period spanning 2000 to 2008.  Most of the drilling has been 
for  exploration  and  resource  definition.    However,  in  recent  years  (2007  and  later), 
geotechnical holes have been drilled for groundwater monitoring and collection of data 
for mine design.  To date, 277 holes have been drilled for a total of 130,439 m. 
 
MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
Scott Wilson  RPA  carried  out  an  audit  of  the  most  recent  Mineral  Resource  estimate, 
which was prepared by Norwest Corporation (Norwest) in September 2009. 
 
The Norwest Mineral Resource estimate is shown in Table 1-3.

As part of the audit, Scott Wilson RPA prepared an independent estimate for Cu, Au, Ag, 
and Pd and compared it to the Norwest estimate.  A new probability shell was derived 
from an independently generated set of kriging parameters.  This shell was then used to

assign domains to the blocks and composites.  Geostatistical analyses were carried out 
to  derive  variogram  models,  which  were  somewhat  different  from  those  generated  by 
Norwest.  Capping, search parameters, and classification criteria were kept the same as 
for the original models.   
 
There  is  very  little  difference  between  the  Norwest  and  Scott  Wilson  RPA  estimates, 
which,  in  Scott  Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  provides  additional  validation  of  the  Norwest 
model.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  also  notes  that  the  global  estimate  appears  to  be  quite 
insensitive to variations in either the probability shell or the variogram models. 
 
Scott  Wilson  RPA  recommends  reporting  the  Mineral  Resources  at  a  CuEq  cut-off  of 
0.4%  CuEq.    The  Cu-equivalence  calculation  incorporates  the  value  of  the  Au  in  the 
overall value of the resource body.  In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, a 0.4% CuEq cut-off 
is  supported  by  the  present  financial  model  for  the  mine.    Table  1-4  summarizes  the 
Mineral Resources estimate at the 0.4% CuEq cut-off.

MINING 
The New Afton deposit is being developed as a block cave mining operation to produce 
4 Mtpa of copper-gold ore for processing in a flotation plant for the recovery of copper in 
concentrates  and  gold  in  concentrates.    Underground  development  is  underway  using 
New  Gold  crews  which  replaced  the  mining  contractor  crews  and  commenced 
development in February 2009.  There is supporting infrastructure at the site including 
access, offices, staff, equipment, and a concrete batch plant.  The new mill building has 
been  erected  and  the grinding  mills  are mechanically  installed.    No  significant  surface 
construction was underway at the time of the site visit and the focus is on underground 
development  and  project  planning  and  engineering.    This  report  considers  the 
development of the Project from the end of the second quarter of 2009 onwards.  
 
Engineering  studies  have  indicated  that  the  New  Afton  deposit  is  amenable  to  block 
caving  and  the  Mineral  Reserves  have  been  estimated  through  the  application  of 
Gemcom’s  block  cave  modelling  software  (PCBC)  to  determine  the  mine  production 
schedules.  The deposit has been broken into three zones, B1, B2, and B3.  The B1 and 
B2 blocks are closer to surface and will provide the initial mine production.  Both the B1 
and  B2  blocks  are  expected  to  cave  readily.    The  B3  block  is  deeper  and  the  rock  is 
more competent so that caving is marginal and it may be necessary to implement some 
additional work to assist the cave development.

The B1 and B2 block undercut is approximately 120 m above the B3 undercut.  At each 
block  an  undercut  will  be  developed  along  with  an  extraction  level.    At  the  extraction 
level, drawpoints will be developed on a 13 m spacing.  Ore will be mucked by load-haul-
dump  (LHD)  units  and  hauled  to  ore  passes  to drop  to  a tramming  level  14  m  below, 
from where the ore will be trammed by large LHDs to the crusher.  Ore from the B3 block 
will be hauled by 50-tonne truck to the crusher level.  From the crusher the ore will be 
conveyed to the mill via a 4.5 km long conveyor system. 
 
The mine is accessed by two portals for development, one in the open pit and the other 
being the conveyor portal near the mill.  With the subsidence due to caving, the drift from 
the  open  pit  will  be  lost  and  the  secondary  exit  will  be  by  conveyance  in  a  ventilation 
borehole. 
 
MINERAL PROCESSING 
The New Afton mill has been designed to process 11,000 tpd, or 4 Mtpa, of ore at full 
capacity and recover copper, gold, and silver. 
 
The mill will process a blend of primary, transition, and supergene ores. The process will 
utilize conventional crushing, grinding, and concentration processes to separate valuable 
minerals from gangue into concentrates at marketable grades. Mineral separation will be 
achieved  by  gravity  concentration  and  differential  flotation.  A  regrinding  stage  will  be 
included in the flotation circuit.  
 
The tailings handling system will pump the combined tailings (from the rougher flotation 
circuit and the cleaner scavenger circuit) to the Cyclone Plant, a set of primary cyclones 
located adjacent to the tailings storage facility (TSF).   
 
The  cyclone  underflow  product  will  be  delivered  to  a  skid-mounted  secondary  cyclone 
pack  located  on  the  top  of  the  tailings  dam.  The  sand  or  coarse  fraction  from  these 
secondary cyclones will be used to construct the tailings dam and the secondary cyclone 
overflow product will be used to seal the wet side of that dam. A centreline construction 
method will be used to establish the tailings dam structure. There will be three seepage 
collection  ponds  below  the  dry  side  of  the  main  tailings  dam  to  recover  and  return 
seepage back to the TSF.

ENVIRONMENTAL
Much of the Project area has been greatly altered such that natural undulating has been 
replaced by level rock dumps, open pits, and severely compacted borrow areas.  The 
dominant water bodies are now related to mining-related impoundments.  The baseline 
environmental  studies  undertaken  considered  both  the  natural  and  anthropogenic 
landscapes.    Environmental  baseline  studies  were  undertaken  on  the  Project  site 
between  April  and  December  2006.    All  baseline  studies  were  implemented  in 
accordance  with  provincial  data  collection  guidelines  where  applicable,  and  generally 
accepted scientific procedures.
On October 31, 2007, the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (MEMPR) 
issued  Mine  Permit  M229  approving  the  work  system  and  reclamation  program  in 
respect  of  the  New  Afton  Project.    The  Mine  Permit  obligates  the  New  Gold  to  post 
reclamation  security  in  the  aggregate  amount  of  $9.5  million.  The  initial  installment  of 
$3.5 million was posted by the New Gold.
New Gold has entered into an agreement with local First Nations to pay a royalty on the 
value of the product with a set minimum annual royalty.
CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
The remaining preproduction capital budget for the Project is C$460.9 million in Q2 2009 
Canadian  dollars.    Sunk  costs  are  not  included  in  the  capital  summary.    Capital  cost 
estimates  have  been  prepared  by  AMEC,  New  Gold,  and  AMC  Mining  Consultants 
(Canada) (AMC) in the course of the detailed engineering work which was being done by 
AMEC until mid-2009.
Capital cost estimate revisions and adjustments continue as Project optimization tasks 
are still underway.  The mine capital costs are built up from first principles for the mine 
development  activities  together  with  quotations  for  major  equipment  items.    The 
sustaining capital estimate for the life of the mine is C$172.3 million.
The life of mine operating cost is estimated to be C$17.27 per tonne milled.  The costs 
do  not  include  concentrate  shipping  or  treatment,  nor  do  they  include  corporate 
overheads.  Operating costs have been compiled by New Gold and AMC.  The costs for 
all areas were built up from first principles with a high level of detail in the cost build-up.

PROJECT EXECUTION PLAN 
Development of the New Afton Project is underway, with the underground development 
being  undertaken  by  company  crews.    A  Project  team  is  in  place  with  administrative, 
technical (geology, mine and mill) and mine development personnel on staff.  There are 
also engineering consultants supporting the group. 
 
The current Project schedule is not in a finished form; this is an aspect of the Project 
planning  which  Scott  Wilson  RPA  recommends  be  addressed 
to  generate  a 
comprehensive Project development schedule including all of the changes in the Project 
since the 2007 Feasibility Study.   
 
Mine  development  is  scheduled  to  continue  until  and  after  the  commencement  of 
production.  The development of the B3 zone has been deferred to reduce the upfront 
capital costs.  Mill construction is forecast to recommence at the start of 2011, with the 
mill planned to be in commissioning mode in Q2 of 2012 and operating at the start of Q3 
2012. 
 
New  Gold  will  continue  to  use  AMEC  for  engineering  and  procurement,  but  will  do 
construction  management  for  the  remaining  mill  construction  packages  with  its  own 
team, led by a recently hired construction manager.

2 INTRODUCTION 
Scott  Wilson  Roscoe  Postle  Associates  Inc.  (Scott  Wilson  RPA)  was  retained  by  Mr. 
Mark Petersen, Vice President, Exploration, of New Gold Inc. (New Gold), to prepare an 
independent  Technical  Report  and  Feasibility  Update  on  the  New  Afton  Cu-Au-Ag-Pd 
Project  (the  Project)  near  Kamloops,  British  Columbia,  Canada.    The  purpose  of  this 
report  is  to  support  the  public  disclosure  of  updated  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral 
Reserves  for  the  Project.    This  Technical  Report  conforms  to  NI  43-101  Standards  of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).  Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on 
September 3 and 4, 2009. 
 
New  Gold  is  a  publicly  traded  mining  company,  focused  on  gold  production,  with 
operations in the United States, Mexico, and Australia.  New Gold’s corporate offices are 
located in Vancouver, British Columbia and Toronto, Ontario. The company is listed on 
Toronto (TSX:NGD) and New York (NYSE: AMEX) stock exchanges.   
 
New  Afton  is  a former  producer  which  operated an  open  pit  mine from  1977  to  1987.  
New Gold acquired an option on the New Afton property in 1999 and began exploration 
work  in  2000.    The  Project  is  in  the  development  stage  and  is  a  planned  11,000  tpd 
(nominal)  block  cave  operation  scheduled  to  commence  milling  in  mid-2012.    Copper 
and  gold  concentrates  will  be  produced  at  the  Project.    Development  commenced  in 
2007 but, except for engineering and other limited activities, was halted due to the global 
economic  conditions  in  the  third  quarter  of  2008.    Underground  development  was 
underway at the time of the site visit and surface construction is scheduled to restart in 
2010.   
 
Currently, the major assets and facilities associated with the Project are:

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The New Afton Project is located at Latitude 50°39’ north and Longitude 120°31’ west, 
approximately 350 km northeast of Vancouver and 10 km west of the City of Kamloops, 
in the South-Central Interior of British Columbia (Figure 4-1).  New Gold’s holdings in the 
Project area comprise two groups, Afton and Ajax.  The New Afton deposit lies within the 
Afton Group.  The Afton Group consists of 44 mineral claims that have been converted 
to the new grid staking system (Figure 4-2).  A list of these claims is provided in Table 4-
1.  A portion of the Afton claims have been surveyed and are included in a mining lease, 
which was issued on November 9, 2006 (Figure 4-2).  Total area of all claims and the 
lease is 7,352.7 ha.   
 
The  project  survey  control  is  based  on  the  Universal  Transverse  Mercator  (UTM) 
coordinate  system.    It  is  based  on  the  Zone  10  North  projection,  using  the  World 
Geodetic  System  1984  (WGS’84)  datum.    The  UTM  coordinates  place  the  New  Afton 
project at 5,614,800N and 675,500E at a surface elevation of 700 MASL.
LAND TENURE 
New Gold holds surface rights for approximately 4,300 acres surrounding the New Afton 
Project, purchased from subsidiaries of Teck Resources Limited (Teck) on October 25, 
2007.  The terms of the purchase agreement provide title to fee simple land, a covenant 
to obtain a release of grazing leases, and access to surface improvements, including a 
water pipeline to the site from Kamloops Lake. 
 
Reclamation permits covering the existing pits, plant facility and tailings pond, issued by 
the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines, are held in the name of the previous 
operator, Teck. 
 
Under an Option to Purchase Agreement (“the Option”) dated September 22, 1999, DRC 
Resources  Corporation  (DRC),  the  predecessor  company  to  New  Gold,  acquired  the 
exclusive right for 90 days to purchase a 100% undivided working interest in the Afton 1 
– 11 (the “Original Claims”) as to 50% from Westridge Enterprises Ltd., a non-reporting 
British Columbia company wholly owned by John H. Kruzick, a director of DRC, and as

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
to  50%  from  Indo-Gold  Development  Ltd.,  a  non-reporting  British  Columbia  company 
owned by John Ball, a geologist (the “Optionors”).  The Option provided for consideration 
to be a 10% Net Profit Royalty (NPR) and a property management agreement with the 
Optionors.    The  terms  of  the  agreement  required  a  series  of  payments  in  shares  and 
expenditure, totalling 2 million shares and $6.5 million in expenditures over a nine year 
time frame.  The payments and work expenditures have been completed as required and 
New Gold now owns the property subject to a 10% NPR. 
 
On June 27, 2002, New Gold acquired an option exercisable on or before December 1, 
2010, to purchase the Optionors’ 10% NPR for a cash consideration of $2 million and 
the Option was amended by removing the exclusive right of the Optionors to act as the 
operators of the New Afton Cu-Au Project.  In addition to the Original Claims, New Gold 
has staked other claims for its own account to consolidate its land position at the Project.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
The  New  Afton  Project  is  located  350  km  northeast  of  Vancouver  and  10  km  west  of 
Kamloops, British Columbia, in the South-Central Interior of British Columbia, on the site 
of the past producing Afton Mine, a previous operation of Teck.  The Project is located 
on the south side of the Thompson River Valley.  Trans-Canada Highway No. 1 passes, 
several kilometres west of its junction with the  Coquihalla Highway No. 5, through the 
middle of the Afton mining lease.  Access to the mine site is by a mine road located off of 
the Trans-Canada Highway.
CLIMATE 
The Kamloops area is in the rain shadow of the Coast Mountains.  Precipitation is minor, 
averaging about 257 mm annually (of which 175 mm is rainfall), with light winter snow 
and  infrequent  rain  in  the  spring  and  fall.    The  area  has  warm  summers  where 
temperatures  can  reach  38°C  and  cool  winters  where  temperatures  hover  around  the 
freezing  mark.    During  the  winter,  short  periods  of  cold  weather  can  occur  where 
temperatures drop to as low as -29°C.
LOCAL RESOURCES 
Kamloops  is  a  major  transportation  hub  for  highway,  air,  and  railroad.    Forestry, 
ranching,  mining,  and  tourism  are  the  most  important  economic  activities  in  the  area.  
The  city  has  an  airport  with  daily  air  service  from  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  and 
Calgary,  Alberta,  and  is  serviced  by  both  Canadian  National  and  Canadian  Pacific 
Railways.  Kamloops is a natural resource-based city of 80,000 people.  The area has a 
ready supply of trained workers and professionals and has suppliers and contractors to 
support heavy industry.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
BC Hydro transmission lines, a Terasen natural gas pipeline, and a Pembina oil pipeline 
traverse  the  mining  lease  north  of  the  Afton  pit.    A  water  pipeline  approximately  four 
kilometres in length can deliver fresh water from Kamloops Lake to the mine site.  New 
Gold purchased the pipeline and pump house facilities from Teck as part of the purchase 
agreement in 2007.  New Gold has obtained a temporary water permit and applied for a 
permanent water permit to withdraw  water from Kamloops Lake for mining and milling 
operations.   
 
The surface and underground infrastructure at the New Afton Project includes:
•  Site access from the Trans-Canada Highway which is immediately adjacent
to the site.
•  Underground  mine  workings  a  conveyor  gallery,  a  second  access  from  the
open pit, and ventilation raises to surface.
•  Facilities  providing  basic  infrastructure  to  the  site  including  electric  power,
water supply, communications, and mine offices.
•  An  underground  mobile  equipment  fleet  and  support  facilities  at  both  the
upper, conveyor gallery portal and the portal in the open pit.
•  Dewatering  facilities  for  pumping  from  the  open  pit  to  a  storage  area  in
Pothook Lake, which has been bermed to increase its volume.
•  Construction support equipment including a concrete batch plant and trucks
for the delivery of concrete and surface support equipment.
•  Engineering and administration offices, mine dry and first aid facilities. 
 
•  A  new  concentrator  building  with  the  SAG  mill,  ball  mill  and  vertical  mill
mechanically installed.
•  A partially cleared and prepared tailings storage facility.
The old Teck concentrator building remains in its location on the east side of the open 
pit, but the New Afton facilities are located to the west of the pit.  Similarly, the old Teck 
tailings storage area remains on site but is not planned for use by New Gold.  Both the 
concentrator building and tailings pond are on land owned by others.

PHYSIOGRAPHY  
The landscape is characterized by hilly, till-covered, drumlinoidal terrain and dispersed, 
small, alkaline water bodies.  Relief adjacent to Kamloops Lake is a few hundred metres 
or more.  The most significant topographic features within the mining lease are the Afton 
and  Pothook  open  pits  and  the  reclaimed  waste  rock  dumps  of  the  Afton  Operating 
Corporation, the former operator.  Kamloops Lake is located north of the mining lease 
and  bisects  the  Afton  mineral  tenure.    Vegetation  consists  of  open  grasslands  and 
sparse pine forests as a consequence of a continental, semi-arid climate.

6 HISTORY 
Exploration  in  the  Afton area  began  in the mid-1800s,  as  prospectors  pushed  into the 
interior of British Columbia following the Fraser and Caribou gold rushes.  The Iron Mask 
property, staked in 1896, was the first in the Kamloops district.  A 100 ft shaft was sunk 
on  the  Pothook  deposit  in  1898.    Mining  was  carried  out  from  the  turn  of  the  century 
through until 1927 at several gold, copper, and silver mines including the Pothook, Iron 
King,  Copper  King,  and  Iron  Mask.    The  Afton  property  claims  were  staked  over  the 
Pothook workings in 1949 by Axel Bergland.  This was followed by sporadic, and largely 
unsuccessful, exploration work by a number of parties through the 1950s and 1960s.   
 
Mr. Chester Millar acquired the property in the mid-1960s and formed a private company 
called Afton Mines Ltd. (Afton Mines) to carry out exploration work.  In 1970, Afton Mines 
obtained a drill intersection of 170 ft of 0.4% Cu from what ultimately became the Afton 
deposit.  For the next three years, over 150,000 ft of drilling was carried out by a number 
of operators.  Duval Corporation and Quintana Minerals took options on the property in 
1970 but dropped them in 1971.  They were followed in 1972 by Canex Placer.  Also in 
1972, Teck Corporation and Iso Mines Ltd. (Iso) purchased an equity interest in Afton 
Mines.   
 
Teck  and  Iso  bought  Canex  Placer’s  interest  for  $4.0  million  in  1973,  and  initiated 
engineering  and  metallurgical  studies.    A  production  decision  was  taken  in  October 
1975, with production commencing at the Afton open pit mine in late 1977.  At the start 
of production, the reserves were 34 million tons grading 1% Cu, 0.016 oz/ton Au, and 
0.12 oz/ton Ag (30.8 million tonnes grading 1% Cu, 0.58 g/t Au, and 4.2 g/t Ag).  Mining 
took place on the property at the Afton, Crescent, Pothook, and Ajax pits.   The mine 
closed in 1991, reopened again in 1994, closing finally in 1997.   
 
Five deep diamond drill holes, drilled in 1980 below and to the southwest of the Afton pit, 
pierced what is now referred to as the New Afton deposit.  Teck carried out a study to 
determine the feasibility of mining this zone from underground, but shelved the Project.

In 1999, the Afton mining leases expired and the ground was staked by Westridge Ltd., 
and Indogold Development Ltd.  DRC Resources Corporation (DRC) acquired an option 
on  the  property  and  surrounded  it  with  additional  staking.    The  following  year,  DRC 
began exploration work with 9,320 m of surface diamond drilling in 21 NQ holes in the 
New Afton deposit. 
 
In  February  2001,  DRC  completed  a  Scoping  Study  based  on  drilling  results  to  date.  
The  Scoping  Study  indicated that the  New  Afton  deposit  could  be  profitably  exploited, 
and  this  led  to  further  definition  drilling  to  confirm  the  continuity  of  the  mineralization.  
The successful conclusion of this phase of exploration led to the commissioning of an 
Advanced  Scoping  Study  in  2003  and  completed  in  February  2004  (Behre  Dolbear, 
2004).    The  study  contemplated  an  underground  mine,  using  a  block  caving  method, 
feeding  a  conventional  flotation  mill  operating  at  a  rate  of  9,000  tpd.    Measured  and 
Indicated  Mineral  Resources  were  68.7 million  tonnes  grading  1.08%  Cu,  0.85 g/t  Au, 
and 2.62 g/t Ag.  The report estimated an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) for the 
Project of 19.9%, with a payback of capital in 3.7 years. 
 
In  late  2004,  a  portal  was  collared  on  the  south  wall  of  the  Afton  pit,  and  1,915  m  of 
decline and drift were driven to provide access for definition drilling and bulk sampling of 
the  deposit.    The  drifting  was  completed  by  September  2005.    Diamond  drilling,  both 
from surface and underground, has been carried out more or less continuously up to the 
time of writing of this report.  At the cut-off date for the 2006 Mineral Resource estimate, 
the total amount of diamond drilling was 84,755 m in 182 holes. 
 
DRC  underwent  a  name  change  to  New  Gold  Inc.  in  May  2005.    Total  exploration 
expenditures  on  the  New  Afton  Project  by  DRC  and  New  Gold  to  the  end  of  the  3rd 
quarter of 2006 were C$37.2 million. 
 
New Gold commissioned a Feasibility Study for the Project at the end of 2005, and the 
results of this study were released in April 2007 (Hatch, 2007).  The study contemplated 
a  block  cave  mine  and  conventional  grinding/flotation  mill  operation  with  a  daily 
throughput  of  11,000  tonnes.    Mineral  Reserves  comprised  44.4  million  tonnes  in  the 
Probable  category  grading  0.98%  Cu,  0.72  g/t  Au,  and  2.27  g/t  Ag.    Mine  life  was 
estimated  to  be  12  years,  with  preproduction  capital  costs  of  $268  million  and  Life  of

Mine  (LOM)  sustaining  capital  of  $215  million.    Pre-tax  IRR,  using  base-case  metal 
prices  of  US$2.01/lb  Cu,  US$487/oz  Au,  and  US$8.54/oz  Ag,  was  estimated  to  be 
13.6%. 
 
Also  during  the  period  2006-07,  exploration  drilling  resulted  in  the  discovery  of  the  C 
Zone located below the main body of mineralization.  
 
At  the  time  of  writing  of  this  report,  underground  development  was  underway,  the  mill 
building  had  been  erected  with  exterior  cladding  installed,  mill  foundations  had  been 
poured,  and  the  SAG  Mill,  Ball  Mill  and  Verti-Mill  installed.    Surface  construction  was 
suspended  until  late  2010,  and  underground  development  was  expected  to  be 
completed  in  2012.    This  concept  will  allow  the  mill  to  be  completed  in  time  for  the 
underground to deliver ore at the mill’s rated capacity of 11,000 tpd.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
The Afton area is underlain primarily by rocks of the Upper to Lower Palaeozoic Quesnel 
Terrane,  a  package  of  island-arc  sedimentary  rocks,  volcanic  assemblages  and 
associated intrusive phases.  Quesnel Terrane was accreted onto the North American 
continental  margin  during  the  Early  to  Mid-Jurassic,  and  is  distributed  throughout  the 
entire length of British Columbia.  It forms part of the Intermontane Belt, which is host to 
many porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposits including Copper Mountain, Afton, Highland Valley, 
Mount Polley, Gibraltar, Kemess, and Galore Creek.  
 
In  the  immediate  Project  area,  the  Quesnel  Terrane  comprises  Late  Triassic  to  Early 
Jurassic Nicola Group island-arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and coeval alkalic to 
subalkalic intrusions of the Iron Mask batholith (Figure 7-1).  The Nicola Group consists 
of submarine and subaerial volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Volcanic components are 
intermediate to basic flows, with associated breccias and volcaniclastic units.  The Nicola 
Group rocks have been regionally metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies.   
 
Intruding the Nicola Group are Iron Mask diorite, monzodiorite, and monzonite plutons 
occurring along a northwest trend.  Four principal phases of the Iron Mask batholith have 
been  identified  and  these  are  the  Pothook  phase  agmatite  intrusion  breccia,  Pothook 
diorite, Cherry Creek Suite monzodiorite to monzonite, and Sugarloaf diorite.  Near the 
margins  of  the  Iron  Mask  batholith,  Nicola  Group  rocks  have  been  thermally 
metamorphosed  to  hornfels.   The Iron  Mask  intrusive  rocks  are  the  principal  hosts for 
Cu-Au-Ag mineralization at New Afton. 
 
Post-mineralization  Middle  Eocene  volcanic  and  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Kamloops 
Group unconformably overlie the Nicola and Iron Mask units.  These rocks were partially 
responsible for shielding the New Afton deposit from removal by erosion and glaciation. 
 
The Project area is traversed by regional-scale fault zones which are believed to be the 
principal  control  to  intrusion  of  the  batholithic  rocks,  as  well  as  the  mineralization 
processes.    North-  to  northwest-trending  steep  to  moderate-dipping  fault  zones  are 
primary  controlling  structures  for  emplacement  of  the  Iron  Mask  intrusives.    East-  to

northeast-trending 
to  hydrothermal  alteration  and 
mineralization.    The  faulting  and  associated  fracturing  also  provided  conduits  for 
meteoric  waters,  which  gave  rise  to  weathering  and  supergene  enrichment  of  the 
primary sulphide mineralization.
PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
The  New  Afton  deposit  is  hosted  within  the  Cherry  Creek  member  of  the  Iron  Mask 
batholith complex (Figure 7-2).  The Iron Mask complex is a multi-phase plutonic body 
exposed in a southeast-trending belt measuring 34 km long by 5 km wide.  The Cherry 
Creek phase is the principal host unit for the New Afton deposit.  It is a partially fault-
bounded body trending east-northeast through the deposit area, curving to the east side 
of the property to a more southeasterly trend (Figure 7-3).  At Afton, the Cherry Creek 
intrusive is a variably and multiply brecciated assemblage of porphyritic and equigranular 
monzonite-monzodiorite.  Cherry Creek rocks include fine- to medium-grained pyroxene-
hornblende  monzodiorite  and  fine-grained  biotite-monzonite,  varying  to  more  dioritic 
composition,  and  minor  syenite.    The  principal  host  phase  of  the  Cherry  Creek  is  a 
magnetic fine-  to  medium-grained  porphyritic  pyroxene-hornblende  monzodiorite  which 
forms a wedge of intrusive breccia between the Nicola and Pothook rocks.  Contacts to 
the  west  and  southwest  are  with  Nicola  Group  volcanic  rocks  and  to  the  east  and 
southeast with the Pothook diorite.   
 
Contact relationships between various intrusive phases are complex and not completely 
understood.    Cherry  Creek  rocks  are  difficult  to  discriminate  from  Pothook  biotite-
pyroxene  diorite  owing  to  overprinting  by  alteration.    Strong  potassic  alteration  occurs 
along  the  contact  between  the  Pothook  and  Cherry  Creek  phases.    Pothook  rocks 
outcrop  to  the  east  and  south  of  the  Afton  deposit.    They  are  weakly  porphyritic  to 
equigranular and, where not altered, moderately to strongly magnetic.  Poikiolitic biotite 
is diagnostic of the Pothook diorite.

Nicola  Group  rocks  border  the  Cherry  Creek  intrusive  on  west  and  southwest  of  the 
deposit  but  are  not  hosts  to  the  economic  mineralization.    They  consist  of  augite 
porphyry, polylithic volcanic breccias, and picrite flows and breccias.  Xenoliths of Nicola 
rocks occur within the Cherry Creek intrusive, and on the southwest end of the deposit 
the  Nicola form  a  large roof pendant overlying the Cherry Creek.  A possible  volcanic 
vent breccia phase appears to crosscut the Nicola strata  
 
A steeply dipping body of serpentinized and sheared picrite has been entrained within 
the Hanging Wall Fault, a major structural control to the New Afton deposit.  This unit 
separates separating strongly mineralized, pyrite-poor, potassically altered monzodiorite 
to the northwest from pyritic, sericite-carbonate-clay-chlorite-altered monzodiorite to the 
southeast.  Ground conditions within the picrite are poor, which has hampered efforts to 
drill  through  it.    As  a  result,  drill  information  on  the  hanging  wall  side  of  the  picrite  is 
limited.  
 
New  Gold  geologists  have  recently  discerned  that  a  late,  post-mineral  intrusive  phase 
occupies  a  corridor  oriented  roughly  parallel  to  and  lying  within  the  orebody.    This 
intrusive post-dates the Cu-Au mineralization and is largely barren, except for scattered 
occurrences  of  limited  lateral  extent  which  may,  in  fact,  be  entrained  blocks  of  earlier 
mineralized intrusive material.  It has been called the “De-Mineralized Zone” (DMZ) by 
mine staff. 
 
The property is traversed by mafic pyroxene-feldspar porphyry, monzonite, hornblende 
diorite porphyry, and hornblende-feldspar-quartz porphyry (latite) dykes.  The dykes are 
late  phases  of  the  intrusive  and  difficult  to  discriminate  from  Cherry  Creek  rocks  in 
places.  They  are  post-mineral  events,  although  some  have  pyrite-chalcopyrite 
mineralization along their margins. 
 
Mesozoic  units  (i.e.,  Nicola  and  Cherry  Creek) are  unconformably  overlain  by  Eocene 
Kamloops Group rocks.  In the Project area, the Kamloops Group comprises coarse- to 
fine-grained  clastic  sedimentary  rocks,  along  with  a  mafic  flow.    Coal  beds  within  this 
package are visible in the north wall of the Afton Pit.

Structure  is  a  dominant  feature  of  the  geology  of  the  deposit  and  has  influenced  all 
aspects  of  the  host  rock  lithology,  mineralizing  events,  and  post-mineral  processes.  
Zones  of  intersection  between  deep-seated  northwest-southeast-trending  faults  and 
east-northeast  fractures  were  primary  controls  to  localization  of  the  Triassic  intrusive 
bodies  (i.e.,  the  Iron  Mask  batholith)  and  Nicola  volcanic  centres.    The  northwest-
southeast  structures  are  major  regional  fault  zones  believed  to  date  back  to  Triassic 
times with repeated stages of reactivation through to the Tertiary.   
 
East-northeast-striking steeply dipping fault zones were the primary control to the New 
Afton  mineralization.    Two  faults,  termed  the  Hanging Wall  (east)  and  Footwall  (west) 
faults,  constrain  the  New  Afton  deposit  to  a  relatively  narrow  steeply  dipping  corridor. 
They,  along  with  moderately  to  steeply  dipping  east-west,  southwest-northeast,  and 
north-south fault zones have been mapped in the Afton pit (see Figure 7-2), and were 
subsequently  picked  up  in  diamond  drill  holes  and  underground  mapping.  These 
structures  are  thought  to  have  controlled  the  flow  of  mineralizing  hydrothermal  fluids 
responsible for the alteration and deposition of sulphides.  The pattern of intersection of 
the fault planes has imparted a southwest plunge to the New Afton zone.   
 
Subsequent fault movements shuffled portions of the deposit, in parts truncating it, and 
transposing slices of waste and ore in others.  The faults and subsidiary fracturing then 
provided conduits for weathering solutions, which resulted in supergene alteration down 
to relatively deep elevations (approximately 400 m below surface in places).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The  Afton  deposits  are  Cu-Au  silica-saturated,  alkalic  porphyry  style  deposits.  
Mineralization results from late stage hydrothermal activity driven by remnant heat within 
an alkalic intrusive complex.  Thermal gradients within these systems give rise to broadly 
concentric, although often complexly intermingled, zones of alteration and mineralization.  
The  distribution  of  alteration  and  mineral facies  are  largely  influenced  by  dikes,  veins, 
and fracture systems which concentrate and control fluid flow.   
 
The  New  Afton  deposit  is  unique  in  the  sense  that  it  is  very  strongly  constrained  by 
structure.    The  mineralization  occurs  as  a  tabular  body  that  occupies  a  largely  fault-
bounded  corridor,  which  traverses  the  property  in  an  east-northeast/west-southwest 
direction (see Figure 7-2).  This corridor is bounded on either side by the Hanging Wall 
(SE) and Footwall (NW) faults.  The orebody does not come in contact with the Footwall 
Fault, however, mineralization is partially entrained within and likely disrupted by portions 
of the Hanging Wall Fault.  Pods of mineralization are also known to occur outboard of 
the Hanging Wall Fault. 
 
Very  late  epithermal  processes  have  overprinted  the  porphyry  system  and  introduced 
mercury, antimony, and arsenic in geochemically significant concentrations.

9 MINERALIZATION 
fine-grained  disseminated  chalcopyrite  and 
Hypogene  mineralization  comprises 
relatively  minor  bornite  or  chalcocite.    In  weathered  portions  of  the  deposit,  the 
chalcopyrite  has  been  altered  to  bornite  and  chalcocite,  and  in  the  most  intensely 
oxidized areas, native copper.  Supergene mineralization is broadly constrained to the 
upper portions of the deposit, reaching to deeper areas along fracture zones. 
 
Native  gold  is  rarely  observed.    Gold  and  silver  reportedly  occur  as  electrum  grains 
within the chalcopyrite and bornite.  
 
Significant amounts of mercury, antimony, and arsenic occur in and around the deposit 
but are not thought to be directly related to the porphyry event(s).  Rather, they are more 
likely  to  have  been  introduced  during  much  later  epithermal  activity,  similar  to  several 
other localities in the district.  
 
The  central  core  of  mineralization  comprises  an  early  potassic  alteration  phase  which 
includes intense biotite ± silica ± magnetite hornfels of Nicola Group and Cherry Creek 
monzonite.  The  earliest  stages  of  the  mineralization  also  include  stockworks  of 
magnetite  +  apatite  +  actinolite  +  biotite  +  calcite  +  chalcopyrite  ±  pyrite  veins.  
Overprinted  on  the  hornfels  and  magnetite  facies  is  fracture-controlled  to  pervasive 
hydrothermal  potassic  alteration  (K-feldspar  +  biotite  +  actinolite)  and  sulphide 
mineralization consisting of disseminated and veinlet-hosted chalcopyrite and pyrite with 
subsidiary bornite.  Copper-gold mineralization occurs in association with strong potassic 
alteration  and  in  crackle  breccias  proximal  to  magnetite,  pyrite,  and  quartz-carbonate 
stockworks.   
 
Pyrite  stockworks  encompass  the  potassic  zones  in  a  shell  of  phyllic  alteration,  which 
includes dolomite + sericite in quartz-carbonate stockworks associated with high-angle 
faults.    This  imparts  a  bleached  appearance  to  the  rock  in  contrast  with  the  darker 
brownish-coloured hornfels.

The  latest  stage  of  hydrothermal  alteration  associated  with  the  primary  mineralization 
event is a propylitic overprint consisting of actinolite + chlorite + epidote ± carbonate ± 
pyrite ± chalcopyrite. 
 
The  bulk  of  the  deposit  occupies  a  large  tabular  mass  measuring  900  m  long  by 
approximately 100 m wide and spanning a vertical distance of about 350 m.  The zone 
dips  vertically  to  steeply  south-southeast,  and  plunges  at  moderate  angles  to  the 
southwest.    Two  subsidiary  satellite  bodies  occur  to  the  northeast  of  the  Main  Zone.  
One of these zones appears to branch off of the Main Zone and strikes in a somewhat 
more easterly trend, dipping steeply to the south-southeast.  The other, which is further 
away from the Main Zone has a similar strike to the Main Zone but dips at a flatter angle 
(approximately 60° southeast). 
 
As stated above, the deposit is porphyry-style, with very distinct structural controls.  The 
primary  mineralizing  event  was  preceded  by  development  of  disseminated  magnetite-
pyrite.  Primary economic sulphide mineralization occurred in association with potassic 
alteration  (principally  K-spar)  resulting  in  destruction  of  the  earlier  magnetite-pyrite 
assemblage.    Following  this,  carbonate  veinlets  (principally  ankerite)  developed  along 
and  surrounding  the  faults,  along  with  varying  amounts  of  pyrite,  clay  gouge,  and 
sericite.   
 
Subsequent faulting reshuffled portions of the deposit in a manner that is not completely 
understood.  This has resulted in truncation of the zone along the Hanging Wall Fault in 
places, and apparent displacement of mineralized blocks.  These blocks may occur as 
isolated  pods  in  the  hanging  wall  or  may  also  be  situated  adjacent  to  the  Main  Zone 
such that they appear to comprise a continuous body of mineralization crossing the fault.

10 EXPLORATION 
Prior  to  New  Gold’s  involvement,  the  only  work  that  had  been  done  on  the  deep 
resource at Afton was the seven holes drilled by Afton Mines in 1973 (two holes) and 
1980 (five holes).  New Gold commenced exploration work in 2000, with mapping and 
sampling of the pit (as well as any available outcrop surrounding the pit) and drilling of 
96 surface diamond core holes totalling 42,450 m.   
 
In November 2004, an adit was collared in the former Afton open pit at 512 m ASL.  A 
ramp  was  driven  from  this  portal  to  provide  access  for  underground  sampling,  infill 
drilling to confirm the Mineral Resources, and further exploration drilling to determine the 
full extent of the mineralization.  Total drifting was 2,200 m.     
 
Diamond  drilling  from  February  2005  to  April  2006  (cut-off  for  the  2006  resource 
estimate) totalled 30,778 m in 78 holes.  This brought the total amount of drilling on the 
Project to 84,755 in 182 holes.  Drilling continued throughout 2006, and into 2007, on the 
C Zone, a deep extension to the New Afton ore body.  Five exploration holes totalling 
2,996 m were drilled in the Pothook Pit area, which is approximately 0.5 km east of the 
Afton mine pit. Drilling was also conducted on the Hanging Wall Zones, located under 
the east side of the Afton pit, in 2008.  To date, 276 exploration diamond drill holes have 
been completed in the entire Project area, for an aggregate length of 130,439 m. 
 
In late 2005, New Gold contracted Fugro Airborne Surveys to complete 1,323 line-km of 
airborne  electromagnetic  surveying  (DIGHEM)  of  the  Afton  and  Ajax  claims.   Quantec 
Geoscience Ltd. was retained in 2008 to carry out Tensor Magnetotelluric (MT) and DC 
Resistivity and Induced Polarization (DC/IP) surveys totalling 34.5 line-km. 
 
In addition to the work at Afton, New Gold carried out relatively small programs on the 
Ajax Group, which is located just over 7 km to the southeast of the Afton pit.  Drilling on 
the Ajax in 2004 and 2006 totalled 4,635 m in ten holes.  During the period from 2006 to 
2008,  New  Gold  drilled  another  16  holes  totalling  6,820  m.    A  radiometric  survey, 
consisting  of  44.73  line-km,  was  carried  out  in  2007,  along  with  collection  of  2,040 
geochemical soil samples.

11 DRILLING 
All drilling completed to date on the Project has been diamond core drilling, conducted in 
a series of programs over a period spanning 2000 to 2008.  Table 11-1 summarizes the 
various  campaigns  completed  over  those  years.    Most  of  the  drilling  has  been  for 
exploration  and  resource  definition.    However,  in  recent  years  (2007  and  later), 
geotechnical holes have been drilled for groundwater monitoring and collection of data 
for mine design.

The individual drilling campaigns are described in the following subsections.
2000–2003 PROGRAM 
New Gold used Atlas Drilling Company (Atlas) of Kamloops, British Columbia, to do the 
surface drilling.  Atlas employed two diamond drills, a Longyear 38 and Longyear 44, to 
complete the drilling programs.  All of the surface drilling done to date has been with NQ-
size equipment (4.76 cm dia.), except for four drill holes which were BQ (3.64 cm dia.).

A  total  of  93  diamond  drill  holes  were  collared  for  an  aggregate  length  of  47,129  m 
(Figure 11-1).  All surface drill collars were surveyed by transit and Brunton compass.  
Drill  hole  orientations  in  2000  beyond  hole  2K-12  were  measured  using  a  Pajari  Bore 
Hole Survey Instrument, and in 2001 and 2002 a Reflex Easy-Shot Survey Instrument, 
which records dip and azimuth, was used.  Drilling is discussed in further detail in reports 
prepared by Behre Dolbear (2003, 2004).  
 
At the completion of the 2000 drilling program, the Main Zone was estimated to be 365 
m long, 76 m wide (average), and 300 m in vertical extent. 
 
In  2001,  ten  diamond  drill  holes  extended  the  length  of  the  Main  Zone  280  m  to  the 
southwest of the previous drilling.  The 2002 infill drilling intersected the Main Zone from 
the west and provided exploration data on the areas between previously drilled holes.  
Drill  holes  extended  the  measured  length  of  the  Main  Zone  120  m  to  the  southwest.  
Drilling  in  2003  focused  on  upgrading  Inferred  Resources  to  Measured  and  Indicated 
Resources.  At that time, the Main Zone  was estimated to be 800 m long, 90 m wide 
(average), and 300 m in vertical extent.
2005–2006 PROGRAM 
The  2005  underground  drilling  program  was  carried  out  by  Boisvenu  Drilling  Ltd.  of 
Vancouver, British Columbia, using NQ2 equipment (5.06 cm dia.).  All drill holes were 
surveyed  using  a  photo-bore  single-shot  instrument  for  dip  and  azimuth  changes 
downhole, with collar surveys done by transit.   
 
Underground  drilling  totalled  26,516  m  in  67  holes  during  2005,  with  an  additional  37 
holes drilled in 2006 (17,319 m).  The 2005 program focused on definition drilling of the 
known  mineralization  in  the  Main  Zone.    The  pattern  was  configured  to fill  in  sections 
halfway between the existing surface holes, bringing the nominal section spacing to 40 
m.  In 2006, the principal target area was the C Zone.  This drilling was successful in 
delineating a modest Inferred Mineral Resource of 7.9 Mt grading 0.96% Cu, 0.88 g/t Au, 
and 1.6 g/t Ag. 
 
The  core  from  the  drill  was  brought  by  the  drillers  on  a  daily  basis  to  the  core  shack 
where it was placed on a pallet and covered until placed in the temporary racks.  The

core was logged for rock type, mineralization, and alteration, and also for geotechnical 
data including percent recovery, rock quality designation (RQD), character and number 
of  fractures.    The  core  was  photographed  prior  to  being  sampled.    Scott Wilson  RPA 
noted in the site visits conducted in 2005 and 2006 that the core recovery was generally 
excellent.  
 
Underground drilling was carried out on 12 sections and consisted of several drill hole 
fans from each station (Figure 11-1).  Drilling completed to that time had delineated a 
mineralized body measuring about 1,000 m in length, 50 m to 100 m in width, and 400 m 
in vertical extent, with a moderate plunge to the west.
2007 PROGRAM 
The 2007 drilling also targeted the Hanging Wall Zones, as well as depth extensions to 
the  C  Zone.    Geotechnical  drilling  was  also  conducted  from  both  surface  and 
underground.    Four  holes  were  drilled  on  the  C  Zone,  and  23  holes  were  drilled  on 
Hanging  Wall  Zones  targets.    The  geotechnical  program  comprised  five  underground 
and four surface holes. 
 
The C Zone program was carried out by FORACO Drilling Ltd. (FORACO).  Core sizes 
were  PQ  (8.51  cm  dia.),  HQ  (6.35  cm  dia.),  NQ2,  and  BQTK  (4.07  cm  dia.).    Three 
contractors: FORACO, Atlas, and Western Exploration Diamond Drilling Ltd. (Western), 
were employed for the Hanging Wall program.  The core sizes were HQ and NQ2.  Atlas 
and  Western  were  also  contracted  to  do  the  geotechnical  drilling,  which  was  entirely 
NQ2 size. 
 
Core-handling protocols in 2007 were similar to those applied in 2005-2006.  Downhole 
surveys  were carried out using either a Reflex Easy-Shot or Maxibor instrument.  The 
Reflex measurements were made every 50 m for holes greater than 100 m depth.  For 
shorter holes, measurements were made at the mid-point and bottom of the hole.  The 
Maxibor provided readings every three metres downhole.

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
2008 PROGRAM 
Drilling continued on the Hanging Wall Zones in 2008, with a total of 4,450 m drilled in 
15 surface holes.  Drilling contractors used were Atlas, Western, and Connors Drilling 
Ltd.  
 
New Gold now has a formal protocol for locating, monitoring, surveying, and logging the 
drill holes.  Planned holes are plotted in plan and section to confirm the target and collar 
location.    A  geologist  inspects  the  collar  site,  and  the  surveyors  mark  both  the  collar 
location and line.  Once the drill has been set up, the geologist conducts an inspection, 
checks the orientation of the rig, and confirms with the driller.  Daily site inspections are 
conducted by a geologist as the hole is being drilled. 
 
Following completion, a downhole survey is carried out by a technician using the Reflex 
instrument (as described under 2007 Program).  The Maxibor is no longer used as New 
Gold personnel have concerns regarding its mechanical reliability.   
 
At this time, also, a request is made to the surveyors for collar pick-up.  Scott Wilson 
RPA notes that, in practice, some underground collars are not actually surveyed, but are 
located relative to the drift survey. Site reclamation of both the pad and the sump is then 
carried out. 
 
Core is delivered at the end of each shift to the logging facility housed in a Quonset hut 
on site.  Depending on the back-log, the core is either laid out for processing or stored 
for  later  logging.    Processed  core  is  laid  out,  washed,  checked  for  correct  depth 
measurements,  and  marked  with  start  and  end  measurements.    Any  incorrect  depth 
blocks are corrected at this time.  Aluminum tags, denoting hole and box numbers, are 
affixed to each box.  The core is then marked for sampling on two-metre intervals. 
 
Geotechnical logging is then carried out, followed by the geological logging.  Geological 
logging includes lithology, alteration, and mineralization.  The logs are transcribed into 
spreadsheets, which are then sent to the database manager along with the core imagery 
and sample lists.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
2000-2003 DRILL PROGRAMS 
New  Gold  consultant,  James  McDougall,  P.Eng.,  reviewed  and  advised  on  diamond 
drilling  and  geological  fieldwork  for  the  2000  to  2003  programs.    All  significantly 
mineralized  drill  core  from  the  2001  to  2003  programs  (except  for  specimen  sections) 
was logged, photographed, and diamond sawed, with half the core retained in the core 
box  at  New  Gold’s  core  shack  and  the  other  half  taken  directly  to  the  laboratory.  
Samples were conveyed by laboratory employees from site to Eco Tech Laboratory Ltd. 
of Kamloops, British Columbia, for analysis for Cu, Au, Ag, and Pd.  Core from the 2000 
program  was  split  rather  than  diamond  sawed  and  was  not  photographed  prior  to 
splitting.    However,  in  view  of  the  extreme  fragmentation  involved  with  core  splitting, 
occasional one-foot unsplit mineralized sections were retained for structural studies. 
 
Sample lengths were predominantly 2.00 m or 3.05 m, however, Scott Wilson RPA notes 
that  there  are  a  significant  number  of  longer  intervals.    The  maximum  sample  length 
recorded  in  the  database  is  15.2  m,  and  930  samples  measure  greater  than  3.05  m.  
Approximately 4.7% of the samples contained within the deposit are greater than 3.05 m 
in length. 
  
A limited number of check samples were randomly selected and sent to Acme Analytical 
Laboratories  Ltd.  and  International  Plasma  Laboratory  Ltd.  of  Vancouver,  British 
Columbia.    All  of  the  check  samples  correlated  well  with  the  originals  (Behre  Dolbear 
2003).  Selected core samples were examined microscopically in the field, and in thin 
section by petrographer J.F. Harris, Ph.D.
2005 UNDERGROUND SAMPLING 
The underground samples comprise continuous chip samples taken on both sides of the 
drift and correspond with each round of approximately 4.8 m in length.  Muck samples 
are  also  taken  for  each  round.    These  samples  were  not  used  for  mineral  resource 
estimation.

2005-06 DRILL PROGRAMS 
Drill holes were sampled in two-metre lengths or less as marked by the geologist.  Scott 
Wilson  RPA  notes  that, while  the  sampling  protocol  includes  provision  for  sampling  at 
less than two-metre lengths, virtually all of the sampling done since the start of 2005 was 
done on two-metre intervals.  Sampling is reportedly based on visible mineralization, but, 
in practice, most of the core was sampled.  The samples were sawn in half, bagged, and 
put into plastic pails for shipping.  The sampler filled out sample tags and, for every 20 
samples, included a blank sample prepared from previously drilled barren andesite, a tag 
for  a  standard to  be  put  into  the  sample  stream  at the  lab,  and,  in  addition,  a quarter 
sample to provide a duplicate.  
 
The pails were kept in a locked trailer, which housed the cutting facility, until shipped.  
The laboratory picked up the samples several times a week.  Sample tags were stapled 
onto  the  core  boxes  at  the  start  of  each  sample.    After  the  core  was  sampled,  the 
remaining half core was stored in the original boxes on pallets outside.  Each pallet was 
covered  with  plastic  wrap  and  securely  fastened.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  notes  that  a 
permanent core storage facility  with covered racks has since been established on site 
and all core has been relocated to this facility. 
 
The assay results were loaded directly from the laboratory into an MS Access database.  
The drill logs were entered into MS Excel spreadsheets from the handwritten logs.
2007 AND SUBSEQUENT DRILLING PROGRAMS 
The two metre sampling interval standard has been maintained and is specified in the 
formal protocol that New Gold now maintains.  Samples are marked as described above 
in Section 11 of this report.  Technicians retrieve the boxes from the rack and convey 
them to the cutting shack.  Core is sawn in half, and the sample is placed in a plastic bag 
marked with the tag number.  The remaining half core is put back in the box for storage.  
Each day, the samples are placed in rice bags, which are then marked with the sample 
sequence and prepared for shipping.  A daily manifest is prepared, detailing the sample 
numbers cut and packaged, and is provided to the laboratory.  Samples are stored in a 
locked enclosure until pick-up by laboratory personnel.  Each shipment is accompanied 
by the manifest, with a duplicate copy retained at site.

Starting in early 2007, New Gold commenced a program of assaying pulps by inductively 
coupled  plasma  (ICP)  in  order to  build  a  database  of  potentially  deleterious  elements.  
Starting in the walls, and progressing through the deposit to the opposite wall, every fifth 
sample was selected from the drill database.  These samples were run using ICP.  At the 
time of the site visit, 9,137 samples had been analyzed in this program. 
 
In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, the sampling method is appropriate for the deposit type 
and is consistent with current industry practice.  The samples are taken in such a way as 
to be representative of the deposit as it is presently known.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
2000-2003 DRILL PROGRAMS 
Sample preparation and analysis were as follows:
•  All  samples  were  sorted,  documented,  dried  (if  necessary),  roll  crushed  to  -10
mesh, split into 250 g subsamples, and pulverized to 95% -140 mesh.
•  Samples for Cu metallics assay (when requested) were split and pulverized into 
additional 250 g subsamples of -10 mesh material. The entire pulp was screened 
to -140 mesh.
•  Au and Pd were subsampled to 30 g aliquots and analyzed with conventional fire 
assay  using  atomic  absorption  (AA)  and/or  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  (ICP) 
finish. Minimum reported detection for Au and Pd was 0.005 g/t.
•  Cu  was  determined  by  AA  using  aqua  regia  digestion.  “Metallic”  Cu  (when
required) included two Cu assays per sample.
•  Ag geochemical analysis was by aqua regia digestion and AA.
•  All equipment was flushed with barren material and blasted with compressed air
between each sampling procedure.
All  core  drilled  by  New  Gold  in  the  2000-2003  programs  was  assayed  by  Eco  Tech 
Laboratories  Limited  (Eco  Tech)  of  Kamloops,  British  Columbia,  who  are  Certified 
Assayers and participate in the National Canmet Proficiency Testing, and who maintain 
their own in-house QA/QC program.   
 
The New Afton property is fenced and gated, and reasonably secure.  It was reported 
that after the core was logged and sawn, tied sample bags were locked in New Gold’s 
field  office  until  picked  up  by  personnel  from  Eco  Tech  for  transport  to  their  facilities.  
Drill core was stored in core racks at the locked, secure core shack.  Rejects were kept 
at Eco Tech’s office, and pulps were securely stored at New Gold’s field office.
2005 AND SUBSEQUENT DRILL PROGRAMS 
All  analytical  work  was  performed  by  Eco  Tech.    Copper  and  silver  assays  were 
determined  using  standard  acid  digestion  followed  by  AA.    Gold  and  palladium  were

determined  using  fire  assay  followed  by  an  AA  finish.    The  one-in-five  deleterious 
element samples were run for 30-element ICP. 
 
Mr. Stewart Wallis of Scott Wilson RPA visited the Eco Tech Kamloops facility on June 
7,  2005,  for  an  inspection,  and  discussed  the  assaying  methodology  and  QA/QC 
protocols  with  Jutta  Jealouse,  President.    Internal  checks  consist  of  a  minimum  two 
repeats, one blank, two re-splits, and two or three reference standards, one for Cu, one 
for  Ag,  or  one  combined  Cu/Ag  and  one  for  Au/Pd.    If  native  Cu  is  reported  on  the 
sample sheets, a metallic screen analysis is run in addition to the regular assay. 
 
The laboratory was observed to be clean and proper procedures were in place to track 
each sample.  Assay results and internal check results were checked and batches rerun 
if problems were observed.  The laboratory has since been acquired by Stewart Group 
Ltd., of the United Kingdom.  Eco Tech is ISO 9001-2000 accredited. 
 
Bulk  density  measurements  are  made  at  Eco Tech,  using  a  water  immersion  method.  
Specimens are sealed in wax, weighed in air and in water, and the density determined 
by  the  ratio  between  the  weight  of  displaced  water  and  the  weight  of  the  sample.  
Correction  is  made  for  the  volume  of  wax  encasing  the  specimen.    Data  for  686 
determinations were included in the database provided to Scott Wilson RPA for review. 
 
In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, the assay methodologies are standard practices in the 
industry and are appropriate for the mineralization at New Afton.  The laboratory is well-
known,  accredited  commercial  assayer,  with  considerable  experience  with  Afton  ores.  
As noted above, the samples are in the custody of New Gold personnel or authorized 
designates from the drill to the lab, and Scott Wilson RPA has no concerns regarding 
sample security.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 
2000-2003 DRILL PROGRAMS 
New Gold’s QA/QC program was as follows:
www.scottwilson.com
•  Assay standards were routinely used to control assay precision.
•  One in nine pulp samples were re-assayed by Eco Tech.
•  One in 25 reject samples were re-split and re-assayed by Eco Tech, and
laboratories.
•  Pulp  samples  were  randomly  selected  for  duplicate  assaying  by  different
Previous  reports  (Behre  Dolbear  2003,  2004)  have  described  validation  of  the  assays 
from the surface drilling program.  Behre Dolbear (2004) concluded that the assay and 
survey database used for the Afton mineral resource estimation was sufficiently free of 
error to be adequate for resource estimation.
2005-2006 DRILL PROGRAM 
Scott  Wilson  RPA  conducted  a  review  of  the  QA/QC  results  for  the  2006  mineral 
resource estimate.  Independent samples were not collected as the property had been 
previously  visited  and  reported  on  by  of  a  number  of  independent  Professional 
Geologists and is a former producing mine.   
 
New  Gold’s  protocols  were  somewhat  modified  from  the  ones  used  prior  to  2005.    A 
blank, standard, or duplicate was entered into the sample stream at a frequency of one 
every eight samples.  A total of 18,508 unprepared samples were submitted to Eco Tech 
during the 2005-2006 program (Konst, 2006).  This included 801 blanks, 793 standards, 
and 721 duplicates, which, in sum, equates to approximately 12% of all samples run. 
 
Sample QA/QC data from the underground drilling program was analyzed by Ron Konst, 
P.Geo., an independent consultant retained by New Gold.  Mr. Konst noted that there 
were 53 blank assays and 18 standard assays with results outside of an acceptable error 
limit.    These  samples  comprised  7%  and  2%  of  the  total  blank  and  standard  assays, 
respectively, although it was reported that several of these “outliers” were the result of 
improper  labelling  (i.e.,  standards  sent  as  blanks,  and  vice  versa).    The  Konst  report

recommended  that  the  batches  with  out-of-specification  (OOS)  QA/QC  data  be 
investigated and re-assayed, if appropriate.  This work was carried out and no material 
changes to the assay database resulted.  Several of the OOS blanks were found to be 
misidentified in the database and did not represent improper assay results. 
 
The duplicate data were analyzed using scatter diagrams and Thompson-Howarth plots 
to determine if any biases were present and to define the assay precision.  The precision 
for Cu at a 0.6% grade was ±9%, and for Au at a 0.5 g/t grade, ±20%.  No biases were 
detected.   
 
Scott  Wilson  RPA  reviewed  the  Konst  report  and  the  QA/QC  data,  and  conducted 
independent  analyses  of  the  QA/QC  assays.    The  duplicate  analyses  were  subject  to 
Thompson-Howarth plots to confirm the results of the Konst report.  Also, each of the 
blank assays was plotted against the sample that immediately preceded it in the sample 
stream,  to  check  for  evidence  of  contamination  in  sample  preparation.    No  concerns 
were indicated by this analysis.  Scott Wilson RPA reviewed the plots of the standard 
assays and confirmed that there was no indication of systematic bias, nor any trends or 
particular time periods where assays tended to be OOS. 
 
Scott  Wilson  RPA  concurred  with  the  principal  conclusion  of  the  Konst  report  and 
considered the assay data suitable for use in mineral resource estimation.  However, in 
the  course  of  preparing  the  estimate,  Scott  Wilson  RPA  found  a  number  of  database 
errors, which were brought to the attention of New Gold personnel and corrected.  These 
errors were often observed to persist in subsequent versions of the database, indicating 
that the validation process was not robust.  Eventually, these errors were expunged, but 
there were concerns regarding the data handling.   
 
Scott  Wilson  RPA  carried  out  a  check  of  approximately  10%  of  the  drilling  database 
against the original assay and survey records.  Drill holes were selected on a more or 
less random basis, spanning the entire life of the Project to date.  No errors were found.
2007 AND SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMS 
New Gold consultant, Bruce Davis, reviewed the QA/QC data in October 2008 and found 
that QA/QC results were showing significant deficiencies but remedial measures had not

been taken.  The recommendation was made to select approximately 300 sample pulps 
for  re-assay  of  Cu  and  Au,  both  at  the  principal  laboratory,  Eco  Tech,  as  well  as  at 
another laboratory.  The results of this re-assay program did not indicate that there were 
any concerns with respect to bias.  However, the data did display a somewhat high level 
of scatter for pulp duplicates. 
 
Scott  Wilson  RPA  selected  approximately  10%  of  the  holes  drilled  since  the  last 
resource  estimate  (2006).    Records  showed  that  110  holes  had  been  drilled  and,  of 
these, 11 were checked against the original assay data received from the laboratory.  No 
errors  were  found.    In  addition,  the  entire  database  was  checked  using  the  Gemcom 
validation  utility.   One  or  two  very  minor  discrepancies  were found  with respect  to  the 
header information, but none that would impact on resource estimation. 
 
Present  protocols  are  for  the  assay  data  to  be  sent  via  email  and  hard  copy  to  the 
database manager at site.  These data are then converted to comma-delimited files and 
imported  into  the  master  database  for  validation.    The  validated  data  can  then  be 
exported  to  various  users  for  specific  applications  such  as  geological  interpretation, 
plotting, and resource estimation.  
 
At the time of the most recent Scott Wilson RPA site visit, a new database system was 
being implemented, with automated functions for importing, validating, and exporting the 
drill data.  Data handling protocols were also being introduced that would provide for the 
establishment  of  a  single  master  database,  with  one  person  responsible  for  its 
maintenance.  Scott Wilson RPA considers this to be a very worthwhile step and strongly 
recommends  that  all  phases  of  the  data  handling  process  be  rigorously  monitored.  
Assay QA/QC results should be reviewed on a continual basis, in a timely fashion, and 
remedial actions taken when necessary. 
 
In  Scott  Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  the  present  protocols  for  data  acquisition  and 
management appear to be reasonable.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
The New Afton Project is the most advanced exploration and development project in the 
area.  The ground adjacent to the southeast (Ajax deposit) is 100% owned by Abacus 
Mining  &  Exploration  Corp.    In  July  2009,  Wardrop  Engineering  Inc.  produced  a 
Preliminary Assessment on the property which contemplated a 60,000 tpd open pit mine 
and mill facility.  Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the project were quoted 
as 422.4 Mt at a grade of 0.30% Cu, 0.19 g/t Au, 0.0015% Mo, and 0.31 g/t Ag, with an 
additional  Inferred  Resource  of  80.6  Mt  grading  0.22%  Cu,  0.16  g/t  Au,  0.0011%  Mo, 
and  0.38  g/t  Ag  (Table  15-1).    The  database  for  the  2009  Mineral  Resource  estimate 
comprised 140,490 m of diamond drilling in 366 drill holes along with 53 percussion drill 
holes totalling 4,386 m.

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
This section has been summarized from the Hatch 2007 Feasibility Study as well as the 
SGS  Mineral  Services  (SGS)  metallurgical  test  report,  both  completed  in  April  2007.  
Where  necessary,  the  information  on  equipment  sizing  has  been  updated  with  recent 
data provided by New Gold on the implementation phase of the Project.
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
A metallurgical test program was developed by Hatch in conjunction with New Gold and 
SGS. The primary test work was completed by SGS from March to October 2006, while 
secondary  programs  were  completed  by  Pocock  Industrial  Inc.  (Pocock)  and  Knelson. 
Mineralogy  was  completed  by  Advanced  Mineral  Technology  Laboratory  (Amtel)  and 
Vancouver Petrographics Ltd. (VPL). Hatch reviewed and interpreted the results from the 
various test programs to develop the process design criteria and flowsheets.  
 
Three ore types represent the mineralization for this copper-gold deposit. At the testing 
stage, the proportion of these ore types was estimated based on the resource estimate 
at  the  time.    The  preliminary  metallurgical  evaluations  focused  on  the  mesogene  and 
hypogene  ore  types.  The  metals  of  economic  interest  were  copper,  gold,  silver,  and 
palladium. Table 16-1 provides a comparison of the estimated percentages for the test 
program  with  the  percentages  in  the  2009  Life  of  Mine  (LOM)  plan.  In  the  opinion  of 
Scott Wilson  RPA,  the  samples  used  in  testing  were  reasonably  representative  of  the 
different ore types.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 
This  metallurgical  test  program  was  conducted  in  two  phases.  The  first  phase  was 
conducted  on  bulk  samples  representing  the  mesogene  and  hypogene  ore  types,  to 
establish typical metallurgical requirements for the two main ore types. These samples 
were  obtained  from  the  exploration  decline  into  the  deposit.  Barren  hanging  wall  and 
footwall materials adjacent to the ore were obtained to evaluate the impact of dilution. 
 
The second phase  evaluated  the  variability  of  metallurgical  response  to  the  standard 
conditions established. This phase of the program employed split drill core samples from 
various spatial locations in the orebody. In addition, split drill core samples from diamond 
drill  holes  90  and  91  were  included.  Drill  hole  90  represented  two  different supergene 
ore types, while drill hole 91 was selected to more thoroughly represent the mesogene 
ore.  SGS  completed  grinding  and  flotation  tests  on  all  of  these  samples  and  also 
conducted solid-liquid settling tests on flotation concentrates. 
 
Pocock conducted tailings dewatering tests on various rougher flotation tailings samples. 
Their  scope  of  work  included  flocculant  screening,  static  and  dynamic  gravity 
sedimentation, and pulp rheology, pressure and vacuum filtration tests.  
 
Amtel  completed  a  mineralogical  evaluation  and  reported  on  the  deportment  of  gold 
values in the three ore types. VPL issued two mineralogical examination reports, one on 
30 bulk samples for the two main ore types and the second on 70 core and bulk samples 
representing the three ore types, footwall, and other rock units. 
 
SAMPLES 
In  the first phase, bulk  samples  were  taken  to  represent the two  main  ore types,  the 
mesogene and the hypogene. For each ore type, three grades were prepared.

For each bulk sample a total of nine 300 kg drums were collected and shipped to SGS 
for  metallurgical  testing,  three  drums  for  each  grade  range.  Composite  mixing 
proportions were then calculated to blend the three grade samples from each ore type to 
match a target assay.  The final mesogene master composite assayed 1.44% Cu and 
1.26 g/t Au, while the hypogene master composite assayed 1.26% Cu and 1.05 g/t Au. 
Scott Wilson RPA notes that the LOM plan grades are lower at 0.96% Cu and 0.72 g/t 
Au, and this may have an effect on the metallurgical performance. 
 
Dilution samples were submitted for ore blending to represent the expected dilution with 
the selected block caving mining method. Block caving will result in lower selectivity at 
the  ore  interfaces.  To  evaluate  this  effect  on  the  metallurgical  performance,  a  total  of 
approximately 500 kg barren hanging wall and footwall samples were sent to SGS. The 
dilution type samples represented the mesogene, hypogene, and picrite rock types. 
 
Supergene samples consisting of split drill core from drill hole 90 were also tested. Six 
pails, weighing a total of 193 kg, were sent to SGS.  Half of the sample was designated 
Type  1,  representing  a  hematite-rich  alteration,  and  half  was  Type  2,  representing  a 
weaker hematite alteration but with more interval fractures. 
 
For  the  second  phase,  variability  samples  were  selected  to  represent  various  spatial 
locations within the mineralized zones. For this work, 18 pails of split drill core samples 
representing  supergene,  mesogene,  and  hypogene  ore  types  and  the  three  grade 
ranges were submitted.  Each pail weighed 24 kg to 30 kg. 
 
In addition nine pails of core samples from drill hole 91, weighing 245 kg, were sent to 
SGS. These  additional  core  samples  were  submitted to  provide  an  expected  range  of 
primary and secondary copper minerals representing all three ore types.

MINERALOGY 
Three laboratories conducted mineralogical studies on the New Afton samples.
www.scottwilson.com
•  VPL conducted two mineralogical studies: one for hypogene and mesogene 
ores on the underground bulk samples and a second petrographic study on 
70  drill  core  and  underground  samples  for  all  three  ore  types  and  footwall 
rocks.
•  SGS conducted a modal analysis on the mesogene and hypogene ores and
a mineralogical study on hypogene copper concentrate samples.
•  Amtel conducted a gold deportment study for all ore types.
The VPL studies are briefly summarized below:
•  Hypogene ore contains chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) as the main copper mineral of 
interest with a chalcopyrite:pyrite ratio of 25:1.  Chalcopyrite occurs primarily 
as  free  grains  but  with  inclusions  in  silicates.  Gold  particles  varied  in  size 
from  5  µm  to  40  µm  and  occur  as  native  gold  between  pyrite  and 
chalcopyrite grains. There is sericite present.
•  Mesogene  ore  copper  mineralization  includes  chalcopyrite,  as  well  as 
bornite (Cu5FeS) and chalcocite (Cu2S) in varying proportions that occur as 
intergrowths  replacing  the  original  chalcopyrite  mineralization.  Chalcocite 
tends to be finer grained and dispersed, which will have a negative influence 
on  the  final  concentrate  grade.  Pyrite  is  extremely  rare.  The  content  of 
sericite is higher. No gold particles were observed.
•  Supergene  ore  copper  minerals  are  mainly  chalcocite  and  native  copper. 
Native copper occurs as micro-fracture coatings, which will render recovery 
by flotation difficult. Lower levels of sericite and carbonate compared to the 
mesogene ore were observed. 
Footwall  Zone  rocks  resemble  mesogene  rocks  but  with  lower  levels  of 
sericite.  Some  sulphides  are  present  as  barren pyrite,  but  copper  minerals 
are rare.
•
The SGS modal analysis quantified the levels of various minerals. This study identified 
tennantite  (Cu11FeAs4S13)  as  the  primary  source  of  arsenic  (As).    The  As  level  in 
mesogene ore poses an economic concern for the concentrate produced from this ore 
type.  The  study  also  indicated  the  presence  of  tetrahedrite  (4Cu2S·Sb2S3)  in  the 
mesogene  ore  type,  which  has  the  potential  to  cause  higher  Sb  levels  in  the  copper 
concentrate, but this was not evident in flotation test results.  
 
The  levels  of  sericite  and  chlorite  were  high  enough  in  both  the  mesogene  and 
hypogene  rock  types  to  cause  slimes  problem  in  the  dewatering  of  flotation  tailings.

Subsequently,  it  was  concluded  that  tailings  would  not  be  thickened  as  part  of  the 
process (see Mineral Processing section). 
 
The Amtel study noted that approximately 40% of the gold was associated with copper 
sulphides and 30% occurred as liberated electrum in all three ore types.
GRINDING 
A  detailed  study  of  the  grinding  characteristics  for  the  mesogene  and  hypogene  ore 
types  was  undertaken.  Coarse  ore  was  subjected  to  energy  determinations  using  the 
Bond Low-energy Impact Test and the JKTech Drop-weight Test (DWT).   
 
Coarse ore was crushed and homogenized to form two grindability composite at minus 
1-1/4” and minus six mesh.  These samples underwent further grinding tests including 
the SAG Power Index (SPI) test, the MacPherson 18” Autogeneous grinding test (AWI), 
the Bond Rod Mill work index (RWI), the Bond Ball Mill work index (BWI), and Abrasion 
Index (AI) determinations. Those results have been summarized in Table 16-3.

These  work  indices  have  classified  both  ores  as  being  hard  and  competent,  with  the 
hypogene ore being very hard. For the Abrasion index classifications, the mesogene ore 
has been categorized as low-abrasive and the hypogene ores as mildly abrasive.
FLOTATION 
A  total  of  83  batch flotation  tests  and  seven  locked  cycle  tests (LCT)  were  performed 
over  the  entire  test  program.    The first  phase  test  work  on  the  bulk  samples  included 
open circuit and locked cycle tests and evaluated the following:
•  primary and regrind product sizes 
•  collector and frother types

•
flotation kinetics
The effect of dilution with barren rock on the metallurgical performance was studied. A 
limited amount of flotation work was conducted on the supergene ore.  At the end of the 
test  program,  a  flowsheet  was  established  that  consisted  of  two  stages  of  primary 
grinding, rougher flotation, rougher concentrate regrinding, first stage cleaning followed 
by  cleaner-scavenger  flotation,  and  two  additional  stages  of  cleaner  flotation.  The 
cleaner-scavenger  concentrate  was  recycled  for  regrinding.  Rougher  tailings  and  the 
cleaner-scavenger tailings are handled separately but combine to make final tailings.  
 
The  main  flotation  reagents  used  were  collectors,  including  potassium  amyl  xanthate 
(PAX),  sodium  isopropyl  xanthate  (SIPX),  Aero  5100,  Aero  7249  and  Cytec  3418A  (a 
phosphine  reagent);  and  frothers,  including  methyl  isobutyl  carbinol  (MIBC),  Dowfroth-
250 (DF250) and pine oil. PAX was selected as the collector based on its traditional role 
in  porphyry  flotation,  while  DF250  was  used  as  the  principal  frother.  The  high  sericite 
contents of some of the ores will warrant the possible use of carboxyl-methyl-cellulose 
(CMC).    Subsequent  testing  determined  the  ultimate  selection  of  PAX,  3418A,  MIBC, 
and lime as the reagent suite for the process plant. 
 
The results indicated that a P80 of 160 µm was the optimum primary grind.  Finer primary 
grinding of the hypogene ore to a P80 of 106 µm did not improve the copper recovery.  
Gold flotation kinetics followed that for copper for both ore types. 
 
The optimum regrind size for cleaner flotation performance was between 21 µm and 59 
µm for the hypogene and mesogene ores. Consequently, a P80 of 35 µm was selected 
for sizing the regrind mill. 
 
Dilution tests on bulk samples included the addition of 10% and 20% hanging wall and 
footwall  materials  for  the  hypogene  (five  tests)  and  mesogene  (eight  tests)  ore  types. 
This  was  followed  by  a  series  of  four  cleaner  tests  on  mesogene  ore,  diluted  with 
supergene ore by 20% and 40%. The results indicated that the diluting rock produced 
similar  rougher  copper  and  gold  recovery  but  with  higher  mass  recoveries  and 
subsequently lower concentrate grades. The impact of this would be an increased load 
on the regrind mill and cleaner circuit.

LOCKED CYCLE TESTS 
Locked cycle tests were conducted on bulk samples in duplicate for the main ore types, 
with a different frother reagent (MIBC or DF250) used on each. The results in Table 16-4 
show that MIBC provides a higher concentrate grade but a lower copper recovery.  The 
hypogene ore exhibits slightly better metallurgical recovery than the mesogene ore.

There will be gold, silver, and likely palladium credits in selling the concentrate. Smelter 
penalties will be incurred for arsenic and mercury when treating a significant portion of 
mesogene ore, and possibly for antimony as well, as typical threshold values are 0.2% 
As, 0.1% Sb, and 10 ppm Hg.    
 
The insoluble values were low for the first phase locked cycle tests but they were high in 
the drill hole 91 concentrates. Higher insoluble values would have been expected due to 
the high clay content of these ore types.  Insoluble minerals can produce more difficulties 
in  flotation  and  an  insoluble  depressant  or  dispersant  may  be  required  in  the  flotation 
reagent suite. 
 
After the locked cycle tests were completed, separate reagent suites were evaluated to 
determine whether improvements could be made to the flotation response for various ore 
types. As the block caving mining method was planned to be used, the focus was on the 
development of a single flowsheet for all ore types.
GRAVITY TESTS 
Gravity  test  work  was  also  completed  on  hypogene,  mesogene,  and  mesogene-
supergene  blends  to  optimize  recovery  of  gold  to  the  final  concentrate.  The  gravity 
concentration  work  by  Knelson  identified  the  presence  of gravity  recoverable  gold.  An 
economic benefit for gravity concentration was not identified from the test work, but is 
based  on  good  experience  at  other  porphyry  copper-gold  properties.  Gravity 
concentration circuits will be included in the primary and regrind circuits.

Subsequent test work determined that final grade concentrate could be produced from 
coarse  material  with  flash  flotation  in  the  grinding  circuit.    A  flash  flotation  circuit  was 
subsequently added to the process plant design.  
 
In addition, Knelson conducted a preliminary bench-scale assessment of native copper 
recovery  by  gravity  concentration for  the  three  ore  types.  This  was  done  because  the 
native copper values proved to be difficult to recover by flotation methods. Based on the 
analysis completed by Knelson, there will be potential to recover some of the copper in 
the supergene ore to a gravity concentrate at a marketable concentrate grade. Copper in 
hypogene and mesogene ores did not appear to be amenable to gravity concentration. 
More work on a larger scale should be completed to quantify the native copper impact on 
metallurgy.
VARIABILITY TESTS 
In  the  second  phase  of  flotation  work,  tests  were  conducted  on  drill  core  samples  to 
determine the variability of flotation response on a spatial basis throughout the different 
zones of mineralization. Various intervals from sixteen drill holes were provided for this 
evaluation. Within these intervals, the samples were classified by ore type and by copper 
grades, as was done in the first phase. A total of 25 open circuit batch cleaner tests were 
performed, ten on hypogene ore, seven on mesogene ore, and eight on supergene ore.  
A summary of the variability test results is shown in Table 16-6.  
 
Later  in  the  test  program,  another  set  of  variability  samples  from  drill  hole  91  were 
provided as a more wide representation of the mesogene ore type; those samples were 
provided  as  three  composites,  labelled  A,  B,  and  C.  The  sample  designations  were  a 
function of the depth in  that drill hole. The “A” composite is from the 266 m to 300 m 
depth, the “B” composite from 300 m to 360 m depth, and the “C” composite from the 
360  m  to  418  m  depth.  Testing  on  these  samples  included  five  batch  tests  and  three 
locked cycle tests.

Metallurgical recoveries have been analyzed by New Gold and Hatch and directly related 
to the head grade and to grind size from the variability tests. The relationships with head 
grade  are  shown  in  detail  in  the  subsection  on  Metallurgical  Recovery.    This  effect  of 
head  grade  can  be  seen  in  Table  16-6,  most  notably  for  mesogene  ore,  with  copper 
recovery ranging between 60% and 89% depending on head grades ranging from 0.63% 
Cu  to  2.78%  Cu.    Gold  recovery  ranges  are  even  more  pronounced  than  copper.  
Copper concentrate grades produced from all samples were acceptable and deemed to 
be saleable.
DEWATERING TESTS 
Dewatering tests were conducted on copper concentrates and on rougher tailings. SGS 
conducted static settling tests on final copper concentrates and vacuum filtration tests on 
rougher  tailings  samples.  Pocock  conducted  a  series  of  dewatering  tests  on  rougher 
tailings  samples. The  Pocock  scope  of  work  consisted  of flocculant  optimizing, gravity 
sedimentation, pulp rheology, pressure and vacuum filtration tests. 
 
CONCENTRATE DEWATERING TESTS 
Concentrate from  two  bulk flotation tests  were  subjected  to settling tests. The  primary 
and  regrind  P80  sizes  for  these  tests  were  110  µm  and  27  µm,  respectively.  Copper 
concentrate settling test resulted in underflow densities of 61% to 64% solids and unit

areas  of  0.028  m2/tpd  to  0.058  m2/tpd  with  the  addition  of  flocculant  and  coagulant.  
Subsequent testing was done by an equipment supplier to support the selection of the 
equipment for the process plant. 
 
No  pressure  filtration  tests  were  included  in  the  test  program  because  of  the  large 
quantity  of  concentrate  required  for  conducting  such  evaluations.  Subsequent  testing 
was done by vendors to support the bidding process and the selection of the equipment 
for the process plant. 
 
ROUGHER TAILINGS DEWATERING TESTS 
Dry  stacking  of  tailings  was  initially  evaluated  by  SGS  with  vacuum  filtration  tests 
conducted  on  rougher  tailings  under  various  operating  conditions.    Cake  moistures 
varied from 18% to 21%, with filtration rates varying between 11 and 79 dry kg/m2·h. 
 
Pocock  ran  a  series  of  sedimentation  tests  on  the  three  rock  types  and  for  one 
composite with hanging wall material. Good settling rates and supernatant clarity were 
obtained using 50 g/t to 80 g/t of a cationic coagulant (Hychem 606) and 20 g/t to 30 g/t 
of an anionic polyacrylamide (Hychem 303).  The result was typical underflow densities 
of  57%  to  64%  and  unit  areas  of  0.125  m2/tpd  to  0.300  m2/tpd.    However,  it  was 
concluded  that  these flocculant  and  coagulant  addition  rates  were  cost-prohibitive  and 
conventional slurry deposition of tailings was adopted for the final design.
METALLURGICAL RECOVERY PROJECTIONS 
The  data  from  the  variability  tests  have  been  analyzed  to  develop  equations  for 
projecting the recovery of copper, gold, silver, and palladium and the deportment of the 
penalty elements, arsenic and mercury, in the concentrate for all three ore types. Where 
available, locked cycle results have been used to support the projections from the batch 
test  data  points.  The  equations  have  been  used  for  projecting  production  from  mining 
blocks and in the economic model. 
 
COPPER RECOVERY 
Copper recovery has been correlated with the copper head grade for a constant copper 
concentrate grade for all three ore types.  Recoveries have been normalized to a 28% 
Cu concentrate grade for hypogene ore, which contains primarily chalcopyrite, to a 30%
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009
Page 16-11

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
Cu concentrate grade for mesogene ore, due to the presence of bornite, and 58% Cu 
concentrate for supergene ore, due to the presence of native copper. 
 
A recovery increase of 2% to 3% has been applied to the best fit equations based on the 
expected improvement in project plant performance vs. batch open circuit cleaner data. 
This increase is supported by locked cycle test results for hypogene and mesogene ore 
types.  Typically,  locked  cycle  recovery  would  be  higher  than  that  from  batch  open 
cleaners for the same concentrate grade and it would be indicative of the recovery that 
may be achieved in an optimized plant operation. For supergene ore, the correlation has 
been  developed  based  on  flotation  only  with  an  increase  to  allow  for  potential  native 
copper recovery by gravity concentration. 
 
For Hypogene ore, the correlation for copper recovery is expressed as:
% Cu recovery = 6.2059·Ln (F) + 90.69 
where F = % Cu(ore)
For Mesogene ore, the correlation is based on tails losses and is expressed as:
% Cu recovery =  100(28.062 – 3.168/F) 
(29.8944 – 0.0646·F) 
 
where F = % Cu(ore)
For Supergene ore, the correlation is estimated as follows:
% Cu recovery = 41.308·Ln (F) + 54.833 
where F = % Cu(ore)
GOLD RECOVERY 
Amtel’s  mineralogical  study  concluded  that  gold  is  primarily  associated  with  copper 
sulphides that will be recoverable by flotation in all three ore types. For hypogene ore, 
the gold recovery did not correlate well with copper recovery, but the gold concentration 
ratio correlated well with copper concentration ratio.  For mesogene and supergene ore 
types,  there  was  a  reasonable  direct  correlation  between  gold  recovery  and  copper 
recovery.

For  Hypogene  ore,  gold  recovery  was  calculated  using  the  concentration  ratio 
correlation and the calculated concentrate production based on copper:

g/t Au (conc) = 1.0447x - 1.8458  
g/t Au (ore) 
where x =  %Cu(conc) 
 
%Cu(ore)
For Mesogene ore, gold recovery was calculated as follows:
% Au recovery = 15.754·e0.0193x 
where x = % Cu recovery
For Supergene ore, gold recovery was calculated as follows:
% Au recovery = 0.6545x + 24.715 
where x = % Cu recovery
SILVER RECOVERY 
For  both  hypogene  and  mesogene  ore  types,  silver  recovery  has  a  poor  direct 
correlation  with  copper  recovery,  but  the  silver  concentration  ratio  correlated  well  with 
copper concentration, similar to the hypogene gold recovery.  
 
For  Hypogene  ore,  silver  recovery  was  calculated  using  the  concentration  ratio 
correlation and the calculated concentrate production based on copper:
g/t Ag (conc) = 1.181x - 10.271  
g/t Ag (ore) 
where x =  %Cu(conc)

g/t Ag (ore) 
where x =  %Cu(conc)

ARSENIC AND MERCURY CONTENT IN CONCENTRATE 
For hypogene and mesogene ore types, the data showed a strong correlation between 
the  arsenic  and  mercury  concentration  ratios  and  copper  concentration  ratio.  These 
correlations were used to determine the economical concentrate grade (particularly for 
mesogene  ore  which  contains  higher  arsenic)  by  assessing  the  effect  of  concentrate 
copper  grade  on  the  levels  of  these  elements  in  the  concentrate  and  their  associated 
penalties. 
 
For Hypogene ore, the concentration relationships are as follows:
% As (conc) = 0.8615x - 6.2294 
% As (ore)
g/t Hg (conc) = 1.162x - 11.434 
g/t Hg (ore) 
where x =  %Cu(conc) 
%Cu(ore)
For Mesogene ore, the concentration relationships are as follows:
% As (conc) = 0.6285x + 6.0855 
% As (ore)
g/t Hg (conc) = 0.3864x + 8.2154 
g/t Hg (ore) 
where x =  %Cu(conc) 
%Cu(ore)
For  Supergene  ore,  the  arsenic  and  mercury  content  in  the  concentrate  correlated 
directly with their respective ratio to copper in the feed as follows:
% As(conc)  = 40.658x - 0.0716 
where x =  %As(ore) 
 
%Cu(ore) 
 
g/t Hg(conc)  = 51.077x - 8.4396

MINERAL PROCESSING 
The New Afton processing facilities have been designed to process 4 Mtpa of ore and 
recover copper, gold, and silver. A conventional crushing, grinding, gravity concentration 
and  flotation  process  has  been  proposed  for  the  Project,  utilizing  standard  processes 
and equipment.  
 
The process design criteria were developed based on a combination of test work results, 
experience  from  similar  operations,  and  industry  practice.    The  following  process 
description should be read in conjunction with the process flow diagram shown in Figure 
16-1.
PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
The  New  Afton  mill  has  been  designed  to  process  a  blend  of  primary,  transition,  and 
supergene  ores.  The  process  will  utilize  conventional  crushing,  grinding,  and 
concentration processes to separate valuable minerals from gangue into concentrates at 
marketable  grades.  Mineral  separation  will  be  achieved  by  gravity  concentration  and 
differential flotation. A regrinding stage will be included in the flotation circuit.  
 
The New Afton mill has been designed to process 11,000 tpd of ore at full capacity and 
will operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  The plant will consist of the following 
unit operations.
Flash Flotation
•  Primary crushing  
•  Conveying from underground to surface 
•  Stockpiles – coarse ore storage and reclaim, and intermediate waste storage 
•  SAG mill primary grinding with cone crushing of recycle pebbles  
•  Ball mill secondary grinding with closed circuit cyclone classification 
•  Gravity concentration 
• 
•  Rougher flotation 
•  Rougher concentrate regrinding, classification and gravity concentration 
•  Cleaning flotation in three stages with one open stage of cleaner-scavenger 
•  Concentrate thickening and storage 
•  Concentrate pressure filtration 
•  Concentrate storage, loading and weighing (on-site) 
•

PRIMARY CRUSHING, COARSE ORE STORAGE AND RECLAIM 
The ore will be crushed underground by a jaw crusher to 150 mm and conveyed to the 
surface onto a 10,000-tonne live load coarse ore stockpile.  Coarse ore will be reclaimed 
from the stockpile by one of two apron feeders to the SAG mill feed conveyor belt. A dust 
collector  system  will  be  installed  in  the  reclaim  tunnel  to  collect  dust  generated  at the 
apron feeder. 
 
GRINDING 
Coarse ore at 150 mm will be ground in an 8.3 m x 3.96 m SAG mill (7,000 HP) and a 
5.5 m x 9.75 m ball mill (7,000 HP) to reduce the ore to a product size of 80% passing 
160 µm.  
 
The design criteria for the grinding circuit have been based on hypogene ore, as it has 
the higher work index.  A SAG work index of 19.2 kWh/t and a Ball Mill work index of 
21.8 kWh/t have been used with an expected transfer size of 1 mm.  In the earlier years, 
the mill feed will be exclusively hypogene, while later on in the LOM plan there will be 
various blends of hypogene and mesogene ores. 
 
The SAG mill product will be classified on a 2.44 m x 6.1 m single-deck vibrating screen. 
The screen oversize will be reduced in a 2,100 mm cone crusher (500 HP) to 12 mm and 
then  recycled  to  the  SAG  feed  conveyor.  The  screen  undersize  will  be  classified  in  a 
bank of six 660 mm diameter cyclones.  
 
The cyclone overflow will feed the rougher flotation cells. The cyclone underflow will be 
returned  to  the  SAG  mill,  while  a  portion  of  the  cyclone  underflow  slurry  will  feed  the 
gravity concentrator that will be installed to optimize gold recovery. Gravity concentrates 
will be directed to the concentrate thickener. Another cyclone underflow stream will be 
directed to a flash flotation circuit consisting of a 20 m3 rougher and a 5 m3 cleaner to 
remove coarse copper sulphide particles. 
 
FLOTATION 
A single bank of 100 m3 flotation cells is provided for the rougher flotation. Flotation will 
be  conducted  at  the  natural  pH,  with  PAX,  3418A,  and  MIBC  added  at  the  rougher 
flotation  stage.  Rougher  concentrates  will  be  reground  and  upgraded  to  a  final

concentrate  grade  with  three  stages  of  cleaner  and  one  stage  of  cleaner-scavenger 
flotation.  
 
Rougher and recycled cleaner-scavenger concentrates will be reground in a 1,250 HP 
vertical grinding mill operating in closed circuit with three 381 mm diameter cyclones. A 
second collector, Aerophine 3418A will be added to the regrind mill. The regrind mill will 
produce a particle size distribution of 80% passing 35 μm. The cyclone overflow will then 
advance to the cleaning stages. 
 
The  first  cleaner  consists  of  a  bank  of  seven  20  m3  flotation  cells  operating  in  open 
circuit, while the second and third cleaners will operate in closed circuit. The first cleaner 
concentrate  will  be  fed  to  the  second  cleaner  circuit,  while  the  first  cleaner-scavenger 
tails will report to the final tails pump box. The second cleaner concentrate will feed the 
third  cleaner  circuit  to  produce  the  final  copper  concentrate.    The  second  and  third 
cleaner circuits consist of 5 m3 flotation cells. 
 
DEWATERING AND CONCENTRATE TRANSPORTATION 
The concentrate dewatering circuit includes thickening and pressure filtration.  The final 
concentrates from the third cleaner flotation stage will be dewatered in an 18 m diameter 
thickener with flocculant added to the solution to enhance solids settling and to achieve 
the target underflow density of 65% solids by weight. The thickener overflow will be re-
used as process water in the plant.  
 
The underflow from the thickener will be pumped to a concentrate stock tank that will be 
designed for 24-hour storage. Stock tank concentrate will be pumped to one of two 40 
m2  pressure  filters  to  produce  a  concentrate  cake  containing  8%  to  12.5%  H2O.  The 
concentrate  filter  cake  will  be  discharged  onto  a  1,320-tonne  capacity  concentrate 
stockpile in the loading shed. Concentrates will be sampled, loaded into B-Line trucks, 
and weighed prior to shipment from the site.

TAILINGS DISPOSAL 
The tailings handling system will pump the combined tailings (from the rougher flotation 
circuit and the cleaner scavenger circuit) to the Cyclone Plant, a set of primary cyclones, 
located adjacent to the tailings storage facility (TSF).  
 
The  cyclone  underflow  product  will  be  delivered  to  a  skid-mounted  secondary  cyclone 
pack  located  on  the  top  of  the  tailings  dam.  The  sand  or  coarse  fraction  from  these 
secondary cyclones will be used to construct the tailings dam and the secondary cyclone 
overflow product will be used to seal the wet side of that dam. A centreline construction 
method will be used to establish the tailings dam structure. There will be three seepage 
collection  ponds  below  the  dry  side  of  the  main  tailings  dam  to  recover  and  return 
seepage back to the TSF. 
 
TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITY  
The TSF includes the Pothook pit, the tailings dam, and the impoundment zone.  The 
concept  of  “dry-stacking”  for  tailings  disposal  was  evaluated  earlier  and  dropped  for 
various  reasons,  principally  related  to  the  prohibitive  costs  of  the  flocculants  and 
coagulants.  The plan is to create a centreline raised tailings dam with an upstream (u/s) 
low-permeability core of compacted glacial till and a downstream (d/s) shell of cycloned 
sand from the tailings.  Certain segments of the tailings dam will also include a starter 
dam constructed solely out of native glacial till.  Cyclone overflow (fines) and the unused 
whole tailings will be impounded behind the dam, along with a small amount of operating 
water and seasonal surplus water. The impounded water is to be reclaimed and reused 
in the plant. 
 
The  TSF  partially  overlies  former  waste  rock  dumps  and  partially  is  located  on  native 
ground.    Areas  covering  waste  rock  dumps  will  be  lined  with  a  1.5  mm  thick 
geomembrane to prevent piping into the waste rock.   
 
Initially, whole tailings will be stored in Pothook pit followed by a stage during which a 
layer of whole tailings will be deposited in the entire impoundment area.  Subsequently, 
a cycloning operation consisting of primary and secondary cyclones will go in operation 
to separate the sand fraction from the whole tailing.

The tailings  deposition design  is  based  upon the feasibility  production  schedule  which 
commenced with two years at 1.6 Mtpa before ramping up to 4 Mtpa and contained a 
LOM  plan  of  44.4  Mt.    The  revised  production  plan  contains  47.4  Mt  and  moves 
immediately  to  a  production  rate  of  4  Mtpa.    New  Gold  has  modified  the  tailings  dam 
design and schedule to accommodate these changes.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL 
RESERVE ESTIMATES 
MINERAL RESOURCES 
HISTORY 
Mr. Gary Giroux, P. Eng., completed an initial resource estimate for the Project in May 
2003,  which  was  then  updated  in  January  2004.    The  estimate  was  prepared  using  a 
block  model  constrained  by  a  wireframe  model  of  the  mineralized  body.    Grade  was 
interpolated into the blocks using Ordinary Kriging (OK).  The January 2004 Measured 
and Indicated Mineral Resource estimate for the Afton Main Zone at a cut-off grade of 
0.7% copper equivalent (CuEq) was 68.7 Mt at a grade of 1.08% Cu, 0.85 g/t Au, 2.62 
g/t Ag, and 0.12 g/t Pd.  Total contained metal was 1,640 million pounds of Cu and 1.9 
million ounces of Au.  There was an additional Inferred Mineral Resource of 7.45 Mt at 
0.92% Cu, 0.78 g/t Au, 2.34 g/t Ag, 0.12 g/t Pd (Behre Dolbear, 2004). 
 
Following  completion  of  definition  drilling,  in  2006,  Scott Wilson  RPA  re-estimated  the 
Mineral Resources at New Afton using a block model constrained by wireframe models 
of the principal mineralized zones.  Grades for Ag, Au, Cu, and Pd were interpolated into 
the blocks using OK.  The wireframe models were constructed by New Gold personnel 
and inspected by Scott Wilson RPA prior to their use in the block model.  High grades for 
all four elements were capped before compositing. 
 
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources totalled 65.7 Mt grading 1.02% Cu, 0.77 g/t 
Au, and 2.59 g/t Ag.  In addition, a modest Inferred Mineral Resource of 7.9 Mt grading 
0.96% Cu, 0.88 g/t Au, and 1.6 g/t Ag was estimated for the C Zone.

The  most  recent  Mineral  Resource  estimate,  which  is  the  subject  of  this  audit,  was 
prepared  by  Messrs.  Robert  Sim,  P.  Geo.,  and  Bruce  Davis,  FAusIMM,  in  September 
2009 (Sim and Davis, 2009), hereafter referred to as the "2009 resource model" or "2009 
resource  estimate".    A  probability  shell  was  generated  using  Indicator  Kriging  (IK)  to 
serve as a constraining wireframe model for the deposit.  The estimate was made using 
a block model method, with grades interpolated using OK for Cu, Au, Ag, and Pd.  In

addition,  potentially  deleterious  components  were  estimated  into  the  blocks,  including 
As, Hg, Sb, Bi, Cd, Fe, Ni, Pb, S, Se, Te, and Zn.  These estimates were made using 
Inverse Distance Squared (ID2) weighting.   
 
The Mineral Resource estimate, as reported by Sim and Davis (2009) is shown in Table 
17-1. 
 
The  model  was  constructed  using  MineSite  software,  which  is  an  off-the-shelf 
commercial  package  commonly  used  in  the  industry.    Wireframe  models  of  the 
topography and the DMZ were generated by New Gold personnel.  The probability grade 
shell was created using IK, with some manual modifications afterward.  The grade shell 
encloses blocks with a greater than 50% probability of grading greater than 0.25% Cu. 
 
The  database  for  the  grade  interpolations  was  entirely  composed  of  diamond  drill 
samples collected by New Gold over the period 2000 to the present.

MODEL GEOMETRY 
A project survey grid has been established which is rotated 50° clockwise from the UTM 
grid, and the database, wireframes and block models are based on this grid.  The block 
model  consists  of  an  array  of  10  m  x  10  m  x  10  m  blocks.    Origin  and  model  size 
parameters are shown in Table 17-2. 
 
Note that the origin coordinates in Table 17-2 use the Gemcom convention.  In Gemcom, 
the block model origin is the uppermost southwest corner (i.e., not the centroid) of the

DATABASE 
SAMPLES 
The  data  for  the  wireframing  and  grade  interpolations  are  entirely  from  diamond  drill 
sampling.  The database contains records for 276 holes, of which 28 are located outside 
the  resource  model  area.    The  number  of  sampled  intervals  varies  depending  on  the 
element.    Key  economic  components  such  as  Cu,  Au,  Ag,  and  Pd  were  assayed  in 
virtually  all  samples,  and  numbered  in  the  order  of  47,000  to  49,000.    Deleterious 
components, such as Hg, As, and Sb were analyzed in only 7,100 or so samples, while 
total S, Se, and Te in only approximately 2,600 samples. 
 
A table of sample statistics used in the estimate is provided below in Table 17-3.

COMPOSITES 
The  sample  data  were  composited  to  two-metre  downhole  lengths.    The  two-metre 
interval  was  selected  because  approximately  93%  of  the  samples  are  two  metres  in 
length and because this length results in the least change to the original data.  In Scott 
Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  this  is  a  reasonable  criterion  for  selection  of  the  composite 
interval. 
 
In reviewing the data, Sim and Davis (2009) noted that there were several sections of 
the  drill  holes  that  were  not  sampled  (termed  “missing  intervals”).    Some  of  the 
unsampled intervals were non-mineralized and deliberately ignored to save assay costs.  
Other missing intervals occurred in the database where holes were wedged.  The upper 
portion  of  the  pilot  hole  down  to  the  wedge  is  carried  in  the  record  for  that  wedge  to 
ensure that it plots at the appropriate depth.  The samples for this interval are assigned 
to  the  pilot  hole,  and  consequently,  the  upper  portion  of  the  wedge  hole  appears  as

“missing”  in  the  sample record.   Still  other  intervals  are truly  “missing” (i.e.,  they  have 
been lost and are unaccounted for).   
 
It is conventional practice to assign zero grade to missing intervals, however, there are 
several instances in the database where this would be unfairly conservative, and these 
should be ignored.  Sorting out which missing intervals should be assigned zero grade is 
onerous and error-prone.  Sim and Davis (2009) carried out a study to determine what 
effect ignoring all of the missing intervals had on the global resource estimate and found 
this  effect  to  be  negligible.    Consequently,  all  missing  intervals  were  ignored  in  the 
compositing.  In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, this is a reasonable approach.
ESTIMATION DOMAINS 
For  the  2006  estimate,  New  Gold  geologists  had  prepared  wireframe  models  of  what 
they perceived to be the principal mineralogical zones  within the deposit.  There were 
four  principal  zones  of  mineralization:  supergene,  mesogene,  hypogene,  and  the  C 
Zone.  The hypogene zone was simply the primary sulphide mineralization, consisting of 
chalcopyrite and lesser bornite with accessory pyrite.  The mesogene zone was defined 
as  encompassing  material  that  had  begun  to  show  signs  of  oxidation,  typified  by  the 
emergence  of  chalcocite  replacing  primary  Cu  sulphides.    The  supergene  zone  was 
interpreted  to  be  the  region  of  the  deposit  where  the  Cu  minerals  had  been  entirely 
oxidized to native Cu or remnant chalcocite.  The C Zone was (and still is) considered to 
be a separate hypogene sulphide body residing below the main body of mineralization. 
 
A  fifth  domain,  the  DMZ,  was  recognized  and  partially  modelled  but  was  not  as  well 
understood  as  it  is  now.    Further  interpretive  work  by  New  Gold  geologists  has 
determined that this is a distinct post-mineral intrusive phase that can be identified in drill 
core, but had hitherto been considered an altered equivalent of the host units.   
 
Additional wireframe modelling has also been completed on the fault zones which both 
bracket and transect the deposit.  The two principal fault zones, the Hanging Wall and 
Footwall, have been modelled in some detail.  Additional crossing structures and splays 
have  been  modelled  to  a  somewhat  lesser  degree  of  completeness  yet  still  serve  to 
improve overall understanding of the controls to mineralization.

•  The  geologists  responsible  for  interpreting  the  zones  had  since  left  the 
company,  and  the  wireframes  had  not  been  fully  updated  with  the  newer  drill 
information.
•  There  was  scepticism  and  doubt  as  to  the  original  interpreted  zones  and  not
enough time or resources to reinterpret them.
SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
For  the  updated  model,  a  review  was  undertaken  to  determine  if the  various  domains 
from the 2006 models could be used.  The following conclusions were made:
www.scottwilson.com
•  The boundaries of the zones, as they appear in the drilling, are indistinct and
somewhat subjective.
•  Statistical analyses and  contact profiles demonstrated that there were no real 
differences in grade characteristics between the zones; therefore, constraining 
the grade interpolations on that basis did not appear to be relevant.
As a result, the decision was taken to construct a grade shell as the defining boundary of 
the deposit.  The 2006 wireframes were retained for assignment of bulk densities to the 
blocks and for general characterization of the deposit.  
 
The grade shell was derived from an IK model wherein material with a greater than 50% 
probability  of grading  higher  than  0.25%  Cu  was  defined  as “in  the  zone”.   From this, 
three  principal  estimation  domains  were  established:  the  DMZ,  the  grade  shell,  and 
outside of either the grade shell or the DMZ.  
 
Scott Wilson RPA inspected the probability shell and attempted to re-create it from the 
2009 resource model composite data.  A semi-variogram analysis was carried out using 
Sage, the same software used by Sim and Davis (2009).  The variogram model derived 
from this analysis was built into a model in GEMS, and a new indicator model generated.  
Scott Wilson RPA notes that the GEMS software is more limited than MineSite and so it 
was not possible to exactly copy the search parameters.  The resulting probability shell 
was compared to the 2009 resource model in plan and section views.  For the most part, 
the two wireframes were similar in size and shape, however, there were some notable 
differences  which  have  yet  to  be  explained.    As  it  happens,  this  turned  out  to  be 
inconsequential, as a resource estimate created from the GEMS probability shell yielded 
almost  identical  results  as  those  in  the  2009  resource  estimate.    Scott  Wilson  RPA 
concludes  that  there  is  very  little  sensitivity  in  the  model  to  small  changes  in  the 
probability shell.

The  use  of  probability  shells  in  resource  estimation  is  an  acceptable  practice  and,  if 
prepared  by  experienced  practitioners  (as  in  this  case),  a  reasonable  approach.  
However,  in  Scott  Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  it  would  be  preferable  to  use  deterministic 
models  of  the  geological  domains  interpreted  from  lithological  or  mineralogical 
characteristics.  In this case, time and cost constraints for completing the estimate left 
little choice.  Reverting to the grade shell has not had a significant impact on either the 
Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates.  The last three estimates for the New 
Afton  deposits  have  been  prepared  using  markedly  different  methods,  which  all  have 
produced similar results.  In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, this suggests that the estimate 
is quite robust and is based on sufficient drilling information to be relatively insensitive to 
changes in methodology. 
 
In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, domains based on mineralogical parameters are useful 
for  reasons  other  than  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate.    Metallurgical  recoveries  are 
observed to vary between the different mineralogical zones.  Similarly, the geotechnical 
characteristics  of  the  rock  mass  are  observed  to  have  a  measurable  impact  on  the 
quality of the rock mass.  Scott Wilson RPA recommends that for future block models 
these components be included in the modelling process, if possible.
CAPPING OF HIGH GRADES 
Composite  statistics  for  the  economic  components  in  the  three  principal  domains  are 
shown in Table 17-4.  Histograms and probability plots are provided in Appendix 1. 
 
Scott Wilson RPA notes that the distributions of all components are positively skewed 
and this generally results in overestimation of metal contents unless some remedial step 
is  taken.    Mean  values  generated  from  non-normally  distributed  data  are  often  times 
biased in relation to the true average grade. A common practice in the industry is to cap 
grades  at  some  predetermined  level,  and  in  so  doing,  limit  the  impact  of  the  highest 
grade  samples.    The  2009  resource  model  incorporates  grade  caps  that  have  been 
applied  to  the  composited  sampled  data  prior  to  running  the  grade  interpolation.    A 
summary of the caps applied is provided in Table 17-5.

Scott Wilson RPA generally advises against placing caps on the composited samples in 
favour of capping the raw samples.  However, in this case, because the compositing has 
had  a  minimal  impact  on  the  sample  lengths,  it  is  acceptable.    Scott  Wilson  RPA 
reviewed the cap values and considers them to be within a reasonable range.
GEOSTATISTICS 
Preparation of the 2009 resource model included a geostatistical analysis on the composited 
data in order to derive kriging and search parameters.  Multi-directional correlograms for 
Cu, Au, Ag, and Pd were generated using Sage software.  The data were partitioned into 
two domains: one inside and one outside the DMZ.   
 
The variogram models derived from the analysis are shown in Table 17-5.

Scott  Wilson  RPA  conducted  an  independent  geostatistical  analysis  using  the  same 
software (Sage) and the same composite database.  The variogram models derived from 
this  analysis  were  similar  in  many  respects  to  those  in  Table  17-5,  but  with  some 
significant  differences.    For  the  most  part,  the  anisotropy  directions  and  ranges  were 
similar for the second structures of the models.  The first structures, however, tended to 
differ substantially.  In addition, the nugget effects were generally significantly lower than 
those derived for the 2009 resource model.   
 
It  is  curious  why  the  software  (which,  incidentally,  derives  the  variogram  models 
automatically  without  much  user  intervention)  should  generate  different  variogram

models from, supposedly, the same data.  However, it does not appear to be material to 
the  global  estimate.    As  mentioned  above,  Scott  Wilson  RPA  ran  grade  interpolation 
models  using  an  independently  derived  probability  shell  and  variogram  models  and 
obtained results very similar to those obtained by Sim and Davis (2009).  This suggests 
that the global estimate is insensitive to changes to the variogram models.
SEARCH PARAMETERS 
For  the  economic  elements  in  the  DMZ  domain,  the  search  was  a  300  m  spherical 
ellipsoid,  with  a  minimum  of  8  and  a  maximum  of  28  composites  per  estimate,  and  a 
maximum of seven composites allowed from any one drill hole.  Search parameters were 
the same for the grade shell domain, except that for Au, and the estimates were limited 
to a minimum of six and a maximum of 15 composites, with a maximum of five allowed 
from any one drill hole.  For outside of the probability shell, the composite constraints 
were identical to those for the DMZ, except that the search ellipsoid was reduced to 200 
m x 200 m x 100 m.  For all domains, the estimates were constrained to using only one 
hole per octant. 
 
For  the  ID2  estimates  (deleterious  components),  a  300  m  spherical  search  was  used, 
with  the  block  estimates  limited  to  a  minimum  of  four  and  a  maximum  of  nine 
composites, and again, a maximum of one hole per octant. 
 
In  Scott  Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  the  search  parameters  for  the  economic  elements  are 
reasonable  and  supported  by  the  variography.    The  300  m  search  used  for  the 
deleterious  elements  is  somewhat  aggressive.    As  a  result,  the  estimates  for  these 
elements are likely to be lower in confidence level than the economic elements.  This is 
particularly likely considering the lower number of samples for the deleterious elements.
BULK DENSITY 
Average bulk density was assigned to the block model according to mineralization type.  
The  average  bulk  densities  were  derived  from  656  measurements  collected  from  drill 
core  over  the  course  of  exploration  work  on  the  Project.    Table  17-6  shows  how  the 
assignments were made.

VALIDATION 
Sim and Davis validated the 2009 resource block model using the following techniques:
•  Visual inspection and comparison of block and composite grades in sections and
•  Hermitian  Polynomial  Change  of  Support  analysis  to  check  the  degree  of
smoothing in the block grade interpolations.
•  Comparison with ID2 and Nearest Neighbour (NN) estimates.
plans.
•  Swath plots.
The  validation  exercises  conducted  by  Sim  and  Davis  (2009)  indicated  that  the  block 
grade  interpolations  were  unbiased  and  honoured  the  local  drill  hole  grades.   In  Scott 
Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  the  validation  work  by  Sim  and  Davis  (2009)  was  done  at  a 
reasonable and appropriate level.   
 
Scott  Wilson  RPA  prepared  an  independent  estimate  for  Cu,  Au,  Ag,  and  Pd  and 
compared  it  to  the  2009  resource  estimate.    As  already  stated  in  this  report,  a  new 
probability shell was derived from an independently generated set of kriging parameters.  
This shell was then used, along with the DMZ solid, to assign domains to the blocks and 
composites.  Geostatistical analyses were carried out to derive variogram models, which, 
as already mentioned, were somewhat different from those generated by Sim and Davis 
(2009).    Capping,  search  parameters,  and  classification  criteria  (see  subsection  on 
Classification) were kept the same as for the original models.   
 
The Scott Wilson RPA block model results at the 0.5% Cu cut-off are compared to the 
2009  resource  model  in  Table  17-7.    There  is  very  little  difference  between  the  two

estimates,  which,  in  Scott  Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  provides  additional  validation  of  the 
2009 resource model.  Scott Wilson RPA also notes that the global estimate appears to 
be quite insensitive to variations in either the probability shell or the variogram models.
www.scottwilson.com
CLASSIFICATION 
The estimate has been classified according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves as adopted by the CIM Council on December 11, 2005 
(CIM definitions).  Criteria for classification were as follows: 
 
MEASURED
Assigned to blocks with Cu grades estimated by a minimum of three drill holes 
with  composites  at  an  average  spacing  of  30  m  (nominal  drill  spacing  of 
approximately 50 m).
INDICATED
Assigned to blocks with Cu grades estimated by a minimum of three drill holes 
with  composites  at  an  average  spacing  of  50  m  (nominal  drill  spacing  of 
approximately 80 m).
INFERRED
Assigned to blocks that do not meet the criteria for Measured or Indicated but are 
within 50 m of a drill hole.

CUT-OFF GRADE 
Sim and Davis (2009) used a 0.25% Cu cut-off for the probability shell, and applied a 
0.5%  Cu  cut-off  to  the  block  grades  for  reporting  purposes.    The  cut-off  used  for  the 
Feasibility Study resource estimate was US$10/t (Hatch, 2007).  For the present model, 
the cut-off is based on Cu grade only (0.5% Cu), which will likely result in a reduction in 
the overall size of the estimate.  
 
In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, there is significant value in the other metals, particularly 
Au, which is not being given full credit by using a Cu-only cut-off.  New Gold’s Life of 
Mine model shows that contribution to revenue is as follows; Cu = 70%, Au = 29% and 
Ag = 1%.  On the recommendation of Scott Wilson RPA, Sim and Davis (2009) prepared 
a  report  of  the  Mineral  Resources  using  a  Cu-equivalent  (CuEq)  cut-off.    Copper 
equivalence was calculated based on the following equation: 
 
  CuEq = Cu_% + (DolVal_Au / DolVal_Cu) * Au_g/t 
 
Where: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The revised Mineral Resources are summarized in Table 17-8.
CuEq = copper equivalent grade 
  Cu_% = copper grade in percent 
 
  DolVal_Cu = $/% Cu = $55.12 (based on $US2.50/lb Cu) 
  DolVal_Au = $/g Au = $28.94 (based on $US900/oz Au)
Au_g/t = gold grade in g/t

Table 17-8 demonstrates that the CuEq cut-off adds a modest but measureable amount 
to the Mineral Resource estimate (see Table 17-1).  The total Measured and Indicated 
tonnage,  at  the  0.5%  CuEq  cut-off,  increased  by  approximately  13%,  with  a  partially 
offsetting  drop  in  grades.    The  overall  metal  content  for  Cu  and  Au  at  that  cut-off 
increase by 4% and 6%, respectively. 
 
The 0.5 % Cu (or CuEq) cut-off, at US$2.50/lb Cu, represents a gross contained metal 
value  of  US$27.55/t.    Using  the  parameters  in  the  New  Afton  financial  model,  Scott 
Wilson RPA estimates that for ore grades of 0.5 % Cu, 0.4 g/t Au, and 1.0 g/t Ag (i.e.

precious  metal  grades  that  are  roughly  proportional  to  the  average  Cu  grade  in  the 
deposit), the NSR value of the rock is C$33.74/t.  The estimated cash costs for LOM at 
New  Afton  are  C$17.19/t,  suggesting  that  the  0.5%  Cu  cut-off  is  very  conservative, 
particularly  for  a  Mineral  Resource  estimate.    At  a  0.3%  Cu  grade,  the  same  NSR 
analysis indicates that the NSR value is C$20.24, which compares more favourably to 
the LOM cash costs per tonne.   
 
In  Scott  Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  a  cut-off  in  the  order  of  0.3%  Cu  is  probably  more 
appropriate for the Mineral Resource estimate than 0.5% Cu.  At the 0.3% Cu-only cut-
off, the additional metal values contributed by Au and to a much lesser degree, Ag, are 
in the order of an additional 0.1% CuEq.  This implies that the CuEq cut-off would be in 
the order of 0.4% CuEq. Comparison between Tables 17-1 and 17-8 indicates that the 
tonnage  reporting  at  the  0.3%  Cu  cut-off  is  roughly  equal  to  that  at  the  0.4%  CuEq.  
Consequently, Scott Wilson RPA recommends that the Mineral Resources be quoted at 
a CuEq cut-off of 0.4% CuEq.
COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE 
Table  17-9  compares  the  2009  Mineral  Resource  estimate,  at  the  0.4%  CuEq  cut-off, 
with  the  2006  Mineral  Resource  estimate,  at  the  $10/t  cut-off,  as  reported  in  the 
Feasibility  Study  (Hatch,  2007).    The  tonnage  of  the  Measured  Resources  dropped, 
while there was a significant increase for the Indicated Resources.  Total tonnage of the 
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources did not change appreciably, nor did the total 
metal  contents.    The  Inferred  Resources  essentially  tripled  in  volume,  with  a  marked 
decrease in grades.  
 
In  Scott  Wilson  RPA’s  opinion,  the  variance  between  the  Measured  plus  Indicated 
Mineral  Resources  in  the  two  estimates  is  not  significant,  and  can  be  explained  by 
differences in methodology.  The changes in the Inferred Mineral Resources are due to 
additional  drilling  has  expanded  the  C  Zone,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  total  Inferred 
tonnage.  Additional  drilling  has  also  likely  affected  the  resources  in  the  area  of  the 
Hanging Wall Zones.   
 
In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, the difference between the 2006 and present estimates is 
not significant on a global basis and should not make a material difference to the Mineral 
Reserve estimate.

MINERAL RESERVES 
For  the  2007  Feasibility  Study,  AMC  Consultants  Pty  Ltd.  (AMC)  prepared  a  Mineral 
Reserve  estimate  based  on  the  block  caving  method.    The  key  inputs  and  processes 
used  to  develop  and  validate  the  estimate  are  described  below.    The  2007  Mineral 
Reserve estimate was based upon a geological block model prepared by Scott Wilson 
RPA which formed the basis of the Mineral Resource estimate published by New Gold in 
September 2006. 
 
The  2007  reserve  estimation  was  completed  based  upon  the  use  of  two  separate 
modelling approaches (Cave-Sim and Gemcom PCBC).  In September 2009, New Gold 
provided a new resource model which was reviewed and accepted by Scott Wilson RPA 
as  described  above.    AMC  again  used  the  PCBC  modelling  software  to  generate  a 
Mineral  Reserve  estimate.    Based  upon  the  similar  results  from  the  two  software 
packages in the 2007 estimate, this 2009 estimate was based solely on the PCBC model 
for its ease of use. 
 
Scott Wilson RPA has reviewed the assumptions and results of the estimation process 
and concurs that the estimate is consistent with the CIM definitions and NI 43-101.  The 
Mineral Reserve estimate is summarized in Table 17-10 and described in more detail in 
the following subsections.

2007 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE

described  below.    In  preparing  the  2007  estimate,  AMC  used  geotechnical  data  and 
geological interpretations of faults and other structures provided by New Gold.   
 
A  detailed  analysis  of  the  deposit  was  first  carried  out  to  identify  the  most  suitable 
positions of the block cave extraction levels and the extent of the area to be undercut to 
induce caving (the block cave footprint).  During this analysis a large number of iterations 
were carried out. 
 
After selection of appropriate extraction levels and footprints and an overall development 
sequence, taking into account geotechnical and practical mining constraints, a detailed 
production schedule was developed using commercially available block cave modelling 
software (PCBC). 
 
An alternative software program (Cave-Sim) was also used to model material flow in the 
cave  and  produce  the  production  estimates  for  the  Feasibility  Study.    Sensitivities  to 
changes in key parameters influencing the reserve estimate were modelled using both 
PCBC and Cave-Sim. 
 
INITIAL REVIEW OF RESOURCE GRADE DISTRIBUTION 
Those parts of the deposit suitable for mining were initially identified by visual inspection 
of the grade distribution  within the deposit, and  by analysis of the value generated by 
mining various areas.  The Hanging Wall Zones are isolated from the Main Zone and are 
low grade.  Because of their location, they cannot utilize the underground infrastructure 
required for mining the Main Zone and would require separate access, ore handling and 
ventilation systems.  These zones were considered to be uneconomic. 
 
The Main Zone was split into east and west blocks at 3525E, which coincides with the 
approximate  position  of a  low-grade  zone  running  through  the  deposit.   Both  the  east 
and west portions of the Main Zone were used for further analysis to determine the most 
suitable extraction levels and footprints. 
 
SELECTION OF EXTRACTION LEVEL AND FOOTPRINT 
AMC  reviewed  a  number  of  possible  undercut  positions  by  visual  inspection  of  the 
resource.  The block size in the resource model was reset to 15 m x 15 m x 20 m high to 
match a preliminary estimate of drawpoint spacing.  A series of block models were then

Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009
Page 17-20

created,  one  for  each  potential  undercut  position.    In  each  model,  blocks  below  the 
undercut were removed from the model, while those above the undercut were subjected 
to a mixing algorithm to simulate the effect of drawing material from drawpoints. 
 
AMC added a value field (Net Smelter Return, or NSR, Value) to the diluted model.  The 
NSR Value is an estimate of the theoretical value received for the concentrate produced 
from  one  tonne  of  resource,  net  of  all  costs  and  losses  incurred  in  the  off-site 
transportation and processing of concentrate. 
 
After  calculating  the  unit  NSR  Value  of  the  material  in  each  diluted  block,  an  amount 
equivalent  to  $14  per  tonne  was  deducted  from  the  NSR  Value  to  reflect  the  mining, 
onsite processing, and administration costs.  No account was taken of the time value of 
money.  Columns of blocks having a positive cumulative NSR Value were assembled, 
progressing up from the undercut.  The final height of each column was determined by 
the  position  of  the  last  block  to  add  value  to  the  column.    An  amount  reflecting  a 
preliminary estimate of the cost of establishing the portions of the undercut, extraction 
level, drawpoint, and drawbell necessary to mine each column was subtracted from the 
total column value. 
 
A  perimeter  or  footprint  was  drawn  on  the  undercut  level  around  groups  of  profitable 
columns.  The footprint was adjusted to ensure that a minimum north-south span was 
maintained.  A number of footprints were prepared for each model to test the sensitivity 
of the Project to minimum span criteria of 105 m, 90 m, and 75 m.  Unprofitable columns 
were added to the footprint where necessary, to achieve the minimum span. The height 
of  unprofitable  columns  was  limited  to  60  m  to  minimize  the  mining  of  unprofitable 
material, while ensuring full cave establishment.   
 
A large number of possible extraction level options were initially tested, leading to the 
conclusion that the most suitable arrangement was to establish three panels – Block 1 
(B1), Block 2 (B2), and Block 3 (B3) - with B1 and B2 on the same elevation and B3 on a 
lower elevation. B3 would mine the down-plunge western extension of the deposit and 
could mine underneath B2 if necessary.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009
Page 17-21
SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
Further work was then carried out to establish the optimum elevation of the B1 and B2 
undercut, the western limit of B2, and the elevation and eastern limit of the B3 undercut.  
The undercut level for B1 and B2 was set at a nominal elevation of 5,085 m and for B3, 
at 4,965 m. 
 
To enable a single cut-off parameter to be used, AMC added an NSR Value field to the 
Combined Resource Model.  Each of the different rock types - supergene, mesogene, 
and hypogene - have different recoveries and concentrate grades, which impact on the 
NSR Value calculation.  
 
PRODUCTION ESTIMATES USING PCBC 
An assessment of the recoverable tonnage and grade from the deposit was carried out 
on behalf of AMC by Stratavision Pty Ltd. (Stratavision).  The PCBC software program 
was used for this assessment.  Key inputs to the PCBC modelling process include the 
estimated shape of the draw cones, the percentage of fines, the mixing horizon and the 
sequence  of  extraction.    Three  cases  were  modelled  using  a  set  of  Expected,  Best 
Credible, and Worst Credible parameters. 
 
PCBC PRODUCTION SEQUENCING 
An  extraction  sequence starting  in  the  southwest  corner  of  B2  and  progressing to  the 
northwest  corner  of  B1  was  used  in  all  cases.  B3  was  scheduled  to  commence  after 
completion  of  the  western  drawpoints  in  B2.    The  undercut  face  was  maintained  at  a 
nominal angle of 45° to the strike of the orebody.  The production schedule for B3 was 
run independently of B1 and B2.  In reality, the far eastern drawpoints of B3 will incur 
slightly more dilution than indicated, due to the presence of caved waste in the depleted 
western portion of B2. 
 
The scheduling method used takes the total required tonnage and divides it amongst all 
the  active  drawpoints  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  material  remaining  in  each  draw 
column.    Thus  the  higher  columns  are  drawn  down  faster  and  the  lower  ones  more 
slowly.  The aim is to close off all the drawpoints at approximately the same time.  This is 
more  difficult  to  achieve  if  there  are  significant  variations  in  economic  column  heights 
between drawpoints.  This was experienced in B1 where the far eastern drawpoints had 
to be “trimmed” to a maximum Height of Draw (HOD) of 350 m

PRODUCTION ESTIMATES USING CAVE-SIM 
In addition to using PCBC, an assessment of the recoverable tonnage and grade from 
the  deposit  was  carried  out  using  the  three-dimensional  particle  flow  code  Cave-Sim.  
The  code  is  broadly  based  on  the  concept  of  cellular  automata,  in  which  cells  are 
considered as discrete objects that are categorized by individual "state" parameters that 
evolve  dynamically.    This  allows  very  large  systems  to  be  studied  with  very  simple 
discrete  equations  that  are  calibrated  against  empirical  knowledge.    The  three 
dimensional  cellular  automata  in  Cave-Sim  consider  particle  friction,  particle  size 
distributions,  and  state  of  stress.    The  user  has  full  control  over  draw  rates  from 
individual  drawpoints  and  tracking  of  the  instantaneous  and  cumulative  grade  and 
particle size distribution through each drawpoint. 
 
COMPARISONS BETWEEN PCBC AND CAVE-SIM RESULTS 
In  the  Expected  and  Best  Credible  cases,  Cave-Sim  modelling  indicates  marginally 
higher levels of dilution than PCBC resulting in higher tonnages (+5%) and lower grades 
(-2%  to  -3%).    However,  the  differences  are  small  and  within  the  accuracy  of  the 
estimating process.  
 
ADJUSTMENT FOR ORE LOSSES 
Both PCBC and Cave-Sim programs provide estimates of the tonnage and grade of the 
material  that  can  potentially  be  recovered  under  a  given  set  of  draw  control  rules.    In 
practice, events will occur that limit the ability to achieve these estimates.  Adjustments 
to  the  schedules  resulted  in  an  overall  reduction  of  approximately  4%  in  the  tonnage 
output.
2009 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
A  Mineral  Reserve  estimate  was  compiled  by  AMC  based  upon  a  revised  resource 
model  as  described  in  the  Mineral  Resource  section  of this  report.   The  2009  Mineral 
Reserve estimate was based upon the use of the PCBC software for estimation of the 
mineral reserves within the planned block cave operation.  The undercut elevations were 
unchanged  from  the  2007  Mineral  Reserve  estimate,  however,  the  operating  cost 
assumptions  for  the  drawpoint  shut-off  grade  were  revised  to  match  the  current  cost 
estimates.    PCBC  parameters  were  the  same as  the “expected”  case  in  the feasibility 
study work.

A lower grade pillar previously left between the B1 and B2 blocks has been mined and 
the B2 block has been expanded by rows of drawpoints to the west.  This expansion to 
the west reduces the amount of material in the B3 block bring some production ahead 
and  reducing  haulage  costs.   There  are two  rows  of  B3  drawpoints  which  are  located 
beneath the B2 cave. 
 
The PCBC program includes dilution material and the draw height has been limited to a 
maximum of 350 m to account for the losses that will occur due to less than ideal draw 
control,  damage  to  drawpoints  and  the  loss  of  drawpoints  that  have  not  reached  the 
shut-off grade at the end of the mine life. 
 
The drawpoint production predicted from the PCBC model is shown in Table 17-11 along 
with the resource classification of material within the total.

There  will  be  inferred  and  unclassified  mineral  resource  material  which  will  be  mined 
from the block cave, and segregation of the material is not possible.  The inferred and 
unclassified  material  is  considered  to  carry  some  grade,  though  the  material  has 
insufficient  certainty  to  be  Measured  or  Indicated  Resource.    For  the  purposes  of 
estimating  the  Mineral  Reserves,  which  by  CIM  definitions  include  diluting  materials, 
Scott Wilson RPA has included the tonnage of this inferred and unclassified material with 
the grades reduced by 50%.  Scott Wilson RPA considers this material to be mineralized 
dilution, which will be included in the Mineral Reserve estimate and within the production 
plan. 
  
CLASSIFICATION OF MINERAL RESERVES 
There  is  a  large  volume  of  the material  within  the  planned  cave  that  has  a  Measured 
Resource  classification.    However,  due  to  the  uncertainty  associated  with  estimating 
material movement within the cave, and the absence of any historical production versus 
forecast  reconciliation,  a  Probable  classification  has  been  applied  to  the  reserve 
because of the uncertainty. 
 
MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
The  Mineral  Reserve  estimate  for  the  New  Afton  Project  is  presented  in  Table  17-13.  
The Mineral Reserve has been estimated using the resource block model prepared by 
New Gold and confirmed by Scott Wilson RPA.

19 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
The New Afton deposit is being developed as a block cave mining operation to produce 
4 Mtpa of copper-gold ore for processing in a flotation plant for the recovery of copper in 
concentrates  and  gold  in  concentrates.    Underground  development  is  underway  using 
New Gold crews which replaced the mining contractor crews and resumed development 
in February 2009.  There is supporting infrastructure at the site including access, offices, 
staff, equipment, and a concrete batch plant.  The new mill building has been erected 
and the grinding mills are mechanically installed.  No significant surface construction was 
underway at the time of the site visit and the focus is on underground development and 
project planning and engineering.  This report considers the development of the Project 
from the end of the second quarter of 2009 onwards.  
 
Previous underground mining studies related to the New Afton Project were completed 
by AMC as part of the Feasibility Study prepared by Hatch Ltd. (Hatch) in 2007.  AMC 
completed additional engineering work subsequent to the Feasibility Study.  AMC based 
its work on geotechnical, hydrological and geological information, including the Mineral 
Resource estimates, provided either directly by New Gold or other consultants involved 
in the Feasibility Study. 
 
In  the  preparation  of  this  Technical  Report,  Scott Wilson  RPA  has  reviewed  the  mine 
design work by AMC, as well as the capital and operating cost estimates prepared for 
and after the 2007 Feasibility Study.  It is Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion that the precision 
and  level  of  detail  applied  to  the  design,  scheduling,  and  cost  estimation  work  is 
appropriate  and  consistent  with  the  level  of  engineering  and  the  state  of  the  Project 
development.  Scott Wilson RPA has used the design and descriptions as generated by 
AMC as the basis for this section of the report. 
 
In the Feasibility Study, a staged start-up over a period of years was proposed, however, 
with  the  changes  to the  Project  execution  plan,  the  strategy  is  to  move  directly  to  the 
planned production rate of 4 Mtpa.   
 
Development  of  the  underground  mine  is  the  longest  lead  time  item  in  the  Project 
development.    The  Project  construction  schedule  has  been  designed  such  that
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009
Page 19-1

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
interconnections  between  independent  development  areas  are  established  as  soon  as 
possible.  Refuge chambers will be installed at suitable locations in each development 
area until the interconnections are established.  
 
Initial ore from development, undercutting, and production drawpoints will be stockpiled 
in a temporary run-of-mine stockpile area adjacent to the mill.  Milling operations were 
scheduled to commence in month 37, when the mine production and surface stockpile 
will provide sufficient ore for the mill to ramp up to 4 Mtpa over a three-month period.
MINING OPERATIONS 
MINE DESIGN 
During the mining method selection process for the feasibility study, studies were carried 
out  to  determine  the  most  suitable  production  rate  the  Project.  Initially,  a  staged 
production build was proposed starting with an annualized rate of 1.6 Mtpa for a nominal 
two-year period and then increasing to a maximum production rate of 4.0 Mtpa.  With the 
break  in  the  construction  schedule  caused  by  New  Gold’s  response  to  the  global 
financial crisis, there has been time to advance the planning and mine development and 
the  current  strategy  is  to  commence  operations  and  ramp  up  to  the  4.0  Mtpa  rate 
immediately after start-up.
MINING METHOD 
Block caving is proposed for the New Afton deposit after consideration of the following 
mining methods:
•  Non-Caving Methods
•  Open pit mining 
•  Sublevel open stoping (SLOS) with cemented backfill 
•  SLOS with uncemented backfill 
•  Post pillar cut & fill
•  Caving Methods
•  Core & shell (open stoping with mass blasting of pillars) 
•  Sublevel caving (SLC) 
•  Block caving
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
AMC  concluded  that  open  pit mining  was  uneconomical,  open  stoping methods  would 
not be practical, and caving methods that started from the top (sublevel caving) would 
commence in the poorest ground conditions and in the supergene ore.  Therefore, block 
caving  was  chosen  because  this  method  starts  from  the  bottom  and  is  conducive  to 
large-scale low-cost mining. 
 
A number of block cave footprints were prepared to test the sensitivity of the Project to 
minimum  span  criteria  and  a  large  number  of  possible  extraction  level  options  were 
initially  tested.    It  was  concluded  that  the  most  suitable  arrangement  was  to  establish 
three panels, with Block 1 (B1) and Block 2 (B2) on the same elevation and Block 3 (B3) 
on a lower elevation.  The locations of the blocks relative to the open pit are shown in 
Figure 19-2.

GEOMECHANICS  
Geotechnical  investigations  of  the  New  Afton  deposit  were  completed  by  AMC  for  the 
Feasibility Study.  AMC compiled a report setting out the relevant geotechnical aspects 
of the Project.  The key geotechnical considerations relating to the design and operation 
of the Project are summarized below. 
 
GEOTECHNICAL DOMAINS  
The deposit is divided into three geological domains, based on the nature of the copper 
mineralization:
•  Hypogene (primary): Chalcopyrite ± chalcocite, with silicification and K-spar
flooding, and variable calcite veins.
•  Mesogene  (transition):  Chalcopyrite,  chalcocite,  bornite,  plus  calcite  veins
and argillic alteration.
alteration.
The following geotechnical domains were defined:
•  Supergene:  Native  copper,  chalcocite,  plus  variable  hematite  and  argillic
•  Supergene mineralization  
•  Transitional (mesogene) mineralization  
•  Primary (hypogene) mineralization  
•  Fault Impacted Zone  
•  Footwall (waste) rock.
With  further  drilling  and  underground  exposures,  the  geotechnical  domains  may  be 
refined in future.   
 
The Fault Impacted Zone (FIZ) is a narrow (up to 20 m wide)  zone of extremely poor 
ground  conditions  immediately  adjacent  and  parallel  to  the  Hanging  Wall  Fault.    In 
addition to geotechnical domains, there is a picrite body to the south of the Hanging Wall

diabase dykes also intersect the deposit.  Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks lie to 
the north of the deposit, but do not impact directly on the underground project, although 
these areas will be partially impacted by surface settlement.  
 
The most prominent fault sets which impact on mine design are:
•  Hanging Wall Fault Zone  
•  Footwall Fault  
•  Northeast faults  
•  Northwest faults  
•  North faults  
•  Various picrite intrusives associated with major fault zones
Microfracturing  is  pervasive  throughout  the  deposit  and  is  most  intensely  developed 
where alteration is most intense.  The intensity of microfracturing has not been recorded 
in  geological  logs.    However,  it  is  expected  that  microfracturing  will  prove  to  be  a 
significant  factor  in  cave  development  and  fragmentation,  and  to  a  lesser  degree  in 
development stability.  
 
Rock quality  varies  broadly  from  extremely  poor  to good,  with  an  average  of fair. The 
best  ground  conditions  are  found  within  the  hypogene  mineralization  and  the  worst, 
within the intensely altered FIZ, the Hanging Wall Fault Zone, the adjacent picrite, and 
where major faults intersect the supergene mineralization.  
 
GEOTECHNICAL DATABASE AND MODEL 
There is a geotechnical database which includes the majority of the total drilling.  Drilling 
coverage  is  good  within  and  close  to  the  mineralized  zones,  but  decreases  as  the 
distance  from  the  main  mineralized  areas  increases.  Specific  drilling  has  provided 
geotechnical information in areas of key mine infrastructure.  There is clear evidence of 
deterioration of the core over time, particularly in the weaker materials.  
 
All geotechnical logging by New Gold has been based upon Bieniawski’s original 1976 
version  of  his  rock  mass  rating  system,  the  RMR76.    AMC  reviewed  the  raw 
geotechnical  data  provided  by  New  Gold,  and  generated  RMR76  values  during  post-
processing.    The  resulting  database  has  been  incorporated  into  a  geotechnical  block 
model.

The New Afton drill hole database includes the following geotechnical data:
www.scottwilson.com
Jointing intensity and condition (as per Bieniawski, 1976)  
Joint roughness (recorded separately to joint condition)
•  Core recovery and RQD  
•  Fractures per metre  
• 
• 
•  Fracture / faulting code with core angle  
•  RMR76 (Bieniawski) – calculated field from the above  
•  RMR90 (Laubscher) – estimated from RMR76.
A  database  of  small-scale  structures  (joints,  fractures  and  veins)  has  been  prepared 
from  surface  pit  and  underground  mapping,  and,  based  on  a  limited  program  of 
laboratory strength testing and field point load index testing, the rock mass unconfined 
compressive strengths were estimated.  The virgin rock stress was measured during the 
study by overcoring of Hollow Inclusion (HI) cells in hypogene mineralization, exposed in 
the underground exploration crosscut. 
 
To  facilitate  an  empirical  assessment  of  cavability,  a  conversion  to  Laubscher’s  RMR 
(1990  version)  was  completed  based  on  relogging  of  selected  boreholes.    This 
correlation  is  considered  satisfactory  for  broad  indications  of  behaviour,  such  as  in  a 
cavability assessment. 
 
A geotechnical block model was prepared for both the mineralized zones and the host 
rocks.  The  block  model  is  based  upon  simple  kriging,  with  search  ellipses  based  on 
geometry  and  statistical  analyses,  and  criteria  applied  for  minimum  samples  per  cell.  
The model  contains  blank  cells  where  there  is  insufficient  drilling to  satisfy  the  search 
criteria.  Underground  exposures  provided  a  good  opportunity  to  compare  the  block 
model with actual conditions, and the comparisons were good on the scale of groups of 
cells (tens of metres).  
 
CAVABILITY 
The cavability of a deposit defines the ability of the orebody and overlying rock mass to 
cave freely and spontaneously, once undercut to a sufficient dimension.  Experience has 
shown  there  is  a  relationship  between  the  competence  of  a  rock  mass  and  the 
dimensions of the undercut required to initiate and sustain caving.  One of the design 
challenges is to determine the undercut dimensions required for caving of the given rock 
mass and to relate that to the orebody geometry available.

Once initiated, caving is ideally a continuous process, providing sufficient void remains 
below the cave back to enable new failures to occur. This void is created by continuous 
production from the base of the cave, drawing down the broken caved material.  
 
At New Afton, the dominant failure mechanism is projected to be structural collapse of 
the  rock  mass,  i.e.,  there  are  sufficient  natural  planes  of  weakness  in  a  variety  of 
orientations for the rock mass to be unstable when undercut by a sufficient area.  
 
The cavability of the New Afton deposit is represented by two end-members of a range 
of  changing  orebody  geometries  and  ground  conditions.    In  the  east,  the  deposit  is 
relatively  wide,  close  to  surface,  and  with  a  higher  proportion  of  poorer  ground 
conditions.  Outside the FIZ domain, some of the poorest ground conditions are located 
in the Supergene ore at the far eastern ends of the deposit.  Conversely, in the west, the 
hypogene  orebody  is  more  narrow,  deeper,  and  located  within  some  of  the  most 
competent ground conditions in the deposit. 
 
As mentioned earlier in this section, it is proposed that the deposit will be mined using 
three  block  cave  panels,  B1,  B2,  and  B3.    Figure  19-3  shows  the  undercut  footprints 
(blue outlines) for B1 and B2.  Using these outlines the hydraulic radii (area/perimeter) 
for the three panels are as follows:
•  B1 and B2: HR = 34 m 
•  B3: HR = 31 m
Based  upon  experience,  there  is  no  doubt  the  eastern  areas  of  the  orebody  will  cave 
readily.    Further  assessment  of  cavability  is,  however,  required  for  the  central  and 
western areas of the deposit, especially where the orebody geometry narrows in the far 
west (and at depth).  The cavability of the New Afton deposit has been assessed using 
two techniques: empirical and numerical stress analysis. 
 
The empirical assessments of cavability indicate adequate cave development in B1 and 
B2,  and  marginal  cavability  for  B3.    Although  B3  is  indicated  to  be  cavable,  from  the 
Laubscher  Cavability  Chart  (Figure  19-4),  the  margin  from  the  indicated  “non-caving” 
zone  is  small.    The  north-south  span  for  B3  in  particular  is  recognized  as  a  potential 
issue.

The  Abaqus  non-linear finite  element  stress  analyses  indicated  that  a minimum  north-
south span of 95 m was required and that caving would initiate at a hydraulic radius (HR) 
of ≈  32   m.    This  was  based  on  hypogene  rock  properties.    Again,  this  provides  for 
adequate cavability for B1 and B2, but marginal cavability for B3.   
 
The role of major structures has not been considered in either the empirical or numerical 
assessments of cavability.   Major faults will assist cave development, especially in B1 
which  contains  a  high  proportion  of  the  weaker  mesogene  rock  mass.  The  structural 
environment associated with B3 is not currently well defined and it is recommended that 
this be a focus for future data collection and investigative programs.  B3 production is 
significantly later than B1 and B2, providing time for such studies. 
 
UNDERCUTTING SEQUENCE 
A  number  of  undercutting  sequencing  alternatives  were  evaluated,  but  the  sequence 
selected  was  B2  first,  followed  closely  by  B1,  both  adopting  a  southwest  to  northeast 
undercut direction.  B3 (far west, and deeper) would be mined last. 
 
The  preferred  undercutting  sequence  included  consideration  of  the  predominant 
structural  fabric,  the  principal  stress  direction  and  the  results  of  numerical  modelling.  
The  numerical  modelling  indicated  that  a  significant  zone  of  yield  is  likely  to  occur 
beneath the undercut level, as caving extends upwards. Damage zones also extend a 
significant distance into the surrounding rock mass adjacent to the caves, and suggest 
the  undercuts  should  extend  30  m  to  40  m  ahead  of  drawbell  construction.    This  has 
been implemented in the Project schedules. 
 
CAVE CONTINGENCY PLANNING 
Two options are considered to mitigate any potential risks of poor cave performance:
•  Pre-conditioning, and/or 
•  Cave assistance.
Pre-conditioning refers to the use of various techniques to generate additional fracturing 
in  the  rock  mass,  to  reduce  rock  mass  strength,  prior  to  the  commencement  of 
undercutting.  Cave assistance refers to methods used to weaken the rock mass within 
the  desired  cave  column,  after  caving  has  commenced,  in  response  to  areas  of  poor 
cave performance.  It is not envisaged that pre-conditioning will be required in B1 and B2

at  New  Afton.    However,  pre-conditioning  using  blasting  or  hydraulic  fracturing 
techniques is an option for B3. 
 
FRAGMENTATION 
An assessment of the size distribution of broken rock at the extraction level drawpoints 
was carried out by Stratavision Pty Ltd.  The block cave fragmentation (BCF) software 
program  was  used  for  this  assessment.    The  program  provides  an  indication  of  the 
primary  fragmentation  resulting  from  the  initial  caving  processes  and  the  secondary 
fragmentation that occurs when material higher up in the orebody is broken up as it is 
drawn down towards the drawpoints. 
 
The work indicates that the New Afton deposit is highly fractured within all geotechnical 
domains  and  the  proportion  of  the  caved  rock  mass  that  will  pass  2  m3  (a  standard 
industry guideline) will be close to 100% for all areas, but with some potential for more 
coarse material during the early stages of caving in the hypogene material. 
 
Sensitivity  analysis  of  the  fragmentation  estimates  to  changes  in  fracture  frequency  in 
the  potentially  more  competent  hypogene  domain  in  the  lower  portion  of  B3  indicates 
that  a  primary fragmentation  of  77%  <2 m³  is  possible.    The  secondary fragmentation 
remains high with 98% <2 m³. Some large blocks may therefore be expected to report to 
the drawpoints in the early stages of production within this domain. 
 
Only a small percentage of hang-ups and oversize rock (greater than 2 m3) reporting to 
the drawpoints are expected. 
 
SURFACE SUBSIDENCE 
Underground mining by caving methods will result in surface subsidence.  Subsidence 
from massive underground three-dimensional orebodies is not well defined, the methods 
of analysis are not standardized, and the subsidence is normally discontinuous.   
 
The impact of the subsidence above the New Afton deposit has been evaluated by both 
empirical  and  numerical  methods.    The  empirical  assessment  of  cave  limits  is  only  a 
crude analysis, but is sufficient as a preliminary guide to possible surface effects.

The  Crater  Zone  (cave  limit;  discontinuous  deformations)  developed  using  empirical 
methods is shown in Figure 19-5. The diagram also shows an exclusion zone (equivalent 
to  the  Cave  Influence  Zone)  within  which  there  is  potential  for  (elastic,  continuous) 
subsidence effects to occur.  Permanent or difficult to replace surface infrastructure has 
been excluded from this area. 
 
The numerical assessment used a novel design approach, combining the merits of draw 
simulation  using  Cave-Sim  with  a  non-linear  stress  analysis  of  the  ultimate  cave 
geometry.  However, the model is uncalibrated, and naturally such a model includes a 
number of important simplifying assumptions.  The numerical analyses considered two 
variations  on  rock  mass  material  properties,  “Best”  and  “Worst”,  but  did  not  include 
discrete geological structures.   
 
Figure 19-6 shows the extent of subsidence effects estimated using numerical modelling.  
The  diagram  shows  two  surface  outlines  resulting  from  the  Abaqus  modelling  of  the 
cave,  termed  “Best  Credible”  and  “Worst  Credible”,  together  with  the  surface  outline 
resulting from the analysis of ‘underground mining on pit slope’ stability.  Slope damage 
in  the  northern  slopes  occurs  during  the  mining  of  B1.    This  zone  grows  during  the 
subsequent mining of B3, and the failure zone extends along the Tertiary contact in the 
northern slope. 
 
The  subsidence  crater  and  the  influence  zone  will  expand  gradually  as  underground 
mining  progresses.    Monitoring  of  ground  behaviour  will  follow  the  progression  of 
underground  and  surface  effects,  and  provide  early  indications  of  any  unexpected 
behaviour,  to  allow  contingency  plans  to  be  implemented.    Automated  pit  slope 
monitoring is an ongoing exercise at the site.

GROUND SUPPORT 
Stress  analyses  were  undertaken  to  determine  the  likely  stability  of  the  undercut  and 
extraction levels for B1 and B2, where production for the initial years will take place, and 
where  ground  conditions  are  slightly  poorer.  Specific  assessments  for  B3  were  not 
carried out but will be required in the future, during a period of refinement of B3 layout 
and designs. 
 
The support systems include 24 mm diameter full-column grouted rockbolts, cable bolts, 
F56  gauge  weldmesh,  mesh  straps,  and  fibre-reinforced  shotcrete.    Two  or  three 
Henderson-style steel sets will be used in each drawpoint brow, and special measures 
are  recommended  to  protect  drawpoint  pillar  noses.    The  proportions  of  ground 
conditions  in  different  categories  were  considered  based  upon  statistical  analyses  of 
geotechnical data and the block model. 
 
MAJOR EXCAVATIONS STABILITY 
Stress  analysis  studies  of  the  proposed  crusher  chamber  demonstrated  there  is  no 
interaction expected with the cave zones, and that the extent of yield around the crusher 
chamber  will  be  limited  to  local  re-entrants  and  brows.    No  other  specific  stability 
assessments were undertaken for other mine infrastructure. 
 
MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MONITORING PROGRAM 
A Ground Control Management Plan (GCMP) will be required.  This is a ‘live’ document 
which captures all the key features of the operation’s ground control policies, practices, 
and procedures.  The GCMP would include:
•  Details of the standard support designs.
•  An outline of the conditions under which variations from those standards are
permitted.
•  The authorities / responsibilities for making any changes.
•  The support specifications in use at the mine.
•  A summary of the geotechnical monitoring programs in use at the mine.
A Geotechnical Monitoring Program will be an essential component of the Project’s rock 
mechanics program.  The program will need to be established, operated, and maintained 
by a qualified rock mechanics engineer throughout the life of the Project.  The objective
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009

of the monitoring program will be to provide data to enable the safe management of the 
mine in respect of the major mine hazards. 
 
These hazards include but are not limited to:
www.scottwilson.com
Inrush risk (mud, water, and airblast).
•  Cave initiation, propagation, and surface impact/subsidence. 
• 
•  Major excavation stability (undercut and extraction levels, crusher). 
•  Mine seismicity.
CAVE MONITORING 
Monitoring of the cave is important and is planned to be done via borehole monitors and 
remote sensing.  Draw control is also important and the draw must be managed.  The 
recommended  monitoring  programs  for  both  surface  and  underground  are  outlined 
below. 
 
Surface monitoring should include the following:
•  Precise levelling across an array of monitoring stations distributed within and
outside the predicted subsidence zone.
•  Open holes for monitoring of cave progression. These holes will be focused 
on  the  central  and  western  areas  of  the  deposit.  A  total  of  12  holes  are 
recommended.
•  Extensometers  or  time-domain  reflectometry  (TDR)  cables  also  placed  in 
surface  boreholes  drilled  down  to  intersect  the  proposed  cave  at  different 
elevations.
Underground monitoring should include the following:
•
‘Smart’  extensometers  for  monitoring  ground  movements  on  the  undercut 
and extraction levels.
•  Additional absolute virgin stress measurements.
•  A Seismic Monitoring System.
A  draw  control  plan  should  be  designed  and  monitored,  recording  and  managing  the 
production  from  the  drawpoints  as  well  as  recording  and  monitoring  conditions  at  the 
drawpoints.

MUDRUSH POTENTIAL 
An assessment of the mudrush potential was completed for the 2007 Feasibility Study.  
There is a potential for mudrush hazard to develop during the life of the mine, due to the 
following:
www.scottwilson.com
•  Potentially mud-forming rock types exist within the cave material.
•  Potential for significant water inflow from terrestrial sources.
•  Potential  for  localized  ingress  of  groundwater  into  the  cave  material  along
prominent structures and ungrouted drill holes.
•  Potential  for  ingress  of  wet  mud  and  fines  from  the  Afton  pit  as  the  cave
breaks through the pit floor.
•  The  generation  of  progressively  increasing  volumes  of  fines,  due  to
comminution of the cave material as the cave matures.
The  generation  of  fines  within  the  Afton  block  cave  is  an  unavoidable  product  of  the 
caving  process.    As  a  result,  it  is  recommended  that  engineering  measures  and 
procedures  be  developed,  with  the  focus  on  minimizing  the  passage  of  water  into  the 
cave muck pile and on reducing the accumulation of fines within the cave muck pile by 
developing strict draw control strategies. 
 
The  following  specific  controls  are  recommended  to  minimize  the  potential  for  the 
development of mudrush hazards:
•  Develop and implement a draw management plan.
•  Conduct a drawpoint monitoring program to identify the nature of the material
•  Reduce the water content of the debris in the bottom of the pit such that the 
material  is  not  subject  to  liquefaction  when  disturbed  by  subsidence  or 
movement within the cave.
•  Minimize  and  control  water  inflow  into  the  cave  muck  pile  at  every
opportunity.

•  Remove  all  free  water  from  the  New  Afton  open  pit  before  mining
www.scottwilson.com
SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
The  potential  mudrush  hazard  has  been  based  on  limited  information  especially  as 
related to the potential for fines generation within the cave muck pile.  Additional rock 
property  tests  are  recommended,  including  slake  durability  tests,  for  the  specific  rock 
types representative of those expected within the cave muck pile. 
 
HYDROGEOLOGY 
A hydrogeological evaluation was carried out to determine the present pit water balance 
and to predict likely inflows to the block cave.  Total groundwater inflow to the pit/block 
cave  is  predicted  to  increase  from  about  4  L/s  to  5  L/s  under  present  pre-mining 
conditions, rising to about 8 L/s during block cave operations. 
 
The highest transient inflows are predicted to occur once the back of the cave starts to 
fail and the zone of fracturing starts to migrate to the surface.  Based on a six month 
period between the completion of the undercut and the initiation of surface subsidence, 
simulated flows ranged from 11 L/s to 17 L/s for the 0.5% and 1.0% porosity cases, with 
short  term  peak  flows  up  to  about  26  L/s.    The  transient  flows  are  considered  upper 
bound  and  will  be  re-assessed  during  initial  mine  developed  and  once  the  undercut 
development is initiated. 
 
PIT DEWATERING AND DEBRIS STABILIZATION 
Based upon a bathymetric survey and the final pit survey, it has been estimated that the 
pit contains approximately 2.6 Mm3 of supernatant water and 0.6 Mm3 of rock and soil 
debris.  That volume was estimated to be increasing by about 0.15 Mm3 per year.  
 
It  is  proposed  to  stabilize  the  debris  material  prior  to  block  caving  operations.    The 
strategy involves removal of the supernatant water by pumping.  Once the free water has 
been removed, a road will be constructed across the pit on top of the debris to access a 
series of up to 40 dewatering wells that will penetrate the full thickness of the debris to 
the  base  of  the  pit.    Submersible  pumps  in  each  of  the  wells  will  continue  to  remove 
water  until  the  moisture  content  of  the  debris  has  been  reduced  to  approximately  its 
liquid limit.  Further consolidation will be achieved by either vacuum pumping from the 
existing wells or mechanical compaction. 
 
The  objective  is  to  dewater  to  fines  content  of  the  debris,  to  approximately  midway 
between its liquid limit and its plastic limit, so that a mudflow cannot occur.  A period of

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
approximately two years has been allowed for this process to be completed and verified, 
prior to commencement of caving in B1. 
 
At  the  time  of this  report, the  dewatering  of the pit  was  underway  with  a forecast  280 
days of pumping left to complete the initial dewatering.  This would lead to completion of 
the first phase of dewatering near the end of the second quarter of 2010.
BLOCK CAVE DESIGN 
UNDERCUT DESIGN 
The undercut design is shown in Figure 19-7.  The undercut will be mined from crosscuts 
driven at a nominal centreline spacing of 13 m.  A low height undercut is proposed with a 
flat section over the drawbell and an “A” shape forming the crown of the major apex.  A 
vertical interval of 17 m floor to floor has been adopted between the undercut level and 
the  extraction  level  below.    This  distance  is  a  reasonable  compromise  between  the 
reduced stress effects on the extraction level achieved by increasing the interval and the 
practical  issues  associated  with  mining  drawbells  with  a  high  level  of  consistency  and 
reliability. 
 
It is proposed that the undercut crosscuts will be mined 3.6 m wide by 4.0 m high.  An 
access drive 5.5 m wide and 5.5 m high will be mined on the north side of the deposit.  A 
slot drive will link the southern extremities of the crosscuts.  The undercut crosscuts will 
be mined at a nominal gradient of 1:50 (2.0%) to the south. As the development will be 
driven down grade, face pumps will be necessary during the development stage.  Drain 
holes  down  to  the  extraction  level  will  be  drilled  where  necessary.    Each  undercut 
crosscut  will  be  ventilated  using  an  auxiliary  ventilation  duct,  both  during  development 
and when retreating the undercut.

It  is  estimated  that  approximately  45%  of  the  material  blasted  in  the  undercut  will  be 
extracted on the undercut level using 6-tonne to 7-tonne capacity load-haul-dump (LHD) 
units.  This material will be tipped in ore passes leading to the ore transfer level.  Five 
2.4 m diameter passes from the B1 and B2 undercut level are proposed for this purpose.  
In order to maintain an overall undercut face angle of approximately 60° to the strike of 
the  deposit,  the  cave  face  position  in  each  crosscut  will  need  to  lag  the  face  in  the 
adjacent westerly crosscut by a minimum of 22.5 m. 
 
The undercut will be drilled using 64 mm diameter holes at a ring spacing of 2.1 m.  The 
inclination  of  the  rings  will  be  designed  to  reduce  the  lag  between  undercut  face 
positions in adjacent crosscuts to a minimum.  Approximately 93 m of drilling per ring will 
be  required.    A  number  of  slot raises,  up  to  12  m  long,  will  be  required  to  initiate  the 
undercut,  a  Cubex  in-the-hole  (ITH)  drill  rig  with  pneumatic  hammers  mounted  on  a 
Roger V-30 reaming head is proposed for this work. 
 
DRAWBELL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 
Drawbell drives were designed at 4.0 m high x 3.6 m wide to provide adequate clearance 
for  the  drilling  equipment.    Drawbells  will  be  constructed  by  drilling  twin  760  mm  pilot 
raises with a Cubex rig, and approximately 1,360 m of 64 mm blastholes with a hydraulic 
top hammer production drill.  Pumped emulsion explosives and electronic detonators will 
be  required  to  give  the  highest  level  of  control  and  predictability  over  the  blast.  
Drawpoint support work will be completed prior to firing the drawbell. 
 
EXTRACTION LEVEL DEVELOPMENT 
The extraction level crosscuts will be accessed from a 5.5 m wide x 5.5 m high access 
drive on the north side of the deposit. An offset herringbone layout is proposed, with the 
access crosscuts being 3.6 m wide by 3.6 m high, after application of surface support. 
These dimensions are suitable for the use of either diesel or electric LHD units.  
 
Ore  will  be  trammed  back  to  short  2.4  m  diameter  ore  passes  connected  to  the 
production crosscut. Only one LHD will operate in a crosscut at any time and will only 
enter the access drive when moving from one production crosscut to the next, or when 
travelling  to  the  workshop  for  maintenance.  This  arrangement  avoids  interaction  with 
other LHDs or with development and ground support equipment that will need to use the 
access drive.

To allow for the long life required, ground support standards will be high with extensive 
use of fibrecrete, rockbolts, and cables.  Concrete roadways will be constructed in the 
extraction level crosscuts. 
 
Intake  air  will  enter  the  level  from  the  access  drive  and  flow  past  the  drawpoints  to 
exhaust ventilation raises at the southern end of the crosscuts leading to the ventilation 
level below.  Ventilation raises will be fitted with small fans to control airflow. 
 
Crosscuts  will  be  graded  down  at  1:50  (2.0%),  towards  the  ventilation  raise  such  that 
water  from  the  drawpoint  dust  suppression  system,  plus  any  groundwater  emanating 
from the cave, flows to the raise and thus to the main collection sumps.  It is proposed 
that water sprays installed at the drawpoints will be automatically controlled by vehicle 
movement sensors. 
 
DRAWPOINTS 
Drawpoints were designed to accommodate 6-tonne to 7-tonne capacity LHDs at 3.4 m 
wide by 3.4 m high.  Drawpoints will be heavily supported with rockbolts, fibrecrete, and 
Henderson  style  sets.    Figures  19-8  and  19-9  show  a  typical  drawpoint  arrangement.  
The  tonnage  drawn  through  each  drawpoint  will  vary  from  14,000  tonnes  for  those 
drawpoints whose purpose is only to extend the cave footprint to achieve the minimum 
span required for caving, up to 165,000 tonnes.  Concrete roadways will be constructed 
in  all  drawpoints,  with  steel  wear  rails  embedded  in  the  concrete  in  those  drawpoints 
where in excess of 75,000 tonnes is planned to be extracted.  Drawpoints will be fitted 
with automatic dust suppression sprays, activated when a loader enters the drawpoint.

ORE AND WASTE HANDLING 
As  part  of  the  Feasibility  Study,  a  trade-off  study  to  assess  the  merits  of  using  either 
shaft or conveyor haulage for ore transfer to surface was completed.  Conveyor handling 
was chosen as a lower overall cost alternative. 
 
ORE AND WASTE HANDLING REQUIREMENTS 
During  the  initial  development  of  the  mine,  all  ore  and  waste  will  be  trucked  to  the 
surface. Following commissioning of the underground crushing and conveying system, 
truck haulage in the conveyor decline will be limited to delivery of bulk materials to the 
mining areas and possibly some waste transfer to surface.  
 
Approximately 12% of the ore to be mined will originate from B3, located approximately 
120 m below the crusher feed position.  Ore from this area will be mined later in the mine 
life and will be trucked up to the crusher via a decline. 
 
A summary of the estimated total quantity of ore and waste mined over the life of the 
Project is shown in Table 19-1 and Figure 19-10. 
 
Prior  to  installation  of  the  underground  crusher  and  conveyors,  ore  and  waste  will  be 
trucked to the surface using a fleet of 50 tonne capacity articulated haul trucks.  Trucking 
routes out of the mine will include the conveyor ramp, except during installation of the 
conveyor,  and  the  existing  exploration  ramp.    Either  route  could  be  used  for  ore  and 
waste but, in general, ore will be trucked via the conveyor ramp to a stockpile adjacent to 
the mill and waste, via the exploration ramp for disposal in the open pit.  It is envisaged 
that waste hauled to the surface via the conveyor ramp will be placed on top of the future 
subsidence area. 
 
The  estimated  total  average  annual  ore  and  waste  movement  during  the  initial 
construction period is shown in Figure 19-10.  Material movement requirements will peak 
at approximately 2,400 tonnes per day prior to crusher commissioning (Q2 2012).  The 
material  movement 
is 
commissioned and ramps up to a peak of 11,900 tonnes per day.

CONVEYOR DECLINE 
The  conveyor  decline  has  been  designed  at  a  gradient  of  1:6  (16.7%)  with  four  legs, 
varying in length from 700 m to 1,200 m.  Transfer stations were designed at the head 
and tail end of each leg.  The cross-sectional dimensions, at 5.5 m wide by 6.5 m high, 
provide  adequate  clearance  for  a  loaded  50-tonne  capacity  truck  and  the  conveyor 
structure.  A typical cross-section through the conveyor decline is shown in Figure 19-12. 
 
The  decline  is  being  developed  using  drill  and  blast  techniques  with  diesel  powered 
trucks and large capacity LHDs.  Ground support for the decline includes the use of rock 
bolts and fibrecrete.   
 
It  is  proposed  that  the  conveyor  structures  would  be  of  modular  construction  and 
suspended  from  chains  attached  to  the  back  of  the  decline.    The  following  belt 
specification was used in the Feasibility Study:
•

CONVEYOR TRANSFER ARRANGEMENTS 
The  design  philosophy  for  the  transfer  stations  is  to  minimize  the  excavation  volume 
required;  to  keep  maximum  excavation  spans  below  10  m;  to  simplify  installation, 
maintenance and belt replacement activity; and to provide belt replacement facilities at 
the head end using a 4.5 m high roll of belting. 
 
The geometry of the conveyor decline results in shallow angles at the transfer points.  A 
transfer  arrangement  having  separate  head  end  and  tail  end  chambers  with  a  short 
interconnecting ore bin was selected on the basis of its relative simplicity and lower cost. 
 
With the exception of the portal conveyor, each conveyor will be driven from the head 
end using dual drives. The head end drive floor will be elevated, providing a roadway 
beneath  the  floor  for  maintenance  vehicle  access  to  the  head  end  chamber  and  belt 
reeling station. 
 
A tail end belt take-up arrangement was selected for all transfer stations as it provides 
the  best  combination  of  minimizing  excavation  spans  and  overall  excavation  volume.  
The  conveyor  decline  and  transfer  stations  were  designed  such  that  trucks  and  other 
vehicles using the decline do not have to pass through the transfer chambers. 
 
INSTALLATION OF CONVEYOR SYSTEM 
At various stages during the installation of the conveyor system, it will be necessary to 
suspend  trucking  activities  in  the  conveyor  decline.    During  these  periods,  ore  will  be 
trucked to surface via the alternative route through the open pit portal and the open pit 
access road to the mill stockpile.  
 
To  speed  the  installation  process,  it  is  envisaged  that  idler  frames  in  6  m  lengths 
complete with idlers  will be pre-assembled on surface and delivered down the decline 
and  installed  using  a  suitably  modified  scissor-lift  truck.    Laser  survey  control  will  be 
used to align the holes for the conveyor suspension bolts and the idler frames. 
 
ORE TRANSFER FROM THE EXTRACTION LEVEL TO THE CRUSHER 
LHDs operating on the extraction level will feed ore to short ore passes leading to the 
ore transfer level located approximately 17 m below.  No grizzlies are proposed at the
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
top  of  the  passes,  which  will  be  sized  to  accept  the  largest  possible  rock  capable  of 
being delivered by the 6-tonne to 7-tonne capacity LHDs. 
 
Two 17-tonne capacity LHDs will load ore from the base of the ore passes and tram it to 
the crusher dump pocket.  In order to protect the ore pass brows from excessive wear, 
steel  sets  embedded  in  high  strength  fibrecrete  similar  to  those  proposed  for  the 
production drawpoints will be installed at the base of each pass.  Brow chains will also 
be fitted at the bottom of the passes.  The passes will be fitted with level sensors and 
lights on both the extraction and transfer levels to ensure the brow of the pass is always 
kept closed.   
 
Dual tramming routes were designed on the transfer level to avoid interaction between 
haulage units.  There is the potential for fully automated operation of the loaders on this 
level. 
 
The transfer drives were designed at 5.5 m wide by 4.0 m high and will be mined at a 
nominal  gradient  of  1:40  (2.5%).    A  high  strength  concrete  road  bed  will  be  installed 
along with embedded steel wear bars in the crosscuts leading to the base of each pass. 
 
CRUSHER 
A  150-tonne  to  600-tonne  capacity  crusher  dump  pocket  designed  to  allow  two-sided 
tipping  by  LHDs  and  single  side  tipping  by  50-tonne  capacity  trucks  will  be  installed 
above a 2.4 m wide apron feeder.  The feeder will control the feed rate to a 2,000 mm x 
1,500 mm nominal size single toggle jaw crusher.  A fixed rock breaker installed at the 
crusher feed hopper will minimize production delays due to crusher bridges. 
 
The  crushed  material  is  discharged  into  a  pocket  and  bin  of  approximately  200-tonne 
capacity located directly below the crusher outlet cavity.  The crushed ore bin discharges 
onto the picking conveyor belt, where a tramp metal detection and collection system will 
remove metal objects before ore is fed to the main decline belt system.  
 
Ore from B3 will be trucked from a truck loading bay near the extraction drift directly to 
the  crusher  dump  pocket  or  to  a  short  pass  adjacent  to  the  crusher.    A  maximum 
production rate of approximately 1.8 Mtpa has been scheduled from B3.

WASTE HANDLING 
It  is  envisaged  that  waste  mined  after  commissioning  of  the  crusher  and  conveyor 
system will be trucked to surface via the conveyor decline, however, provision has also 
been  made  for  waste  to  be  batched  through  the  system  on  an  as-needs  basis.    The 
short ore pass adjacent to the crusher designed to handle ore from B3 will be used as a 
waste  storage  pass.    Very  little  waste  will  be  mined  once  ore  production  commences 
from B3. 
 
The transfer tower at the head end of the portal conveyor will be fitted with a head chute 
and a two-way transfer to either the mill feed conveyor or waste conveyor.
PRE-PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 
Exploration of the New Afton deposit included an underground drive and access from the 
512 m elevation of the open pit.  This development provided a starting point for the mine 
development coupled with a new portal for the conveyor gallery collared near the mill.  
Mine  development  commenced  in  2007  and  continued  until  November  2008,  when  it 
was halted to conserve cash in the difficult financial markets.  The mine development in 
2007 and 2008 was carried out by a mining contractor, Cementation Inc.   
 
Mine  development  restarted  in  February  2009  as  New  Afton  changed  from  contractor 
mining to owner mining.  The mine development is advancing the conveyor galleries and 
the main access.  Initial ore from development, undercutting, and production drawpoints 
will be stockpiled in a temporary stockpile area adjacent to the mill.  Milling operations 
were scheduled to commence in month 37 and will increase to the planned production 
rate of 4 Mtpa over a three-month period.  Operations are proposed to continue at the 
planned rate for 11 years. 
 
Lateral development scheduling has been completed using the following assumptions:
•  All  remuck  bays  have  been  designed  and  included  in  the  estimate  of  total
taken from the resource block model.
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009
Page 19-34
drift metres.
•  An  allowance  for  overbreak  of  10%  of  the  designed  excavation  volume  is
added when estimating tonnages of waste from development.
•  Waste is assigned a density of 2.6 t/m³. The density of development ore is
SCOTT WILSON RPA
www.scottwilson.com
•
•  The advance of any single heading is limited to a maximum of 30 m/week. In 
the case of the extraction level crosscuts and undercut development, this is 
reduced to 20 m/week.
•  The maximum drawpoint development rate is scheduled at 10 m/week.
In  multiheading  development  situations,  the  maximum  development  rate 
scheduled per development jumbo is limited to 50 m/week.
•  Development of the extraction level crosscuts and drawpoints are scheduled 
in two stages. Initially, the crosscut is advanced to its southern extremity. A 
minimum  period  of four weeks  is  scheduled  to  pour  and  cure the  concrete 
roadway before development of the first drawpoint.
•  Construction  of  drawpoints  and  drawbell  crosscuts  is  scheduled  after  the
roadway is complete and the undercut has passed overhead.
•  All bored raises are scheduled at an average advance rate (including rig up,
piloting, reaming, and rig down activities) of 30 m/week.
•  All  distances  are  based  on  the  centreline  to  centreline  distance.  The 
exception  to  this  is  the  extraction  level  drawpoints  where  the  length  is 
measured from the wall of the extraction crosscuts.
PROGRESS TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2009 
Actual  development  by  Company  crews  for  the  period  February  to  September  2009 
totalled  1,072  m  vs.  the  budget  of  1,490  m.    The  shortfall  in  advance  reflects  the 
development  and  training  of  new  mining  crews  and  limited  heading  availability.  
Management  indicates  that  this  development  shortfall  is  being  addressed  by  moving 
from 5 day per week 10.5 hour shifts to 7 day per week 11 hour shifts.  Development 
rates will also benefit from the availability of close-spaced multiple headings in 2010.   
 
Productivity rates used in the LOM reflect actual productivity to date.  Development cost 
to date is $6,829/m to the end of September based on mining and maintenance costs, 
but excluding indirects, such as general and administration (G&A) costs.  Comparable 
LOM  development  costs  are  $5,733/m.    The  LOM  cost  estimate  reflects  increasing 
expertise  within  the  crews,  increased  efficiencies  resulting  from  24:7  operation  and 
longer shifts, and multiple close-spaced headings.  Actual productivity to date was taken 
into account in estimating advance rates for the LOM.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
MINE ACCESS 
The deposit is bounded on the southern side by a major fault structure (the Hanging Wall 
Fault and Picrite), which is considered to be difficult to cross; therefore, the permanent 
access and underground infrastructure has been designed on the north (footwall) side of 
the deposit. 
 
The existing exploration portal (located within the open pit) and decline provided early 
access for the undercut and extraction level development and a conveyor decline portal 
has been developed close to the proposed mill site at an elevation of 674 m. 
 
After  the  commencement  of  production,  caving  will  cause  access  through  part  of  the 
exploration decline to be lost.  Prior to this occurring, a service raise (VR5), equipped 
with  an  emergency  hoisting  system  will  be  installed  to  provide  a  separate  connection 
between the mine workings and surface. During the remaining life of the mine, the main 
access  will  be  via  the  conveyor  decline,  with  the  service  raise  and  hoisting  system 
providing a second means of egress for use in an emergency. 
 
MINE VENTILATION 
The  primary  ventilation  circuit  will  be  a  push-pull  system  with  six  main  surface  fans 
installed on three intake shafts and three exhaust shafts.  The conveyor decline will be 
an exhaust airway.  The total required airflow has been estimated at 500 m3/s.  Exhaust 
raises will be 3.5 m diameter and will each have an airflow of approximately 140 m3/s, 
with an additional 80 m3/s returning via the conveyor decline.  The three intake raises will 
be 3.5 m diameter and will each have an airflow of approximately 167 m3/s.    
 
Flow  rates  and  pressures  in  the  proposed  ventilation  circuit  were  modelled  using 
Ventsim  software.    Six  horizontally  mounted  axial  flow  fans  are  proposed  to  meet  the 
required duty.  A number of secondary and booster fan arrangements within the mine will 
ensure distribution of air to all working areas.  
 
Simple, robust and automated circuit control devices are proposed to create an efficient 
ventilation  system.    Automatically  activated  water  sprays  will  be  fitted  to  production 
drawpoints  on  the  extraction  level  to  minimize  dust.    Dust  extraction  systems  will  be 
installed on orepasses, at conveyor transfer points and in the crusher station.

AMC has estimated an average surface rock temperature at New Afton of approximately 
12°C and a geothermal gradient of approximately 3°C per 100 m depth. There is some 
potential for hot working conditions to be encountered in the deeper parts of the mine 
while intensive development is being undertaken (particularly during summer), but these 
situations  can  be  avoided  provided  that  secondary  ventilation  systems  are  properly 
designed, installed, and maintained. 
 
Between  1978  and  1993,  approximately  23%  of  days  at  New  Afton  had  average 
temperatures  below  freezing.  To  avoid  the  problems  associated  with  air  intake 
temperatures consistently below freezing, it is proposed to install natural gas, direct fired 
heating plants on each of the intakes. These plants will be installed near the portals with 
warm air ducted to the portal entrances and the intake raises. Only a portion of the air 
entering the portals will be heated. The quantity and temperature of the heated air will be 
adjusted to maintain the overall temperature of air entering the mine above freezing. 
 
UNDERGROUND SHOPS AND SERVICES 
An  underground  workshop  will  be  constructed  adjacent  to  the  extraction  level  for  the 
mobile equipment fleet maintenance.  An underground fuel bay will be installed with a 
dedicated return airway and a fire suppression system.  An underground magazine has 
been designed to hold approximately one week’s consumption of explosives, with supply 
from surface through regular visits from explosives suppliers.  
 
Lunch room and refuge station facilities will also be installed on the extraction level. 
 
MINE DEWATERING 
The  underground  pumping  system  is  designed  as  a  staged  system  with  an  installed 
pumping capacity of 50 L/s.  The main pumps will be remotely monitored and controlled.  
 
COMPRESSED AIR AND ELECTRICITY 
A mine-wide compressed air system is not planned for the entire mine.  A local system 
will  be  installed  in  the  workshop  and  crusher  area  for  maintenance  and  other 
miscellaneous activities.  Compressed air for other activities will be provided by on-board 
and mobile compressors.  Electrical power will be reticulated through the mine at 13.8 kV 
via a ring main system.

COMMUNICATIONS 
The proposed mine communications system includes telephone communications (voice 
over internet), a leaky feeder radio network, an asset tracking system, video monitoring 
systems and programmable logic control systems for pumps, fans and ventilation control 
systems, ore pass level monitoring, crushing and conveying systems. 
 
MINE EQUIPMENT 
The current mine equipment fleet is in service for the development of the mine access.  
As the undercut development proceeds, there will be additional equipment required for 
the long hole drilling and then for mine production.  The current mine equipment fleet is 
shown in Table 19-2.

The  average  recovery  of  mercury  and  arsenic  to  the  concentrate  is  estimated  to  be 
70.7% and 67.6%, respectively.  Recovery for copper, gold, and silver was estimated as 
outlined in Section 16, plus a factor of 87% was applied to 2012 recoveries to account 
for start-up uncertainty.

MARKETS 
The New Afton mine’s principal commodities are copper concentrates containing copper 
and gold and doré containing gold.  The principal commodities are freely traded at prices 
that  are  widely  known  so  that  the  prospects  for  the  sale  of  production  are  virtually 
assured.    
 
Copper is a principal metal traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and has total 
price  transparency.    Prices  are  quoted  on  the  LME  for  Copper  Grade  A  and  can  be 
found at www.lme.com.  The average copper price for the first nine months of 2009 was 
$2.11 per pound. Current prices as of September 30, 2009, are $2.81 per pound.  The 
three-year and five-year rolling average prices through the end of September 2009 are 
$2.92  and  $2.61  per  pound,  respectively.    This  Technical  Report  uses  the  long-term

CONTRACTS 
New  Afton  does  not  have  contracts  in  place  for  mining,  construction,  Engineering, 
Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM), operating supplies and reagents, 
concentrate  shipping  or  concentrate  treatment.    Scott  Wilson  RPA  expects  that  all  of 
these  items can  be  organized  in  a  timely  manner  before  operations  commence.   New 
Afton does not plan to engage mining contractors for the underground development or 
production.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The New Afton Project lies within the Interior Plateau subdivision of south-central British 
Columbia.    The  area’s  complex  geology,  glacial  history  and  continental,  semi-arid 
climate have given rise to many regional landscapes.  The Project area lies at about 720 
MASL and drains into Kamloops Lake, the second-largest water body contained in the 
Thompson River watershed, a major tributary of the Fraser River.  Much of the Project 
area  has  been  greatly  altered  such  that  natural  undulating  grasslands  formed  on  till-
covered  drumlinoid  terrain  and  interspersed  by  numerous  small,  alkaline  water  bodies 
have  been  replaced  by  level  rock  dumps,  open  pits,  and  severely  compacted  borrow 
areas.    The  dominant  water  bodies  are  now  related  to  mining-related  impoundments.  
The  baseline  environmental  studies  undertaken  considered  both  the  natural  and 
anthropogenic landscapes.  The two primary landscape types are:
•  Extensively disturbed areas, reconfigured and/or reclaimed as a result of historic
mining activities and infrastructure development; and
•  Undisturbed  landforms,  which  are  similar  to  those  that  existed  prior  to  the 
development  of  the  New  Afton  mine,  consist  of  Ponderosa  Pine–bunchgrass 
vegetation  interspersed  by  discontinuous  alkaline  water  bodies  and  ephemeral 
drainage altered by grazing land use.
Environmental studies undertaken for the Project included:
a)  Climate studies, air quality, meteorology 
b)  Noise  
c)  Emissions analysis 
d)  Surficial geology, topography, terrain and soils  
e)  Surface water quality and quantity

f)  Groundwater quality and quantity  
g)  Hydrological modelling for water balance management  
h)  Pit Lake bathymetry  
i)  Aquatic  resources  including  fish  and  fish  habitat,  wetlands,  primary  and
secondary producers, physical limnology
j)  Terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation  
k)  Invasive plants  
l)  Wildlife, including species at risk  
m)  Land status and use  
n)  Land capability  
o)  Archaeology  
p)  Metal leaching and Acid Rock Drainage status and potential
Environmental baseline studies were undertaken on the Project site between April and 
December 2006.  All baseline studies were implemented in accordance with provincial 
data  collection  guidelines  where  applicable,  and  generally  accepted  scientific 
procedures.  The  objectives  and  results  of  baseline  studies  were  reviewed  with  the 
Kamloops  Indian  Band  and  Skeetchestn  Indian  Band  in  support  of  project-related 
consultations.
PERMITTING 
On October 31, 2007, the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (MEMPR) 
issued  Mine  Permit  M229  approving  the  work  system  and  reclamation  program  in 
respect  of  the  New  Afton  Project.    The  Mine  Permit  obligates  the  New  Gold  to  post 
reclamation  security  in  the  aggregate  amount  of  $9.5  million.  The  initial  installment  of 
$3.5 million was posted by the New Gold pursuant to a Safekeeping Agreement dated 
November 6, 2007, between New Gold, Bank of Montreal, and the MEMPR. 
 
In  addition  to  the  Mine  Permit,  a  number  of  permits,  consents,  and  authorizations  are 
required  to  develop  the  Project.  Table  19-11  sets  out  the  permits  which  have  been 
obtained, permits required by the Province of British Columbia, and permits required by 
the Government of Canada.

including  preferential  hiring,  education,
SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
comprising  the  New  Afton  Project.    Discussions  with  these  Bands  commenced  in 
February  2006.    After  a  number  of  meetings,  information  exchanges  and  discussions, 
the  Bands  and  New  Gold  signed  letters  of  intent  in  September  2006  which  provided 
among other things for an exchange of information and continued dialogue between the 
parties.    Further  discussions  with  the  Bands  during  2007  and  2008  culminated  in  the 
execution and delivery of a formal agreement between the Bands and New Gold dated 
March 20, 2008 (the “Participation Agreement”).   
 
One  of  the  principal  objectives  of  the  Participation  Agreement  is  to  establish  a 
cooperative  and  mutually  beneficial  working  relationship  between  the  Bands  and  New 
Gold  with  respect  to  the  development  and  operation  of  the  New  Afton  Project.    The 
Participation Agreement provides that the Bands consent to the New Afton Project and 
agree not to challenge before a court of law any New Gold interests or permits related to 
the  Project.    New  Gold  undertakes  to  provide  the  Bands  with  certain  economic  and 
social  benefits 
training  and  business 
opportunities.   
 
The Participation Agreement contemplates that New Gold  will pay to a  socioeconomic 
trust  to  be  created  for  the  benefit  of  Band  members  an  amount  of  $250,000  in  2009. 
Thereafter, each year in which commercial production occurs at the mine, an amount of 
0.5%  NSR,  or  a  minimum  of  $250,000  a  year,  shall  be  paid  to  the  trust,  with  the 
minimum payment to be increased to $500,000 for a given year if copper prices in that 
year exceed $2.50 a pound.  
 
After  the  costs  of  developing,  permitting,  constructing,  and  equipping  the  mine  have 
been  repaid  to  New  Gold,  the  payment  to  the  trust  will  increase  to  the  greater  of 
$1,000,000  a  year,  or  1%  of  NSR  in  that  year.  Should  copper  prices  exceed  $2.50  a 
pound in a given year, this payment will increase to 1.5% of NSR for that year.  Should 
copper prices exceed $3.00 a pound in a given year, this payment will increase to 2% of 
NSR for that year.  
 
The  Participation  Agreement  also  grants the  Bands  a  right  of first  refusal  to  purchase 
that portion of the Afton Surface Rights lying to the north of the Trans-Canada Highway

and south of Kamloops Lake in the event New Gold decides to sell these lands in the 
future separately and distinctly from the New Afton Project.
www.scottwilson.com
DECOMMISSIONING PLAN  
Information on successful practices for reclamation from past mining operations at the 
New Afton site will assist in the design of future reclamation efforts.  The New Afton mine 
decommissioning process will involve three distinct phases:
•  pre-decommissioning  
•  decommissioning  
•  post-decommissioning
The objective for all three phases will be to dispose of fixed machinery and buildings and 
to return the site to a condition acceptable to the Chief Inspector of Mines, MEMPR, as 
outlined in the Mines Act Permit.  This work will be in accordance with the objectives of 
Part 10, Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia. The Code 
requires that:
•  All machinery, equipment, and building superstructures shall be removed;
•  Concrete foundations shall be covered and revegetated unless, they have been
exempted by the inspector because of demonstrated impracticality;
•  All scrap material shall be disposed of in a manner acceptable to the inspector.
PRE-DECOMMISSIONING PHASE  
Decommissioning  activities  will  commence  in  the  final  year  of  mine  operations  with 
establishment of the decommissioning management team and submission of a tailings 
decommissioning plan. 
 
DECOMMISSIONING PHASE  
The  decommissioning  process  will  be  undertaken  by  a  number  of  contractors  with 
special skills or equipment. Those contractors are:
•  A  mechanical  contractor  to  clean,  dismantle  and  crate  process  and/or  large
pieces of mobile equipment;
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009
Page 19-50
•  A civil contractor to reclaim roads and waste dumps; 
•  A scrap dealer to cut up structural steel structures that cannot be sold;
•  A crushing plant contractor equipped with a dozer/ripper, drop ball, magnet and
crushing plant to crush the building floor slabs and piers;
•  A hydro seeding contractor to revegetate reclaimed areas;
•  An  auctioneer  to  sell  the  process  and  mobile  equipment,  buildings  and  office
furniture.
SCOTT WILSON RPA
www.scottwilson.com
•  An  electrical  contractor  to  disconnect,  remove  and  crate  for  sale;  controls,
•  A civil contractor to dismantle buildings, prepare the tailings dam for shutdown,
cabinets and transformers;
and remove-tailing lines;
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE  
The  stockpiles,  Pothook  pit  earth  dam,  the  visibility  berm,  and  the  dam  slopes  will  be 
monitored  for  bare  spots,  slumping,  and  erosion.  Any  failures  will  be  rectified.  The 
stockpiles  and  the  earth  dam  will  be  assessed  on  a  monthly  basis  until  the  cover  is 
stabilized and annually until it is required for reclamation.  The surface cover of the berm 
will be assessed in the spring and fall for erosion.  Any areas exhibiting erosion will be 
rectified.  
 
The  side  slopes  of  the  tailings  storage  facility  will  not  be  reclaimed  until  closure. 
However, slopes will be monitored on a monthly basis for water and wind erosion during 
operation. Surfaces exhibiting erosion will be amended.  
 
Other reseeded areas such as the pipeline corridor and the access road side slopes will 
be monitored for surface erosion and reseeded where required. 
 
POST-CLOSURE MONITORING  
All reclaimed areas will require monitoring until vegetation is well established.  Indicators 
of successful reclamation are high vegetative surface coverage and the absence of rills, 
gullies,  and  other  erosional  features.    A  soil  specialist  will  be  on-site  periodically  to 
provide guidance and make recommendations.  
 
The flat areas will be checked for surface coverage in the spring and fall for the first five 
years and annually for the next three years.  Any issues related to plant establishment 
 
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009

SCOTT WILSON RPA 
 
will  be  rectified.    Records  of  inspection  and  a  description  of  the  conditions  will  be 
recorded on-site.  
 
Reclamation of the TSF will require special attention because of the length of the slopes, 
the  low  fertility  of  the  materials,  the  fine  texture,  the  absence  of  soil  structure,  the 
potential for compaction, and the arid climate.  Monitoring will be carried out regularly to 
ensure that reclamation has been successful.  Areas exhibiting surface erosion will be 
amended. Records will be kept to assess the changes in percent bare ground or surface 
cover as well as plant health.  
 
At closure, a range management plan will be developed for the areas which will be used 
for grazing.  No animals will be allowed on the site for a minimum of three years to allow 
the  bunch  grasses  to  spread,  establish,  and  produce  seed.  Range  quality  will  be 
assessed in the spring and fall each year by a qualified professional who will determine 
range readiness.  Range will be assessed every three years once it is in use to ensure 
the range plan is suitable.  
 
All of the land which will be disturbed for the Project will be reclaimed. Traditional use in 
the area is cattle grazing on a landscape dominated by grasslands. The final end land 
use  will  be  to  develop  grasslands  which  will  be  used  for  cattle  grazing.  Rangeland  in 
British  Columbia  also  includes  wildlife  use.  Therefore,  the  final  reclamation  plan  will 
include  wildlife  considerations,  such  as  appropriate  fencing  and  the  development  of 
shelter areas for various birds and small animals.  
 
SUMMARY OF AREAS REQUIRING RECLAMATION  
The  stockpiles,  Pothook  Pit  Dam,  and  the  visual  berm  are  classified  as  temporary 
infrastructures.  Approximately  112.5  ha  of  flat  surfaces  will  have  received  final 
reclamation treatment upon closure. As well, the TSF, which comprises 37 ha of surface 
and 4.6 ha of access road slopes, will be reclaimed. Therefore, a total surface area of 
154.1 ha will have received final reclamation, with the remaining infrastructure treated to 
prevent wind and water erosion during the construction and operation of the mine.  
 
CLOSURE COST  
For the 2007 Feasibility Study, Hatch made preliminary factored estimates of the cost of 
removing  all  equipment  from  the  surface,  demolishing  the  buildings,  sealing  the 
 
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project

entrances  to  the  underground,  and  regrading  the  site.  The  resale  value  of  equipment 
and buildings was ignored. All underground equipment was left in place 
 
Rescan  Environmental  Services  Ltd.  (Rescan)  estimated  the  cost  of  redistributing 
stockpiled till and top soil and the cost of revegetation. Rescan also assessed the cost of 
addressing remaining legacy liabilities from the previous operator and estimated the cost 
of  post-closure  monitoring  (Rescan,  2007).  All  of  the  closure  cost  estimates  were 
prepared  in  accordance  with  MEMPR  guidelines  and  used  the  MEMPR  spreadsheet.

TAXES 
Scott Wilson RPA has relied on New Gold for guidance on applicable taxes, royalties, 
and  other  government  levies  or  interests,  applicable  to  revenue  or  income  from  the 
Project. 
 
The taxes applicable to the New Afton Project are:
New Gold Inc. – New Afton Project 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – December 31, 2009
Page 19-53
SCOTT WILSON RPA
www.scottwilson.com
•  BC net proceeds tax of 2% 
(cid:129)  BC revenue tax of 13% 
(cid:129)  BC income tax at a rate of 11% 
(cid:129)  Federal income tax at a rate of 15%.
The  BC  net  proceeds  tax  is  taken  against  the  revenue  less  operating  costs  including 
concentrate  treatment  and  transportation.    The  agreed  royalty  to  First  Nations  is  not 
deductible.
The  BC  revenue  tax  is  charged  on  gross  proceeds  less  the  cumulative  expenditure 
account, which is the sum of operating and capital costs, with a 33% premium added to 
preproduction capital.
The  federal  and  provincial  income  taxes  are  based  on  income  less  applicable  capital 
allowances.
CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES
The  preproduction  capital  budget  for  the  Project  is  summarized  in  Table  19-13.    The 
capital is stated in Q2 2009 Canadian dollars.  Sunk costs are not included in the capital 
summary.  Capital cost estimates have been prepared by AMEC, New Gold, and AMC in 
the course of the detailed engineering work which was being done by AMEC until mid-
2009 at which time the activity was essentially put on hold pending final financing.  The 
cost estimate included sunk costs and Project costs, with over 5,300 line items with cost 
estimates  for  labour  materials  and  contracts.    Capital  cost  estimate  revisions  and 
adjustments continue as Project optimization tasks are still underway.  The mine capital 
costs are built up from first principles for the mine development activities together with 
quotations for major equipment items.

PROJECT EXECUTION PLAN 
Development of the New Afton Project is underway, with the underground development 
being  undertaken  by  company  crews.    A  Project  team  is  in  place  with  administrative, 
technical (geology, mine and mill) and mine development personnel on staff.  There are 
also engineering consultants supporting the group. 
 
The current Project schedule is not in a finished form, this is an aspect of the Project 
planning  which  Scott  Wilson  RPA  recommends  be  addressed 
to  generate  a 
comprehensive Project development schedule including all of the changes in the Project 
since the 2007 Feasibility Study.  The change in the production rate will have changed 
the tailings requirements and the faster mining rate may have impacted on the timing of 
the  replacement  access  for  the  exploration  access  drift.    At  this  time,  the  mine 
development is clearly the critical path activity. 
 
At the time of the site visit, mine development was underway, the mill building had been 
erected, and the grinding mills were mechanically installed.  Clearing and development 
of the TSF had commenced and the dewatering of the Afton pit to the Pothook pit was 
underway.   
 
Mine  development  is  scheduled  to  continue  until  and  after  the  commencement  of 
production.  The development of the B3 zone has been deferred to reduce the upfront 
capital costs.  Mill construction is forecast to recommence at the start of 2011, with the 
mill planned to be in commissioning mode in Q2 of 2012 and operating at the start of Q3 
2012. 
 
New  Gold  will  continue  to  use  AMEC  for  engineering  and  procurement,  but  will  do 
construction  management  for  the  remaining  mill  construction  packages  with  its  own 
team, led by a recently hired construction manager.
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
A Cash Flow Projection has been generated from the Life of Mine production schedule 
and  capital  and  operating  cost  estimates,  and  is  summarized  in  Table  19-26.    A 
summary of the key criteria is provided below.

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 
Considering  the  Project  on  a  stand-alone  basis,  the  undiscounted  after  tax  cash  flow 
totals C$707 million over the mine life, and simple payback occurs after approximately 
4.5 years.
The Total Cash Cost is US$0.84 per pound of copper.   The mine life capital unit cost is 
US$0.69  per  pound  of  copper  and  the  byproduct  credits  are  US$0.89  per  pound  of 
copper, for a Total Production Cost of US$0.64 per pound of copper.  Average annual 
production during operation is 72 M pounds of copper and 76,000 ounces of gold.
The after tax NPV at a 5% discount rate is C$374 million, and the IRR is 19%.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic 
risks were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:
x  Metal prices 
x  Operating costs (Total Cash Cost) 
x  Capital costs
The 5% NPV after tax sensitivity over the base case has been calculated for -20% to 
+20%  variations.    The  sensitivities  are  shown  in  Figure  19-13  and  Table  19-27.    The 
Project is most sensitive to metal price and less sensitive to capital and operating costs, 
which are almost equally sensitive.

20 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA has carried out an audit of the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
estimates for the New Afton Project, and makes the following conclusions:
•  The drilling has been conducted in a manner consistent with industry standards.
•  The  core  handling,  logging  and  sampling  have  been  carried  out  in  a  manner
consistent with industry standards.
•  Sampling  and  assaying  has  been  conducted  in  a  manner  appropriate  for  the
deposit type and mineralization, and using industry-standard practices.
•  Assay QA/QC protocols are consistent with common industry standards, and no 
evidence  of  persistent  or  systematic  errors  has  been  found.    However,  the 
QA/QC has been inconsistently monitored and requires more timely review.
•  Density measurements are made in sufficient numbers and with an appropriate
methodology.
•  The database is generally free of serious errors although several inconsistencies 
have  been  found.    At  the  time  of  writing,  a  new  database  system  was  being 
installed, which will implement more rigorous validation procedures.
•  The Mineral Resource estimate has been carried out using generally reasonable
assumptions and parameters, and accepted practices.
•  Geological  interpretation  has  resulted  in  improvements  to  the  understanding  of 
several features of the deposit, particularly the faulting and the DMZ.  However, 
interpretations  of  the  mineralized  zone  boundaries  have  not  been  maintained, 
resulting  in  the  implementation  of  a  grade  shell  approach  to  constraining  the 
grade interpolation.  In Scott Wilson RPA’s opinion, it would be preferable to base 
the  resource  boundaries  on  lithological  and  mineralogical  characteristics,  if 
possible.
•  The updated Mineral Resource estimate is not materially different from the 2006 
estimate  used  in  the  2007  Feasibility  Study,  and  should  not  result  in  a  major 
change to the Mineral Reserves.
•  The assay database for deleterious elements has been markedly improved since 
the last estimate but still lags behind the economic elements in terms of numbers 
of samples and coverage.  Improvements could still be made to the block grade 
estimates for deleterious components.
•  The Mineral Resources should be quoted at a CuEq cut-off rather than a Cu cut-
off.

  The Mineral Reserve is estimated to be 47.4 million tonnes of Probable Mineral
Reserves grading 0.95% Cu, 0.69 g/t Au, and 2.03 g/t Ag.
  The  Mineral  Reserves  are  considered  to  be  amenable  to  underground  mining
through the use of block caving at a production rate of 4 Mtpa of ore.
  The preproduction capital cost is estimated to be C$460.9 million plus sustaining
capital of $172.3 million and not including sunk expenditures.
  The estimated LOM operating cost is $17.27 per tonne milled.
  Considering the Project on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted after-tax cash 
flow  totals  C$707  million  over  the  mine  life,  and  simple  payback  occurs  after 
approximately 4.5 years after the commencement of production.
  The Total Cash Cost is US$0.84 per pound of copper.   The mine life capital unit 
cost is US$0.69 per pound of copper and the byproduct credits are US$0.89 per 
pound of copper, for a Total Production Cost of US$0.64 per pound of copper.    
Average annual production during operation is 72 million pounds of copper and 
76,000 ounces of gold.
  The after-tax NPV at a 5% discount rate is C$374 million, and the IRR is 19%.

21 RECOMMENDATIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA makes the following recommendations:
  Based  upon  the  assumptions  and  estimates  within  this  study,  the  continued
development of the Project is recommended.
  Database validation protocols should be enhanced and rigorously observed.
  Geological interpretation and wireframing should continue with focus on the ore 
zones, in order to improve the constraints to the grade interpolations.  If possible, 
the  grade  shell  should  be  replaced  by  wireframes  based  on  geological 
characteristics.
  The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  should  be  quoted  at  a  0.4%  CuEq  cut-off.
Changing the cut-off does not materially affect the Mineral Reserves.
  Analytical  work  on  the  deleterious  elements  should  continue  in  order  to  allow
improvements to be made to the block models for these components.
  The review of the project execution plan which is currently underway should be 
continued and completed including incorporation of all of the modifications since 
completion of the 2007 Feasibility Study.
