<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Geneva Conventions 
of 12 August 1949 and the Protocols Additional thereto of 1977, and other relevant instruments 
of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as well as the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action,  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> article 32 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 
and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, which recognizes the 
right of families to know the fate of their relatives, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that article 33 of Additional Protocol I provides that the parties to an armed 
conflict shall search for the persons who have been reported missing, as soon as circumstances 
permit,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/177, in which 
article 24 (2) sets out the right of victims to know the truth regarding the circumstances of the 
enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and the fate of the 
disappeared person, and sets forth State party obligations to take appropriate measures in this 
regard, and the preamble reaffirms the right to freedom to seek, receive and impart information 
to that end,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking</i> <i>into account</i> resolution 2005/66 of the Commission on Human Rights and Council 
decision 2/105 on the right to the truth,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the right to the truth (E/CN.4/2006/91, A/HRC/5/7) and its significant 
conclusions related to the right to know the truth about gross violations of human rights and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that adequate steps to identify victims should also be taken in situations not 
amounting to armed conflict, especially in cases of massive or systematic violations of 
human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through 
action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II) and taking note with 
appreciation of the updated version of those principles (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1),  </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that the Human Rights Committee<b>1</b> and the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances (E/CN.4/1999/62) have recognized the right of the victims of gross 
violations of human rights and the right of their relatives to the truth about the events that have 
taken place, including the identification of the perpetrators of the facts that gave rise to such 
violations,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i>, in cases of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law, the need to study the interrelationship between the right to the 
truth and the right to access to justice, the right to obtain effective remedy and reparation, and 
other relevant human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the importance for the international community to endeavour to recognize the 
right of victims of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, and their families and society as a whole, to know the truth regarding such 
violations, to the fullest extent practicable, in particular, the identity of the perpetrators, the 
causes and facts of such violations, and the circumstances under which they occurred, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing also</i> that it is important for States to provide appropriate and effective 
mechanisms for society as a whole and, in particular, for relatives of the victims, to know the 
truth regarding gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that a specific right to the truth may be characterized differently in some legal 
systems as the right to know or the right to be informed or freedom of information,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that the public and individuals are entitled to have access, to the fullest extent 
practicable, to information regarding the actions and decision-making processes of their 
Government, within the framework of each State&#8217;s domestic legal system, 
</p>
<p>

</b>  <i>Official Records of the General Assembly</i>, <i>Fifty-first Session</i>, <i>Supplement No. 40</i> (A/51/40). </p>

 <p></p>

violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law to facilitate 
knowledge of such violations, to investigate allegations and to provide victims with access to an 
effective remedy in accordance with international law,  
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Recognizes</i> the importance of respecting and ensuring the right to the truth so as to

</p>
<p> 2.<i> Welcomes</i> the establishment in several States of specific judicial mechanisms and 
other non-judicial mechanisms such as truth and reconciliation commissions, that complement 
the justice system, to investigate violations of human rights and violations of international 
humanitarian law, and appreciates the elaboration and publication of the reports and decisions of 
these bodies; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Encourages</i> the States concerned to disseminate, implement and monitor 
implementation of the recommendations of non-judicial mechanisms such as truth and 
reconciliation commissions, and provide information regarding compliance with the decisions of 
judicial mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Encourages</i> other States to consider establishing specific judicial mechanisms and, 
where appropriate, truth and reconciliation commissions to complement the justice system, to 
investigate and address gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law;  
</p>
<p> 5.<i> Encourages</i> States to provide requesting States the necessary and appropriate 
assistance regarding the right to the truth by means of, among other actions, technical 
cooperation and exchange of information concerning administrative, legislative and judicial and 
non-judicial measures, as well as experiences and best practices that have as a purpose the 
protection, promotion and implementation of this right;  
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Encourages </i>all States that have not done so to consider signing, ratifying or acceding 
to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 7.<i> Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
prepare a comprehensive study, to be presented to the Council at its twelfth session, on best 
practices for the effective implementation of this right, including, in particular, practices relating 
to archives and records concerning gross violations of human rights with a view to create 
guidelines on protecting archives and records concerning gross human rights violations, and 
programmes for the protection of witnesses and other persons involved in trials connected with 
such violations;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report, to be 
presented to the Council at its fifteenth session, on the use of forensic experts in case of gross 
violations of human rights with a view to identifying trends and best practices in this regard;

thirteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 10<i>. Invites </i>special rapporteurs and other mechanisms of the Council, in the framework of
