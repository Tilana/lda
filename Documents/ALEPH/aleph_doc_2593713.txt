<P align=center><B>B2GOLD CORP. </B><BR><B>Up to US$100,000,000
</B><BR><B>Common Shares</B></P>
<P align=justify>This Prospectus Supplement, together with the accompanying
short form base shelf prospectus dated January 11, 2016 (the
&#147;<B>Prospectus</B>&#148;), qualifies the distribution (the 
&#147;<B>Offering</B>&#148;) of
common shares (each, an &#147;<B>Offered Share&#146;&#146;</B>) of B2Gold Corp.
(&#147;<B>B2Gold</B>&#148; or the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;) having an 
aggregate offering price of
up to US$100,000,000. B2Gold has entered into an equity distribution agreement
dated August 11, 2016 (the &#147;<B>Distribution Agreement</B>&#148;) with 
Canaccord
Genuity Corp., Canaccord Genuity Inc., HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. and HSBC
Securities (USA) Inc. (collectively, the &#147;<B>Agents</B>&#148;) pursuant to 
which
B2Gold may distribute Offered Shares from time to time through the Agents, as
agents, for the distribution of the Offered Shares, in accordance with the terms
of the Distribution Agreement. See &#147;Plan of Distribution&#148;. </P>
<P align=justify>The outstanding common shares of the Company (&#147;<B>Common
Shares</B>&#148;) are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the
&#147;<B>TSX</B>&#148;) under the symbol &#147;BTO&#148; and on the NYSE MKT LLC
(the &#147;<B>NYSE
MKT</B>&#148;) under the symbol &#147;BTG&#148;. On August 10, 2016, the last 
trading day before
the filing of this Prospectus Supplement, the closing trading price of the
Common Shares on the TSX was C$4.64 per Common Share and the closing trading 
price
of the Common Shares on the NYSE MKT was US$3.55 per Common Share. The TSX has
conditionally approved the listing of the Offered Shares offered hereunder,
subject to the Company fulfilling all of the listing requirements of the TSX.
The NYSE MKT has approved the listing of the Offered Shares offered hereunder.
</P>
<P align=justify>Sales of Offered Shares, if any, under this Prospectus
Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus are anticipated to be made in
transactions that are deemed to be &#147;at-the-market distributions&#148; as 
defined in
National Instrument 44-102 - <I>Shelf Distributions </I>(&#147;<B>NI 44-
102</B>&#148;),
including sales made directly on the TSX and the NYSE MKT or on any other 
existing
trading market for the Common Shares in Canada or the United States. The Offered
Shares will be
distributed at the market prices prevailing at the time of the sale or at prices
to be negotiated with purchasers. As a result, prices may vary as between
purchasers and during the period of distribution. <B>There is no minimum amount
of funds that must be raised under the Offering. This means that the Offering
may terminate after only raising a small portion of the offering amount set out
above, or none at all. </B>See &#147;Plan of Distribution&#148;. </P>
<P align=justify>B2Gold will pay the Agents compensation for their services in
acting as agents in connection with the sale of Offered Shares pursuant to the
terms of the Distribution Agreement equal to 2% of the gross sale price per
Offered Share sold (the &#147;<B>Commission</B>&#148;). The Commission shall be 
divided
equally between the Agents regardless of which Agent effects the sale. </P>
<P align=justify>As sales agents, the Agents will not engage in any transactions
to stabilize the price of the Common Shares. No underwriter or dealer involved
in the distribution, no affiliate of such an underwriter or dealer and no person
or company acting jointly or in concert with such an underwriter or dealer has
over-allotted, or will over-allot, securities in connection with the
distribution or effected, or will effect, any other transactions that are
intended to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities. </P>
<P align=justify><B>The purchase and ownership of Offered Shares is subject to
certain risks that should be considered carefully by prospective purchasers.
Please see &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in this Prospectus Supplement and the 
accompanying
Prospectus and the risk factors in the AIF (as herein defined) and other
documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, for a description of
risks involved in an investment in Offered Shares. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>The Offering is made by a Canadian issuer that is permitted
under a multi-jurisdictional disclosure system adopted by the United States to
prepare this Prospectus Supplement in accordance with Canadian disclosure
requirements. Prospective investors should be aware that such requirements are
different from those applicable to issuers in the United States. Financial
statements incorporated herein by reference have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (&#147;IFRS&#148;), and thus may not be comparable to
financial
statements of United States companies. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Prospective investors should be aware that the acquisition,
holding or disposition of the Offered Shares may have tax consequences,
including the Canadian federal income tax consequences applicable to a foreign
controlled corporation that acquires Common Shares. Such consequences for
investors who are resident in, or citizens of, the United States or who are
resident in Canada may not be described fully herein. Prospective investors
should read the tax discussion contained in this Prospectus Supplement under the
heading &#147;Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations&#148; and 
&#147;Certain United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations&#148; and should consult their own tax
advisor with respect to their own particular circumstances.</B><B><I>
</I></B></P>
<P align=justify><B>The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws may be affected adversely by the fact that the
Company is incorporated under the laws of the province of British Columbia, that
the majority of the Company&#146;s officers and directors and some or all of the
experts named in this Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus are
residents of a country other than the United States, and that a substantial
portion of the Company&#146;s assets and the assets of said persons are located
outside the United States. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>NEITHER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
(THE &#147;SEC&#148;) NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES REGULATOR HAS APPROVED OR 
DISAPPROVED OF
THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY OR DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT OR THE
ACCOMPANYING PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE
CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.
are affiliates of HSBC Bank USA, National Association, which acts as
administrative agent and a lender under the $350 million senior secured credit
facility entered into as of May 20, 2015, as amended from time to time (the
&#147;Credit Facility&#148;), of the Company and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. acts
as sole
lead arranger and sole bookrunner under the Credit Facility. Consequently, the
Company may be considered a &#147;connected issuer&#148; to HSBC Securities 
(Canada) Inc.
and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. under applicable Canadian securities legislation.
In addition, the Company&#146;s use of proceeds under the Offering may be deemed
a
conflict of interest within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;). See &#147;Relationship Between
the Company and Certain Agents
  (Conflicts of Interest)&#148; for further information. </B></P>
<P align=justify>Mr. George Johnson is a director of the Company and resides
outside of Canada. Mr. Johnson has appointed B2Gold Corp., Suite 3100, Three
Bentall Centre, 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V7X 1J1,
as his agent for service of process in Canada. Prospective investors are advised
that it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments obtained in
Canada against Mr. Johnson, even though he has appointed an agent for service of
process. </P>

<P align=center><B>CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES
INVESTORS</B><BR><B>CONCERNING MINERAL RESERVE AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES</B></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">We are permitted under a
multi-jurisdictional disclosure system adopted by the securities regulatory
authorities in Canada and the United States to prepare this Prospectus
Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus, including the documents incorporated
by reference, in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws,
which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. All mineral
resource and reserve estimates included in this Prospectus Supplement and the
accompanying Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, have
been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 <I>Standards of
Disclosure for Mineral Projects</I> (&#147;<B>NI 43-101</B>&#148;). NI 43-101 is
a rule
developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards
for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical
information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ significantly
from the mineral reserve disclosure requirements of the SEC set out in Industry
Guide 7. Consequently, mineral reserve and mineral resource information included
and incorporated by reference in this Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying
Prospectus is not comparable to similar information that would generally be
disclosed by U.S. companies in accordance with the rules of the SEC.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In particular, the SEC&#146;s Industry
Guide 7 applies different standards in order to classify mineralization as a
reserve. As a result, the definitions of proven and probable mineral reserves
used in NI 43-101 differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7. Under SEC
standards, mineralization may not be classified as a &#147;reserve&#148; unless 
the
determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and
legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.
Among other things, all necessary permits would be required to be in hand or
issuance imminent in order to classify mineralized material as reserves under
the SEC standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve estimates included and
incorporated by reference in this Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying
Prospectus may not qualify as &#147;reserves&#148; under SEC standards.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In addition, the information
included and incorporated by reference in this Prospectus Supplement and the
accompanying Prospectus uses the terms &#147;mineral resources&#148;, 
&#147;measured mineral
resources&#148;, &#147;indicated mineral resources&#148; and &#147;inferred 
mineral resources&#148; to
comply with the reporting standards in Canada. The SEC&#146;s Industry Guide 7 
does
not currently recognize mineral resources and U.S. companies are generally not
permitted to disclose mineral resources in documents they file with the SEC.
Investors are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the
mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into SEC defined
mineral reserves. Further, &#147;inferred mineral resources&#148; have a great 
amount of
uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or
economically. Therefore, investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or
any part of an inferred mineral resource exists. In accordance with Canadian
rules, estimates of &#147;inferred mineral resources&#148; cannot form the basis
of
feasibility studies or, except in limited circumstances, other economic studies.
It cannot be assumed that all or any part of &#147;indicated mineral 
resources&#148; or
&#147;inferred mineral resources&#148; will ever be upgraded to a higher 
category or that
such mineral resources or any &#147;measured mineral resources&#148; will be 
classified as
mineral reserves. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of the
reported &#147;measured mineral resources&#148;, &#147;indicated mineral 
resources&#148; or
&#147;inferred mineral resources&#148; included and incorporated by reference in
this
Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus is economically or legally
mineable. Disclosure of &#147;contained ounces&#148; in a resource is permitted 
under NI
43-101; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization
that does not constitute &#147;reserves&#148; by SEC standards as in-place 
tonnage and
grade without reference to unit measures. In addition, the documents
incorporated by reference in this Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying
Prospectus include information regarding adjacent or nearby properties on which 
we have no right to
mine. The SEC does not normally allow U.S. companies to include such information
in their filings with the SEC. For the above reasons, information included and
incorporated by reference in this Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying
Prospectus that describes our mineral reserve and resource estimates or that
describes the results of pre-feasibility or other studies is not comparable to
similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and
disclosure requirements of the SEC. </P>

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The price of gold decreased by

$1,184.25 per ounce on January 2, 2015 to $1,062.25 per ounce on December 31,
2015. As of August 10, 2016, the price of gold was $1,347.70. Current and future
price
declines could cause commercial production or the development of new mines to be
impracticable. If gold prices decline significantly, or decline for an extended
period of time, we might not be able to continue our operations, develop our
properties, or fulfill our obligations under our permits and licenses, or under
our agreements with our partners. This could result in us losing our interest in

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Properties not yet in production,
or slated for expansion, are subject to higher risks as new mining operations
often experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase, and production
delays and cost adjustments can often happen. Failure to achieve production or

risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Our business plans and
projections rely significantly on the planned exploration and development of our
non-producing properties. The exploration for and development of mineral
deposits involves significant risks that even a combination of careful
evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. While the discovery of
an ore body may result in substantial rewards, few properties that are explored
are ultimately developed into producing mines and no assurance can be given that
minerals will be discovered in sufficient quantities or having sufficient grade
to justify commercial operations or that funds required for development can be
obtained on a timely basis. Major expenses may be required to locate and
establish mineral reserves, to develop metallurgical processes and to construct
mining and processing facilities at a particular site. It is impossible to
ensure that the exploration or development programs we or any of our joint
venture partners plan will result in a profitable commercial mining
operation.</P>

commercially viable depends
on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:</P>

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In addition, as a result of the
substantial expenditures involved in development projects, developments are
prone to material cost overruns versus budget. The capital expenditures and time
required to develop new mines are considerable and changes in cost or
construction schedules can significantly increase both the time and capital
required to build the mine. The project development schedules are also dependent
on obtaining the governmental approvals necessary for the operation of a mine.
Substantial expenditures are required to build mining and processing facilities
for new properties. The timeline to obtain these government approvals is often
beyond our control. It is not unusual in the mining industry for new mining
operations to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase,
resulting in delays and requiring more capital than anticipated. </P>

mineral resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available
data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and
geological interpretation. Short-term operating factors relating to the mineral
reserves, such as the need for orderly development of the ore bodies or the
processing of new or different ore grades, may cause the mining operation to be
unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no

liabilities from previous owners or operators. We have been required to address
contamination at our properties in the past and may need to continue to do so in
the future, either for existing environmental conditions or for leaks or
discharges that may arise from our ongoing operations or other contingencies.
Contamination from hazardous substances, either at our own properties or other
locations for which we may be responsible, may subject us to liability for the
investigation or remediation of contamination, as well as for claims seeking to

management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These estimates,
however, and the assumptions upon which they are based, are subject to a variety
of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual
expenditures to differ from those estimates. If these estimates prove incorrect,
the total capital expenditures required to complete the Fekola Project may
increase. We cannot be assured that we will have access to sufficient financing
or generate sufficient cash flows to fund any increase in required capital
spending from the construction and development of the Fekola Project. There can
be no assurances that development and start-up costs and the ongoing operating
costs associated with the development of the Fekola Project will not be

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Namibian economy is highly
dependent on the mining sector, which, in 2015, was estimated at approximately
11.5% of GDP. Namibia is also highly dependent on foreign imports, including
fuel. These factors make the Namibian economy vulnerable to adverse commodity
price fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In addition, Namibia is a member
of the Southern African Customs Union (&#147;<B>SACU</B>&#148;), which provides 
for a
common external tariff and guarantees free movement of goods between its member
states. A high proportion of Namibia&#146;s trade is conducted with SACU members
and,
in its 2016 budget, the Namibian Ministry of Finance stated that a significant
risk for revenue growth is the projected reduction of SACU revenue. The
International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2016, Namibian SACU revenue
receipts will decline by approximately 51.5% from an estimated $10.3 billion in
2015 to a projected $6.8 billion in 2016. Accordingly, the Namibian Government
is highly dependent on SACU revenue, but Namibia&#146;s share of the SACU 
revenue is
expected to decline in the foreseeable future, as a result of which the Namibian
government may be compelled to introduce additional taxes or increase current
tax rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For
example, the Namibian government recently increased the
royalty on net sales of gold and silver from 3% to 4%.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Because our property interests and exploration activities

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Our operations in Burkina Faso
are subject to various risks, including political and economic considerations
such as civil and tribal unrest, war (including in neighbouring countries),
terrorist actions, criminal activity, nationalization, invalidation of
governmental orders, failure to enforce existing laws, labour disputes,
corruption, sovereign risk, political instability, the failure of foreign
parties, courts or governments to honour or enforce contractual relations or
uphold property rights, changing government regulations with respect to mining
(including royalties, environmental requirements, labour, taxation, land tenure,
foreign investments, income repatriation and capital recovery), fluctuations in
currency exchange and inflation rates, import and export restrictions,
challenges to our title to properties or mineral rights, problems or delays
renewing licenses and permits, opposition to mining from local, environmental or
other non-governmental organizations, increased financing costs, instability due
to economic under-development, inadequate infrastructure, and the expropriation
of property interests, as well as by laws and policies of Canada affecting
foreign trade, investment and taxation. As African governments continue to
struggle with deficits and depressed economies, the strength of commodity prices
has resulted in the gold mining sector being targeted as a source of revenue.
Governments are continually assessing the terms for a mining company to exploit
resources in their country. In this regard, the new mining code adopted by
Burkina Faso in July 2015 introduced changes to the mining legislation,
including changes affecting taxation, licensing, the requirement to pay a
preferred dividend to the state, requirements for employments of local personnel
or contractors and other benefits to be provided to local residents. The
exploitation license that was issued on July 8, 2016 in respect of the Kiaka
Project (the &#147;<B>Kiaka Licence</B>&#148;) requires mine construction at the
Kiaka
Project to be completed within two years of the issuance date, a timeframe that
the Company will probably not be able to meet. The Burkina Faso Mining Code
provides for two additional two year exemptions which can extend the period for
construction to a total of six years. If the construction has started and the
level of investment has exceeded 50%, an additional year for the construction
period can also be granted. If all of the exemption periods have been exhausted,
the government has the right to withdraw the Kiaka Licence. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be granted the exemptions for extending the time
frame to complete mine construction. If such exemptions are granted, there can
be no assurance that the mine construction can be completed in such time period.

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In addition, the enforcement by
us of our legal rights to exploit our properties or to utilize our permits and
licenses may not be recognized by the court systems in Burkina Faso, although in
certain circumstances we may agree to submit a dispute to an international court
of arbitration. Burkina Faso&#146;s status as a developing country may also make
it
more difficult for us to obtain required financing for our projects. </P>

protection, labour relations, repatriation of income or return of capital or our

<P align=justify><B><I>Failure to comply with Philippines regulations or
political and legal developments in the Philippines could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Constitution of the
Philippines provides that all natural resources are owned by the State which may
enter into a coproduction, joint venture or production sharing agreement with
citizens of the Philippines or corporations or associations whose capital is at
least 60% owned by Philippine citizens. Commonwealth Act No. 108, as amended
(the &#147;<B>Anti-Dummy Act</B>&#148;), provides penalties for, among others: 
(a)
Filipinos who permit aliens to use them as nominees or dummies so that the
aliens could enjoy privileges otherwise reserved for Filipinos or Filipino
corporations, and (b) aliens or foreigners who profit from the adoption of these
dummy relationships. It also penalizes the act of falsely simulating the
existence of minimum stock or capital as owned by citizens of the Philippines or
any other country in cases in which a constitutional or legal provision requires
that before a corporation or association may exercise or enjoy a right,
franchise or privilege, not less than a certain percentage of its capital must
be owned by such citizens. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Anti-Dummy Act likewise
prohibits aliens from intervening in the management, operation, administration
or control of nationalized business or enterprises, whether as officers,
employees or labourers, with or without remuneration, except that aliens may
take part in technical aspects only, provided (a) no Filipino can do such
technical work, and (b) it is with express authority from the Secretary of
Justice. The Anti-Dummy Act also allows the election of aliens as members of the
boards of directors or the governing bodies of corporations or associations
engaged in partially nationalised activities in proportion to their allowable
participation or share in the capital of such entities. Although we believe our
structure complies with all Philippine regulations, there is a risk that, given
the limited precedents to date in the country, it could be changed or
challenged. Our failure to comply with Philippines regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Since 2012, the granting of new mining
permits in the Philippines has been subject to significant restrictions pursuant
to a moratorium imposed pending new mining legislation. This legislation is not
final, but may impose significant new revenue-sharing obligations. Following the
2016 Philippine presidential election, the Philippine government has increased
its environmental enforcement efforts with respect to mining operations and
suspended certain companies' mining operations. It has also initiated an audit
of mining companies in the Philippines to assess their compliance with
technical, environmental and social requirements under applicable law. The
outcome of this audit at Masbate is not known at this time. In addition, the
newly identified head of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has
been quoted in the media as advocating stricter regulations for the mining
industry. Political developments, changes in Philippine laws or regulations, or
a determination that we are not in compliance with Philippine laws or
regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations
and financial condition.</P>

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Production at our mining
operations is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and B2Gold&#146;s 
relations
with its unionized and non-unionized employees. Some of our employees are
represented by labour unions under various collective labour agreements. The
collective bargaining agreement covering the workers at Limon Mine is effective
until July 1, 2018. The collective bargaining agreement covering the workers at
La Libertad Mine is effective until December 31, 2017. Any of the parties
involved may present a draft of a new collective bargaining agreement with 60
days prior to expiration date, although the existing collective bargaining
agreement will continue in effect until a new one has been approved. We may not
be able to satisfactorily renegotiate our collective labour agreements when they
expire and may face tougher negotiations or higher wage demands than would be
the case for non-unionized labour. In addition, existing labour agreements may
not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. In
addition, relations between us and our employees may be affected by changes in
the scheme of labour relations that may be introduced by the relevant
governmental authorities in those jurisdictions in which we carry on business.
Changes in such legislation or in the relationship between us and our employees
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Limon Mine has experienced
labour issues in the past, including work stoppages or suspension of operations
due to legal or illegal strikes or illegal road blockades. Time may be lost to
strikes (legal and illegal). In addition, our operations at La Libertad Mine
have been disrupted by work stoppages due to illegal road blockades. We are
continuing to seek a permanent solution to these disruptions; however, there can
be no assurance that a permanent solution will be found and that we will not
have to suspend operations again. Suspension of our operations at the Limon
Mine, La Libertad Mine or any of our other mines or properties could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In Namibia, due to high levels of
unemployment, and restrictive immigration policies applied by the Namibian
Ministry of Home Affairs, it may be difficult for us to obtain employment
permits for skilled personnel that may be required in exploration or mining
operations. In addition, Namibia suffers from high levels of poverty. Although
the Namibian government spends a significant proportion (the highest single
budget amount) on education, education initiatives and programs may take time to
take effect. Currently, a significant proportion of the Namibian work-force can
be classified as unskilled or semi-skilled labourers, as a result of which it
may be difficult for employers to find skilled personnel for
specialized tasks. Shortages of suitably qualified personnel in Namibia could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. </P>

could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial condition and may
impact our relationship with the communities in which we operate. They may
install road blockades, apply for injunctions for work stoppage and file
lawsuits for damages. These actions can relate not only to current activities
but also historic mining activities by prior owners and could have a material,
adverse effect on our operations. They may also file complaints with regulators
in respect of B2Gold&#146;s, and our directors&#146; and insiders&#146;, 
regulatory filings,
either in respect of us or other companies. Such complaints, regardless of
whether they have any substance or basis in fact or law, may have the effect of

<P align=justify><B><I>We may encounter conflicts with small scale miners in
certain countries which could have a material adverse effect on our
operations.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Small scale miners have been
operating in Aroroy, Masbate Province since 1979 without obtaining a valid
mining or processing permits issued by the government. Some of these mining and
processing operations are within the property of FRC, and there has been
evidence of contamination from tailing and effluent discharges within the
Masbate property boundary. Although FRC is not legally liable for their
contamination, FRC has attempted to limit the activities of these miners and
inform the public about the risk of contamination. In line with attempts to
limit and control their activities, FRC, in coordination with the local and
national governments, began a process to enter into agreements with small scale
miners. The agreements will require the formation of local cooperatives to
legally apply for mining and processing permits and work on some areas of our
mineral tenements that are not suitable for large scale mining and limited to a
definite period of time. There is also a natural conflict in objectives between
small scale miners and FRC, as the small scale miners have no legal rights to
mine and are keen to access as much ore as possible. In contrast, FRC have a
stated position of allowing some level of activity; however, FRC require it to
be contained to nominated areas only and subject to the law governing small
scale mining in the country. Accordingly, there are risks that conflict can
arise that could materially adversely affect the operations of FRC.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In Nicaragua, there is a long
history of small scale miner activity throughout the country. Nicaraguan law
provides that 1% of a concession be available for artisanal (non-mechanized)
activity. At La Libertad, we have executed several agreements with local
cooperatives, and process a portion of their output from areas that are mutually
agreed upon. However, this scenario is changing due to the establishment of an
unaffiliated small process plant that will specialize in processing small scale
miner ore. There is also independent artisanal mining being carried out. Small
scale miner issues are managed by a specific specialized group at La Libertad
Mine, and the focus has been to ensure that we and artisanal miners coexist
within the concession. At Limon Mine, there has been no artisanal activity in
the active mining area; however, in outlying non-producing concessions, there
are some areas of extensive small scale miner workings. The number of artisanal
miners has increased as the price of gold has increased. There is a risk of
conflict with the small scale miners which could materially adversely affect our
operations. Further development of our mining activities may require the
relocation and physical resettlement of artisanal miners and development plans
may be impacted as a result. Any delays as a result of potential relocation or
resettlement could negatively impact us and may result in additional expenses or
prevent further development. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Small scale artisanal miners may
use sodium cyanide or mercury which are toxic materials. Should an artisanal
miner&#146;s sodium cyanide or mercury leak or otherwise be discharged into our
mineral properties, we may become subject to liability for clean-up work that
may not be insured. Related clean-up work may have a material adverse effect on
our operations. </P>

effect on our production and results of operations.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Our ability to carry out
successful mineral exploration and development activities and mining operations
will depend on a number of factors including compliance with our obligations
with respect to acquiring and maintaining title to our interest in certain
properties. The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a very detailed
and time-consuming process. No guarantee can be given that we will be in a
position to comply with all such conditions and obligations, or to require third
parties to comply with their obligations with respect to such properties.
Furthermore, while it is common practice that permits and licenses may be
renewed, extended or transferred into other forms of licenses appropriate for
ongoing operations, no guarantee can be given that a renewal, extension or a
transfer will be granted to us or, if they are granted, that we will be in a
position to comply with all conditions that are imposed. A number of our
interests are the subject of pending applications to register assignments,
extend the term, and increase the area or to convert licenses to concession
contracts and there is no assurance that such applications will be approved as
submitted. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The interests in our properties
may not be free from defects or the material contracts between us and the

properties, we may be required to make certain expenditures in respect of the
property maintenance by paying government claim and other fees. If we fail to
make the expenditures or fail to maintain the properties in good standing, we
may lose our right to such properties and forfeit any funds expended to such

environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others, delays in
mining, monetary losses and possible legal liability. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Although we maintain insurance to
protect against certain risks in such amounts as we consider to be reasonable,
our insurance will not cover all the potential risks associated with our
operations and insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be
adequate to cover any resulting liability. It is not always possible to obtain
insurance against all risks and we may decide not to insure against certain
risks because of high premiums or other reasons. Moreover, insurance against
risks such as loss of title to mineral property, environmental pollution or
other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally
available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable
terms. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that
could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results

competitive in all of its phases, and we compete with many companies possessing
greater financial resources and technical facilities than us with respect to the
discovery and acquisition of interests in mineral properties, and the
recruitment and retention of qualified employees and other persons to carry out
our mineral production and exploration activities. Competition in the mining
industry could adversely affect our prospects for mineral exploration and
development in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">All industries, including the
mining industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit. We are,
from time to time, involved in various claims, legal proceedings and complaints
arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, companies like ours
that have experienced volatility in their share price have been subjected to
class action securities litigation by shareholders. Defense and settlement costs
can be substantial, even for claims that are without merit. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of the litigation process, the litigation process could take away
from management time and effort and the resolution of any particular legal
proceeding to which we may become subject could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial position. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Current global financial conditions have been subject to
continued volatility. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Current global financial
conditions have been subject to continued volatility. Government debt and the
risk of sovereign defaults in many countries have been causing significant
uncertainties in the markets. High levels of volatility and market turmoil could
adversely impact commodity prices, exchange rates and interest rates and have a
detrimental effect on our business. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We may fail to maintain the adequacy of internal control
over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act</I></B>.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Our Common Shares are registered
under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;<B>U.S.
Exchange Act</B>&#148;), and listed on the NYSE MKT and, accordingly, we are 
subject
to the reporting and other requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws that
apply to foreign private issuers, including the requirement to maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&#147;<B>SOX</B>&#148;). SOX requires management to do 
an annual
assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, and for our
external auditors to conduct an independent assessment of their
effectiveness.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Our internal controls over
financial reporting may not be adequate, or we may not be able to maintain them
as required by SOX. We also may not be able to maintain effective internal
controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis, if standards are
modified, supplemented or amended from time to time. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">If we do not satisfy the SOX
requirements on an ongoing and timely basis, investors could lose confidence in
the reliability of our financial statements, and this could harm our business
and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares or the
market value of our other securities. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">If we do not implement new or
improved controls, or experience difficulties in implementing them, it could
harm our operating results or we may not be able to meet our reporting
obligations. We may not be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any are
identified in future periods, or maintain all of the necessary controls to
ensure continued compliance. We also may not be able to retain personnel who
have the necessary finance and accounting skills because of the increased demand
for qualified personnel among publicly traded companies.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Our recent acquisitions and any
other acquisition we make in the future can pose challenges in implementing the
required processes, procedures and controls in the new operations. Any companies
we acquire may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls
over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by
the securities laws that currently apply to us. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">If any of our staff fail to
disclose material information that is otherwise required to be reported, no
evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls over
financial reporting will detect this. The effectiveness of our controls and
procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments.
Continually enhancing our internal controls is important, especially as we
expand and the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal controls
over financial reporting will increase. Although we intend to devote substantial
time to ensuring ongoing compliance, and incurring the necessary costs
associated with this, we are not certain that we will be successful in complying
with Section 404 of SOX. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Aboriginal and local community title claims and rights to
consultation and accommodation may affect our existing operations and
development projects. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Governments in many jurisdictions
must consult with Aboriginal peoples and local communities with respect to
grants of mineral rights and the issuance or amendment of project
authorizations. Consultation and other rights of Aboriginal people and local
communities may require accommodations, including undertakings regarding
employment, royalty payments and other matters. This may affect our ability to
acquire within a reasonable time frame effective mineral titles, permits or
licenses in these jurisdictions and may affect the timetable and costs of 
development of mineral
properties in these jurisdictions. The risk of Aboriginal title claims also
could affect existing operations as well as development projects. These legal
requirements may also affect our ability to expand or transfer existing
operations or to develop new projects.</P>

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">We are subject to various U.S.,
Canadian and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Canadian
Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. In general, these laws prohibit a
company and its employees and intermediaries from bribing or making other
prohibited payments to foreign officials or other persons to obtain or retain
business or gain some other business advantage. According to Transparency
International, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Namibia, Burkina Faso, Colombia and
Mali are perceived as having fairly high levels of corruption relative to
Canada. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory
requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which
existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Failure to comply with the
applicable legislation and other similar foreign laws could expose us and our
senior management to civil and/or criminal penalties, other sanctions and
remedial measures, legal expenses and reputational damage, all of which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Likewise, any investigation of any alleged violations of the
applicable anti-corruption legislation by Canadian or foreign authorities could

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">We may issue additional Common
Shares in subsequent offerings (including through the sale of securities
convertible into, or exchangeable for, Common Shares) and under our equity
incentive plans. We may also issue Common Shares to finance future acquisitions
and other projects. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of Common
Shares or the effect, if any, that future issuances of Common Shares will have
on the market price of the Common Shares. Sales or issuances of a substantial
number of Common Shares, or the perception that such sales or issuances could
occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Shares. With
any additional issuance of Common Shares, investors will suffer dilution to

their commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Offered Shares when and to the
extent requested by the Company, but the Company is not required to request the
sale of the maximum amount offered and, if it requests a sale, the Agents are
not obligated to purchase any Offered Shares that are not sold. As a result of
the Offering being made on a commercially reasonable efforts basis with no
minimum, and only as requested by the Company, the Company may raise
substantially less than the maximum total offering amount or none at all.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>There is no certainty regarding the number of Common

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Offered Shares will be sold
by the Agents at the market price prevailing at the time of sale or at prices to
be negotiated with purchasers and, therefore, there is no certainty on the
number of Common Shares that may be sold under the Offering. If the prevailing
market price for the Common Shares or the prices at which the Company is able to
negotiate sales with purchasers declines then the Company will be able to issue
more Common Shares under the Offering and investors may suffer greater dilution.

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Company has entered into the
Distribution Agreement with the Agents under which it may issue and sell from
time to time Offered Shares through or to the Agents having an aggregate
offering price of up to US$100,000,000 in the United States and in each of the
provinces of Canada. Sales of Offered Shares, if any, will be made in
transactions that are deemed to be &#147;at-the-market distributions&#148; as 
defined in
NI 44-102, including sales made directly on the TSX and the NYSE MKT or on any
other existing trading market for the Common Shares in Canada or the United
States. If expressly
authorized by the Company, the Agents may also sell the Offered Shares in
privately negotiated transactions in the United States. Subject to the pricing
parameters in a placement notice, the Offered Shares will be distributed either
(i) at the market prices prevailing at the time of the sale or (ii) in privately
negotiated transactions at prices to be negotiated with purchasers. As a result,
price may vary as between purchasers and during the period of distribution.
Pursuant to a decision of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities on July
29, 2016, the number of Common Shares sold on the TSX or another Canadian
marketplace as at-the-market distributions on any trading day will not exceed
25% of the trading volume of the Common Shares on the TSX and all other Canadian
marketplaces on that day.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Agents will offer the Offered
Shares subject to the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement on a
daily basis or as otherwise agreed upon by the Company and the Agents. The
Company will designate the maximum amount of Offered Shares to be sold pursuant
to any single placement notice to the applicable Agent. The Company will
identify in the placement notice which Agent will effect the placement. Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement, the Agents will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to sell, on the Company&#146;s behalf, all
of
the Offered Shares requested to be sold by the Company. The Company may instruct
the Agents not to sell Offered Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or
above the price designated by the Company in any such instruction. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Either the Company or the Agents
may suspend the Offering upon proper notice to the other party. The Company and
the Agents each have the right, by giving written notice as specified in the
Distribution Agreement, to terminate the Distribution Agreement in each 
party&#146;s
sole discretion at any time. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">B2Gold will pay the Agents
compensation for their services in acting as agents in the sale of Offered
Shares pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement equal to the
Commission. The Commission shall be divided equally between the Agents
regardless of which Agent effects the sale. The remaining sales proceeds, after
deducting any expenses payable by the Company and any transaction or filing fees
imposed by any governmental, regulatory, or self-regulatory organization in
connection with the sales, will equal the net proceeds to the Company for the
sale of such Offered Shares. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The applicable Agent will provide
written confirmation to the Company (with a copy to the other Agents) no later
than the opening of the trading day immediately following the trading day on
which it has made sales of the Offered Shares under the Distribution Agreement.
Each confirmation will include the number of Offered Shares sold on such day,
the average price of the Offered Shares sold on such day, the compensation
payable by B2Gold to the Agents with respect to such sales and the net proceeds
payable to B2Gold.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Within seven calendar days after
the end of each month in which sales were made under this Prospectus Supplement
we will file on SEDAR and, with the SEC on EDGAR, a report disclosing the number
and average price of the Offered Shares distributed over the TSX by us pursuant
to this Prospectus Supplement, as well as the gross proceeds, Commission and net
proceeds with respect to sales during the prior month. We will also disclose the
number and average price of the Offered Shares sold, as well as the gross
proceeds, Commission and net proceeds from sales hereunder in our annual and
interim financial statements and management&#146;s discussion and analysis filed
on
SEDAR and with the SEC, for any quarters in which sales of Offered Shares occur.

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Settlement for sales of Offered
Shares will occur, unless the parties agree otherwise, on the third trading day
on the applicable exchange following the date on which any sales were made in
return for payment of the net proceeds to the Company. There is no arrangement
for funds to be received in an escrow, trust or similar arrangement. Sales of
Offered Shares in the United States will be settled through the facilities of
The Depository Trust Company or by such other means as the Company and the
Agents may agree upon and sales of the Offered Shares in Canada will be settled
through the facilities of CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. or by such
other means as the Company and the Agents may agree upon. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In connection with the sales of
the Offered Shares on the Company&#146;s behalf, each of the Agents may be

be an &#147;underwriter&#148; within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 
1933, as
amended (the &#147;<B>U.S. Securities Act</B>&#148;), and the compensation paid 
to the
Agents may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts. The Company
has agreed in the Distribution Agreement to provide indemnification and
contribution to the Agents against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the U.S. Securities Act. In addition, the Company has agreed, to
reimburse the reasonable expenses of the Agents in connection with the Offering,
pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement. In no event will the Agents
be entitled to reimbursement of expenses under the Distribution Agreement to the
extent it would cause the Agents to receive total compensation in excess of 8.0%
of the total proceeds from the sale of Offered Shares under the Distribution
Agreement. The Agents and their affiliates will not engage in any transactions
to stabilize the price of our Common Shares. No underwriter or dealer involved
in the distribution, no affiliate of such an underwriter or dealer and no person
or company acting jointly or in concert with such an underwriter or dealer has
over-allotted, or will over-allot, securities in connection with the
distribution or effected, or will effect any other transactions that are
intended to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities. </P>

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Credit Facility matures on
May 20, 2019, except that it shall become due on July 1, 2018 in the event that
greater than 25% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Company&#146;s
3.25% convertible senior subordinated notes with a maturity date prior to August
1, 2019 are then outstanding. The Credit Facility has a
base principal amount of $350 million and includes an accordion feature which
could increase the size of the Credit Facility to $450 million. As of the date
of this Prospectus Supplement, the Company has drawn $175 million on the Credit
Facility. As at the date of this Prospectus Supplement, the Company is in
compliance with the terms of the Credit Facility and no breach thereof has been
waived by any of the lenders thereunder. There has been no material adverse
change in the financial position of the Company or the value of the security
granted by the Company since the indebtedness under the Credit Facility was
incurred, other than as disclosed in this Prospectus Supplement. Initially, a
portion of the net proceeds received by the Company from the Offering will be
used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility and
subsequently such amounts will be redrawn for the uses described under the
heading &#147;Use of Proceeds&#148;. </P>

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The decision to act as an Agent
in connection with the sales of Offered Shares by HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc.
and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. was made independently of HSBC Bank USA, National
Association. The terms of the Offering were determined by negotiation between
the Company and the Agents, without involvement of HSBC Bank USA, National
Association. As a consequence of the Offering, the Agents will receive their
respective shares of the Commission in accordance with the provisions of the
Distribution Agreement.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Because more than 5% of the net
proceeds of the Offering could initially be used to reduce indebtedness under
the Credit Facility, HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA)
Inc. may be deemed to have a conflict of interest within the meaning of FINRA 
Rule 5121. Accordingly, the Offering
is being made in accordance with Rule 5121. Because the Offered Shares have a
&#147;bona fide public market&#148; pursuant to Rule 5121, the appointment of a 
&#147;qualified
independent underwriter&#148; is not necessary. HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. 
and
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. will not confirm sale of the Offered Shares to any
account over which they exercise discretionary authority without the prior
written approval of the customer. </P>

<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">This summary is based upon the
provisions of the Tax Act in force as of the date hereof, all specific proposals
to amend the Tax Act that have been publicly and officially announced by or on

administrative and assessing policies and practices of the Canada Revenue Agency
(the &#147;<B>CRA</B>&#148;), published in writing by it prior to the date

However, no assurance can be given that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted
in their current form, or at all. This summary is not exhaustive of all possible
Canadian federal income tax considerations and, except for the Proposed
Amendments, does not take into account or anticipate any changes in the law or
any changes in the CRA&#146;s administrative and assessing policies or

whether by legislative, governmental or judicial action or decision, nor does it

<P align=justify><B>Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations for
Residents of Canada </B></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The following summary describes
the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable to
a purchaser who acquires beneficial ownership of Offered Shares pursuant to the
Offering and who, at all relevant times, for purposes of the Tax Act, (1) is, or
is deemed to be, resident in Canada, (2) deals at arm&#146;s length with B2Gold 
and
the Agents; (3) is not affiliated with B2Gold or the Agents; and (4) holds the
Offered Shares as capital property (a &#147;<B>Holder</B>&#148;). Generally, the
Offered
Shares will be capital property to a Holder provided the Holder does not acquire
or hold those Offered Shares in the course of carrying on a business of buying
or selling securities or as part of an adventure or concern in the nature of
trade. Certain Holders may be entitled to make or may have already made the
irrevocable election permitted by subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act the effect of
which may be to deem to be capital property any Common Shares (and all other
&#147;Canadian securities&#148;, as defined in the Tax Act) owned by such Holder
in the
taxation year in which the election is made and in all subsequent taxation
years. Holders whose Offered Shares might not otherwise be considered to be
capital property should consult their own tax advisors concerning this
election.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">This summary is not applicable to
(i) a purchaser that is a &#147;specified financial institution&#148;; (ii) a 
purchaser an
interest in which is a &#147;tax shelter investment&#148;; (iii) a purchaser 
that is, for
purposes of certain rules (referred to as the mark-to-market rules) applicable
to securities held by financial institutions, a &#147;financial 
institution&#148;; (iv) a
purchaser that reports its &#147;Canadian tax results&#148; in a currency other 
than Canadian currency; or (v) a purchaser that enters
into, with respect to their Offered Shares, a &#147;derivative forward 
agreement&#148;,
each as defined in the Tax Act. Such purchasers should consult their own tax
advisors. </P>

<P align=justify><I>Currency Conversion </I></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Generally, for purposes of the
Tax Act, all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of
Offered Shares must be converted into Canadian dollars based on the exchange
rates as determined in accordance with the Tax Act. The amounts subject to
withholding tax and any capital gains or capital losses realized by a Holder may
be affected by fluctuations in the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Taxation of Holders of Offered Shares </I></P>
<P align=justify><U>Dividends</U> </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">A Holder will be required to
include in computing its income for a taxation year any dividends received or
deemed to be received on the Offered Shares. In the case of a Holder that is an
individual (other than certain trusts), such dividends will be subject to the
gross-up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to taxable dividends received
or deemed to be received from taxable Canadian corporations, including the
enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit applicable to any dividends designated
by B2Gold as an eligible dividend in accordance with the provisions of the Tax
Act. A dividend received by a Holder that is a corporation will generally be
deductible in computing the corporation&#146;s taxable income. In certain
circumstances, subsection 55(2) of the Tax Act will treat a taxable dividend
received by a Holder that is a corporation as proceeds of disposition or a
capital gain. Holders that are corporations should consult their own tax
advisors having regard to their own circumstances. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">A Holder that is a &#147;private
corporation&#148;, as defined in the Tax Act, or any other corporation 
controlled,
whether because of a beneficial interest in one or more trusts or otherwise, by
or for the benefit of an individual (other than a trust) or a related group of
individuals (other than trusts), will generally be liable to pay a refundable
tax of 38 1&#8260;3% under Part IV of the Tax Act on dividends received or 
deemed to
be received on the common shares to the extent such dividends are deductible in
computing the Holder&#146;s taxable income for the taxation year.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">For the purpose of computing the
adjusted cost base of such Offered Shares to the Holder, the cost of such
Offered Shares acquired pursuant to the Offering will be averaged with the
adjusted cost base of all other Common Shares held by the Holder as capital
property at that time. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Dispositions</U> </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Generally, on a disposition or
deemed disposition of a Offered Share, a Holder will realize a capital gain (or
capital loss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition,
net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the
adjusted cost base to the Holder of the Offered Share immediately before the
disposition or deemed disposition. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Generally, a Holder is required
to include in computing its income for a taxation year one-half of the amount of
any capital gain (a &#147;<B>taxable capital gain</B>&#148;) realized in the 
year. Subject
to and in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Act, a Holder is required to
deduct one-half of the amount of any capital loss (an &#147;<B>allowable capital
loss</B>&#148;) realized in a taxation year from taxable capital gains realized 
by
the Holder in the year and allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital
gains for the year may be carried back and deducted in any of the three
preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent
taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such years, to the
extent and under the circumstances prescribed by the Tax Act. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The amount of any capital loss
realized by a Holder that is a corporation on the disposition or deemed
disposition of a common share may be reduced by the amount of any dividends
received by the Holder on such Offered Share to the extent and under the
circumstances prescribed by the Tax Act. Similar rules may apply where a common
share is owned by a partnership or trust of which a corporation, trust or
partnership is a member or beneficiary. Such Holders should consult their own
tax advisors. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">A Holder that is throughout the
relevant taxation year a &#147;Canadian-controlled private corporation&#148; (as
defined
in the Tax Act) also may be liable to pay an additional refundable tax of 10
2&#8260;3% (subject to pro-ration for taxation years that end after 2015 and 
begin
before 2016) on its &#147;aggregate investment income&#148; for the year which 
will

<P align=justify><B>Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations for
Non-Residents of Canada </B></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The following is, as of the date
hereof, a summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations
generally applicable under the Tax Act, to a holder who acquires, as beneficial
owner, the Offered Shares under the Offering, and who, for purposes of the Tax
Act and at all relevant times: (i) holds the Offered Shares as capital property;
(ii) deals at arm&#146;s length with, and is not affiliated with, us or the 
Agent;
(iii) is not, and is not deemed to be resident in Canada; and (iv) does not use
or hold and will not be deemed to use or hold, Offered Shares in a business
carried on in Canada, (a &#147;<B>Non-Resident Holder</B>&#148;). Generally, 
Offered
Shares will be considered to be capital property to a Non- Resident Holder
provided the Non-Resident Holder does not hold Offered Shares in the course of
carrying on a business of trading or dealing in securities and has not acquired
them in one or more transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the
nature of trade. Special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may
apply to a Non-Resident Holder that is an insurer that carries on an insurance
business in Canada and elsewhere. <B>Such Non- Resident Holders should seek
advice from their own tax advisors</B>. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Currency Conversion </I></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Generally, for purposes of the
Tax Act, all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of
Offered Shares must be converted into Canadian dollars based on the exchange
rates as determined in accordance with the Tax Act. The amounts subject to
withholding tax and any capital gains or capital losses realized by a Non-
Resident Holder may be affected by fluctuations in the Canadian-U.S. dollar
exchange rate. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Disposition of Common Shares</U> </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">A Non-Resident Holder will not
generally be subject to tax under the Tax Act on a disposition of a Offered
Share, unless the Offered Share constitutes &#147;taxable Canadian 
property&#148; (as
defined in the Tax Act) of the Non-Resident Holder at the time of disposition
and the Non-Resident Holder is not entitled to relief under an applicable income
tax treaty or convention. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Provided the Offered Shares are
listed on a &#147;designated stock exchange&#148;, as defined in the Tax Act 
(which
currently includes the TSX and the NYSE MKT) at the time of disposition, the
Offered Shares will generally not constitute taxable Canadian property of a
Non-Resident Holder at that time, unless at any time during the 60-month period
immediately preceding the disposition the following two conditions are satisfied
concurrently: (i) (a) the Non-Resident Holder; (b) persons with whom the
Non-Resident Holder did not deal at arm&#146;s length; (c) partnerships in which
the
Non-Resident Holder or a person described in (b) holds a membership interest
directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships; or (d) any combination
of the persons and partnerships described in (a) through (c), owned 25% or more
of the issued shares of any class or series of shares of the Company; and (ii)
more than 50% of the fair market value of the Offered Shares was derived
directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: real or immovable
property situated in Canada, &#147;Canadian resource properties&#148;, 
&#147;timber resource
properties&#148; (each as defined in the Tax Act), and options in respect of, or
interests in or for civil law rights in, such properties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Act, the Offered Shares
could be deemed to be taxable Canadian property. Even if the Offered Shares are
taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident Holder, such Non-Resident Holder may
be exempt from tax under the Tax Act on the disposition of such Offered Shares
by virtue of an applicable income tax treaty or convention. <B>A Non-Resident
Holder contemplating a disposition of Offered Shares that may constitute taxable
Canadian property should consult a tax advisor prior to such disposition.</B>
</P>
<P align=justify><U>Receipt of Dividends</U> </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Dividends paid or credited (or
deemed to be paid or credited) to a Non-Resident Holder on Offered Shares will
be subject to Canadian withholding tax under the Tax Act. The general rate of
withholding tax is 25%, although such rate may be reduced under the provisions
of an applicable income tax convention between Canada and the Non- Resident
Holder&#146;s country of residence. For example, under the <I>Canada-United 
States
Income Tax Convention (1980) </I>as amended (the &#147;<B>U.S. 
Treaty</B>&#148;), the rate
is generally reduced to 15% where the Non-Resident Holder is a resident of the
United States for the purposes of, and is entitled to the benefits of, the U.S.
Treaty. </P>

non-U.S. tax consequences to U.S. Holders of the acquisition, ownership, and
disposition of Common Shares. In addition, except as specifically set forth
below, this summary does not discuss applicable tax reporting requirements. Each
prospective U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S.

&#147;Passive
Foreign Investment Company Rules.&#148; </P>
<P align=justify><I>Taxation of Distributions </I></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">A U.S. Holder that receives a
distribution, including a constructive distribution, with respect to a Common
Share will be required to include the amount of such distribution in gross
income as a dividend (without reduction for any foreign income tax withheld from
such distribution) to the extent of the current or accumulated &#147;earnings 
and
profits&#148; of the Company, as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
To
the extent that a distribution exceeds the current and accumulated 
&#147;earnings and
profits&#148; of the Company, such distribution will be treated first as a tax-
free
return of capital to the extent of a U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in the Common
Shares and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of such Common Shares
(see &#147;Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Shares&#148; below). 
However, the
Company may not maintain the calculations of its earnings and profits in
accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, and each U.S. Holder may
have to assume that any distribution by the Company with respect to the Common
Shares will constitute ordinary dividend income. Dividends received on Common
Shares by corporate U.S. Holders generally will not be eligible for the
&#147;dividends received deduction&#148;. Subject to applicable limitations and 
provided
the Company is eligible for the benefits of the U.S. Treaty, dividends paid by
the Company to non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will
be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains
for dividends, provided certain holding period and other conditions are
satisfied, including that the Company not be classified as a PFIC (as defined
below) in the tax year of distribution or in the preceding tax year. The
dividend rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax
advisor regarding the application of such rules. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Shares </I></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">A U.S. Holder will recognize gain
or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of Common Shares in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between (a) the amount of cash plus the fair
market value of any property received and (b) such U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis 
in
such Common Shares sold or otherwise disposed of. Any such gain or loss
generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or
loss if, at the time of the sale or other disposition, such Common Shares are
held for more than one year. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Preferential tax rates apply to
long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate, or
trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains
of a U.S. Holder that is a corporation. Deductions for capital losses are
subject to significant limitations under the Code. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules </B></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">If the Company were to constitute
a &#147;passive foreign investment company&#148; (&#147;<B>PFIC</B>&#148;) for 
any year during a
U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period, then certain potentially adverse rules would
affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder resulting from
the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Common Shares. The Company
believes that it was not a PFIC for the prior tax year, and based on current
business plans and financial expectations, the Company expects that it should
not be a PFIC for the current tax year and expects that it should not be a PFIC 
for the
foreseeable future. No opinion of legal counsel or ruling from the IRS
concerning the status of the Company as a PFIC has been obtained or is currently
planned to be requested. However, PFIC classification is fundamentally factual
in nature, generally cannot be determined until the close of the tax year in
question, and is determined annually. Additionally, the analysis depends, in
part, on the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules, which are
subject to differing interpretations. Consequently, there can be no assurance
that the Company has never been and will not become a PFIC for any tax year
during which U.S. Holders hold Common Shares. </P>

is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder will be required to file an annual report
with the IRS containing such information as Treasury Regulations and/or other
IRS guidance may require. In addition to penalties, a failure to satisfy such
reporting requirements may result in an extension of the time period during
which the IRS can assess a tax. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the requirements of filing such information returns under
these rules, including the requirement to file an IRS Form 8621. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">A foreign corporation generally
will be a PFIC if, after the application of certain &#147;look-through&#148; 
rules with
respect to subsidiaries in which it holds at least 25% of the value of such
subsidiary, for a tax year, (a) 75% or more of the gross income of the foreign
corporation for such tax year is passive income (the &#147;income test&#148;) or
(b) 50%
or more of the value of the foreign corporation&#146;s assets either produce 
passive
income or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset 
test&#148;),
based on the quarterly average of the fair market value of such assets. 
&#147;Gross
income&#148; generally includes all sales revenues less the cost of goods sold, 
plus
income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources,
and &#147;passive income&#148; generally includes, for example, dividends, 
interest,
certain rents and royalties, certain gains from the sale of stock and
securities, and certain gains from commodities transactions. Active business
gains arising from the sale of commodities generally are excluded from passive
income if substantially all (85% or more) of a foreign corporation&#146;s 
commodities
are stock in trade or inventory, depreciable property used in a trade or
business or supplies regularly used or consumed in the ordinary course of its
trade or business, and certain other requirements are satisfied. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">If the Company were a PFIC in any
tax year during which a U.S. Holder held Common Shares, such holder generally
would be subject to special rules with respect to &#147;excess 
distributions&#148; made by
the Company on the Common Shares and with respect to gain from the disposition
of Common Shares. An &#147;<B>excess distribution</B>&#148; generally is defined
as the
excess of distributions with respect to the Common Shares received by a U.S.
Holder in any tax year over 125% of the average annual distributions such U.S.
Holder has received from the Company during the shorter of the three preceding
tax years, or such U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period for the Common Shares.
Generally, a U.S. Holder would be required to allocate any excess distribution
or gain from the disposition of the Common Shares ratably over its holding
period for the Common Shares. Such amounts allocated to the year of the
disposition or excess distribution would be taxed as ordinary income, and
amounts allocated to prior tax years would be taxed as ordinary income at the
highest tax rate in effect for each such year and an interest charge at a rate
applicable to underpayments of tax would apply. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">While there are U.S. federal
income tax elections that sometimes can be made to mitigate these adverse tax
consequences (including the &#147;QEF Election&#148; under Section 1295 of the 
Code and
the &#147;Mark-to-Market Election&#148; under Section 1296 of the Code), such 
elections
are available in limited circumstances and must be made in a timely manner. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">For each taxable year after the
tax year ending on December 31, 2015 in which the Company determines it is a
PFIC, the Company will provide to U.S. Holders upon written request, or post on
the Company&#146;s website, a PFIC Annual Information Statement and any other
required information to enable such U.S. Holders to make a QEF Election. U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential
application of the PFIC rules to the ownership and disposition of Common Shares,
and the availability of certain U.S. tax elections under the PFIC rules. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Additional Considerations </B></P>
<P align=justify><I>Additional Tax on Passive Income </I></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">Certain individuals, estates and
trusts whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8%
Medicare surtax on &#147;net investment income&#148; including, among other 
things,
dividends and net gain from disposition of property (other than property held in
certain trades or businesses). U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the application, if any, of this tax on their ownership and
disposition of Common Shares.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Receipt of Foreign Currency </I></P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The amount of any distribution
paid to a U.S. Holder in foreign currency, or on the sale, exchange or other
taxable disposition of Common Shares, generally will be equal to the U.S. dollar
value of such foreign currency based on the exchange rate applicable on the date
of actual or constructive receipt (regardless of whether such foreign currency
is converted into U.S. dollars at that time). A U.S. Holder will have a basis in
the foreign currency equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. Any
U.S. Holder who converts or otherwise disposes of the foreign currency after the
date of
receipt may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated
as ordinary income or loss, and generally will be U.S. source income or loss for
foreign tax credit purposes. Different rules apply to U.S. Holders who use the
accrual method with respect to foreign currency received upon the sale, exchange
or other taxable disposition of the Common Shares. Each U.S. Holder should
consult its own U.S. tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of receiving, owning, and disposing of foreign currency. </P>

<P align=justify><I>Foreign Tax Credit </I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the PFIC rules
discussed above, a U.S. Holder that pays (whether directly or through
withholding) Canadian income tax with respect to dividends paid on the Common
Shares generally will be entitled, at the election of such U.S. Holder, to
receive either a deduction or a credit for such Canadian income tax. Generally,
a credit will reduce a U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax liability on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, whereas a deduction will reduce a U.S. Holder&#146;s 
income
that is subject to U.S. federal income tax. This election is made on a
year-by-year basis and applies to all foreign taxes paid (whether directly or
through withholding) by a U.S. Holder during a year. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complex limitations apply to the
foreign tax credit, including the general limitation that the credit cannot
exceed the proportionate share of a U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax
liability that such U.S. Holder&#146;s &#147;foreign source&#148; taxable income
bears to such
U.S. Holder&#146;s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S.
Holder&#146;s various items of income and deduction must be classified, under 
complex
rules, as either &#147;foreign source&#148; or &#147;U.S. source.&#148; 
Generally, dividends paid by
a foreign corporation should be treated as foreign source for this purpose, and
gains recognized on the sale of stock of a foreign corporation by a U.S. Holder
should be treated as U.S. source for this purpose, except as otherwise provided
in an applicable income tax treaty, and if an election is properly made under
the Code. However, the amount of a distribution with respect to the Common
Shares that is treated as a &#147;dividend&#148; may be lower for U.S. federal 
income tax
purposes than it is for Canadian federal income tax purposes, resulting in a
reduced foreign tax credit allowance to a U.S. Holder. In addition, this
limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific categories of
income. The foreign tax credit rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should
consult its own U.S. tax advisor regarding the foreign tax credit rules. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Backup Withholding and Information Reporting </I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under U.S. federal income tax law
and Treasury Regulations, certain categories of U.S. Holders must file
information returns with respect to their investment in, or involvement in, a
foreign corporation. For example, U.S. return disclosure obligations (and
related penalties) are imposed on individuals who are U.S. Holders that hold
certain specified foreign financial assets in excess of certain threshold
amounts. The definition of specified foreign financial assets includes not only
financial accounts maintained in foreign financial institutions, but also,
unless held in accounts maintained by a financial institution, any stock or
security issued by a non-U.S. person, any financial instrument or contract held
for investment that has an issuer or counterparty other than a U.S. person and
any interest in a foreign entity. U. S. Holders may be subject to these
reporting requirements unless their Common Shares are held in an account at
certain financial institutions. Penalties for failure to file certain of these
information returns are substantial. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the requirements of filing information returns, including the
requirement to file an IRS Form 8938.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments made within the U.S. or
by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, of dividends on, and proceeds arising from
the sale or other taxable disposition of, Common Shares will generally be
subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax, at the rate of 28%,
if a U.S. Holder (a) fails to furnish such U.S. Holder&#146;s correct U.S. 
taxpayer
identification number (generally on Form W-9), (b) furnishes an incorrect U.S.
taxpayer identification number, (c) is notified by the IRS that such U.S. Holder
has previously failed to properly report items subject to backup withholding
tax, or (d) fails to certify, under penalty of perjury, that such U.S. Holder
has furnished its correct U.S. taxpayer identification number and that the IRS
has not notified such U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding tax.
However, certain exempt persons generally are excluded from these information
reporting and backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Any amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding tax rules will be
allowed as a credit against a U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax 
liability,
if any, or will be refunded, if such U.S. Holder furnishes required information
to the IRS in a timely manner.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion of reporting
requirements set forth above is not intended to constitute a complete
description of all reporting requirements that may apply to a U.S. Holder. A
failure to satisfy certain reporting requirements may result in an extension of
the time period during which the IRS can assess a tax, and under certain
circumstances, such an extension may apply to assessments of amounts unrelated
to any unsatisfied reporting requirement. Each U.S. Holder should consult its
own tax advisor regarding the information reporting and backup withholding
rules. </P>

<P align=center><B>CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are permitted under a
  multi-jurisdictional disclosure system adopted by the securities regulatory
  authorities in Canada and the United States to prepare this Prospectus,
  including the documents incorporated by reference and any Prospectus 
Supplement,
  in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ
  from the requirements of United States securities laws. All mineral resource 
and
  reserve estimates included in this Prospectus, including the documents
  incorporated by reference, have been prepared in accordance with National
Instrument 43-101 <I>Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects 
</I>(&#147;<B>NI
    43-101</B>&#148;). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities
  Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer
  makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. 
These
  standards differ significantly from the mineral reserve disclosure 
requirements
  of the SEC set out in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, mineral reserve and
  mineral resource information included and incorporated by reference in this
  Prospectus and any Prospectus Supplement is not comparable to similar
  information that would generally be disclosed by U.S. companies in accordance
  with the rules of the SEC.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the SEC&#146;s 
Industry
  Guide 7 applies different standards in order to classify mineralization as a
  reserve. As a result, the definitions of proven and probable mineral reserves
  used in NI 43-101 differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7. Under 
SEC
  standards, mineralization may not be classified as a &#147;reserve&#148; 
unless the
  determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and
  legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.
  Among other things, all necessary permits would be required to be in hand or
  issuance imminent in order to classify mineralized material as reserves under
  the SEC standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve estimates included and
  incorporated by reference in this Prospectus and any Prospectus Supplement may
  not qualify as &#147;reserves&#148; under SEC standards.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the information
  included and incorporated by reference in this Prospectus uses the terms
  &#147;mineral resources&#148;, &#147;measured mineral resources&#148;, 
&#147;indicated mineral resources&#148;
  and &#147;inferred mineral resources&#148; to comply with the reporting 
standards in
  Canada. The SEC&#146;s Industry Guide 7 does not recognize mineral resources 
and U.S.
  companies are generally not permitted to disclose mineral resources in 
documents
  they file with the SEC. Investors are specifically cautioned not to assume 
that
  any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be
  converted into SEC defined mineral reserves. Further, &#147;inferred mineral
  resources&#148; have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and 
as to
  whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, investors are 
also
  cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource
  exists. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of &#147;inferred mineral
  resources&#148; cannot form the basis of feasibility or, except in limited
  circumstances, other economic studies. It cannot be assumed that all or any 
part
  of &#147;measured mineral resources&#148;, &#147;indicated mineral 
resources&#148; or &#147;inferred
  mineral resources&#148; will ever be upgraded to a higher category or mineral
  resources or that mineral resources will be classified as mineral reserves.
  Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of the reported 
&#147;measured
  mineral resources&#148;, &#147;indicated mineral resources&#148; or 
&#147;inferred mineral
  resources&#148; included and incorporated by reference in this Prospectus and 
any
  Prospectus Supplement is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of
  &#147;contained ounces&#148; in a resource is permitted under NI 43-101; 
however, the SEC
normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not 
constitute
  &#147;reserves&#148; by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without 
reference to
  unit measures. In addition, the documents incorporated by reference in this
  Prospectus include information regarding adjacent or nearby properties on 
which
  we have no right to mine. The SEC does not normally allow U.S. companies to
  include such information in their filings with the SEC. For the above reasons,
  information included and incorporated by reference in this Prospectus and any
  Prospectus Supplement that describes our mineral reserve and resource 
estimates
  or that describes the results of pre-feasibility or other studies is not
  comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the
  reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.</P>

<P align=center><B>CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information included and
  incorporated by reference in this Prospectus includes certain &#147;forward-
looking
  information&#148; and &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; (collectively 
&#147;<B>forward-looking
    statements</B>&#148;) within the meaning of applicable Canadian and United 
States
  securities legislation, including projections of future financial and
  operational performance; statements with respect to future events or future
  performance, production estimates, anticipated operating and production costs
  and revenue, estimates of capital expenditures; recovery and grade estimates;
  anticipated exploration, development, construction, production, permitting and
  other activities on the Company&#146;s properties, including finalizing the 
Mining
  Convention and the ownership of the entity that will hold the Fekola project
  with the Government of Mali, the potential development and potential 
production
  from the Fekola project and the anticipated arrival of the permanent camp 
there;
  the life of mine at the Fekola project; estimated financial returns from the
  Fekola project; completion of a mining study for the Otjikoto mine as well as 
a
  new geologic model for the Otjikoto Pit and the Wolfshag zone, updating the
  Kiaka feasibility study; the projections included in existing technical 
reports,
  economic assessments and feasibility studies, including the feasibility study
  for the Fekola project; the potential for expansion of mineral resources and
  mineral reserves, including at the Masbate mine; the potential for expansion 
of
  production capacity, including the cost reduction and continued ramp up, 
improvements and expansion of gold production at the Otjikoto
  mine and development of the adjacent Wolfshag zone, potential expansion 
options
  for the Masbate mine, the completion of permitting in respect of the Jabali
  Antenna Pit, production from the Jabali Antenna Pit and increased production 
at
  La Libertad, and the potential to extend the mine life of the La Libertad and
  Limon mines; projected capital investments and exploration; and the adequacy 
of
  capital, financing needs and the potential availability of and potential for
  receiving further commitments under our new revolving credit facility; the
  potential availability of flexible financing arrangements, including our new
  revolving credit facility; the availability of the accordion feature under our
  new revolving credit facility and the potential increase in available funds
  under it; the repayment of our previous credit facility; and whether our new
revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for the construction 
of
  the Fekola project and to meet our objective of having $100 million on hand.
  Estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves are also forward looking
  statements because they constitute projections, based on certain estimates and
  assumptions, regarding the amount of minerals that may be encountered in the
  future and/or the anticipated economics of production, should a production
  decision be made. All statements included and incorporated by reference herein
  that address events or developments that we expect to occur in the future are
  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are
  not historical facts and are generally, although not always, identified by 
words
  such as &#147;expect&#148;, &#147;plan&#148;, &#147;anticipate&#148;, 
&#147;project&#148;, &#147;target&#148;, &#147;potential&#148;,
  &#147;schedule&#148;, &#147;forecast&#148;, &#147;budget&#148;, 
&#147;estimate&#148;, &#147;intend&#148; or &#147;believe&#148; and similar
  expressions or their negative connotations, or that events or conditions 
&#147;will&#148;,
  &#147;would&#148;, &#147;may&#148;, &#147;could&#148;, &#147;should&#148; or 
&#147;might&#148; occur. All such forward-looking
  statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management as of the 
date
  such statements are made. Forward-looking statements necessarily involve
  assumptions, risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control,
  including risks associated with the volatility of metal prices; risks and
  dangers inherent in exploration, development and mining activities; risks of 
not
  achieving production or cost estimates; uncertainty of mineral reserve and
  mineral resource estimates; material differences for reporting mineralized
  material between United States reporting standards and the Canadian standards;
  financing risks; risks related to hedging activities and ore purchase
  commitments; the ability to obtain and maintain any necessary permits, 
consents
  or authorizations required for mining activities; inability to comply with
  Philippines regulations related to ownership of natural resources and 
operation,
  management and control of our business; risks related to environmental
  regulations or hazards and compliance with complex regulations associated with
  mining activities; the ability to replace mineral reserves and identify
  acquisition opportunities or complete desirable acquisitions; the failure to
  integrate business and assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the
  future; unknown liabilities of companies that we have acquired; fluctuations 
in
  exchange rates; availability of financing and financing risks; risks related 
to
  operations in foreign countries and compliance with foreign laws including
  changes in such laws, risks related to remote operations and the availability 
of
  adequate infrastructure, fluctuations in price and availability of energy and
  other inputs necessary for mining operations; shortages or cost increases in
  necessary equipment, supplies and labour; regulatory, political and country
  risks including the risk of terrorist activity; climate change risks; 
volatility
  of global financial conditions; disruptions arising from conflicts with small
  scale miners in certain countries; risks related to reliance upon contractors,
  third parties and joint venture partners; challenges to title or surface 
rights;
  dependence on key personnel; risks associated with conflicts of interest among
  our directors and officers; the risk of an uninsurable or uninsured loss;
  litigation risk; taxation, including changes in tax laws and interpretation of
  tax laws; difficulty in achieving and maintaining the adequacy of internal
  control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; risks
  related to the ongoing epidemic of the Ebola virus disease in West Africa; and
  community support for our operations including risks related to strikes and
the
  halting of such operations, from time to time, as well as other factors
  identified and as described in more detail under the heading &#147;Risk 
Factors&#148; in
  our most recent annual information form and this Prospectus and in the 
documents
  incorporated by reference herein. The list is not exhaustive of the factors 
that
  may affect our forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that such
  statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results, performance or
  achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by,
  these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that
  any events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or
  occur, or if any of them do, what benefits or liabilities we will derive
  therefrom. Our forward looking statements reflect current expectations 
regarding
  future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date hereof 
and
  we do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if
  circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change
  other than as required by applicable law. For the reasons set forth above, 
undue
  reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. </P>

  as other information in this Prospectus and any applicable Prospectus
  Supplement, before purchasing any of our Securities. Each of the risks 
described
  herein and in these sections and documents could materially and adversely 
affect
  our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, cause
  actual events to differ materially from those described in forward looking
  statements and information relating to the Company and could result in a loss 
of
  your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we
  currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition,
  results of operations and prospects. See &#147;Documents Incorporated by 
Reference.&#148; </P>
<P align=justify><B>There is an absence of a public market for certain of the
  Securities </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no public market for the
  Debt Securities, Warrants, Subscription Receipts or Units and, unless 
otherwise
  specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, we do not intend to apply 
for
  listing of the Debt Securities, Warrants, Subscription Receipts or Units on 
any
  securities exchanges. If the Debt Securities, Warrants, Subscription Receipts 
or
  Units are traded after their initial issue, they may trade at a discount from
  their initial offering prices depending on prevailing interest rates (as
  applicable), the market for similar securities and other factors, including
  general economic conditions and our financial condition. There can be no
  assurance as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Debt Securities,
Warrants, Subscription Receipts or Units, or that a trading market for these
  securities will develop. </P>
<P align=justify><B>The Debt Securities will be structurally subordinated to any
  indebtedness of our subsidiaries </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We carry on our business through
  corporate subsidiaries, and the majority of our assets are held in corporate
  subsidiaries. Our results of operations and ability to service indebtedness,
  including the Debt Securities, are dependent upon the results of operations of
  these subsidiaries and the payment of funds by these subsidiaries to us in the
  form of loans, dividends or otherwise. Our subsidiaries will not have an
  obligation to pay amounts due pursuant to any debt securities or to make any
  funds available for payment on debt securities, whether by dividends, 
interest,
  loans, advances or other payments. In addition, the payment of dividends and 
the
  making of loans, advances and other payments to us by our subsidiaries may be
  subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. The Indenture (as defined
  below) does not limit our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur
  indebtedness. Such indebtedness of our subsidiaries would be structurally 
senior
  to the Debt Securities. In the event of the liquidation of any subsidiary, the
  assets of the subsidiary would be used first to repay the obligations of the
  subsidiary, including indebtedness and trade payables, prior to being used by 
us
  to pay our indebtedness, including any Debt Securities.</P>

<P align=justify><B>Changes in interest rates may cause the market price or
  value of the Debt Securities to decline </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevailing interest rates will
  affect the market price or value of the Debt Securities. The market price or
  value of the Debt Securities may decline as prevailing interest rates for
  comparable debt instruments rise, and increase as prevailing interest rates 
for
  comparable debt instruments decline.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Fluctuations in foreign currency markets may cause the value

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debt Securities denominated or
  payable in foreign currencies may entail significant risk. These risks 
include,
  without limitation, the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign
  currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls
  and potential liquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary 
depending
  upon the currency or currencies involved and will be more fully described in 
the
  applicable Prospectus Supplement. </P>
<P align=center><B>USE OF PROCEEDS </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise specified in a
  Prospectus Supplement, the net proceeds from the sale of Securities will be 
used
  for general corporate purposes, including funding ongoing operations and/or
  working capital requirements, to repay indebtedness outstanding from time to
  time, discretionary capital programs and potential future acquisitions. Each
  Prospectus Supplement will contain specific information concerning the use of
  proceeds from that sale of Securities.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All expenses relating to an
  offering of Securities and any compensation paid to underwriters, dealers or
  agents, as the case may be, will be paid out of the proceeds from the sale of
  Securities, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. 
</P>
<P align=center><B>EARNINGS COVERAGE RATIO </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings coverage ratios will be

the
  issuance of Debt Securities pursuant to this Prospectus. </P>
<P align=center><B>CONSOLIDATED CAPITALIZATION </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the date of the unaudited
  condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and 
for
  the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which are incorporated by reference 
in
  this Prospectus, the only material change to the share and loan capital of the
  Company on a consolidated basis, was the drawdown of US$50 million under the
  Company&#146;s new US$350 million revolving credit facility (the 
&#147;<B>Credit
    Facility</B>&#148;).</P>
<P align=center><B>DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into the Credit
  Facility with a syndicate of international banks pursuant to a credit 
agreement
  made as of May 20, 2015. The Credit Facility also allows for an accordion
  feature whereby upon receipt of additional binding commitments, the facility 
may
  be increased to US$450 million any time prior to the maturity date. HSBC, as
  sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, is the administrative agent. The
  syndicate includes The Bank of Nova Scotia, Soci&#233;t&#233; 
G&#233;n&#233;rale and ING Bank N.V,
  as mandated lead arrangers. Proceeds from the Credit Facility were used to 
repay
  our previous US$200 million revolving credit facility and for general 
corporate
  purposes. The Credit Facility bears interest on a sliding scale of between 
Libor
  plus 2.25% to 3.25% based on our consolidated net leverage ratio. Commitment
  fees for the undrawn portion of the facility will also be on a similar sliding
  scale basis of between 0.5% and 0.925% . The term for the Credit Facility is
  four years, maturing on May 20, 2019, except that it shall become due on July 
1,
  2018 in the event that our 3.25% convertible senior subordinated notes (the
  &#147;<B>Convertible Notes</B>&#148;) due on October 1, 2018 remain 
outstanding or the
  maturity date of the Convertible Notes has not been extended to at least 90 
days
  after May 20, 2019. Upon closing of the Credit Facility, an initial drawdown 
of
  US$150 million was made which was used to repay the cumulative amount drawn
  under our previous credit facility. A subsequent drawdown of US$50 million was
  made for general corporate purposes. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have outstanding as of January
  8, 2016, US$258.75 million Convertible Notes. Proceeds from the sale of the
  Convertible Notes were for general corporate purposes. The Convertible Notes
  bear interest at 3.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October
1
  of each year, beginning on April 1, 2014, and mature on October 1, 2018, 
unless
  earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. The Convertible Notes are
  convertible by holders into our Common Shares, based on an initial conversion
  rate of 254.2912 Common Shares per US$1,000 principal amount. </P>

<P align=center><B>PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may sell the Securities,
  separately or together: (a) to one or more underwriters or dealers; (b)
through
  one or more agents; or (c) directly to one or more other purchasers. Each
  Prospectus Supplement will set forth the terms of the offering, including the
  name or names of any underwriters or agents, the purchase price or prices of 
the
  Securities and the proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Securities. In
  addition, Securities may be offered and issued in consideration for the
  acquisition (an &#147;<B>Acquisition</B>&#148;) of other businesses, assets or
securities
  by us or our subsidiaries. The consideration for any such Acquisition may
  consist of any of the Securities separately, a combination of Securities or 
any
  combination of, among other things, securities, cash and assumption of
  liabilities.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities may be sold from
  time to time in one or more transactions at a fixed price or prices which may 
be
  changed or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related 
to
  such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices, including sales in
  transactions that are deemed to be &#147;at-the-market distributions&#148; as 
defined in
  National Instrument 44-102 - <I>Shelf Distributions</I>, including sales made
  directly on the TSX, NYSE MKT or other existing trading markets for the Common
  Shares. The prices at which the Securities may be offered may vary as between
  purchasers and during the period of distribution. If, in connection with the
  offering of Securities at a fixed price or prices, the underwriters have made 
a
  bona fide effort to sell all of the Securities at the initial offering price
  fixed in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, the public offering price may 
be
  decreased and thereafter further changed, from time to time, to an amount not
  greater than the initial public offering price fixed in such Prospectus
  Supplement, in which case the compensation realized by the underwriters will 
be
  decreased by the amount that the aggregate price paid by purchasers for the
  Securities is less than the gross proceeds paid to us by the underwriters.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underwriters, dealers or agents
  who participate in the distribution of Securities may be entitled under
  agreements to be entered into with the Company to indemnification by us 
against
  certain liabilities, including liabilities under the United States Securities
  Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable Canadian securities legislation, or to
  contribution with respect to payments which such underwriters, dealers or 
agents
  may be required to make in respect thereof. The underwriters, dealers or 
agents
  with whom we enter into agreements may be customers of, engage in transactions
  with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary course of business. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with any offering
  of Securities, except as otherwise set out in a Prospectus Supplement relating
  to a particular offering of Securities, the underwriters or dealers, as the 
case
  may be, may over-allot or effect transactions intended to fix or stabilize the
  market price of the Securities at a level above that which might otherwise
  prevail in the open market. Such transactions, if commenced, may be 
discontinued
  at any time. </P>
<P align=center><B>PRIOR SALES </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 12 month period before
  the date of this Prospectus, we have issued the following Common Shares and
  securities convertible into Common Shares: </P>

<P align=center><B>DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section describing the
  Debt Securities, the terms &#147;Company&#148; and &#147;B2Gold Corp.&#148; 
refer only to B2Gold
  Corp. without any of its subsidiaries. This section describes the general 
terms
  that will apply to any Debt Securities issued pursuant to this Prospectus. The
  specific terms of the Debt Securities, and the extent to which the general 
terms
  described in this section apply to those Debt Securities, will be set forth in
  the applicable Prospectus Supplement. The Debt Securities will be issued in 
one
  or more series under an indenture (the &#147;<B>Indenture</B>&#148;) to be 
entered into
  between the Company and one or more trustees (the &#147;<B>Trustee</B>&#148;) 
that will be
  named in a Prospectus Supplement for a series of Debt Securities. To the 
extent
  applicable, the Indenture will be subject to and governed by the <I>United
    States Trust Indenture Act of 1939</I>, as amended. A copy of the form of 
the
  Indenture to be entered into has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the
  registration statement of which this Prospectus forms a part. The description 
of
  certain provisions of the Indenture in this section is not intended to be
  complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of 
the
  Indenture. Terms used in this summary that are not otherwise defined herein 
have
  the meaning ascribed to them in the Indenture.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may issue Debt Securities and
  incur additional indebtedness other than through the offering of Debt 
Securities
  pursuant to this Prospectus. We may be required to obtain the consent of our
  lenders for the issuance of certain Debt Securities, depending on their 
specific
  terms.</P>
<P align=justify><B>General </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indenture does not limit the
  amount of Debt Securities which we may issue under the Indenture, and we may
  issue Debt Securities in one or more series. Debt Securities may be 
denominated
  and payable in any currency. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable
  Prospectus Supplement, the Indenture permits us, without the consent of the
  holders of any Debt Securities, to increase the principal amount of any series
  of Debt Securities we have previously issued under the Indenture and to issue
  such increased principal amount.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicable Prospectus

<P align=justify><B>Payment </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise indicated in the
  applicable Prospectus Supplement, we will make payments on registered Debt
  Securities (other than Global Securities) at the office or agency of the
Trustee, except that we may choose to pay interest (a) by check mailed to the
  address of the person entitled to such payment as specified in the security
  register or (b) by wire transfer to an account maintained by the person 
entitled
  to such payment as specified in the security register. Unless otherwise
  indicated in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, we will pay any interest 
due
  on registered Debt Securities to the persons in whose name such registered 
Debt
  Securities are registered on the day or days, specified in the applicable
  Prospectus Supplement.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Registered Global Securities </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered debt securities of a
  series may be issued in whole or in part in global form that will be deposited
  with, or on behalf of, a depositary identified in the Prospectus Supplement.
  Global Securities will be registered in the name of a financial institution 
that
  we select, and the debt securities included in the Global Securities may not 
be
  transferred to the name of any other direct holder unless the special
  circumstances described below occur. The financial institution that acts as 
the
  sole direct holder of the Global Securities is called the 
&#147;Depositary&#148;. Any
  person wishing to own Debt Securities issued in the form of Global Securities
  must do so indirectly by virtue of an account with a broker, bank or other
  financial institution that, in turn, has an account with the Depositary.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Special Investor Considerations for Global Securities 
</I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our obligations, as well as the
  obligations of the Trustee and those of any third parties we employed or the
  Trustee, run only to persons who are registered as holders of Debt Securities.
  For example, once we make payment to the registered holder, we have no further
  responsibility for the payment even if that holder is legally required to pass
  the payment along to an investor but does not do so. As an indirect holder, an
  investor's rights relating to a Global Security will be governed by the 
account
  rules of the investor&#146;s financial institution and of the Depositary, as 
well as
  general laws relating to debt securities transfers.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An investor should be aware that
  when Debt Securities are issued in the form of Global Securities:</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
    <P>the investor cannot have Debt Securities registered in his or her own 
name; </P>
  <LI>
    <P>the investor cannot receive physical certificates for his or her interest
      in the Debt Securities; </P>
  <LI>
    <P>the investor must look to his or her own bank or brokerage firm for
      payments on the Debt Securities and protection of his or her legal rights
      relating to the Debt Securities; </P>
  <LI>
    <P>the investor may not be able to sell interests in the Debt Securities to
      some insurance companies and other institutions that are required by law 
to
      hold the physical certificates of Debt Securities that they own; </P>
  <LI>
    <P>the Depositary&#146;s policies will govern payments, transfers, exchange 
and
      other matters relating to the investor's interest in the Global Security. 
We
      and the Trustee will have no responsibility for any aspect of the
Depositary&#146;s
      actions or for its records of ownership interests in the Global Security. 
We
      and the Trustee also do not supervise the Depositary in any way; and </P>
  <LI>
    <P>the Depositary will usually require that interests in a Global Security 
be
      purchased or sold within its system using same-day funds. </P>

<P align=justify><I>Special Situations When Global Security Will be Terminated 
</I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few special situations
  described below, a Global Security will terminate and interests in it will be
  exchanged for physical certificates representing Debt Securities. After that
  exchange, an investor may choose whether to hold Debt Securities directly or
  indirectly through an account at its bank or brokerage firm. Investors must
  consult their own banks or brokers to find out how to have their interests in
  Debt Securities transferred into their own names, so that they will be direct
  holders.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special situations for
  termination of a Global Security are:</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
    <P>when the Depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer
      qualified to continue as Depositary (unless a replacement Depositary is
      named); and </P>
  <LI>
    <P>when and if we decide to terminate a Global Security. </P>
  </LI>
</UL>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prospectus Supplement may
  list situations for terminating a Global Security that would apply only to the
  particular series of Debt Securities covered by the Prospectus Supplement. 
When
  a Global Security terminates, the Depositary (and not us or the Trustee) is
  responsible for deciding the names of the institutions that will be the 
initial
  direct holders. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Events of Default </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &#147;Event of

Securities
  of one or more series, then the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in

  thereby (as one class) may require the principal amount (or, if any of the 
Debt
  Securities of such affected series are Original Issue Discount Securities or
  Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified 
in
  the terms of such affected series) of all the outstanding Debt Securities of
  such affected series and any accrued but unpaid interest on such Debt

  Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal

  been obtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subscription Receipt certificates
  will be exchangeable for new Subscription Receipt certificates of different
  denominations at the office indicated in the Prospectus Supplement. Prior to 
the
  exchange of their Subscription Receipts, holders of Subscription Receipts will
  not have any of the rights of holders of the securities subject to the
  Subscription Receipts. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the subscription receipt
  agreement, a Canadian purchaser of Subscription Receipts will have a 
contractual
  right of rescission following the issuance of Common Shares, Debt Securities 
or
  Warrants, as the case may be, to such purchaser, entitling the purchaser to
  receive the amount paid for the Subscription Receipts upon surrender of the
  Common Shares, Debt Securities or Warrants, as the case may be, if this
  Prospectus, the applicable Prospectus Supplement, and any amendment thereto,
  contains a misrepresentation, provided such remedy for rescission is exercised
  within 180 days of the date the Subscription Receipts are issued. This right 
of
  rescission does not extend to holders of Subscription Receipts who acquire 
such
Subscription Receipts from an initial purchaser, on the open market or
  otherwise, or to initial purchasers who acquire Subscription Receipts in the
  United States or other jurisdictions outside Canada. </P>
<P align=center><B>DESCRIPTION OF UNITS </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may issue Units comprised of
  one or more of the other Securities described in the Prospectus in any
  combination. Each Unit will be issued so that the holder of the Unit is also 
the
  holder of each of the Securities included in the Unit. Thus, the holder of a
  Unit will have the rights and obligations of a holder of each included 
Security.
  The unit agreement, if any, under which a Unit is issued may provide that the
  Securities included in the Unit may not be held or transferred separately, at
  any time or at any time before a specified date. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular terms and

<P align=center><B>DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our authorized share capital
  consists of an unlimited number of Common Shares and an unlimited number of
  preferred shares. As at the date of this Prospectus, 926,864,297 Common Shares
  and no preferred shares are issued and outstanding. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Common Shares</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered holders of Common
  Shares are entitled to receive notice of and attend all meetings of our
  shareholders, and are entitled to one vote for each Common Share held. In
  addition, holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive on a pro rata basis
  dividends if, as and when declared by our board of directors and, upon
  liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, are entitled to receive on a pro rata
  basis our net assets after payment of debts and other liabilities, in each 
case
  subject to the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to 
any
  other series or class of shares, including preferred shares, ranking in 
priority
  to, or equal with, the holders of the Common Shares. Any alteration of the
  rights attached to Common Shares must be approved by at least two-thirds of 
the
  Common Shares voted at a meeting of our shareholders.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Preferred Shares </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferred shares without par
  value may at any time and from time to time be issued in one or more series. 
Our
  board of directors may from time to time by resolution determine the maximum
  number of preferred shares of any such series or determine there is no 
maximum,
  determine the designation of the preferred shares of that series and amend our
  articles to create, define and attach, and if permitted by the <I>Business
    Corporations Act </I>(British Columbia) (&#147;<B>BCBCA</B>&#148;), alter, 
vary or
  abrogate, any special rights and restrictions to be attached to the preferred
  shares of that series. Except as provided in the special rights and 
restrictions
  attaching to the preferred shares, the holders of preferred shares will not be
  entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote any meeting of our shareholders.
  Holders of preferred shares will be entitled to preference with respect to the
  payment of dividends on such shares over the Common Shares, and over any other
  of our shares ranking junior to the preferred shares with respect to payment 
of
  dividends. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders
  of preferred shares will be entitled to preference with respect to 
distribution
  of our property or assets over the Common Shares and over any of our other
shares ranking junior to the preferred shares with respect to the repayment of
  capital paid up on, and the payment of any or all accrued and unpaid 
cumulative
  dividends whether or not earned or declared, or any or all declared and unpaid
  non-cumulative dividends, on the preferred shares. </P>

  Professional Conduct and with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is registered with the Public Company Accounting
  Oversight Board. </P>
<P align=center><B>ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a company organized and
  existing under the BCBCA. Many of our directors and officers, and some of the
  experts named in this Prospectus, are residents of Canada or otherwise reside
  outside the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets, 
and
  a substantial portion of our assets, are located outside the United States. We
  have appointed an agent for service of process in the United States, but it 
may
  be difficult for holders of Securities who reside in the United States to 
effect
  service within the United States upon those directors, officers and experts 
who
  are not residents of the United States. It may also be difficult for holders 
of
  Securities who reside in the United States to realize in the United States 
upon
  judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon our civil liability 
and
  the civil liability of our directors, officers and experts under the United
  States federal securities laws. A final judgment for a liquidated sum in 
favour
  of a private litigant granted by a United States court and predicated solely
  upon civil liability under United States federal securities laws would, 
subject
  to certain exceptions identified in the law of individual provinces and
  territories of Canada, likely be enforceable in Canada if the United States
  court in which the judgment was obtained had a basis for jurisdiction in the 
matter that would be recognized by the domestic Canadian
  court for the same purposes. There is a significant risk that a given Canadian
  court may not have jurisdiction or may decline jurisdiction over a claim based
  solely upon United States federal securities law on application of the 
conflict
  of laws principles of the province or territory in Canada in which the claim 
is
  brought.</P>
