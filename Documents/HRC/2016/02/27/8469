<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report investigates the extent to which the right of access to and 
enjoyment of cultural heritage, in all manifestations, form part of international human rights 
law today. It takes into consideration international instruments and the practice of relevant 
monitoring bodies. 
</p>
<p>2. Considering access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage as a human right is a 
necessary and complementary approach to the preservation/safeguard of cultural heritage. 
Beyond preserving/safeguarding an object or a manifestation in itself, it obliges one to take 
into account the rights of individuals and communities in relation to such object or 
manifestation and, in particular, to connect cultural heritage with its source of production. 
Cultural heritage is linked to human dignity and identity. Accessing and enjoying cultural 
heritage is an important feature of being a member of a community, a citizen and, more 
widely, a member of society. The importance of having access to one&#8217;s own cultural 
heritage, including linguistic heritage, and to that of others has been emphasized by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in general comment No. 21 on the 
right of everyone to take part in cultural life. As further stressed by the Committee, &#8220;the 
obligations to respect and to protect freedoms, cultural heritage and cultural diversity are 
interconnected&#8221;. 1 
</p>
<p>3. In order to collect the views of United Nations Member States, national human 
rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders, the independent 
expert disseminated a questionnaire on access to cultural heritage. Responses were received 
from 30 States and 22 other stakeholders (see Annex I). On 8 and 9 February 2011, the 
independent expert held an experts&#8217; meeting on the right to access and enjoy cultural 
heritage (see Annex II). She also convened a public consultation in Geneva on 10 February 
2011, in which some 35 States as well as other stakeholders participated. The in-depth 
discussions and various perspectives have provided valuable assistance to the independent 
expert in preparing the present report, and she is very grateful to all those who contributed. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Concept of cultural heritage from a human rights perspective 
</b></p>
<p>4. Various definitions of cultural heritage exist at the national level as well as in 
international instruments.2 Although no uniform definition can be found, these instruments, 
together with a number of references relating to traditional knowledge and traditional 
cultural expressions,,3 provide useful guidance for defining what is usually understood as 
</p>
<p>  
 1 General comment No. 21 (2009), Right of everyone to take part in cultural life (art. 15, para. 1 (a), of 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), E/C.12/GC/21, in particular 
paras. 49(d) and 50. 
</p>
<p> 2 See in particular UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural 
Heritage (1972), art. 1; Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003), 
art. 2; Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (Faro 
Convention) (2005), art. 2 (a); ASEAN Declaration On Cultural Heritage (2000), art. 1.  
</p>
<p> 3 For example, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) uses the terms &#8220;traditional cultural 
expressions&#8221; and &#8220;expressions of folklore&#8221; to refer to tangible and intangible forms in which 
traditional knowledge and cultural heritage are expressed, communicated, manifested and passed on 
within indigenous and traditional communities. These terms have replaced the term &#8216;folklore&#8217;, which 
had negative connotations.&#8221; See WIPO &#8220;Intellectual Property and the Safeguarding of Traditional 
Cultures:  Legal Issues and Practical Options for Museums, Libraries and Archives&#8221;, 2010, p. 106; 
see also Secretariat of Pacific Communities, Model Law for the Protection of Traditional Knowledge 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>cultural heritage. Noting that no list is exhaustive, the independent expert describes cultural 
heritage in the questionnaire as:  
</p>
<p>...tangible heritage (e.g. sites, structures and remains of archaeological, historical, 
religious, cultural or aesthetic value), intangible heritage (e.g. traditions, customs 
and practices, aesthetic and spiritual beliefs; vernacular or other languages; artistic 
expressions, folklore) and natural heritage (e.g. protected natural reserves; other 
protected biologically diverse areas; historic parks and gardens and cultural 
landscapes). 
</p>
<p>5. The concept of heritage reflects the dynamic character of something that has been 
developed, built or created, interpreted and re-interpreted in history, and transmitted from 
generation to generation. Cultural heritage links the past, the present and the future as it 
encompasses things inherited from the past that are considered to be of such value or 
significance today, that individuals and communities want to transmit them to future 
generations.  
</p>
<p>6. As stated by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in general 
comment No. 21 on the right of everyone to take part in cultural life, &#8220;the concept of culture 
must be seen not as a series of isolated manifestations or hermetic compartments, but as an 
interactive process whereby individuals and communities, while preserving their 
specificities and purposes, give expression to the culture of humanity&#8221;.4 Therefore, to speak 
of cultural heritage in the context of human rights entails taking into consideration the 
multiple heritages through which individuals and communities express their humanity, give 
meaning to their existence, build their worldviews and represent their encounter with the 
external forces affecting their lives.5 Cultural heritage is to be understood as resources 
enabling the cultural identification and development processes of individuals and 
communities which they, implicitly or explicitly, wish to transmit to future generations.  
</p>
<p>7. Several instruments reflect this approach and stress the importance of individuals 
and communities, including indigenous peoples, in defining and stewarding cultural 
heritage. In these instruments, the definition of cultural heritage is not limited to what is 
considered to be of outstanding value to humanity as a whole, but rather it encompasses 
what is of significance for particular individuals and communities, thereby emphasizing the 
human dimension of cultural heritage. For example, as one purpose of the UNESCO  
Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003) is to &#8220;ensure 
respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the communities, groups and individuals 
concerned&#8221;,6 the criteria for safeguarding is not the notion of outstanding universal value, 
but the meaning the heritage carries for a specific community. According to article 2.1 of 
the Convention, &#8220;&#8230;intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, 
is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their 
interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and 
continuity&#8221;. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Declaration on Cultural 
Heritage (2000) also includes a reference to cultural heritage that is &#8220;of considerable 
importance as habitat for the cultural survival and identity of particular living traditions&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p>  
and Expressions of Culture, in Regional Framework for the Protection of Traditional knowledge and 
Expressions of Culture, art. 4; see also the definition of &#8220;indigenous heritage&#8221; in the United Nations 
study on the &#8220;Protection of the heritage of indigenous peoples&#8221;, E/CN.4/Sub.2/1995/26, Annex, paras. 
11 and 12.

 6 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, art. 1 (b). 
 7 ASEAN Declaration on Cultural Heritage, art. 1 (c). </p>


<p>The Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for 
Society (Faro Convention) (2005), for its part, defines cultural heritage as &#8220;a group of 
resources inherited from the past which people identify, independently of ownership, as a 
reflection and expression of their constantly evolving values, beliefs, knowledge and 
traditions. It includes all aspects of the environment resulting from the interaction between 
people and places through time.&#8221;8 
</p>
<p>8. The independent expert notes that cultural heritage is not restricted to objects and 
manifestations about which individuals and communities may be proud. In some instances, 
heritage recalls errors made in the past and actions reflecting the darker side of humanity, 
the memory of which also needs to be transmitted to future generations, albeit in a different 
manner. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights issues related to cultural heritage  
</b></p>
<p>9. Human rights issues related to cultural heritage are numerous. They include 
questions regarding who defines what cultural heritage is and its significance; which 
cultural heritage deserves protection; the extent to which individuals and communities 
participate in the interpretation, preservation/safeguarding of cultural heritage, have access 
to and enjoy it; how to resolve conflicts and competing interests over cultural heritage; and 
what the possible limitations to a right to cultural heritage are. 
</p>
<p>10. Since cultural heritage encompasses things that are assigned significance, its 
identification requires a selection process. Usually, selection processes in which the State 
plays the main role are reflective of power differentials; likewise, selection by communities 
may also indicate internal differences. As already stated by the independent expert, power 
differentials must be taken into consideration, as they impact the ability of individuals and 
groups to effectively contribute to the identification, development and interpretation of 
what should be considered as a common &#8220;culture&#8221; or shared cultural heritage.9 Hence, the 
participation of individuals and communities in cultural heritage matters is crucial, fully 
respecting the freedom of individuals to participate or not in one or several communities, to 
develop their multiple identities, to access their cultural heritage as well as that of others, 
and to contribute to the creation of culture, including through the contestation of dominant 
norms and values within the communities they belong to as well as those of other 
communities.10   
</p>
<p>11. While cultural heritage could be instrumental in the protection of cultural diversity, 
conversely, it could be recognized selectively to force individuals and communities to 
assimilate into a mainstream community/society. Cultural symbols of dominant 
communities may be glorified, and the content of education and information about cultural 
heritage may be distorted for political purposes. Depending on their own histories, 
communities may have diverging interpretations of a specific cultural heritage, which are 
not always taken into consideration in implementing preservation/safeguard programmes. 
Particular aspects of the past may be emphasized or removed, in line with political 
processes and the will to shape public opinion, to unite or separate peoples and 
communities. Limited access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage may also be used as 
tools to exert political or social pressure.

 9 A/HRC/14/36, para. 6. 
 10 Ibid., para. 10. </p>


<p>12. Competing claims and interests over cultural heritage may lead to controversy and 
conflict. Different individuals, communities and/or the State may claim ownership of, 
interest in, and rights to certain cultural heritage. In particular, many communities argue 
that their cultural heritage is merely used for commercial purposes, in tourism, by cultural 
industries or the mass media, or as part of showcasing national culture, without proper 
authorization or shared benefits. The independent expert notes in this regard the current 
negotiations at the WIPO aimed at developing an international instrument to protect 
traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions. A good balance needs to be 
found. While overly strict protection may stifle creativity, artistic freedom and cultural 
exchanges, the misappropriation of cultural heritage would also impair the rights of 
communities to access and enjoy their own cultural heritage.11   
</p>
<p>13. Globalization, the exploitation of economic resources, the promotion of tourism, and 
development programmes may have a detrimental impact on the ability of individuals and 
communities to preserve/safeguard, develop and transmit their cultural heritage, including 
cultural practices, specific ways of life, and cultural sites and landscapes.  
</p>
<p>14. The disconnection which may occur between cultural heritage and the people 
concerned is an important human rights issue. The challenge is how to ensure that the 
people themselves, in particular source communities, are empowered, and that cultural 
heritage issues are not confined to preservation/safeguarding. In particular, cultural heritage 
programmes should not be implemented at the expense of individuals and communities 
who, sometimes, for the sake of preservation purposes, are displaced or given limited 
access to their own cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>15. The destruction of cultural heritage in the context of war or conflict also has 
important human rights implications. The right of access to and enjoyment of cultural 
heritage of others in a non-stereotypical way in post-conflict situations is of utmost 
importance. The independent expert notes in this regard that, today, cultural peace-making 
traditions are often endangered. Peace-building processes should include the repair of 
cultural heritage with the participation of all concerned, and the promotion of intercultural 
dialogue regarding cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>16. Other human rights issues may arise when elements of the cultural heritage of 
specific communities are stored or displayed in cultural institutions, in particular museums, 
libraries and archives, without the participation or consent of those communities, and/or in 
a manner not respecting the significance and interpretation they give to such heritage. 
Respecting the express wishes of the source community may entail destruction, for 
example, when a community feels that when an individual passes away their name, voice, 
and creations must be erased, or that human remains should be buried or specific objects 
burnt or destroyed. Another issue often raised relates to the possible human rights 
dimension of calls for repatriation of cultural heritage. The independent expert underlines in 
this regard, the need to build stronger relationships between cultural institutions and 
communities, including indigenous peoples, and to develop good practices, building on 
existing initiatives.12  
</p>
<p>17. The improvement of infrastructure and policies to ensure access to and enjoyment of 
cultural heritage by people living in extreme poverty, as well as people with mental and 
physical disabilities, continues to be a challenge.

<p><b> IV. References in international law relating to the rights of 
individuals and communities in relation to cultural heritage, 
and initiatives at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>18. Because the destruction of cultural heritage can be used as a strategy to destroy the 
morale of the enemy, cultural heritage is firstly considered in international humanitarian 
law as requiring a special protection regime in times of conflict and war.13 According to 
international criminal law, individual criminal responsibility can include serious offences 
against cultural heritage.14 In particular, the destruction of cultural property with 
discriminatory intent against a cultural community can be charged as a crime against 
humanity, and the intentional destruction of cultural and religious property and symbols can 
be considered as evidence of an intent to destroy a group within the meaning of the 
Genocide Convention.15  
</p>
<p>19. Numerous international instruments on the protection of cultural heritage in times of 
peace have also been adopted. Besides a number of declarations and recommendations, 
Member States of UNESCO have adopted the Convention concerning the Protection of the 
World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972); the Convention on the Protection of the 
Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001); and the Convention on the Safeguarding of the 
Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003). The widespread support for the 1972 and 2003 
Conventions demonstrates the general agreement on the need to preserve/safeguard cultural 
heritage. Some instruments have also been adopted at the regional level.16 
</p>
<p>20. Although these instruments do not necessarily have a human rights approach to 
cultural heritage, in recent years, a shift has taken place from the preservation/safeguard of 
cultural heritage as such, based on its outstanding value for humanity, to the protection of 
cultural heritage as being of crucial value for individuals and communities in relation to 
their cultural identity. In particular, the addition of intangible heritage as a cultural object to 
be safeguarded has been instrumental to the increased emphasis on the link between 
cultural heritage and cultural identity. At the same time, the &#8220;deep-seated interdependence&#8221; 
between intangible and tangible heritage is increasingly being taken into consideration.17 
Generally speaking, the more recent the instrument, the stronger the link with rights of 
individuals and communities. Notably, the UNESCO Declaration on the Intentional 
Destruction of Cultural Heritage, adopted in 2003, stresses that &#8220;cultural heritage is an

instruments, such as the Faro Convention, do not distinguish between tangible and intangible heritage. </p>


<p>important component of the cultural identity of communities, groups and individuals, and 
of social cohesion, so that its intentional destruction may have adverse consequences on 
human dignity and human rights&#8221;.18 
</p>
<p>21. In parallel, although the right to cultural heritage does not appear per se, references 
to cultural heritage have emerged in international human rights instruments and in the 
practice of monitoring bodies. The link between cultural heritage, cultural diversity and 
cultural rights has been strengthened. There is a better understanding today that, in order to 
respect and protect cultural identity, tangible cultural heritage should be preserved with a 
view to maintaining its authenticity and integrity, intangible cultural heritage should be 
safeguarded to ensure viability and continuity, and rights of access to and enjoyment of 
cultural heritage should be guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>22. Within international law instruments and practice, references can be found on the 
participation of communities and individuals in cultural heritage, as well as their access to 
and enjoyment of cultural heritage. Indeed, participation, access and enjoyment are closely 
interrelated. 
</p>
<p><b> A. UNESCO instruments 
</b></p>
<p>23. Although UNESCO instruments do not generally specify the rights of individuals 
and/or communities to cultural heritage, several entry points in the instruments themselves, 
or developed through practice, invite the adoption of a human rights-based approach. In 
particular, a shift can be seen from the preservation/safeguarding of cultural heritage for the 
public at large to the preservation/safeguarding of cultural heritage of and for communities, 
involving them in the processes of identification and stewardship.  
</p>
<p>24. Increasing recognition to community involvement has been accorded over the years 
under the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural 
Heritage. In 2007, the World Heritage Committee introduced an additional strategic 
objective, calling on States to enhance the role of communities in the implementation of the 
Convention. Furthermore, the Operational Guidelines of the Convention consider local 
communities as partners and strengthen community involvement in nomination, 
management and monitoring,19 which constitutes a significant step. 
</p>
<p>25. The Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage is more 
specific and recognizes that &#8220;communities, in particular indigenous communities, groups 
and, in some cases, individuals play an important role in the production, safeguarding, 
maintenance and recreation of the intangible cultural heritage&#8221;.20 The Convention, together 
with its Operational Directives, emphasizes that State activities can only be undertaken with 
the active involvement or participation of concerned communities, groups and individuals.21 
In particular, their free, prior and informed consent is required for inscribing intangible 
cultural heritage elements on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent

160 and 162. </p>


<p>Safeguarding or Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and 
for including programmes, projects or activities on the Register of Best Practices. 22 
</p>
<p>26. The obligation to include cultural heritage in educational programmes and to raise 
awareness on the existence and value of cultural heritage is also included in UNESCO 
instruments. For example, according to article 27(1) of the Convention concerning the 
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, States &#8220;shall endeavour by all 
appropriate means, and in particular by educational and information programmes, to 
strengthen appreciation and respect by their peoples of the cultural and natural heritage 
defined in articles 1 and 2&#8221;. The Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural 
Heritage more specifically holds that States should &#8220;(a) ensure recognition of, respect for, 
and enhancement of the intangible cultural heritage in society, in particular through: (i) 
educational, awareness-raising and information programmes, aimed at the general public, in 
particular young people; (ii) specific educational and training programmes within the 
communities and groups concerned&#8230;&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p>27. Reference must also be made to instruments addressing the impact of globalization 
and free trade on the diversity of cultural expressions through which cultural heritage is 
expressed, augmented, and transmitted. In particular, the 2001 Universal Declaration on 
Cultural Diversity stresses &#8220;the specificity of cultural goods and services which, as vectors 
of identity, values and meaning, must not be treated as mere commodities or consumer 
goods,&#8221;24 and that &#8220;while ensuring the free circulation of ideas and works, cultural policies 
must create conditions conducive to the production and dissemination of diversified cultural 
goods and services through cultural industries that have the means to assert themselves at 
the local and global level.&#8221;25 This is echoed by the Convention on the Protection and 
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005), which lays down a &#8220;principle of 
equitable access&#8221; according to which &#8220;equitable access to a rich and diversified range of 
cultural expressions from all over the world and access of cultures to the means of 
expression and dissemination constitute important elements for enhancing cultural diversity 
and encouraging mutual understanding.&#8221;26 The Convention on the Protection of Underwater 
Cultural Heritage specifically forbids trade in such heritage.27  
</p>
<p><b> B. Convention on Biological Diversity  
</b></p>
<p>28. Under article 8 (j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity, States shall &#8220;respect, 
preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local 
communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable 
use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and 
involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the 
equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations 
and practices&#8221;.

<p><b> C. Regional instruments and initiatives relating to cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>29. Some regional instruments for the preservation/safeguard of cultural heritage, such 
as the Charter for African Cultural Renaissance (2006), establish clear bridges between 
cultural rights, cultural diversity and cultural heritage. The Charter recognizes that all 
cultures emanate from societies, communities, groups and individuals and that any African 
cultural policy should, of necessity, enable peoples to evolve for increased responsibility in 
its development.28 Article 15, in particular, calls on States to &#8220;create an enabling 
environment to enhance the access and participation of all in culture, including 
marginalized and underprivileged communities.&#8221; The Charter echoes the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (1981), according to which &#8220;All peoples shall have the right 
to their economic, social and cultural development with due regard to their freedom and 
identity and in the equal enjoyment of the common heritage of mankind.&#8221;29 
</p>
<p>30. The ASEAN Declaration on Cultural Heritage (2000) also refers to the human rights 
dimension of cultural heritage, recognizing that &#8220;&#8230;all cultural heritage, identities and 
expressions, cultural rights and freedoms derive from the dignity and worth inherent in the 
human person in creative interaction with other human persons and that the creative 
communities of human persons in ASEAN are the main agents and consequently should be 
the principal beneficiary of, and participate actively in the realization of these heritage, 
expressions and rights&#8230;&#8221;30 Furthermore, the Declaration refers to &#8220;the people&#8217;s right to 
their own culture&#8221;,31 the recognition of communal intellectual property rights, the need to 
ensure that &#8220;traditional communities have access, protection and rights of ownership to 
their own heritage&#8221;32 and calls for increased efforts to assist countries &#8220;to create the 
conditions under which individuals can participate in cultural heritage planning and 
development.&#8221;33  
</p>
<p>31. The European Faro Convention more openly takes the approach of cultural heritage 
rights. It recognizes that &#8220;every person has a right to engage with the cultural heritage of 
their choice&#8230; as an aspect of the right freely to participate in cultural life&#8221;.34 Stressing &#8220;the 
need to involve everyone in society in the ongoing process of defining and managing 
cultural heritage&#8221;, it contains references to the right to benefit from cultural heritage and to 
contribute towards its enrichment,35 the participation of everyone &#8220;in the process of 
identification, study, interpretation, protection, conservation and presentation of the cultural 
heritage&#8221;,36 and access.37 Of note, the Convention calls on States to &#8220;encourage reflection 
on the ethics and methods of presentation of the cultural heritage, as well as respect for 
diversity of interpretations&#8221; and to &#8220;establish processes for conciliation to deal equitably 
with situations where contradictory values are placed on the same cultural heritage by 
different communities&#8221;.38

Community has developed a Model Law for the Protection of Traditional Knowledge and

<p>Expressions of Culture, establishing a range of statutory rights for traditional owners of 
traditional knowledge and expressions of culture, in particular the requirement that their 
prior and informed consent be obtained before their traditional knowledge or expressions of 
culture are used for a non-customary use.39  
</p>
<p><b> D. Human rights instruments  
</b></p>
<p>33. In international human rights treaties, a number of provisions constitute a legal basis 
of a right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The right to take part in cultural life 
</b></p>
<p>34. One of the most explicit provisions in relation to access to and enjoyment of cultural 
heritage is article 15(1)(a) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights which obliges States to recognize the right of everyone to take part in cultural life. In 
its general comment No. 21, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
stressed that &#8220;...in many instances, the obligations to respect and to protect freedoms, 
cultural heritage and diversity are interconnected&#8221;. The Committee makes it clear that the 
obligation to respect the right to take part in cultural life &#8220;&#8230;includes the adoption of 
specific measures aimed at achieving respect for the right of everyone, individually or in 
association with others or within a community or group&#8230; to have access to their own 
cultural and linguistic heritage and to that of others.&#8221;40 The right to participate in cultural 
life implies that individuals and communities have access to and enjoy cultural heritages 
that are meaningful to them, and that their freedom to continuously (re)create cultural 
heritage and transmit it to future generations should be protected.  
</p>
<p>35. The Committee especially emphasized that: &#8220;&#8230;States must respect free access by 
minorities to their own culture, heritage and other forms of expression, as well as the free 
exercise of their cultural identity and practices. States parties must also respect the rights of 
indigenous peoples to their culture and heritage and to maintain and strengthen their 
spiritual relationship with their ancestral lands and other natural resources traditionally 
owned, occupied or used by them, and indispensable to their cultural life.&#8221;41  
</p>
<p>36. It also considered as a core obligation the obligation of States to &#8220;allow and 
encourage the participation of persons belonging to minority groups, indigenous peoples or 
to other communities in the design and implementation of laws and policies that affect 
them. In particular, States parties should obtain their free and informed prior consent when 
the preservation of their cultural resources, especially those associated with their way of life 
and cultural expression, are at risk.&#8221;42 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The right to enjoy one&#8217;s own culture 
</b></p>
<p>37. Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
provides for  the right of members of minorities to enjoy their own culture, practice their 
own religion and use their own language. A similar provision is found is article 30 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which applies to both minority and indigenous 
children. These provisions do not mention cultural heritage specifically, however, people 
cannot enjoy culture without accessing and enjoying cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>

<p>38. The Human Rights Committee observed &#8220;that culture manifests itself in many 
forms, including a particular way of life associated with the use of land resources, 
especially in the case of indigenous peoples&#8221; and noted that it can include traditional 
economic activities such as fishing and hunting.43  
</p>
<p>39. The Committee established a set of criteria to identify violations of the provision 
contained in article 27 of the ICCPR. In general, State interference with the enjoyment of 
culture must have a reasonable and objective justification and be compatible with the other 
provisions of the Covenant. States must ensure the effective participation of members of 
minorities in decisions affecting them and limit the negative impact of the measures taken.44 
This implies more than mere information or consultation; it entails meaningful participation 
and prior and informed consent of the community concerned.45 
</p>
<p>40. Many useful references are contained in the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Persons belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. For 
instance, under article 4.2, &#8220;States shall take measures to create favourable conditions to 
enable persons belonging to minorities to express their characteristics and to develop their 
culture, language, religion, traditions and customs, &#8230;.&#8221; In the same spirit, States Parties to 
the Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities 
undertake &#8220;to promote the conditions necessary for persons belonging to national minorities 
to maintain and develop their culture, and to preserve the essential elements of their 
identity, namely their religion, language, traditions and cultural heritage&#8221;.46 The European 
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is also worth mentioning. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>41. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the 
International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples in Independent Countries contain many provisions relating to cultural rights and, 
more or less explicitly, cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>42. In applying the provisions of the Convention, &#8220;the social, cultural, religious and 
spiritual values and practices of these peoples shall be recognized and protected&#8221;.47 
Furthermore, Governments shall &#8220;consult the peoples concerned, through appropriate 
procedures and in particular through their representative institutions, whenever 
consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect 
them directly&#8221;.48 
</p>
<p>43. Among other important provisions, in particular those relating to the free, prior and 
informed consent of indigenous peoples, article 31 of the United Nations Declaration 
stipulates that:  
</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their 
cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well

<p>as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human 
and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and 
flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual 
and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and 
develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional 
knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.  
</p>
<p>Article 34 adds that &#8220;indigenous peoples have the right to promote, develop and maintain 
their institutional structures and their distinctive customs, spirituality, traditions, procedures, 
practices and, in the cases where they exist, juridical systems or customs, in accordance 
with international human rights standards.&#8221; </p>
<p><b> 4. Other human rights 
</b></p>
<p>44. Many other human rights norms are important for the implementation of the right of 
access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage. These must be interpreted in relation to the 
non-discrimination principle, in particular on the basis of cultural identity. 
</p>
<p>45. The right of peoples to self-determination protects the right of peoples to freely 
pursue their cultural development, and dispose of their natural wealth and resources, which 
has a clear link with cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>46. The right to education is crucial in fostering respect for the diversity of cultural 
heritages and expressions, and in ensuring access to one&#8217;s own cultural heritage and that of 
others. In particular, article 29 (c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that 
education shall be directed to &#8220;the development of respect for the child's parents, his or her 
own cultural identity, language and values, for the national values of the country in which 
the child is living, the country from which he or she may originate, and for civilizations 
different from his or her own.&#8221; Linguistic rights within educational systems are especially 
relevant. Languages should not be downgraded as mere mediums of transmission; they 
carry and convey histories and world views, constituting heritage in themselves. Besides, 
the inclusion in educational programmes of peace-making values, attitudes, modes of 
behaviour and ways of life could make an important contribution to strengthening the 
ability of youth to resolve conflicts and disputes peacefully, as called for in the Declaration 
and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace.49 
</p>
<p>47. The right to freedom of expression is essential for the development and maintenance 
of cultural heritage, and dialogue when conflicts of interpretation about the meaning and 
significance of cultural heritage arise. Similarly, the right to information plays an important 
role; people need to be adequately informed about the existence, significance and 
background of diverse cultural heritages, about the possibilities of accessing or 
participating in these, and, where relevant, about debates surrounding the interpretation to 
be given to cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>48. Since much of cultural heritage has religious connotations, the right to freedom of 
thought and religion is of great relevance for the right of access to and enjoyment cultural 
heritage, as it protects, in particular, access to religious sites and memorials, as well as the 
pursuit of religious practices.  
</p>
<p>  
 49 General Assembly resolution 53/243. </p>


<p><b> E. Initiatives at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>49. As indicated by the responses to the independent expert&#8217;s questionnaire, many 
national constitutions include the State&#8217;s obligation to protect cultural heritage and/or 
recognize the right of people to access culture or cultural heritage. This further 
demonstrates the importance accorded by States to cultural heritage issues. Although the 
measures adopted often aim at the preservation/safeguard of the heritage itself, as well as 
the promotion of tourism and development, ultimate goals include public awareness, 
education, and access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage by all. In their responses, many 
States made a link between respect for cultural rights, cultural diversity, and the need to 
preserve/safeguard cultural heritage. Some also provided information on measures adopted 
to ensure the preservation/safeguard of the cultural heritage of minorities and indigenous 
peoples, including their languages. 
</p>
<p>50. State institutions are usually entrusted with the task of identifying and classifying 
cultural heritage. Some stakeholders claim that in some countries, challenges are 
encountered in obtaining information on procedures for the recognition of cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>51. However, several States have reported efforts to ensure the involvement of 
individuals and communities, in particular, but not only, with regard to intangible heritage. 
For instance, in Austria, communities, groups and individuals that create, maintain and 
transmit intangible heritage are involved in the process of identification; tradition bearers 
and practitioners may, with the consent of the communities concerned, request the inclusion 
of an element of living traditions in the national inventory. In Syria, heritage bearers and 
practitioners are encouraged to participate in the identification of intangible heritage, and 
communities are actively involved in safeguarding activities. In Canada, First Nations are 
involved in the identification and classification of national parks, historic sites and marine 
conservation areas; there are also provincial measures involving indigenous peoples. In 
Nicaragua, local cultural actors participate in the identification of local cultural heritage 
through the National Inventory of the Cultural Goods of Nicaragua. In Cuba and 
Venezuela, communities are associated in the identification and classification of cultural 
heritage. The Ombudsman of Portugal reported on concrete examples of participation by 
interested persons and groups in the determination of cultural heritage, and Portugal 
mentioned a nationwide inventory of intangible cultural heritage that will be put on-line to 
ensure the widest participation of communities, groups and individuals in the safeguarding 
of their intangible heritage and the making of inventories. Malaysia reported on formal and 
informal information and presentations made to &#8220;various groups of users and interested 
groups&#8221; in regard to cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>52. A number of States provide for the participation of the public at large, citizens or 
interested persons, in cultural heritage identification processes (for example, Canada, 
Georgia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Portugal and Uzbekistan). The Dominican Republic reported 
on a draft law to ensure the participation of interested persons, including through 
cooperation with the mass media. Some States reported that information on cultural 
heritage identification and classification is publicly disseminated (for example, Canada, 
Italy and Spain), or that the civil society, through associations working in the field of 
cultural heritage, is involved in identification and classification processes (for example, 
Monaco and Switzerland).  
</p>
<p>53. The independent expert notes that in most cases the final decision for identification/ 
classification of cultural heritage lies with State institutions. Reference to &#8220;stakeholders&#8221; or 
&#8220;interested persons&#8221; is not always defined at the national level, and variously includes, for 
example, State institutions, local authorities, experts, public or private owners, associations, 
communities and/or individuals. The need to ensure the participation of source or local 
communities, and actively seek their consent is not always clearly stated. </p>


<p>54. Considerable information was received on initiatives taken in the field of 
information technologies to foster access to cultural heritage. For instance, in Austria, 
special attention is paid to the production of educational materials incorporating new 
electronic media in minority languages. Germany noted that its digitization project must be 
accompanied by intensified efforts in the field of cultural education and media literacy. 
While new technologies allow for exciting advances in the field of cultural heritage, it is 
important to use these tools in ways that allow for the greatest possible access while 
preserving/safeguarding the heritage. 
</p>
<p>55. States also reported on awareness-raising and educational programmes (in particular, 
multicultural education), and support to cultural events and activities. The United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, for example, has a free admission policy for its 
national-funded museums and galleries. A number of national legislations and programmes, 
for example in the Dominican Republic, Greece, Italy, and Mexico, specifically address the 
issue of access to cultural heritage in particular by disabled persons, the elderly, minorities, 
migrants, refugees and/or children and students. 
</p>
<p>56. Responses to the questionnaire have addressed the issue of possible limitations to 
the right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage, in particular for conservation 
purposes. Information was received on access being reserved for specific communities 
based on their traditions in Nepal, on limits being imposed on access to sites significant to 
indigenous peoples in Canada, and to the cultural heritage of isolated indigenous peoples in 
Ecuador. A number of States stressed that access may be restricted to privately owned 
cultural heritage. In this respect, many European countries reported on their participation in 
European heritage days when people are allowed to freely visit sites usually closed to the 
public. 
</p>
<p>57. The independent expert welcomes information received on available remedies. For 
example, in Burkina Faso, citizens may commence proceedings or petition against acts 
endangering public heritage. Complaints in case of denial of access to cultural heritage may 
be lodged before the Ministry of Culture in Spain, and the courts in Mauritius. In 
Switzerland, associations working in the field of cultural heritage may challenge 
construction permits affecting cultural heritage before the courts. In Canada, indigenous 
peoples may also seek redress. The Ombudsman of Portugal reported on concrete cases 
brought to its attention, in particular regarding the lack of participation of concerned 
communities in the determination of protected cultural landscapes. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Normative content  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access and enjoyment 
</b></p>
<p>58. Access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage are interdependent concepts &#8211; one 
implying the other. They convey an ability to, inter alia, know, understand, enter, visit, 
make use of, maintain, exchange and develop cultural heritage, as well as to benefit from 
the cultural heritage and creations of others, without political, religious, economic or 
physical encumbrances. Individuals and communities cannot be seen as mere beneficiaries 
or users of cultural heritage. Access and enjoyment also imply contributing to the 
identification, interpretation and development of cultural heritage, as well as to the design 
and implementation of preservation/safeguard policies and programmes. Effective 
participation in decision-making processes relating to cultural heritage is a key element of 
these concepts.  </p>


<p>59. This approach is reflected in the UNESCO Recommendation on Participation by the 
People at Large in Cultural Life and Their Contribution to It (1976), which defines, access 
to culture as &#8220;concrete opportunities available to everyone, in particular through the 
creation of appropriate socio-economic conditions, for freely obtaining information, 
training, knowledge and understanding, and for enjoying cultural values and cultural 
property.&#8221;50 General comment No. 21 also stresses that &#8220;access covers in particular the right 
of everyone &#8211; alone, in association with others, or as a community &#8211; to know and 
understand his or her own culture and that of others through education and information, and 
to receive quality education and training with due regard for cultural identity. Everyone has 
also the right to learn about forms of expression and dissemination through any technical 
medium of information or communication, to follow a way of life associated with the use of 
cultural goods and resources such as land, water, biodiversity, language or specific 
institutions, and to benefit from the cultural heritage and the creation of other individuals 
and communities.&#8221;51 
</p>
<p>60. The concept of access has been specifically developed by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.52 Applied to cultural heritage, the following must be 
ensured: (a) physical access to cultural heritage, which may be complemented by access 
through information technologies;53 (b) economic access, which means that access should 
be affordable to all; (c). information access, which refers to the right to seek, receive and 
impart information on cultural heritage, without borders; and (d) access to decision making 
and monitoring procedures, including administrative and judicial procedures and remedies. 
An overlapping principle is non-discrimination, with special attention to disadvantaged 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Rights-holders, and concerned individuals and communities 
</b></p>
<p>61. Individuals and groups, the majority and minorities, citizens and migrants all have 
the right to access and enjoy cultural heritage. As mentioned above, general comment No. 
21 stresses that the right to take part in cultural life may be exercised alone, in association 
with others, or as a community. Therefore, the right of access to and enjoyment of cultural 
heritage must be considered both as an individual and a collective human right.54 In the case 
of indigenous peoples, this also stems from the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples.  
</p>
<p>62. Varying degrees of access and enjoyment may be recognized, taking into 
consideration the diverse interests of individuals and groups according to their relationship 
with specific cultural heritages. Distinctions should be made between (a) originators or 
&#8220;source communities&#8221;, communities which consider themselves as the custodians/owners 
of a specific cultural heritage, people who are keeping cultural heritage alive and/or have 
taken responsibility for it; (b) individuals and communities, including local communities, 
who consider the cultural heritage in question an integral part of the life of the community, 
but may not be actively involved in its maintenance; (c) scientists and artists; and (d) the 
</p>
<p>  
 50  UNESCO Recommendation on Participation by the People at Large in Cultural Life and Their 
</p>
<p>Contribution to It, para. 1 (a). 
 51  General comment No. 21 (2009), para. 15 (b). 
 52  Access forms part of the so-called 4A scheme, composed of four elements: availability, accessibility, 
</p>
<p>acceptability and adaptability. This scheme was elaborated by the late Professor Katarina 
Tomasevski, Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, in E/CN.4/1999/49, and is systematically 
used by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its general comments. 
</p>
<p> 53  See in particular UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage (2003). 
 54  See also the Council of Europe Faro Convention which states that &#8220;everyone, alone or collectively, 
</p>
<p>has the right to benefit from cultural heritage...&#8221;, art. 4(a). </p>


<p>general public accessing the cultural heritage of others. Interestingly, the Faro Convention 
refers to the notion of &#8220;heritage community&#8221;, which &#8220;consists of people who value specific 
aspects of cultural heritage which they wish, within the framework of public action, to 
sustain and transmit to future generations.&#8221;55 This implies that concerned communities may 
reunite people from diverse cultural, religious, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds over a 
specific cultural heritage that they consider they have in common.  
</p>
<p>63. This distinction has important implications for States, notably when establishing 
consultation and participation procedures, which should ensure the active involvement of 
source and local communities, in particular. Therefore, general calls for public participation 
may not be sufficient. Taking into consideration the varied situations of individuals and 
groups is also of importance when States, or courts, are required to arbitrate conflicts of 
interests over cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p><b> B. State obligations 
</b></p>
<p>64. The language used to describe State obligations in cultural heritage instruments and 
human rights instruments differ. Within the framework of UNESCO and WIPO, 
&#8220;protection&#8221;, &#8220;preservation&#8221; and &#8220;safeguard&#8221; have different meanings. While 
&#8220;preservation&#8221; is used for tangible heritage with a focus on maintaining their &#8220;authenticity&#8221; 
and &#8220;integrity&#8221;; &#8220;safeguarding&#8221; focuses on the &#8220;viability&#8221; and &#8220;continuity&#8221; of intangible 
heritage. &#8220;Protection&#8221; at WIPO means protecting the creativity and distinctiveness inherent 
in expressions against unauthorized or illegitimate use by third parties.56  
</p>
<p>65. In the human rights language, State obligations are commonly described following 
the typology of respect, protect and fulfil. These obligations can be elucidated taking into 
consideration relevant elements in cultural heritage instruments, interpretation of relevant 
human rights provisions, based in particular on general comment No. 21, and the 
development of good practices at the regional and national levels.  
</p>
<p>66. The obligation to respect requires States to refrain from interfering, directly or 
indirectly, with the right to access and to enjoy cultural heritage, while their obligation to 
protect requires that they prevent third parties from interfering with that right. General 
comment No. 21 stresses in particular that States have the obligation to:  
 (a) Respect and protect cultural heritage in all its forms, in times of war and 
peace, and natural disasters; (&#8230;). 
</p>
<p> (b) Respect and protect cultural heritage of all groups and communities, in 
particular the most disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups, in economic 
development and environmental policies and programmes; (&#8230;). 
</p>
<p> (c) Res-pect and protect the cultural productions of indigenous peoples, 
including their traditional knowledge, natural medicines, folklore, rituals and other forms of 
expression;  
</p>
<p>This includes protection from illegal or unjust exploitation of their lands, territories and 
resources by State entities or private or transnational enterprises and corporations.57 
</p>
<p>67. The obligation to fulfil requires States to take appropriate measures aimed at the full 
realization of the right to access and enjoy cultural heritage by all, and at improving the 
</p>
<p>  
 55  Council of Europe Faro Convention, art. 2(b). 
 56  WIPO, op. cit., p. 18. 
 57  General comment No. 21 (2009), para. 50. </p>


<p>conditions under which this right can be enjoyed. Under article 15.1 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, States have the general obligation to 
take positive measures for the conservation, development and diffusion of culture, which 
entails protection, preservation/safeguard, dissemination of information on and promotion 
of cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>68. Several obligations, as described in general comment No. 21, are relevant to the 
right to access and enjoy cultural heritage.58 For example, States have the core obligation to 
&#8220;eliminate any barriers or obstacles that inhibit or restrict a person&#8217;s access to the person&#8217;s 
own culture or to other cultures, without discrimination and without consideration for 
frontiers of any kind&#8221;.59 States must develop programmes and policies aimed at &#8220;guaranteed 
access for all, without discrimination on grounds of financial or any other status, to 
museums, libraries, cinemas and theatres and to cultural activities, services and events&#8221;. 
Although entrance fees may be necessary, measures can ensure that they do not constitute 
an insurmountable obstacle for people with scarce financial resources. Programmes &#8220;aimed 
at preserving and restoring cultural heritage,&#8221;60 should also be developed. States should 
further set up an institutional framework and support cultural institutions by adopting 
policies &#8220;for the protection and promotion of cultural diversity, and facilitating access to a 
rich and diversified range of cultural expressions, including through, inter alia, measures 
aimed at establishing and supporting public institutions and the cultural infrastructure 
necessary for the implementation of such policies...&#8221;.61   
</p>
<p>69. States also have international obligations, mainly to foster assistance and 
cooperation to protect and promote access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage.62 This 
implies facilitating and promoting cultural exchanges, but also providing intellectual or 
financial support to States that have difficulties in preserving/safeguarding cultural heritage. 
While drafting international agreements, in particular on trade and development, States 
should take into account the right to access and enjoy cultural heritage and ensure it is 
respected. 
</p>
<p>70. A strong human rights-based approach to the preservation/safeguard of cultural 
heritage, both tangible and intangible, requires the establishment of procedures ensuring the 
full participation of concerned individuals and communities. This includes public reflection 
and debate on the opportunities and challenges cultural heritage may present.  
</p>
<p>71. The independent expert further wishes to stress that public, fair, and just procedures 
should be established to arbitrate competing demands for resources by communities who 
wish to develop and implement cultural heritage preservation/safeguard programmes. The 
principle of non-discrimination should be robustly reaffirmed in this regard. More 
generally, effective remedies, including judicial remedies, should be made available to 
individuals and communities who feel that their cultural heritage is not fully respected 
and/or protected, or that their right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage has been 
infringed upon. 
</p>
<p>72. It has often been alleged that scarce economic resources impede States from 
adopting measures aimed at identifying and preserving/safeguarding cultural heritages. 
However, not all obligations, in particular those to recognize the diversity of cultural 
heritages and to ensure the participation of concerned individuals and communities, are 
costly. Lack of action by States also results from cultural rights not being considered as a

 62  Ibid., paras. 56-59. </p>


<p>priority. The independent expert recalls that cultural rights should be treated as other human 
rights and that, under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
States must devote the maximum of their available resources to achieve progressively the 
full realization of rights. In this regard, the obligation to seek and provide international 
assistance and cooperation is firmly laid down in article 2 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Possible limitations 
</b></p>
<p>73. The independent expert already addressed the issue of limitations to cultural rights 
in her first report. Cultural rights may be limited in certain circumstances, following the 
principles enshrined in international human rights law.63 This also applies to the right of 
access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>74. Some practices, which are part of cultural heritage, may infringe upon human rights. 
International instruments clearly state that practices contrary to human rights cannot be 
justified with a plea for the preservation/safeguard of cultural heritage, cultural diversity or 
cultural rights. Under the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural 
Heritage, in particular, &#8220;&#8230;consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural 
heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as 
with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and 
of sustainable development.&#8221;64  
</p>
<p>75. As stressed by many actors, limitations to access can also be imposed to ensure the 
preservation/safeguard of cultural heritage against damage, disappearance or destruction. 
For example, States may legitimately regulate public use and access to a specific site, 
monument or cultural manifestation for safety or conservation purposes, or to protect the 
right of a community to access and enjoy its own cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>76. In this respect, the independent expert again stresses that under the human rights 
framework, unequal situations must be dealt with differently. As stated in paragraph 59 
above, varying degrees of access and enjoyment may be recognized, taking into 
consideration the diverse interests of individuals and communities according to their 
relationship with specific cultural heritages. Consequently, the general public may not 
enjoy the same rights as local communities. Access to a monument or archives by tourists 
and researchers should not be to the detriment of either the object in question or its source 
community. Specific indigenous or religious sites may be fully accessible to the concerned 
peoples and communities, but not to the general public. As stated in the Convention for the 
Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, access to cultural heritage should be 
ensured &#8220;while respecting customary practices governing access to specific aspects of such 
heritage&#8221;.65  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>As reflected in international law and practice, the need to preserve/safeguard 
cultural heritage is a human rights issue. Cultural heritage is important not only in 
itself, but also in relation to its human dimension, in particular its significance for 
individuals and communities and their identity and development processes.

 64  Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, art. 2.1. 
 65  Ibid., art. 13 (d) (ii) </p>


<p>78. <b>The right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage forms part of 
international human rights law, finding its legal basis, in particular, in the right to 
take part in cultural life, the right of members of minorities to enjoy their own 
culture, and the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination and to maintain, 
control, protect and develop cultural heritage. Other human rights must also be taken 
into consideration, in particular the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of belief 
and religion, the right to information and the right to education. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The right of access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage includes the right of 
individuals and communities to, inter alia, know, understand, enter, visit, make use of, 
maintain, exchange and develop cultural heritage, as well as to benefit from the 
cultural heritage and the creation of others. It also includes the right to participate in 
the identification, interpretation and development of cultural heritage, as well as to 
the design and implementation of preservation/safeguard policies and programmes. 
However, varying degrees of access and enjoyment may be recognized, taking into 
consideration the diverse interests of individuals and communities depending on their 
relationship to specific cultural heritages.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>80.<b> The independent expert makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) States should recognize and value the diversity of cultural heritages 
present in their territories and under their jurisdiction, and acknowledge, respect and 
protect the possible diverging interpretations that may arise over cultural heritage. 
The choices of individuals and communities to feel associated (or not) with specific 
elements of cultural heritages should be respected and protected; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) States should respect the free development of cultural heritage. They 
have the duty not to destroy, damage or alter cultural heritage, at least not without 
the free, prior and informed consent of concerned communities, and to take measures 
to preserve/safeguard cultural heritage from destruction or damage by third parties; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Concerned communities and relevant individuals should be consulted 
and invited to actively participate in the whole process of identification, selection, 
classification, interpretation, preservation/safeguard, stewardship and development of 
cultural heritage. No inscription on UNESCO lists relating to cultural heritage or 
national lists or registers should be requested or granted without the free, prior and 
informed consent of the concerned communities. More generally, States should seek 
the free, prior and informed consent of source communities before adopting measures 
concerning their specific cultural heritage, in particular in the case of indigenous 
peoples, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) States should ensure that cultural heritage policies and programmes are 
not implemented at the expense or to the detriment of concerned communities. The 
preservation/safeguarding of cultural heritage should aim at ensuring human 
development, the building of peaceful and democratic societies and the promotion of 
cultural diversity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) States are encouraged to develop cultural heritage mapping processes 
within their territory and should utilize cultural impact assessments in the planning 
and implementation of development projects, in full cooperation with concerned 
communities; </b></p>


<p><b> (f) States should take measures to encourage professionals working in the 
field of cultural heritage to adopt a human rights-based approach and to develop rules 
and guidelines in this respect; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Professionals working in the field of cultural heritage and cultural 
institutions (museums, libraries and archives in particular) should build stronger 
relationships with the communities and peoples whose cultural heritage they are the 
repositories of, respect their contributions regarding the significance, interpretation, 
sharing and display of such heritage, and consider in good faith their queries 
regarding repatriation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Researchers should likewise build stronger relationships with the 
communities and peoples whose cultural heritage they desire to investigate, especially 
when recording cultural heritage manifestations, to ensure their free, prior and 
informed consent at all stages of research and dissemination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Tourism and entertainment industries should respect the right of access 
to and enjoyment of cultural heritage. This implies, in particular, fully taking into 
consideration the complaints lodged by concerned individuals and communities who 
consider that their cultural heritage has been misused, misrepresented or 
misappropriated, or that their cultural heritage is being endangered by their 
activities;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) States should ensure access to the cultural heritage of one&#8217;s own 
communities, as well as that of others, while respecting customary practices governing 
access to cultural heritage. In particular, such access should be ensured through 
education and information, including by the use of modern information and 
communication technologies. States should also ensure to that end, that the content of 
programmes is established in full cooperation with the concerned communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) States should adopt positive measures to ensure access to and enjoyment 
of cultural heritage by all people regardless of gender, including people with scarce 
financial resources, and those with mental and physical disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) States should make available effective remedies, including judicial 
remedies, to concerned individuals and communities who feel that their cultural 
heritage is either not fully respected and protected or that their right of access to and 
enjoyment of cultural heritage is being infringed upon. In arbitration and litigation 
processes, the specific relationship of communities to cultural heritage should be fully 
taken into consideration; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) States are encouraged to ratify relevant international and regional 
treaties for the preservation/safeguarding of cultural heritage, and to implement them 
at the national level adopting a human rights-based approach;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) States should include in their periodic reports to treaty bodies, in 
particular the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, information on action 
taken to ensure the full participation of concerned individuals and communities in 
cultural heritage preservation/safeguard programmes, as well as on measures taken, 
particularly in the field of education and information, to ensure access to and 
enjoyment of cultural heritage. </b></p>
