<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that all 
</p>
<p>human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
</p>
<p>all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as 
</p>
<p>to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
</p>
<p>property, birth or other status,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the International Convention on the Protection of the 
</p>
<p>Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the protocols thereto, in particular 
</p>
<p>the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and the Protocol to 
</p>
<p>Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
</p>
<p>supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the protection of the human rights of all 
</p>
<p>migrants, and the work of the various special mechanisms of the Council that have reported 
</p>
<p>on the situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that 
</p>
<p>everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each 
</p>
<p>State and the right to leave any country, including his or her own, and to return to his or her 
</p>
<p>country,  
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that everyone is entitled to all human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms, without distinction of any kind, wherever the person is and regardless of his or 
</p>
<p>her immigration status,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that States are responsible for promoting and protecting the human 
</p>
<p>rights of all persons, including irregular migrants, who are in their territory and subject to 
</p>
<p>their jurisdiction,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the shared responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and 
</p>
<p>destination in promoting and protecting the human rights of all migrants, and avoiding 
</p>
<p>approaches that might aggravate their vulnerability,  
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, including women 
</p>
<p>and children, who have lost their lives or have been injured in attempting to cross 
</p>
<p>international borders, and recognizing the obligation of States to protect and respect the 
</p>
<p>human rights of those migrants, regardless of their immigration status,  
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including 
</p>
<p>those that refer to border control and the orderly management of migration, must be in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international human rights obligations in order to uphold the human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms of all migrants,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the recommended principles and guidelines on human rights at 
</p>
<p>international borders prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern</i> at measures that, including in the context of policies aimed at 
</p>
<p>reducing irregular migration, treat irregular migration as a criminal rather than an 
</p>
<p>administrative offence, where the effect of doing so is to deny migrants the full enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the important results of the second High-level Dialogue on International 
</p>
<p>Migration and Development, held on 3 and 4 October 2013,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Declaration of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration 
</p>
<p>and Development, adopted by the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session,<footnote name="1">General Assembly resolution 68/4. </footnote> which 
</p>
<p>acknowledges the important contribution of migration in realizing the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals and recognizes that human mobility is a key factor for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development, which should receive due consideration in the elaboration of the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the commitment to take action to avoid the loss of life of migrants, 
</p>
<p>including by preventing and combating the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons by disrupting the criminal networks involved and improving cooperation on 
</p>
<p>prevention, the prosecution of traffickers and smugglers, the protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking and the human rights of migrants who have been the object of 
</p>
<p>smuggling, and in protecting migrants from exploitation and other abuses,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the expertise in the field of migration of the International Organization for 
</p>
<p>Migration and the other member agencies of the Global Migration Group,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing serious concern</i> about the situation of vulnerability and risk faced by 
</p>
<p>migrants in transit, in particular unaccompanied children, including adolescents, or children 
</p>
<p>who have been separated from their families, who are forced to or decide to leave their 
</p>
<p>homelands owing to multiple causes,  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> the need to address the special situation and vulnerability of migrant 
</p>
<p>women and girls by, inter alia, incorporating a gender perspective into policies and 
</p>
<p>strengthening national laws, institutions and programmes to combat gender-based violence, 
</p>
<p>including trafficking in persons and discrimination against women and girls,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> the importance of coordinating international efforts to provide 
</p>
<p>assistance and support to migrants in vulnerable situations and, as appropriate, to facilitate 
</p>
<p>the voluntary return to their countries of origin or procedures for determining the need for 
</p>
<p>international protection while respecting the principle of non-refoulement, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the seventh Global Forum on Migration and Development, which 
</p>
<p>emphasized the importance of facilitating access to regular forms of migration and, where 
</p>
<p>applicable, to social services, including health goods, services and conditions, that 
</p>
<p>contribute to the prosperity of countries of origin, transit and destination and to the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of the empowerment and personal development prospects and outcomes for 
</p>
<p>migrants and their families,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the important role that migrants play as partners in the development 
</p>
<p>of origin, transit and destination countries, and recognizing the need to improve public 
</p>
<p>perceptions of migrants and migration,  
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of the fact that, in the fulfilment of their obligations to protect human rights, 
</p>
<p>States of origin, transit and destination can benefit from schemes of international 
</p>
<p>cooperation,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting with appreciation</i> the actions taken by several special procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and the treaty bodies for the effective prevention of violations of the 
</p>
<p>human rights of migrants, including through joint statements and urgent appeals, and 
</p>
<p>encouraging them to continue their collaborative efforts within their respective mandates to 
</p>
<p>this end,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving 
</p>
<p>societies and their communities of origin and the need to identify appropriate means of 
</p>
<p>maximizing development benefits and responding to the challenges that migration poses to 
</p>
<p>countries of origin, transit and destination, and committing to ensuring dignified, humane 
</p>
<p>treatment with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international 
</p>
<p>cooperation,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Recalls with appreciation</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human 
</p>
<p>rights of migrants,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/26/35. </footnote> invites States to give due consideration to the recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained therein, and welcomes his work; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying 
</p>

<p>Workers and Members of Their Families as a matter of priority, and requests the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General to continue his efforts to promote and raise awareness of the Convention;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also</i> <i>calls upon</i> States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or

</p>

</p>
<p>and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially

</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially those of women and children,
