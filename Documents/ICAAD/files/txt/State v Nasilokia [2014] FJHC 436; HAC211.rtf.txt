Sometimes between 1.30am to 3.50am, the accused entered the dwelling house of PW1 by removing the louver blades from the sitting room.

The only item recovered is the Acer Laptop valued $2,306.94.

4.      
After carefully considering your Plea to be unequivocal, this Court found you guilty for one count of burglary and two counts of theft and accordingly you are convicted under Section 312 (1) and Section 291 (1) of the Crimes Decree respectively.

 Section 312 (1) prescribes a maximum sentence of 13 years imprisonment for aggravated burglary.

7.      
Section 291 (1) prescribes maximum sentence of 10 years for the offence of Theft.

8.      
Considering the tariff for the offence of Burglary in Tabeusi v StateHAC 95-113/2010 and Mucunabitu v State HAC 17 of 2010, the Court accepted between 18 months to 3 years as tariff.

9.      
Tariff for the offence of theft was discussed in several cases. In Saukilagi v State [2005] FJHC 13 HAC 0021/2004 (27 January 2005)the Court accepted between 2 to 9 months as tariff for simple theft.

"The tariff for simple larceny on first conviction is 2-9 months (Ronald Vikash Singh v. State HAA 035 of 2002) and on second conviction a sentence in excess of 9 months. In cases of the larceny of large amounts of money sentences of 1 ½ years imprisonment (IsoaCodrokadroka v. State Crim. App. HAA 67 of 2002) and 3 years imprisonment have been upheld by the High Court (Sevanaia Via Koroi v. State Crim. App. HAA 031 of 2001S). Much depends on the value of the money stolen, and the nature of the relationship between victim and the defendant. The method of stealing is also relevant."

10.     
You have 6 previous convictions. 

11.     
Considering the nature of the offence and all other circumstances, I commence your sentence for the 1stcount at 24 months.

(a)     
You broke into a domestic house by removing 3 louver blades while the family members were fast asleep and value of items stolen is $ 2,521.94

13.     
I increase your sentence by 6 months for the above aggravating factor. Now your sentence is 30 months.

22.     
The suspended sentence is explained to the accused.
