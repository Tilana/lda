<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/104 
of 27 November 2006 on human rights and access to water. In its decision, the Human Rights 
Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) &#8220;&#8230; taking into account the views of States and other stakeholders, to conduct, within 
existing resources, a detailed study on the scope and content of the relevant human rights 
obligations related to equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation under international 
human rights instruments, which includes relevant conclusions and recommendations thereon, to 
be submitted prior to the sixth session of the Council&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2.  In conducting the study, OHCHR has sought written submissions from various 
stakeholders, including States, intergovernmental organizations, national human rights 
institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), experts, and representatives of the private 
sector.<b>1 </b>OHCHR also organized a one-day open consultation to discuss human rights and access 
to safe drinking water and sanitation and attended relevant expert and other meetings.<b>2</b> The 
inputs received during the consultation process have informed the preparation of the study.  
</p>
<p>3.  The report is divided into five chapters. Chapter I reviews the legal framework and existing 
obligations related to equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Chapters II, III 
and IV review the scope and content of the term &#8220;access to safe drinking water and sanitation&#8221;, 
the nature of States&#8217; obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation and the 
question of monitoring. Chapter V discusses issues needing further elaboration and Chapter VI 
sets out some conclusions and recommendations for consideration by the Council.

</p>
<p><b>I.  THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>4. The mandate entrusted to OHCHR by the Human Rights Council limits the sources of 
international law the study may address to international human rights instruments. These are 
understood as including international and regional treaties, as well as human rights-related 
declarations, resolutions, principles and guidelines. While these instruments do not have the 
same binding force as treaties, they may contain elements that already impose or may come to 
impose obligations on States under customary international law. They also highlight social 
expectations and commitments expressed by States and provide useful guidance for interpreting 
States&#8217; obligations under human rights treaties. International plans of action and documents 
adopted by United Nations treaty bodies will be used as sources of interpretations for these 
instruments. Other bodies of international law, such as international watercourse law, will not 
form part of the study. Although falling outside the sources outlined by Human Rights Council 
decision 2/104, the study will address the intersection between humanitarian and environmental 
treaties and human rights instruments and refer to these two other bodies of international law 
insofar as they help clarify the scope and content of human rights obligations in relation to 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation.<b>3</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Instruments referring to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>5. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation are referred to in a range of instruments which 
can be grouped as follows:  
</p>
<p> (a) Explicit reference in human rights treaties: explicit references to safe drinking water 
or sanitation are included in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the recently adopted 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Convention No. 161 of 1985 on Occupational Health Services. At the regional level, the 
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Protocol to the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa include specific provisions on 
access to water. Annex I provides further details on these treaties and the obligations they entail. 
</p>
<p> (b) Implicit reference in human rights treaties: the close connection between access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation and a range of other human rights is implicitly addressed in 
various treaties, notably in relation to the right to life, the prohibition of torture, the right to 
health, the right to education, the right to adequate housing, the right to food and the right to an 
adequate standard of living.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3  </b>For the relationship between human rights and humanitarian law, see Legal Consequences of 
the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, 
International Court of Justice, Reports 2004, p. 136, available at: http://www.icj-
cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf<b> </b>. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Explicit reference in human rights principles and guidelines: several principles and 
guidelines adopted by the United Nations and the ILO highlight the obligation to provide safe 
drinking water or sanitation to particular groups, including prisoners, juveniles deprived of their 
liberty, internally displaced persons (IDPs), workers living in housing provided by their 
employers and old persons. The FAO Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization 
of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security also highlight the fact that 
access to water in sufficient quantity and quality for all is essential for life and health. Annex II 
provides further details on these instruments and the obligations they entail. 
</p>
<p> (d) Safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right in declarations and resolutions: 
access to safe drinking water was first declared a human right by United Nations Member States 
in the Mar del Plata Action Plan (1977) asserting that irrespective of the level of development, 
all people &#8220;have the right to have access to drinking water in quantities and of a quality equal to 
their basic needs&#8221;.<b>4</b> Resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and the 
Commission on Human Rights also refer to safe drinking water as a human right.<b>5</b> Members of 
the Non-Aligned Movement, acknowledged the right to water for all in their 14th Summit final 
document.<b>6</b> At the regional level, recommendation 14 of the Committee of Ministers of the 
Council of Europe to member States on the European Charter on Water Resources provides that 
everyone has the right to a sufficient quantity of water for his or her basic needs.<b>7</b> This being 
said, the recognition of water as a human right in declarations and resolutions has been uneven.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p> (e) Expert documents referring to safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right: 
in 2002, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) adopted its general 
comment No. 15 on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant), defined as the right of 
everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal 
and domestic uses.<b>9</b> General comments provide an authoritative interpretation by an expert body 
on provisions under various international covenants and conventions, including the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). In 2006, the Sub-Commission for

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights adopted the draft guidelines for the realization of 
the right to drinking water supply and sanitation (the Sub-Commission&#8217;s guidelines), which refer 
to a right to drinking water and sanitation.<b>10</b> The Sub-Commission&#8217;s guidelines are intended to 
assist Governments, policymakers, international agencies and members of civil society to 
implement the right to drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p> (f) Plans of action referring to safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right: a 
number of plans of action have also referred to water and sanitation as a human right. 
Agenda 21, adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED) in 1992 states that &#8220;the commonly agreed premise was that &#8216;all peoples, whatever 
their stage of development and their social and economic conditions, have the right to have 
access to drinking water in quantities and of a quality equal to their basic needs&#8217;&#8221;.<b>11</b> In the 
Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (1994), 
States affirmed that all people have &#8220;the right to an adequate standard of living for themselves 
and their families, including adequate food, clothing, housing, water and sanitation&#8221;.<b>12</b> The 
UN-Habitat Plan of Action (1996) subsequently recognized water and sanitation as a human 
right.<b>13</b>  
</p>
<p> (g) Other recognition of safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right: the former 
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan emphasized that &#8220;access to safe water is a 
fundamental human need and, therefore, a basic human right&#8221;.<b>14</b> In its 2006 Human 
Development Report, Beyond scarcity: power, poverty and the global water crisis, the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) stressed the importance of recognizing and 
implementing the right to water.<b>15</b> The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) also stressed 
that &#8220;access to sanitation facilities is a fundamental human right that safeguards health and 
human dignity&#8221;.<b>16</b> The United Nations Millennium Project Task Force on Water and Sanitation

</p>
<p>highlighted the importance of the right to water for achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) related to water and sanitation.<b>17</b> National constitutions, legislation and 
jurisprudence have also recognized water as a human right. National experiences brought to the 
attention of OHCHR also revealed that many countries have adopted specific legislation 
regulating access to safe drinking water.  
</p>
<p>6.  While human rights treaties do not recognize access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
as a human right per se, specific obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation have been increasingly and explicitly recognized in core human rights treaties, mainly 
as part of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to health. With the exception of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families (ICRMW), all recently adopted human rights treaties entail specific 
obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and, to a lesser extent, sanitation. 
Obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation are also implicit in a 
number of human rights treaties and are derived from obligations pertaining to the promotion 
and protection of other human rights.  
</p>
<p>7. In interpreting the right to life under the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, (ICCPR), the Human Rights Committee (HRC) stressed that besides protecting against 
the active taking of life, the right also places a duty on States to ensure access to the means of 
survival and requires States to adopt positive measures, notably to reduce infant mortality, 
increase life expectancy and eliminate malnutrition and epidemics.<b>18</b> The Inter-American Court 
of Human Rights also interpreted the right to life as including access to conditions that guarantee 
a dignified life.<b>19</b> This interpretation finds a specific resonance with the impact that lack of 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation has on peoples&#8217; health and life. Diarrhoeal 
dehydration claims the lives of nearly 2 million children every year and has killed more children 
in the last 10 years than all the people lost to armed conflict since the Second World War.<b>20</b> Each 
and every day, some 3,900 children die because of dirty water, poor hygiene and lack of basic

<p>sanitation while 1.6 million deaths per year can be attributed to the same causes.<b>21</b> Lack of access 
to water and sanitation has also been addressed by the Human Rights Committee and the 
Committee against Torture.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The nexus between access to water and sanitation and the enjoyment of the right to an 
adequate standard of living has been stressed by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (CESCR) in its general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, in which it 
underlined that water constitutes a fundamental element for securing an adequate standard of 
living. The strong link with the right to health has also been highlighted by various 
United Nations treaty bodies, special procedures and regional mechanisms and is acknowledged 
in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The CESCR identified access to safe drinking 
water and sanitation as determinants of the right to health, giving rise to specific obligations to 
ensure an adequate supply of safe and potable water and adequate sanitation.  
</p>
<p>9. Access to safe drinking water also constitutes an important element for the enjoyment of 
the right to food. In extending the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the 
Commission on Human Rights specifically requested him to &#8220;pay attention to the issue of 
drinking water, taking into account the interdependence of this issue and the right to food&#8221;.<b>23</b> The 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food noted, in that respect, that clean drinking water is an 
essential part of healthy nutrition.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>10. In clarifying the scope and content of the right to adequate housing, CESCR underlined 
that access to safe drinking water and sanitation represents a fundamental element for the 
enjoyment of this right.<b>25</b> States&#8217; obligations under the right to education also entail specific

Africa, where access to safe drinking water is an element of the right to nutritious and adequate 
food.

Covenant), para. 8. </p>

</p>
<p>requirements to provide safe drinking water and sanitation facilities for both sexes in educational 
institutions.<b>26</b> The Special Rapporteur on the right to education followed a similar approach, 
highlighting the problem of schools lacking adequate sanitation facilities and water supply and 
the fact that this absence represents a genuine impediment to the right to education.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation can also create equality concerns, notably in 
relation to women, as limited access tends to disproportionately affect their health, physical and 
psychological integrity, privacy and access to education. The time burden of collecting and 
carrying water, which often falls on women and girls, is one explanation for the very large 
gender gaps in school attendance in many countries, while girls also commonly miss out 
disproportionately on an education if school sanitation facilities are inadequate. When girls and 
women have to walk to a place distant from their home for excreta disposal or water collection, 
they are also vulnerable to harassment and assault. Under the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), States parties have the obligation to 
address all forms of discrimination against women, including the elimination of the causes and 
consequences of their de facto or substantive inequality. 
</p>
<p>12.  A certain number of humanitarian and environmental treaties also entail specific provisions 
related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. The Geneva Conventions and their 
Additional Protocols outline the fundamental importance of access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation for health and survival in situations of international and non-international armed 
conflicts. Under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Protocol on 
Water and Health to the 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary 
Watercourses and International Lakes (UNECE Protocol), States parties have the obligation to 
take appropriate measures to provide access to drinking water and sanitation and to protect water 
resources used as sources of drinking water from pollution.<b>28</b>  
</p>
<p><b>II.  SCOPE AND CONTENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The meaning and scope of safe drinking water 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Sufficient quantity  
</b></p>
<p>13.  The mandate entrusted to OHCHR by the Human Rights Council limits the type of issues 
the study can consider to safe drinking water and sanitation. The term &#8220;safe drinking water&#8221; 
covers a limited amount of water needed - along with sanitation requirements - to provide for 
personal and domestic uses, which comprise water for drinking, washing clothes, food 
preparation and for personal and household hygiene. These personal and domestic uses represent 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  CESCR general comment No. 13 (1999) on the right to education (art. 13), para. 43. 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  See for instance E/CN.4/1999/49, para. 67. 
</p>

</b>  Articles 1, 4, para. 2 (a) and (b) and 6, para. 1 (a) and (b) available at: http://www.unece.org/

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a tiny fraction of the total use of water, usually less than 5 per cent.<b>29</b> Other domestic water uses, 
such as water for swimming pools or gardening are therefore not addressed in the study. Access 
to water for other purposes, notably for agriculture or industry, also falls outside the remit of the 
study.  
</p>
<p>14. Similarly, the study does not examine human rights obligations related to access to water 
for livelihood or as a natural resource, notably in relation to indigenous territories or small-scale 
farming, nor does it consider issues related to water management and the protection of 
ecosystems. UNDP&#8217;s 2006 Human Development Report made a comparable distinction between 
water for life in the household on the one hand and water to sustain ecological systems and for 
livelihoods on the other. Declarations and plans of action recognizing access to safe drinking 
water as a human right also highlight the right of individuals to access water in quantities equal 
to their basic needs.<b>30</b> Other documents, while not recognizing access to safe drinking water as a 
human right, present it as a basic need or requirement, highlighting the fact that the access of 
individuals to a sufficient quantity of water should be enhanced. 
</p>
<p>15. The direct corollary of this approach is that the term &#8220;safe drinking water&#8221; does not refer to 
an unlimited amount of water. While it is up to each country to determine the minimum 
reasonable amount of water needed to cover personal and domestic uses, the figures provided in 
World Health Organization (WHO) publications can provide useful guidance. Accordingly, 
between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day are needed to ensure that all health 
concerns are met.<b>31</b> The threshold of 25 litres per person per day represents the lowest level to 
maintain life, but this amount raises health concerns because it is insufficient to meet basic 
hygiene and consumption requirements.<b>32</b> In cases of emergencies - such as natural disasters, 
conflict or post-conflict situations - the Sphere Handbook suggests a basic provision of 7.5 to 
15 litres minimum per person and per day, as there may not be sufficient water available to cover 
all personal and domestic uses.<b>33</b> These different amounts are indicative, as they might change 
depending on a particular context, and might differ for some groups due to health status, work, 
climate conditions, cultural requirements or other factors.

</p>
<p><b>2.  Water quality 
</b></p>
<p>16. International declarations, resolutions and plans of action that include commitments to 
expand access to water also encompass specific quality requirements. Various instruments 
refer, alternatively, to clean water, drinking water, clean drinking water, safe drinking water, 
potable water, safe water, safe and clean water, or fresh water. According to CESCR 
general comment No.15, water for personal and domestic uses must be safe, therefore free from 
substances constituting a threat to a person&#8217;s health. Access to adequate sanitation constitutes 
one of the principal mechanisms for protecting the quality of drinking water.<b>34</b> The 
Sub-Commission&#8217;s guidelines also mention that water must be of a culturally acceptable quality. 
</p>
<p>17. The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (the WHO Guidelines) constitute an 
international reference point for drinking water quality regulation and standard setting. They 
define safe drinking water as water that does not represent any significant risk to health over a 
lifetime of consumption and that is free of microbial pathogens, chemical and radiological 
substances.<b>35</b> These requirements apply to all sources of water provision.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The meaning and scope of sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>18. Human rights instruments offer little guidance as to the scope and content of the term 
&#8220;sanitation&#8221;. The Sub-Commission&#8217;s guidelines refer to a right to sanitation, defined as the right 
of everyone to have access to adequate and safe sanitation that is conducive to the protection of 
public health and the environment.<b>37</b> Accordingly, sanitation and sanitation facilities should be 
physically accessible, affordable, of a sufficient and culturally acceptable quality and in a 
location where physical security can be ensured. 
</p>
<p>19. Overall, human rights instruments refer to various concepts to describe the kind of 
sanitation facilities people should have access to and do not elaborate upon the specific 
requirements these various concepts carry. As such, the contour of the human rights framework 
for sanitation remains imprecise. The Sub-Commission&#8217;s guidelines alternatively refer to 
adequate, basic, acceptable and appropriate sanitation of a culturally acceptable quality without 
clearly defining what these various requirements mean and encompass and what the differences 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>34
</b>  The absence of sanitation systems in many parts of the world has led to widespread 
</p>
<p>pollution and contamination of water sources that individuals rely upon for survival. 
<b>35
</b></p>
<p>  <i>Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality</i>, WHO, available at: http://www.who.int/water_ 
sanitation_health/dwq/guidelines/en/. 
<b>36
</b></p>
<p>  These include not only piped water sources, but also tanker sources, vendor-provided water 
and protected wells. 
<b>37
</b></p>
<p>  See E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/25, para 1.2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>between these terms are. CESCR general comment No. 15 refers to adequate sanitation and safe 
sanitation services, without defining these two terms and clarifying whether they carry different 
obligations.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The UNECE Protocol provides a definition of sanitation, described as the collection, 
transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human excreta or domestic waste water, whether by 
collective systems or by installations serving a single household or undertaking. It emphasizes 
that it should be of an adequate standard that is sufficient to protect human health and the 
environment.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Some guidance might be provided regarding the meaning of sanitation under international 
human rights instruments by virtue of applying existing standards and principles - such as the 
right to privacy and respect for human dignity and personal integrity- to sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The meaning and scope of access 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Equitable access 
</b></p>
<p>22. The consultation process carried out by OHCHR outlined several interpretations of the 
term &#8220;equitable&#8221; used in Human Rights Council&#8217;s decision 2/104 on human rights and 
access to water when referring to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. CESCR 
general comment No. 15 highlights the principle of equity that demands that poorer households 
should not be disproportionately burdened with water expenses as compared to richer 
households.<b>40</b> However, considerations of equity are often broader than the question of how to 
distribute water expenses. Equitable access considered within a human rights framework refers 
to equal and non-discriminatory access and it is on this basis that the term is understood and 
used. 
</p>
<p>23. The human rights framework prohibits discriminatory policies, laws or practices that affect 
individuals&#8217; access to safe drinking water and sanitation, including discrimination on the basis of 
housing or land status.<b>41</b> De jure and de facto discrimination should be addressed immediately in 
a way that takes into account the water and sanitation needs of disadvantaged and marginalized 
individuals.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>38
</b>  International declarations and plans of action refer alternatively to sanitary measures of 
</p>
<p>excreta disposal, effective management of waste, adequate, proper or basic sanitation. 
<b>39
</b></p>
<p>  See articles 2.8 and 6 (b). 
<b>40
</b></p>
<p>  Para. 27. 
</p>
<p><b>41
</b>  See CESCR general comment No. 15, para. 16; Human Rights Committee, general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 18 (1989) on non-discrimination; Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, general recommendation XX (1996) on article 5 of the Convention. 
<b>42
</b></p>
<p>  See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 18 (1989) on non-discrimination, 
para. 10. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. The principles of equality and non-discrimination require that no population group is 
excluded and that priority in allocating limited public resources is given to those who do not 
have access or who face discrimination in accessing safe drinking water and sanitation.<b>43</b> In the 
case of indigenous peoples, guaranteeing their access to safe drinking water might require action 
to secure their customary arrangements for managing water and the protection of their natural 
water resources, as provided for under ILO Convention No. 169 of 1989 on Indigenous and 
Tribal Peoples.<b>44</b> Priority should also be given to institutions serving vulnerable groups such as 
schools, hospitals, and refugee camps. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Physical access 
</b></p>
<p>25. A human rights approach to safe drinking water and sanitation underlines the importance 
of securing safe physical access to water and sanitation facilities. Access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation should be provided within or in close proximity to the home in a way that provides 
regular water and prevents excessive collection time.<b>45</b> Accordingly, human rights obligations 
related to safe drinking water and sanitation do not require States to provide access in every 
house. However, water and sanitation facilities have to be in close proximity to each house, 
educational institution and workplace and must be within safe reach for all sectors of the 
population, taking into account the needs of particular groups, including persons with 
disabilities, children, the elderly and women. Securing access to safe drinking water in rural 
areas might require safeguarding access by domestic users to traditional water sources and 
protecting these sources from unsustainable extraction by industry or agriculture. CESCR 
general comment No. 15 and the Sub-Commission&#8217;s guidelines also stress that the physical 
security of individuals should not be threatened while accessing water and sanitation facilities 
and services.<b>46</b> This requirement is implicit in several human rights treaties protecting respect for 
privacy, human dignity and the integrity of the person, as well as protecting against violence 
against women and girls. 
</p>
<p>26. Figures provided in WHO publications give useful guidance as to what is meant by the 
requirement of a reasonable distance and highlight the correlation between physical access and 
the requirement of a sufficient quantity of safe drinking water to fulfil personal and domestic 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>43
</b>  The poor and marginalized - notably women, children, minority groups, indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced persons (IDPs), migrant workers, prisoners, 
detainees, informal settlers and those living in rural and deprived areas - usually bear the brunt of 
a lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
<b>44
</b></p>
<p>  This link between access to safe drinking water by indigenous peoples and protection of their 
natural water resources has been highlighted in contributions received by indigenous groups as 
part of the consultation process OHCHR carried out in relation to the study. 
<b>45
</b></p>
<p>  See E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/25, para. 12 (c) (i) and 37 (c).

<p>  See E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/25, para. 37. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>uses. Accordingly, a water source with capacity to provide sufficient, safe and regular water 
should normally be within less than 1,000 metres of the household and collection time should not 
exceed 30 minutes in order for around 20 litres a day of water to be collected.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Economic access - affordability 
</b></p>
<p>27. Considering safe drinking water and sanitation from a human rights perspective highlights 
the importance of economic access or affordability. The Plan of Implementation of the World 
Summit on Sustainable Development (2002) underlines that cost-recovery objectives should not 
become a barrier to access to safe drinking water by poor people.<b>48</b> Agenda 21 underlines that 
beyond the provision of safe drinking water for the satisfaction of basic needs, water users 
should be charged appropriately.<b>49</b> Recommendation 14 (2001) of the Committee of Ministers of 
the Council of Europe to member states on the European Charter on Water Resources states that 
&#8220;without prejudice to the right to water to meet basic needs, the supply of water shall be subject 
to payment in order to cover financial costs associated with the production and utilisation of 
water resources&#8221;.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>28. Affordability requires that direct and indirect costs related to water and sanitation should 
not prevent a person from accessing safe drinking water and should not compromise his or her 
ability to enjoy other rights, such as the right to food, housing, health and education. These costs 
include both connection and delivery costs. The human rights framework does not imply, 
therefore, a right to free water and sanitation but highlights the fact that nobody should be 
deprived of access because of an inability to pay. It therefore contemplates the possibility that 
safe drinking water and sanitation should be provided for free in certain circumstances but does 
not set this as a rule. Consequently, the affordability requirement is not incompatible with the 
principle of cost recovery for water and sanitation services, which is also recognized in several 
international declarations. However, it defines limits to cost recovery and highlights the fact that 
it should not become a barrier to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, notably by the 
poor.<b>51</b>

Water Supply and Sanitation also highlighted the fact that research in rural areas found that 
individuals satisfy their basic needs for water if the source can be reached in a round trip 
of 30 minutes or less.

</p>
<p>29. CESCR general comment No. 15 stresses that the most critical target is to ensure the 
affordability of the minimum amount of water sufficient for essential personal and domestic uses 
to prevent disease.<b>52</b> Governments have a wide margin of discretion in choosing the most 
appropriate means to make water affordable. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  NATURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Duty bearers 
</b></p>
<p>30. International human rights law places obligations on States to promote and protect human 
rights. While States carry legal obligations in relation to human rights, either as a result of 
ratifying human rights treaties or under customary international law, other actors such as 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, intergovernmental organizations and 
individuals also have a role in respecting and promoting human rights. 
</p>
<p>31. The consultation process raised the question of the responsibilities of transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises in relation to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation. It identified the increasing societal expectation that companies ensure that their 
operations do not compromise access to safe drinking water and sanitation. The nature and scope 
of the responsibilities of business enterprises under international human rights law is currently 
being explored by the Human Rights Council through the mandate of the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises.<b>53</b> Through the United Nations Global Compact and other voluntary 
initiatives, a number of companies have also committed to respect and ensure respect for human 
rights in the conduct of their operations. Submissions received by the private sector during the 
consultation process also highlight the fact that various private water providers support 
recognition of access to safe drinking water as a human right. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Obligations 
</b></p>
<p>32. Human rights obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation can be 
derived from various treaties, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR) (the right to life and the prohibition of torture) and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) (the right to an adequate standard of living, the 
right to adequate housing, the right to food and the right to health). 
</p>
<p>33. The ICCPR requires States parties to respect and ensure civil and political rights and to 
prohibit discrimination in law or in fact in any field regulated and protected by public 
authorities.<b>54</b> Under the ICESCR, States parties have the obligation to ensure that economic, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>52
</b>  Paras. 12, 27 and 37 (a). 
</p>
<p><b>53
</b>  See for instance A/HRC/4/35. 
</p>
<p><b>54
</b>  Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 18 (1989) on non-discrimination. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights are enjoyed without discrimination and to take steps, progressively and 
to the maximum of their available resources, to realize these. The term &#8220;maximum of available 
resources&#8221; refers to both financial and other resources existing within a State and those available 
through international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>34. Obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation derived from the 
ICCPR are of an immediate nature, even when there are resource implications. Under the 
ICESCR, the obligations are of both an immediate and progressive nature. While universal 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation can be achieved over time within the limits of 
available resources, the obligations of non-discrimination and &#8220;to take steps&#8221; have immediate 
effect. Accordingly, States have to take immediate, deliberate, concrete and targeted steps to 
move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards ensuring access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation, making the most efficient use of available resources. 
</p>
<p>35. The nature of States parties&#8217; obligations under the ICESCR gives rise to three types of 
obligations, namely the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The obligation to respect 
</b></p>
<p>36. The obligation to respect requires that Governments refrain from interfering with access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation. It includes, for instance, the obligation to avoid engaging in 
any practice or activity that denies or limits access to safe drinking water and sanitation, or that 
pollutes water. States must also guarantee that individuals have access to effective judicial or 
other appropriate remedies providing adequate reparation, including restitution, compensation, 
satisfaction or guarantee of non-repetition. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The obligation to protect 
</b></p>
<p>37. International law firmly establishes that States have a duty to protect against non-State 
human rights abuses within their jurisdiction.<b>55</b> This duty requires steps by States to regulate and 
adjudicate abuses by all social actors. The obligation to protect requires that Governments ensure 
that third parties, including individuals, groups, corporations and other entities under their 
jurisdiction do not interfere with access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This obligation 
includes, for instance, the adoption of necessary and effective legislative and other measures to 
prevent third parties from denying access to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>38. When water or sanitation services are operated by the private sector, States should ensure 
that such private provision does not compromise equal, affordable and physically accessible 
water and sanitation of a good quality. States must therefore regulate and control private water 
and sanitation providers through an effective regulatory system which includes independent 
monitoring, participation, and imposition of penalties in case of non-compliance. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>55
</b>  Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights 
</p>
<p>and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, 2007 (A/HRC/4/35). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>39. When water services and facilities are operated by local authorities, States retain the 
obligation to ensure that these have at their disposal sufficient resources, authority and capacity 
to maintain and extend the necessary water and sanitation services. States should also ensure that 
local authorities do guarantee equal access to affordable and physically accessible water and 
sanitation of a good quality. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The obligation to fulfil 
</b></p>
<p>40. The obligation to fulfil requires States to adopt the necessary measures - legislative, 
administrative, policies, programmes and others - to facilitate and promote universal access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation. A number of States have, in this respect, recognized safe 
drinking water as a human right in their national laws.<b>56</b> Many countries have also adopted 
specific legislation regulating particular aspects of water and sanitation - notably the quality of 
water, water services pricing policies and subsidies, prioritization among various uses, minimum 
amounts needed for domestic consumption, or disconnections - although these are often not 
formulated in human rights terms.<b>57</b> 
</p>
<p>41. The obligation to fulfil can be disaggregated into the obligations to facilitate, promote and 
provide. The obligation to facilitate requires States to take positive measures to assist individuals 
to access safe drinking water and sanitation. The obligation to promote obliges the State to take 
steps to ensure that there is appropriate education about hygiene, notably concerning hygienic 
use of water and the protection of water. The obligation to provide demands that States ensure 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation for individuals when they are unable, for reasons 
beyond their control, to do so themselves and through the means at their disposal. Overall, public 
resources should prioritize those without basic access to safe drinking water and sanitation, 
rather than those who already have some sort of access. 
</p>
<p>42. As part of the obligation to fulfil, the CESCR has highlighted certain procedural 
obligations, such as the obligations to ensure access to information concerning safe drinking 
water and sanitation issues, and participation in decision-making processes related to safe 
drinking water and sanitation.<b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>56
</b>  This recognition has been emphasized in various submissions to the consultation process for 
</p>
<p>the study. 
<b>57
</b></p>
<p>  This has been highlighted in various submissions to the consultation process for the study. 
<b>58
</b></p>
<p>  These procedural obligations are recognized in several human rights treaties and declarations 
(Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 1992, principle 10), as well as in 
environmental treaties specifically addressing water and sanitation issues. See for instance 
ICCPR, article 25; CEDAW, article 7; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
article 29. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  MONITORING 
</b></p>
<p>43. Relevant mechanisms for the monitoring of human rights obligations in relation to access 
to safe drinking water and sanitation include the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) United Nations treaty bodies: several treaty bodies, including CESCR, the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
have addressed access to safe drinking water and sanitation in their review of States parties&#8217; 
reports and have formulated specific recommendations thereon. Their concluding observations 
shed light on some key concerns, e.g. on issues related to lack of water in slum areas, lower 
standards for minorities, restrictions regarding access, the situation of IDPs, water pollution, 
environmental problems and their impact on access to water, imbalances in water supply 
between urban and rural areas, the failure of States to ensure the supply of safe drinking water to 
vulnerable groups such as children, restrictions on access to water for persons living under 
foreign occupation, and cases where large segments of the population are left without safe 
drinking water;<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p> (b) Special procedures of the Human Rights Council: several special procedures have 
looked at the relevance to their mandates of the issue of access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation. In particular, the Special Rapporteurs on the right to food and to the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living have dedicated attention to the issue 
during their country visits and in individual communications and annual reports. The Special 
Rapporteur on the right to health has considered safe drinking water and sanitation as 
determinants of the right to health, while the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living has analysed these issues within the 
context of accessibility to services.<b>60</b> In 2001, the Commission on Human Rights asked the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food to pay attention in his reports to the issue of drinking 
water and its interdependence with the right to food;<b>61</b>

</p>
<p> (c) Regional mechanisms: judicial or quasi-judicial human rights mechanisms at the 
regional level have also addressed and developed specific jurisprudence on issues related to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, notably in relation to the pollution of water and access to safe 
drinking water for detainees.<b>62</b> The European Committee on Social Rights has also addressed 
issues related to access to safe drinking water in relation to article 16 of the European Social 
Charter which provides for the right of the family to social, legal and economic protection;<b>63</b> 
</p>
<p> (d) National courts: a number of courts have adjudicated certain aspects of human rights 
obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water - notably in relation to the pollution of 
water resources and disconnections - or have derived a right to access safe drinking water from 
the enjoyment of other human rights, such as the right to life or the right to a healthy 
environment;<b>64</b> 
</p>
<p> (e) National human rights institutions (NHRIs): a number of national human rights 
institutions have a specific mandate for economic, social and cultural rights.<b>65</b> Submissions 
received from NHRIs highlight the fact that some of them already work on issues pertaining to 
safe drinking water and sanitation and monitor related States&#8217; obligations;<b>66</b>

</p>
<p><b>V.  ISSUES REQUIRING FURTHER ELABORATION 
</b>44. This section highlights a number of issues that arose throughout the consultation process 
regarding the nature of human rights obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation that might require further elaboration. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right 
</b></p>
<p>45. As noted in chapter I, human rights treaties entail explicit and implicit obligations in 
relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Obligations are also found in other 
human rights instruments, as well as under humanitarian and environmental law treaties. While 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation is not explicitly recognized as a human right per se 
in human rights treaties, it has been acknowledged by two expert bodies (CESCR and the 
Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights), as well as by States in 
several resolutions, declarations and plans of action. 
</p>
<p>46. However, the debate is still open as to whether access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
is a human right, notably in relation to the following points: (a) whether access to safe drinking 
water is a right on its own or whether obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation are derived from other human rights, such as the right to life, the right to health, the 
right to food or the right to an adequate standard of living; (b) the normative content of human 
rights obligations in relation to access to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>47. In the High Commissioner&#8217;s view, international human rights law entails clear 
obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water. These obligations demand that States 
ensure everyone&#8217;s access to a sufficient amount of safe drinking water for personal and domestic 
uses - defined as water for drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, food preparation 
and personal and household hygiene - to sustain life and health. It is up to each country to 
determine what this sufficient amount is, relying on guidance provided by WHO and others. 
This access should be prioritized over other water uses and should be premised on equality and 
non-discrimination. States should take steps to ensure that this sufficient amount is of good 
quality, affordable for all and can be collected within a reasonable distance from a person&#8217;s 
home. The primary target should be to ensure everyone&#8217;s access to a minimum amount of water 
to prevent disease. 
</p>
<p>48. While the human rights framework does not dictate a particular form of service delivery or 
pricing policy, it requires States to adopt adequate measures and to put in place effective 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>67
</b>  The Australian Utilities Act provides for instance for a Consumer Council that protects users&#8217; 
</p>
<p>rights. Finland&#8217;s Water Services Act establishes a consumer Ombudsman to ensure compliance 
with the law. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>regulations to ensure the access of individuals to sufficient, affordable and physically accessible 
and safe drinking water and sanitation. Effective judicial or other appropriate remedies should be 
available to individuals who have been denied this access. 
</p>
<p>49. Given the clarity of these obligations, the open debate as to whether the human right to 
access safe drinking water is a stand-alone right or is derived from other human rights should not 
impair the recognition of access to safe drinking water as a human right. As noted in chapter II, 
the normative content of human rights obligations in relation to access to sanitation would need 
further elaboration.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  National strategy on water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>50. CESCR general comment No. 15 identifies the adoption of a national strategy on safe 
drinking water as a priority and as a key element to ensure and monitor access to safe drinking 
water, and sets a certain number of parameters this strategy should entail.<b>68</b> UNDP&#8217;s 2006 
Human Development Report also stresses that each country should have a national water and 
sanitation strategy and offers further guidance as to the specific elements this strategy should 
encompass. It suggests that every national strategy should include clear goals backed by 
adequate financing, minimum provision levels and policies to reach the strategy&#8217;s goals, as well 
as pro-poor regulations. 
</p>
<p>51. Further elaboration may be desirable to clarify whether the development of a national 
human rights strategy forms part of States&#8217; obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation and if so, the specific issues it should address. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Private provision of water and sanitation services 
</b></p>
<p>52. A number of submissions to the consultation process for the study have highlighted the 
potential impact that the private provision of water and sanitation services can have on access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation. Some submissions suggested that human rights obligations in 
relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation should prevent the private provision of 
these basic services. The approach of United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures has 
been to stress that the human rights framework does not dictate a particular form of service 
delivery and leaves it to States to determine the best ways to implement their human rights 
obligations.<b>69</b> While remaining neutral as to the way in which water and sanitation services are 
provided, and therefore not prohibiting the private provision of water and sanitation services, 
human rights obligations nonetheless require States to regulate and monitor private water and 
sanitation providers. 
</p>
<p>53. An implicit dimension of this duty to regulate is that privatization of water and sanitation 
services should not take place in the absence of a clear and efficient regulatory framework that 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>68
</b>  Para. 47. 
</p>
<p><b>69
</b>  See for instance, CESCR general comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of States parties&#8217; 
</p>
<p>obligations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>can maintain sustainable access to safe, sufficient, physically accessible and affordable water and 
sanitation. The role of individuals in decision-making on who supplies water and sanitation 
services, the type of services supplied and how these should be managed raises questions 
concerning the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs and other rights, and is an 
important element to take into account when making decisions on private sector delivery. Further 
elaboration is needed regarding the human rights response and requirements concerning the 
private provision of water and sanitation services and the type of regulatory system that States 
must put in place in that respect. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Obligations of local authorities 
</b></p>
<p>54. Local authorities are often responsible for the supply of safe drinking water and sanitation. 
Where safe drinking water and sanitation are provided at the local level, the WHO Guidelines 
outline a certain number of responsibilities of local governments to secure water quality, notably 
in relation to catchment inspection and consumer education.<b>70</b> Local governments represented at 
the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico also recognized that all human beings have the right 
to water in the quantity and quality required to meet their essential needs, as well as to 
sanitation.<b>71</b> 
</p>
<p>55. Further clarification is needed regarding the role, responsibilities and specific obligations 
of local authorities responsible for the provision of water and sanitation services. At the same 
time, as the State remains accountable under international law, its specific responsibilities 
vis-&#224;-vis local authorities should also be further elaborated upon in the context of human rights 
obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The question of disconnections and due process 
</b></p>
<p>56. Considering access to safe drinking water and sanitation from a human rights perspective 
and its close nexus with the right to life, health, an adequate standard of living and the protection 
of human dignity, implies a need for procedural safeguards in case of water and sanitation 
disconnections.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Procedures for the disconnection of water and sanitation services must comprise: (a) timely 
and full disclosure of information on the proposed measures; (b) reasonable notice of the 
proposed action; (c) legal recourse and remedies for those affected; (d) legal assistance for 
</p>

<b>72
</b></p>
<p>  This section refers to disconnections defined as the interruption of delivery due to 
non-payment. It does not refer to disconnections due to the pollution of water sources or 
emergencies. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>obtaining legal remedies. Disconnections for non-payment should not result in a person being 
denied access to a minimum amount of safe drinking water where that person proves that he or 
she is unable to pay for these basic services. 
</p>
<p>58. Recommendation 14 (2001) of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to 
member States on the European Charter on Water Resources provides that social measures 
should be put in place to prevent the supply of water to destitute persons from being cut off.<b>73</b> 
A number of national laws restrict disconnections of water services, in particular those that occur 
due to the user&#8217;s inability, rather than unwillingness to pay.<b>74</b> Courts have also reversed water 
supply disconnection orders on the grounds that these were endangering people&#8217;s health and 
life.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>59. While human rights obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
do not prohibit disconnections, they require that States respect commonly agreed principles of 
due process, take into account a person&#8217;s capacity to pay, and do not deprive an individual who 
is unable to pay of the minimum essential level of water and basic sanitation. Accordingly, the 
quantity of safe drinking water a person can access may be reduced, but full disconnection may 
only be permissible if there is access to an alternative source which can provide a minimum 
amount of safe drinking water needed to prevent disease. In this respect, there is a strong 
presumption that disconnections of institutions serving vulnerable groups, such as schools, 
hospitals and refugee camps are prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Prioritization between various kinds of water use 
</b></p>
<p>60. Considering access to safe drinking water from a human rights perspective highlights the 
need to give precedence in water distribution to water for personal and domestic uses for all. 
Various submissions to the consultation process for the study have highlighted the fact that 
national laws, regulations or policies do give priority to water for human consumption over other 
water uses. 
</p>
<p>61. The Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002) 
calls for water to be allocated among competing uses in a way that gives priority to the 
satisfaction of basic human needs.<b>76</b> This prioritization of human consumption over other water 
uses bears certain implications in terms of water management and might require specific systems 
to manage competing demands and to ensure that access to water for personal and domestic uses 
is prioritized. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>73
</b>  Recommendation Rec(2001) 14, available at http://www.coe.int/t/cm/ 
</p>
<p>adoptedTexts_en.asp#P47_2021. 
<b>74
</b></p>
<p>  See the 1999 UK Water Industry Act and the South Africa Water Services Act (1997) for 
instances where disconnection of water services may or may not be permitted.<b> 
75
</b></p>
<p>  See examples cited in footnote 64 above.<b> 
76
</b></p>
<p>  Para. 26 (c). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. Beyond the clear basic principle that safe drinking water for personal and domestic uses 
should be given precedence over other water uses, questions remain regarding the prioritization 
between various kinds of water use, particularly in situations of water scarcity. Once a sufficient 
amount of safe drinking water to prevent disease has been secured for all, allocation of water 
among various uses - water for personal and domestic uses beyond this sufficient amount, water 
to produce food, water to sustain livelihoods, or water to ensure environmental hygiene - remains 
unclear. CESCR general comment No. 15 notes that priority in the allocation of water should 
also be given to water resources to prevent starvation and disease and that attention should be 
given to ensuring that disadvantaged and marginalized farmers have equitable access to water 
and water management systems. The Human Rights Council may wish to clarify obligations in 
this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Human rights obligations in the context of trade and investment agreements 
</b></p>
<p>63. Submissions received during the consultation process highlighted some concerns regarding 
the relationship between the obligations of States under bilateral investment treaties and their 
human rights obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Some of the 
current proceedings before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes 
(ICSID) opposing private water companies to States, draw attention to the potential impact that 
obligations arising from bilateral investment treaties can have on the duty of States to regulate 
companies in the context of private provision of water or sanitation services. It remains unclear 
whether and how the obligations of Governments under international human rights instruments 
will be taken into account in ICSID judgements.<b>77</b> 
64. While the High Commissioner has already explored aspects of this issue - including in 
relation to access to safe drinking water - and concluded, inter alia, that the duty of Governments 
should be guaranteed, this research would benefit from further analysis.<b>78</b> 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Access to safe drinking water and sanitation is an issue of great importance to the 
international community. The considerable number of submissions received from 
Governments, intergovernmental organizations, national human rights institutions and 
civil society are evidence not only of the interest in this issue, but also of the growing 
recognition that access to safe drinking water and sanitation must be addressed within a

<p><b>human rights framework. The increasing references to safe drinking water in human rights 
instruments as a component of other human rights similarly highlights the growing 
importance of this issue to the international community, as does the inclusion of access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation amongst the Millennium Development Goals. 
Importantly, an increasing number of States are recognizing safe drinking water as a 
human right in their constitutions, as well as national legislation, while national courts are 
enforcing it as a justiciable right.</b> 
66. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights believes that it is now 
time to consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right, defined as 
the right to equal and non-discriminatory access to a sufficient amount of safe drinking 
water for personal and domestic uses - drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, 
food preparation and personal and household hygiene - to sustain life and health. States 
should prioritize these personal and domestic uses over other water uses and should take 
steps to ensure that this sufficient amount is of good quality, affordable for all and can be 
collected within a reasonable distance from a person&#8217;s home.</b> 
</p>
<p>67. <b>The High Commissioner notes that there is a need for further elaboration of certain 
aspects of human rights obligations attached to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation. Existing human rights instruments have provided the basis for expert human 
rights bodies to elaborate on States&#8217; obligations, but the study has highlighted the fact that 
detailed practical advice is required on the following issues: the normative content of 
human rights obligations in relation to access to sanitation; the human rights obligations 
attached to the elaboration of a national strategy on water and sanitation; the regulation of 
the private sector in the context of private provision of safe drinking water and sanitation; 
criteria to protect the right to safe drinking water and sanitation in case of disconnection; 
and the specific obligations of local authorities.</b> 
</p>
<p>68. <b>Debate is still needed on a number of questions, including the following: whether 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation is a self-standing right or is derived from other 
human rights; prioritization among various water uses; interaction with other areas of 
international law, including trade and investment law.</b> 
</p>
<p>69. <b>Although various mechanisms at the international, regional and national level 
monitor certain aspects and dimensions of human rights obligations in relation to access 
to safe drinking water and sanitation, this issue is currently being neglected. While 
United Nations special procedures and treaty bodies have contributed to clarifying human 
rights obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, their work also 
highlights the difficult task of covering these issues in a comprehensive and continuous 
way. Specific, dedicated and sustained attention to safe drinking water and sanitation is 
currently lacking at the international level, given the broad range of issues that special 
procedures and treaty bodies have to address within their mandate and the specific 
questions that arise in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation.</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>70. <b>To this end, the High Commissioner: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Encourages the Human Rights Council to continue its consideration of human 
rights obligations in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation as set out 
above; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Encourages States, intergovernmental organizations, national human rights 
institutions, civil society and business enterprises to identify good practices in the field of 
safe drinking water, sanitation and human rights and make them available to the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</b> </p>
