<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
</p>
<p>attainable standard of physical and mental health visited Tajikistan from 24 to 31 May 
2012. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur considered, in a spirit of dialogue and 
cooperation, how the country had endeavoured to implement the right to health and, in 
particular, considered issues relating to the health system and the financing, prevention and 
treatment of tuberculosis and mental health.  
</p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur commends Tajikistan for the significant 
advances made in reducing poverty, increasing spending on health and addressing maternal 
mortality, as well as for its clear commitment to the realization of the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. In order for the 
State to realize fully the right to health, however, the Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to address a number of serious challenges and consider particular areas for 
improvements in the health system and financing, tuberculosis prevention, treatment and 
control, as well as in mental health care and services. With a view to facilitating that 
endeavour, the Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations.

<p> United Nations A/HRC/23/41/Add.<footnote name="2">0. The prevalence of informal payments in Tajikistan is due in large part to the small 
salaries paid to doctors and other health-care professionals. The Special Rapporteur learned 
during his visit that the average monthly salary for doctors is approximately $85 and $50 
for nurses. Small salaries also contribute to the poor quality of health services, often 
resulting in medical negligence, which is a critical concern throughout Tajikistan and 
contributes to a lack of public trust in the health system and the medical profession in 
general. Many health-care workers are poorly trained, and qualified professionals often 
choose to work abroad, attracted by higher wages and better working conditions, which 
contributes to a high turnover rates throughout the medical profession. According to data 
received during meetings with Government officials, the Government has increased salaries 
for doctors and other health-care professionals by 530 per cent since 2007. This is, 
however, insufficient, given that salaries were initially extremely small; in 2007, monthly 
salaries for health-care workers were as low as $12. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to increase substantially salaries for doctors and other health-care workers in </footnote>

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur paid an official visit to Tajikistan, at the invitation of the 
Government, from 24 to 31 May 2012. The purpose of the visit was to consider, in a spirit 
of dialogue and cooperation, how the country had endeavoured to implement the right to 
health and the measures taken for the successful realization of that right. 
</p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur paid special attention to the health 
system and health financing; tuberculosis and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and mental 
health. The Special Rapporteur visited Dushanbe, Khujand, Kulob, Rudaki and Vahdat. 
3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with senior Government officials from the 
Office of the President, parliamentary committees and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
Health, Labour and Social Protection, Finance, and Justice; the State Pharmaceutical 
Certification Agency; and the Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights. He also held 
meetings with representatives of civil society, international organizations, development 
partners, academics, legal experts and health professionals. The Special Rapporteur is 
grateful to the Government of Tajikistan for its invitation and full cooperation during his 
visit. He also thanks all those who met with him, gave their time and cooperated with him 
during the visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background  
</b></p>
<p>4. Soon after gaining independence in 1991, Tajikistan was engulfed in a civil war that 
lasted five years. During that time, Tajikistan endured a serious upheaval in its economy, 
which resulted in widespread poverty. The health of the population declined dramatically 
during the conflict, as witnessed by the increasing incidence of communicable and non-
communicable diseases, poor quality health services, underfunded and deteriorating health 
infrastructure, a lack of health workers, and restricted access to health facilities, goods and 
services, especially for the poor.1 
</p>
<p>5. Since the cessation of the armed conflict, the Government of Tajikistan has made 
admirable progress in reducing poverty and rebuilding the country&#8217;s health system. The rate 
of relative poverty declined from 83.4 per cent in 1999 to 51 per cent in 2009,2 while 
extreme poverty decreased from 42 per cent in 2003 to 17 per cent in 2009.3 The 
Government has also shown a laudable commitment to health since the conflict, as 
demonstrated by an increase in spending on health, which doubled as a percentage of gross 
domestic product (GDP) from 0.<footnote name="9">5
  A/HRC/11/6/Add.2, para. 71. </footnote> per cent in 2001 to about 2 per cent in 2012. More 
recently, budget allocations to health increased by more than four times, from $37.3 million 
in 2007 to $152.3 million in 2012. In addition, Tajikistan has achieved the Millennium 
Development Goal on improving maternal health. The maternal mortality rate decreased

<p>from 97 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2003 to 46.2 in 2009.4 The Special Rapporteur 
commends the Government for these significant advances in reducing poverty, increasing 
spending on health and addressing maternal mortality. The Government should continue its 
efforts to reduce poverty and address health concerns. 
</p>
<p>6. A lack of adequate primary health care, however, has had a negative impact on all 
aspects of health, in particular on maternal and infant health. The situation is especially 
severe in rural and mountainous areas, where many people continue to lack access to basic 
health-care services, particularly during the winter months. This is a major concern, as up to 
75 per cent of the population of Tajikistan live in rural and remote areas.5 According to data 
compiled by the statistical agency of the office of the President received from the 
Government, infant mortality rates (34 deaths per 1,000 live births) and mortality rates for 
children under 5 years (43 deaths per 1,000 live births) are several times the average of the 
European and Central Asian region (12 and 13 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively).<footnote name="6">1 WHO, WHO-AIMS Report (see footnote 56), p. 5. 
 
</footnote> 
Children&#8217;s health also presents a great concern in Tajikistan, especially the high rates of 
malnutrition in children: 29.1 per cent are stunted and 12.5 per cent are wasted.<footnote name="7">6
 WHO/Europe, Tajikistan: Mental Health (see footnote 71). </footnote> During his 
visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that the Government only funded 30 per cent of the 
national immunization programme and relied on donor funding for the remainder. The State 
should continue to make improvements in these areas in order to realize the right to health 
for all people of Tajikistan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International and national legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. Tajikistan is a party to a number of international treaties that recognize the right to 
health, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the first Optional Protocol 
thereto, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the first two Optional 
Protocols thereto, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. In accordance with article 10 of 
the Constitution adopted in 1994, international legal instruments that are recognized by 
Tajikistan become a constituent part of its national legal system.  
8. The Constitution of Tajikistan contains a number of provisions relating to the right 
to health. Article 38 establishes the right to health care for all and to the protection of the 
environment for the promotion of health. Article 18 protects the right to life, including the 
right to be not subject to forced medical or scientific experiments, while article 17 ensures 
equality before the law and the courts. Legislation relating to the realization of the right to 
health in Tajikistan includes the Reproductive Health Act (2002), the Psychiatric Care Act 
(2002), the Emergency Services Act (2005), the Act on Child Nutrition (2005), the Act on 
the Fight against HIV/AIDS (2005), the Act on Protection from Tuberculosis (2006), the 
Act on Organ Transplants (2007), the Health Insurance Law (2008), the Law on Blood

<p><b> III. Health system and financing  
</b></p>
<p>9. An effective and integrated health system, encompassing health care and the 
underlying determinants of health, that is responsive to national and local priorities and 
accessible to all is fundamental to the realization of the right to health.8 The full realization 
of the right to health also depends on the availability of adequate, equitable and sustainable 
financing for health.9 Despite a 280 per cent increase in the health budget in the past five 
years (according to data received from the Government after the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur), current Government expenditure on health in Tajikistan (2 per cent of GDP) is 
low by both international standards and when compared to the average of 5.<footnote name="7">2
 WHO, WHO-AIMS Report (see footnote 56), p. 27. </footnote> per cent in 
other former Soviet republics in 2010.10 Moreover, only 6 per cent of the national budget is 
allocated to health expenditure, which is well below the average for developing countries in 
Europe and Central Asia. Furthermore, in 2008, Tajikistan spent only $10.6 per capita on 
health, the lowest amount in the European-Central Asia region.11 The estimated cost of 
providing key health services in low-income countries is, however, more than four times 
higher, at approximately $44 per capita.12 During meetings with the Special Rapporteur, 
Government officials acknowledged that spending on health was too low. Increasing 
expenditure on health to meet international standards should therefore be of the utmost 
priority. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Primary health care 
</b></p>
<p>10. Many of the challenges that Tajikistan faces in developing its health system stem 
from the Semashko health system model inherited from the Soviet Union. The model relies 
on input-based financing and aims to provide a comprehensive set of health services. It 
traditionally focuses on infectious diseases and epidemic preparedness, which require large 
numbers of hospital beds and inpatient facilities staffed by specialized health workers. This 
results in the inefficient allocation of health funds to secondary and tertiary health care, and 
a health system that is unresponsive to the population&#8217;s health needs. It also leads to rigid 
budgetary allocation among health facilities, as authorities may not be able to transfer funds 
among facilities without transferring physical resources, such as hospital beds and staff.13 
Investment is thus directed towards specialized hospital institutions, leading to the 
underdevelopment of the primary health-care sector, excess capacity at the secondary and 
tertiary care levels, and the inefficient allocation of health funds and resources.

</p>
<p>11. States have a core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of minimum essential levels 
of the right to health, including available and accessible essential primary health care,14 
which is customarily defined as essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound 
and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals 
and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the 
community and country can afford.15  
</p>
<p>12. The primary health-care sector in Tajikistan remains, however, underdeveloped and 
underfunded, in part because primary care facilities do not feature a large volume of health 
system inputs (such as for hospital beds, costly medical equipment and staff), which largely 
determine the amount of funds allocated to health facilities by the Government. 
Consequently, the primary health-care sector is often perceived as providing poor quality 
services and thus underutilized. For example, the Government estimated in 2005 that up to 
80 per cent of people bypass primary health care and go directly to hospitals.16 Moreover, 
there is a shortage of trained primary health-care workers in Tajikistan. A variety of factors 
contribute to this deficit: the traditionally low status of primary health-care workers within 
the health sector; the fact that general practitioners receive less pay than specialists; and the 
absence of family medicine as a medical specialty in Tajikistan until only recently.17  
13. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that the Government acknowledges the 
above-mentioned shortcomings and has embraced reforms to address them. According to a 
joint annual review for 2011 conducted by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of 
Finance provided by the Government, qualifications in general and family medicine are 
now offered at State medical institutions, and doctors may be certified as family 
practitioners following a six-month retraining programme. Furthermore, basic benefits 
packages comprising basic medical services provided by primary health-care facilities have 
been introduced in three pilot districts. Tajikistan should increase investment in the primary 
health-care sector and ensure that expenditure on health does not disproportionately favour 
expensive curative health facilities, goods and services that benefit only a small sector of 
the population.18  
</p>
<p><b> B. Health financing reforms 
</b></p>
<p>14. In order to address the cases of inefficiency resulting from the country&#8217;s highly 
centralized finance systems, the Government began the process of decentralization 
following independence. As a result of this process, health funds from the central 
Government are now disbursed directly to the finance department of each provincial 
administration, and provinces have greater discretion in formulating local district health 
budgets. In this way, district and local governments are able to respond more dynamically 
to population concerns and to bring health expenditure into line with local health needs and 
preferences.19 Like many other former Soviet republics, however, decentralization was not

<p>accompanied by a coherent strategy to raise local managerial competence.20 For example, 
the Special Rapporteur learned during the visit that the resistance of certain Government 
entities to the efforts made to increase the level of discretion and amount of funds pooled at 
the province level was due to concerns relating to transparency, accountability and 
managerial competence. While commending Tajikistan on having initiated the process of 
decentralization, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to increase local stakeholder 
involvement in health-related decision-making in accordance with the right to health, and to 
build the capacity of local authorities in order to ensure efficient and transparent 
management of health funds and resources. 
</p>
<p>15. In order to increase funds for health, reduce out-of-pocket expenditures for the poor 
and promote access to health facilities, goods and services, the Government has introduced 
two pilot programmes: a fee-for-service programme in 236 health facilities, and a basic 
benefits package in eight districts. Out-of-pocket expenditures, namely payments for health 
goods and services made at the point of service delivery, including informal or &#8221;envelope&#8221; 
payments, are prevalent throughout the health system in Tajikistan. Such expenditures 
accounted for 66.5 per cent of total spending on health in 2010, a large percentage of which 
for expenditure on pharmaceuticals.21 Out-of-pocket expenditures for health goods and 
services have a disproportionate impact on the poor, who must pay a larger proportion of 
their income on health goods and services than other patients. As a consequence, poor 
households may experience financial difficulties and impoverishment, which discourages 
many from seeking health care in the first place. 
</p>
<p>16. The fee-for-service programme allows health facilities to charge a fee set by the 
State for certain hospital services. The programme has resulted in an increase in revenue for 
participating institutions, as well as an increase in the salaries of doctors, which has 
partially curbed the &#8220;brain drain&#8221; and financed the purchase of advanced medical 
equipment in participating hospitals. Increases in revenue under the programme have, 
however, been witnessed mostly in wealthy districts, particularly in Dushanbe. The vast 
majority of institutions have not seen the same benefits. Moreover, increases in doctors&#8217; 
salaries have been inconsistent, even in participating hospitals. Forty per cent of all revenue 
from the programme remains in the department in which it is collected, and the departments 
that experience the greatest increases in revenue under the programme are highly 
specialized.  
</p>
<p>17. The basic benefits package was designed to provide free access to primary health-
care services for all and free hospital services for certain groups, while others pay a formal 
co-payment. According to information provided by the Government, the categories 
exempted of payment include the poor and individuals with particular medical conditions 
with important public health consequences and/or expected high health care costs, such as 
tuberculosis and diabetes.22 Patients who are not exempt but have a referral from a primary 
health-care worker pay 30 per cent of the average cost of the required health service, while 
those without a referral pay 70 per cent.23 Even though free primary health care under the 
programme is meant to be subsidized largely by the State through a specific budget 
allocation, such an allocation has not been included in the health budget, and funding for 
free primary health care has relied primarily on funds collected by means of co-payments

<p>made for hospital services. This creates a problem, because revenue from such co-payments 
is earmarked for improving the quality of health services by securing an increase in 
doctors&#8217; salaries and raising the material and technical capacity of health facilities. 
According to a joint annual review for 2011 provided by the Government (see paragraph 13 
above), in 2011, only 27 per cent of funds collected from co-payments were allocated to the 
salaries of health-care workers. The programme is also underutilized because of poor public 
awareness and a lack of understanding among health-care workers, and has thus been 
ineffective in increasing access to primary health-care services for the poor.  
</p>
<p>18. Both the fee-for-services and the basic benefit package programmes have failed 
significantly to reduce out-of-pocket expenditures, including informal payments. They have 
not substantially increased access to hospital services for the poor either. Even though the 
poor and other vulnerable groups are meant to be exempt from fees under both 
programmes, they are still required to produce a certificate issued by a local commission in 
order to obtain free services. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur heard reports that, in 
practice, the poor are often unable to obtain such certificates for various reasons. The fee-
for-service programme is also being extended to include more health facilities and, in some 
instances, fees are charged for primary health-care services. This is a cause for concern, 
because it will lead to an increase in out-of-pocket expenditure, which may result in further 
underutilization of primary health-care services, particularly among the poor. 
</p>
<p>19. In 2011, pursuant to the national health sector strategy for the period 2010-2020, an 
inter-agency technical working group on health financing reached an agreement to 
implement a pilot programme in 2013 involving the pooling of health funds at the province 
level in Sughd province. Pooling funds for health allows for the cross-subsidization of 
financial risks associated with health care between different groups across large populations 
and the transfer of health funds from the wealthy to the poor and the healthy to the sick. 
Under the pilot programme, primary health care in each district would be funded from the 
province pool on a per capita basis through local taxes supplemented with national tax 
revenues in order to ensure equity between districts. Funds for primary health care would 
be allocated to the basic benefits package, providing a much-needed funding source for it. 
National tax revenues from the pool at the province level would be allocated to hospital 
facilities on a case-based payment rather than on the hospital-bed based method currently 
used. At the time of the visit, the programme was suspended owing to a number of concerns 
expressed by various stakeholders. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
address these concerns urgently with a view to implementing the pilot programme in Sughd 
province.

<p>order to improve the quality of health services and reduce the prevalence of informal 
payments throughout the health system. The quality of medical education in Tajikistan 
should be significantly improved and standards should be developed and implemented to 
ensure uniform qualifications throughout the health sector.  
</p>
<p>21. The right to health requires that everyone have access to quality health care and that 
the State provide a healthy environment. The lack of appropriate mechanisms to deal with 
any possible unjustifiable medical error (namely, those due to negligence or malpractice) 
not only denies those directly affected the compensation to which they should be entitled, 
but also prevent the State from identifying problematic patterns. It also prevents States from 
taking measures that could prevent repetition of such mistakes, which, in undermining the 
quality of available health care, would constitute a violation of the right to health. Anyone 
who is a victim of medical negligence or malpractice should thus have access to effective 
judicial or other appropriate remedies at the national level and should be entitled to 
adequate reparation, such as restitution, compensation, satisfaction or guarantees of non-
repetition.24 The health system in Tajikistan, however, suffers from a lack of remedies and 
accountability for medical malpractice, which further erodes the public&#8217;s trust in the health 
system and the medical profession. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a 
number of individuals with serious complaints relating to poor treatment resulting from 
medical negligence. In each case, the relevant authorities had not adequately investigated 
their complaints and the people affected lacked access to remedies under the law. In that 
context, the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman in Tajikistan has an important role to 
play in addressing these concerns. According to the information received, however, the 
Office has to date lacked sufficient capacity and has not adequately fulfilled its mandate in 
this regard. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take immediate steps to 
ensure that victims of medical negligence and malpractice have access to appropriate legal 
remedies, including compensation for physical and emotional damages, and that the system 
set up also provides information allowing authorities to detect and address problematic 
patterns.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Prevention, treatment and control of tuberculosis  
</b></p>
<p>22. Article 12, paragraph 2 (c) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights requires States to take measures to prevent, treat and control diseases, 
which includes an obligation to prevent, treat and control tuberculosis. The right to health 
also requires States to ensure that good quality health facilities, goods and services are 
available and accessible to all on a non-discriminatory basis, and in particular to those 
belonging to vulnerable or marginalized categories.25 People living with tuberculosis are 
vulnerable as a result of stigmatization and discrimination, poverty and the greater 
likelihood that they are members of groups that are otherwise vulnerable, such as people 
living with HIV, migrant workers and people living in remote areas. The Special 
Rapporteur stresses the fact that States are required to ensure that health-care workers are 
trained to recognize and respond to the specific needs of vulnerable or marginalized groups, 
including people living with tuberculosis.26  
</p>
<p>23. The Government of Tajikistan has acknowledged that tuberculosis poses a serious 
challenge to the country. The rate of tuberculosis prevalence in Tajikistan (350 per 100,000

<p>people)27 is very high compared with average levels in other high-burden countries (222 per 
100,000 people),28 and much higher than the regional average (170 per 100,000 people).29 
Tajikistan remains one of 27 countries with a high-burden of multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis, with 13 per cent of all new cases of tuberculosis and 54 per cent of all 
retreatment cases having multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.30 Furthermore, only 3 per cent of 
all newly notified cases of tuberculosis were tested for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 
2010.31 Approximately 4 per cent of all cases of tuberculosis in Tajikistan have a co-
infection with HIV,32 which is also a major concern that makes it difficult to lower the 
death rate from tuberculosis.  
</p>
<p><b> A. National tuberculosis programme 
</b></p>
<p>24. Efforts to prevent, treat and control tuberculosis in Tajikistan are funded largely by 
international donors. As a result of significant foreign assistance, the capacity of 
laboratories and polyclinics has been strengthened; some have been provided with the latest 
technology, including advanced diagnostic equipment.33 Despite annual increases in State 
allocations, however, the State still does not allocate sufficient funds to meet the country&#8217;s 
needs in the prevention, treatment and control of tuberculosis. As a result, Tajikistan is 
overly dependent on external funding, which could threaten the sustainability of efforts to 
prevent, treat and control the disease in the country.  
</p>
<p>25. A number of factors contribute to the high prevalence of tuberculosis and its multi-
drug-resistant forms in Tajikistan: the underdevelopment of the primary health-care system; 
the less than comprehensive detection and incomplete collection of health information at 
the primary health-care level; the shortage of health-care workers in rural and remote areas; 
inadequate infection control and treatment in prisons; the interruption of prisoners&#8217; 
treatment on their release; a lack of coordination between the State and the health 
authorities of neighbouring countries to ensure access to treatment services for migrant 
workers; and the stigmatization and discrimination of people living with tuberculosis. The 
Special Rapporteur commends the Government for having implemented a pilot Directly 
Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) programme in 2002, and for subsequently 
extending it to all provinces and districts in 2007. In 2010, the Government also established 
a national tuberculosis control programme to combat multi-drug-resistant types of 
tuberculosis.  
</p>
<p>26. Under the national tuberculosis control programme, primary health care is intended 
to be the main level of detection for tuberculosis. Completing diagnostics and sputum

<p>collection at the primary health-care level in the community promotes early case detection, 
which lowers transmission rates, results in better health outcomes and reduces costs to 
patients who would otherwise incur transportation and accommodation expenses.34 Given, 
however, that the primary health-care sector in Tajikistan is underfunded and 
underdeveloped, primary health-care workers tend to refer patients suspected of having 
tuberculosis to specialists rather than provide basic diagnostic services, such as collecting 
sputum and conducting smear microscopy tests. In accordance with the right to health, 
diagnostic services should be available in the community in order to promote early 
detection and ensure universal access, particularly for the poor and people living in rural 
and remote areas. The Special Rapporteur therefore encourages the Government to continue 
to develop the primary health-care system and to integrating tuberculosis detection efforts 
fully into primary health-care services. 
</p>
<p>27. Interrupted access to medicines for poor and physically isolated populations in the 
DOTS programme remains a major concern. The right to health requires that health 
facilities, goods and services be physically and economically accessible to everyone 
without discrimination, including socially disadvantaged groups.35 The law requires that 
treatment services and medicines for tuberculosis be made available free-of-charge in 
Tajikistan.36 According to health-care providers and persons living with tuberculosis in four 
districts of the country, however, the cost of health care is the main obstacle to access to 
testing and treatment for the disease.37 Costs include out-of-pocket expenditure on 
treatment services, medicines, transportation and informal payments to health-care 
workers.38 High transportation costs limit physical access to services provided at treatment 
centres, including primary health-care facilities.39 The inability to afford or to have physical 
access to appropriate and uninterrupted treatment for tuberculosis has been shown to lower 
detection and adherence rates.40 Moreover, in many cases, improper or interrupted 
treatment leads to the development of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, such as multi-
drug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Treatment services 
and medicines for the latter forms are more costly and less readily available than those for 
standard tuberculosis, the duration of treatment regimens are significantly longer, treatment 
side effects are more severe, and treatment success rates are substantially lower.41 The 
greater financial burden associated with the treatment of such forms of tuberculosis is not 
only borne by people living with tuberculosis, but also by the State.

<p><b> B. Tuberculosis and migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>28. According to some estimates, 620,000 Tajik citizens are migrant workers and one in 
every four households reports a family member involved in labour migration. Tajik migrant 
workers are vulnerable as a group owing to their often irregular legal status in host 
countries, the poor working and living conditions they endure and their limited access to 
affordable health services. In some cases, Tajiks living with tuberculosis migrate for work, 
and subsequently lack access to treatment services in the host country. In other cases, Tajik 
migrant workers contract tuberculosis in the host country and have no access to the 
necessary testing and treatment there.42 Migrant workers living with tuberculosis are 
particularly vulnerable because of the stigma associated with the disease, the likelihood that 
they may lose their jobs if their status is revealed, and the threat of deportation from their 
host country.  
</p>
<p>29. Migration increases the risk of transmission of tuberculosis, particularly if migrants 
originate in countries with high rates of prevalence.43 The high costs associated with the 
treatment of tuberculosis abroad coupled with poor awareness of disease prevention and 
transmission further increases the incidence of tuberculosis among migrant workers.44 
Studies have also shown that tuberculosis treatment adherence rates among migrant 
workers are lower than for other groups.45 As a result, migrant workers constituted 10.2 per 
cent of newly registered cases of tuberculosis in Tajikistan in 2007.46 The right to health 
requires States to pay particular attention to all vulnerable and marginalized groups, 
including migrant workers, in national health strategies.47 The Special Rapporteur therefore 
urges the Government to take concrete steps towards addressing the heightened 
vulnerability of Tajik migrant workers to tuberculosis, including through targeted 
interventions and cooperation with host countries. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Tuberculosis in the penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>30. Tuberculosis among prisoners is a matter of great concern in Tajikistan. The State 
has an obligation to ensure the enjoyment of the right to health of prisoners by, inter alia, 
refraining from denying or limiting their access to health services.48 Moreover, prisoners 
living with tuberculosis are a particularly vulnerable as a result of the stigma associated 
with the disease and their complete dependence on access to health facilities, goods and 
services. In 2008, the DOTS programme was fully implemented within the penitentiary 
system and access to testing and treatment for tuberculosis improved. Treatment for multi-
drug-resistant tuberculosis has been available in prisons since 2009. The prevalence of 
tuberculosis and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis has not, however, decreased significantly 
since the implementation of the programme. The incidence of tuberculosis and mortality

<p>rates in prisons was 15 and 30 times higher, respectively, than in the general population.49 
A lack of timely testing and treatment in the penitentiary system exacerbates the burden of 
tuberculosis in prisons. In some cases, treatment starts as late as six to eight weeks after 
detection.50 Moreover, during his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that the prevalence 
of tuberculosis in prisons rose from 165 in 2007 to 195 in 2011, and that the prevalence of 
multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis dropped only slightly, from 22 in 2010 to 19 in 2011. The 
Special Rapporteur was also informed that the prevalence of HIV/tuberculosis co-infection 
in prisons rose from eight cases in 2010 to 21 in 2011, and that the prevalence of multi-
drug-resistant tuberculosis was 44 during the first five months of 2012. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to take concrete steps to increase the availability and 
accessibility of testing and treatment for tuberculosis in prisons. 
</p>
<p>31. The penitentiary system lacks an effective monitoring system and integrated 
electronic database to keep records of prisoners and recently released prisoners living with 
tuberculosis in order to ensure continued treatment upon transfer inside the penitentiary 
system or after release from prison.51 The transfer of prisoners living with tuberculosis 
inside the penitentiary system and a lack of coordination between prison and local health 
authorities thus results in interrupted treatment and raises the risk of multi-drug-resistant 
tuberculosis among prisoners, former prisoners and the general population. The lack of 
accurate medical records may also prevent health workers from providing appropriate 
treatment for prisoners living with tuberculosis who are transferred or released from 
prison.52 Moreover, lack of accurate information concerning the tuberculosis states of 
prisoners is an obstacle to effective infection control in prisons. The obligation of the State 
to prevent, treat and control disease includes the responsibility to use and improve 
epidemiological surveillance. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure an 
appropriate monitoring and medical records system is devised and implemented within the 
penitentiary system in order to prevent any interruption of treatment for current and former 
prisoners living with tuberculosis.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Stigma and discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the stigmatization and 
discrimination associated with people living with tuberculosis and HIV/tuberculosis co-
infection in Tajikistan. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was repeatedly informed 
that the stigma surrounding tuberculosis was a significant concern and that people living 
with HIV/tuberculosis co-infection had occasionally been denied treatment for tuberculosis 
in certain facilities. Stigma and discrimination discourage people living with tuberculosis 
from seeking testing and treatment, which in turn impedes prevention, treatment and 
control efforts.  
</p>
<p>33. Stigmatization in Tajikistan is rooted in poor public awareness of the prevention and 
transmission of tuberculosis. The Government should therefore increase its efforts to raise 
public awareness through mass, social and other media. The Special Rapporteur was 
pleased to learn that, in some instances, the Government had involved people living with 
tuberculosis and those who had recovered from the disease in awareness-raising campaigns 
along with other stakeholders, civil society and religious leaders. The participation of 
affected communities is central to the realization of the right to health and is necessary to

<p>ensure sustainable and effective prevention, treatment and control of tuberculosis in 
Tajikistan. The Government should ensure the right of people living with the disease to 
have personal health data treated with confidentiality, including information concerning 
testing and treatment. Ensuring the right to confidentiality promotes the utilization of 
testing and treatment services by those who might otherwise fear stigmatization. The 
Special Rapporteur therefore urges the Government to facilitate meaningful participation of 
people living with tuberculosis and other relevant stakeholders in all aspects of prevention, 
treatment and control efforts, and to protect the right to confidentiality in testing and 
treatment information in order to reduce the stigmatization of and discrimination against 
people living with the disease. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Mental health 
</b></p>
<p>34. Given that mental health is an essential component of the right to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of health, the State should ensure that good quality mental 
health facilities and goods and services are available, accessible and culturally appropriate 
for all. The obligation to fulfil the right to health requires the State to adopt and implement 
a national public health strategy and plan of action, which includes promoting and 
supporting the establishment of institutions providing counselling and mental health 
services.53 Moreover, the Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and 
the Improvement of Mental Health Care support the right of every person living with 
mental illness to be treated and cared for, as far as possible, in the community in which he 
or she lives.54 
</p>
<p>35. In 2005, Tajikistan signed the Mental Health Declaration and Action Plan for 
Europe, which called upon States Members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
establish mental health policies, programmes and legislation based on current knowledge 
and considerations regarding human rights, in consultation with all stakeholders in mental 
health.55 Tajikistan still lacks a comprehensive national plan addressing mental health. The 
Law on Psychiatric Care of 2002, the primary law governing the provision of mental health 
services in Tajikistan, has not been fully implemented and many of its provisions are 
outdated. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Government 
was considering amending the law and adopting a national mental health strategy. He 
encourages the Government to move promptly towards the adoption of the strategy and a 
comprehensive mental health policy based on the right to health and to ensure the active 
and informed participation of all relevant stakeholders, including people living with mental 
illness, in the decision-making process. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Mental health financing 
</b></p>
<p>36. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that Tajikistan currently allocates 
only 1.5 per cent of the health budget to mental health. There is no separate budget line 
item for psychiatric care in the health budget.56 This may indicate low prioritization of 
mental health in the country. By one estimate, budget allocations for mental health cover

<p>only 30 to 50 per cent of the actual needs of mental health facilities, and 70 per cent of the 
facilities do not receive funding for the procurement of equipment or municipal service 
payments.57 International donor funding has also been generally unavailable for mental 
health, which exacerbates the funding and resource shortage. The Special Rapporteur urges 
the Government to increase funding for mental health substantially as a matter of priority, 
and to allocate a greater proportion of mental health funds and resources to community-
based mental health facilities and services. 
</p>
<p>37. Moreover, the existing mental health physical infrastructure in Tajikistan is in 
disrepair and in need of substantial rebuilding. Owing to limited public funding, many 
psychiatric care facilities are unable to undertake even the most basic repairs.58 The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned at the poor conditions in mental health facilities, which often 
include a lack of basic sanitation and hygiene. Poor hygiene and lack of drinking water and 
food have contributed to the deteriorating physical health of hospitalized patients.59 
Prolonged electricity shortages are common, and patients in some psychiatric hospitals 
have died owing to deficient heating systems during the winter.60 Mental health facilities 
should be fitted with the necessary physical resources and equipment to meet basic sanitary 
standards and the diverse needs of people living with mental illness. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to take immediate steps to improve sanitation and 
hygiene in mental health facilities and to address physical infrastructure problems. 
</p>
<p>38. Inadequate budget allocation to mental health has severely restricted the availability 
and accessibility of culturally acceptable and good-quality mental health facilities, goods 
and services. The mental health system in Tajikistan relies too heavily on the 
institutionalization of people suffering from mental illness, including children, in mental 
hospitals, which make up the vast majority of the mental health infrastructure. Indeed, 84 
per cent of all Government spending on mental health goes to mental hospitals.61 The 
Government has started to reduce the number of hospital beds and to emphasize outpatient 
treatment in accordance with other health sector reforms. There are, however, no functional 
community health services available in the mental health field in Tajikistan.62 During his 
visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that community-based facilities were unable to obtain 
licenses to operate owing to an outdated and inefficient licensing system. Community-
based treatment allows people living with mental illness to remain in their communities 
while receiving treatment. It involves the participation of the community in treatment and 
rehabilitation, and is more cost-effective than inpatient treatment and hospitalization. 
Moreover, community-based treatment will contribute significantly to the reduction of the 
stigmatization of mental illness in Tajikistan. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the 
Government to take concrete steps to establish community-based treatment facilities and 
services for people living with mental illness in accordance with international medical and 
human rights standards.

<p><b> B. Psychiatric medicines and quality of mental health care 
</b></p>
<p>39. Under the right to health, States have an obligation to provide access to safe, 
efficacious and affordable medicines, and to ensure such access for vulnerable populations. 
Psychiatric medicines, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, are, however, rarely 
available in mental health facilities, particularly in poor and remote communities. The 
situation became particularly acute after the provision of free psychotropic treatment was 
discontinued in 2010.63 As a result, there has been an increase in self-medication and the 
use of traditional healers.64 Shortages in psychiatric medicines have also increased out-of-
pocket expenditures for patients, who must pay higher costs for treatment when they are not 
made available free of charge in mental health facilities.65 The widespread shortage of 
psychiatric medicines has further distanced psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness 
from mainstream medicine, disproportionately affecting people living with mental illnesses. 
This is in contrast to those who suffer from physical illness, for whom health goods and 
services are comparatively more accessible. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to improve the supply of psychiatric medicines in Tajikistan through the adoption of laws 
and policies that ensure that safe, efficacious and affordable medicines are available for 
people living with mental illness. 
</p>
<p>40. The primary factor limiting the availability of good-quality mental health services in 
Tajikistan is the lack of qualified mental health workers. There are only 1.8 psychiatrists 
per 100,000 people in Tajikistan,66 which is extremely low when compared with the 
situation in other countries in the region. Moreover, there are almost no psychologists and 
social workers in the country.67 Only 2 per cent of training for medical doctors and 1 per 
cent for nurses is devoted to mental health.68 As a result, there is a complete lack of 
psychosocial staff working in outpatient facilities, community-based psychiatric inpatient 
units and mental hospitals.69 The shortage of qualified mental health workers is even more 
acute in rural and remote areas, where psychiatrists are four times fewer than in urban 
areas.70 Moreover, given that mental health workers are not adequately remunerated, 
younger medical professionals are reluctant to work in mental health.71 Ten per cent of 
mental health workers leave the country within five years following graduation to pursue 
higher paying positions.72 The situation is more serious in the penitentiary system. During 
his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that the prison health system does not have any 
trained mental health workers on staff and relies, on a consultancy basis, solely on one 
doctor trained in mental health. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to raise 
salaries for mental health workers, to develop substantially incentive structures to promote

<p>mental health work and retain mental health professionals, and to improve working 
conditions in mental health facilities. 
</p>
<p>41. Coupled with the lack of mental health workers and severe shortages in psychiatric 
medicines, the poor quality of existing mental health services results in a system that fails 
to serve even the most basic needs of people living with mental illness in Tajikistan. People 
living with mental illness are often subject to restraints or seclusion as part of their 
treatment: 8.2 per cent of patients admitted to the republican psychoneurological hospital 
and 6 to 10 per cent of patients in community-based psychiatric inpatient units were found 
to have been restrained or secluded at least once,73 despite international principles holding 
that physical restraint or involuntary seclusion should be employed &#8220;only when it is the 
only means available to prevent immediate or imminent harm to the patient or others&#8221;.74 
Prevention, detection, diagnosis and monitoring of mental illness are also lacking at the 
primary health-care level. Primary health-care workers do not receive training in mental 
health; for this reason, many mental illnesses, such as depression, go undetected at the 
primary health-care level.75 This deficit further contributes to the mental health burden in 
Tajikistan and increases system-wide costs by failing to prevent more expensive, 
specialized hospital care.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Discrimination, abuse and informed consent in mental health care 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur was distressed to hear reports of abuses perpetrated against 
people living with mental illness in mental health facilities in Tajikistan. These include 
reports of sexual violence against patients by mental health workers and other patients, and 
acts of humiliation whereby patients were given narcotics and forced to perform for 
hospital staff and other patients. Such acts, if substantiated, amount to egregious violations 
of the right to health and infringements on the dignity and autonomy of people living with 
mental illness. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to investigate 
immediately these reports, to implement safeguards to prevent the abuse of people living 
with mental illness, and to ensure that all perpetrators of abuse are held accountable under 
the law.  
</p>
<p>43. The stigmatization of and discrimination against people living with mental illness in 
Tajikistan are a serious concern. Stigma and fear of discrimination discourage people living 
with mental illness from seeking treatment for fear of being identified as mentally ill. Their 
families are reluctant to participate in community-based programmes because of the stigma 
attached to acknowledging that a family member is mentally ill within the community. In 
some cases, families choose to abandon family members living with mental illness in 
mental health facilities.76 A family&#8217;s primary objective is often to disassociate itself from 
the stigma rather than seek appropriate treatment for the family member. Stigma 
surrounding mental illness is further generated and perpetuated by the registration system 
of people who receive treatment in mental health facilities. The Special Rapporteur learned 
that registration information is shared with employers, educational institutions and other 
State agencies. In some cases, the availability of such information results in discrimination 
against people living with mental illness, despite the requirement envisioned by the Law on 
Psychiatric Care on the confidentiality of mental health records. The right to be free from 
discrimination based on health status is a core component of the right to health. The 
registration system, as it is currently implemented, undermines the right to have personal

<p>health data treated with confidentiality and infringes on the dignity of people living with 
mental illness. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to eliminate the stigma 
associated with mental illness through public awareness and education campaigns, and to 
review its mental health registration system by assessing its impact on the rights of people 
living with mental illness. 
</p>
<p>44. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that patients were admitted to 
mental health facilities and received treatment without their explicit and informed consent, 
even though it is required by law in Tajikistan. In a visit to a mental health facility, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that the consent of relatives of those living with mental 
illness was accepted as a substitute for the consent of the patients themselves. This problem 
is compounded by the implementation of the Law on Psychiatric Care, which results in the 
characterization of involuntary admissions as emergency hospitalizations rather than 
involuntary ones.77 Moreover, people living with mental illness are often not informed of 
their health condition or diagnosis, nor involved in discussions about treatment plans nor 
given the opportunity to request alternative psychiatric examination.78 The right to health 
requires that the informed consent of all those who possess legal capacity be obtained prior 
to the administration of medical treatment. Securing the informed consent of people living 
with mental illness is fundamental to respect for their personal autonomy, self-
determination and human dignity. Adults, including those living with mental illness, are 
presumed to possess legal capacity and thus have the right to consent to, refuse, or choose 
an alternative medical intervention.79 Involuntary admission and treatment should only be 
allowed in exceptional circumstances, subject to specific and restrictive conditions, 
respecting best practices and applicable international standards.80 The Special Rapporteur 
calls upon the Government to ensure that the informed consent of all people living with 
mental illness is obtained prior to admission into mental health facilities or the 
administration of treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Mental health of women and domestic violence  
</b></p>
<p>45. According to one estimate, up to 50 per cent of women in Tajikistan experience 
physical, psychological or sexual violence perpetrated by their husbands or other family 
members.81 Tajikistan has no comprehensive health strategy to address the negative impact 
of domestic violence on physical and mental health of women. Doctors and health-care 
workers are not trained to screen and document instances of domestic violence. Tajikistan 
also lacks a functioning cross-referral system between health facilities and support services 
to protect victims of violence.82 As a result, the limited number of programmes that offer 
psychological counselling and temporary protection are not sufficiently integrated into the 
health system and fail to cover the majority of women in need.83 Women from rural and

<p>remote communities, who account for the majority of women in Tajikistan,84 are especially 
vulnerable owing to their limited access to health facilities and services when compared 
with their urban counterparts.85 In accordance with to the right to health, Tajikistan should 
take special measures to protect the physical and mental health of women who are victims 
of or at risk of violence.86  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports of a correlation between high 
rates of domestic violence against women and rising levels of suicide among women and 
young people in Tajikistan. The gender ratio for suicide in the Sughd region is one to one 
male to female, as against the four to one male to female ratio in developed countries.87 
According to WHO, gender-based violence is a significant predictor of suicide in women.88 
A survey in Tajikistan found that 70 per cent of women who had suicidal thoughts and 70 
per cent of those who had attempted suicide reported experiencing physical violence from 
their husbands.89 Another study found that women from families that believe a woman 
should be beaten if she talks to a man who is not a relative are twice as likely to be suicidal 
than those from other families.90 The societal perception that domestic violence is a private 
family matter is also a driving factor in female suicide and impairs the ability of mental 
health workers to assess and treat victims of domestic violence appropriately.91 Other 
factors affecting the incidence of suicide in Tajikistan include forced marriage, child abuse 
and regressive notions of gender roles.92 The lack of mental health services and early 
detection of mental illness at the primary health-care level contribute substantially to this 
problem. 
</p>
<p>47. Following her mission to Tajikistan in 2008, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, pointed to the lack of a protective 
infrastructure and practices by law enforcement and judicial bodies as a reason for 
underreporting of violence against women in the country.93 Health professionals are 
nonetheless required by law to report cases of domestic violence to law enforcement 
authorities in Tajikistan. While reporting requirements are professedly protective, they 
infringe upon a woman&#8217;s right to have personal health data treated with confidentiality, and 
generate and perpetuate stigma surrounding victims of domestic violence.94 Reporting is 
also thought to deter some women from seeking help from health services.95 Furthermore,

</p>
<p>such laws have a chilling effect on the provision of mental health services. Mental health 
workers fearing criminal prosecution may be unwilling to treat victims of domestic 
violence, and victims of violence may be deterred from seeking mental health services out 
of the fear of public exposure and further domestic abuse. These laws thus restrict the 
availability and accessibility of mental health services and expose women to a greater risk 
of suicide. Health workers should therefore not be required by law to report cases of 
domestic violence to law enforcement authorities. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to consider adopting a legal regime that is protective of victims, enabling them 
to quickly obtain protective orders, and that integrates counselling and treatment for 
negative physical and mental health outcomes resulting from domestic violence.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>48.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the progress made in 
Tajikistan since the cessation of civil conflict in 1997. In particular, the Government 
of Tajikistan should be commended for having significantly reduced poverty in the 
country and for having recently initiated health sector reforms. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue health sector reforms in 
accordance with the right to health, to ensure universal access to good-quality health 
facilities, goods and services for all. In that context, the Special Rapporteur notes with 
appreciation the Government&#8217;s communication after his visit that a plan of action had 
been prepared for the implementation of his recommendations, and encourages the 
Government to ensure effective participation of civil society and community 
representatives in the implementation and monitoring of the plan.
