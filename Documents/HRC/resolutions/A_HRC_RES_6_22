</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/22. From rhetoric to reality: a global call for concrete 
action against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>its resolution 3/2 of 8 December 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> General Assembly resolution 61/149 of 19 December 2006 in which 
</p>
<p>the Assembly decided to convene the Durban Review Conference in 2009, 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring </i>the surge and sharp increases in xenophobic and racial tendencies in 
</p>
<p>certain regions of the world, particularly towards those categories of victims already 
</p>
<p>identified in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action such as migrants, 
</p>
<p>refugees, asylum-seekers, people of African descent, people of Asian descent and 
</p>
<p>national and ethnic minorities, 
</p>
<p><i> Regretting </i>the lack of political will to take decisive steps to combat racism in all 
</p>
<p>its forms and manifestations and to concretely move away from denials about the 
</p>
<p>persistence of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i>, in the above context, the imperative need to end posturing about 
</p>
<p>racism and calling on all States to resolutely end impunity for acts of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and to face the everyday realities 
</p>
<p>and challenges of these scourges, 
</p>
<p><i> Absolutely convinced </i>that the failure by States to translate the Durban 
</p>
<p>commitments into concrete action and tangible results is attributable to a lack of 
</p>
<p>political will, in particular with respect to honouring the memory of the victims of 
</p>
<p>historical injustices and past tragedies caused by slavery, the slave trade, the 
</p>
<p>transatlantic slave trade, apartheid, colonialism and genocide, and also underlining that 
</p>
<p>Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian descent and </p>

<p>indigenous peoples were victims of these injustices and tragedies and continue to be 
</p>
<p>victims of their consequences, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>in the above context, the importance of closing these dark chapters 
</p>
<p>in history through reconciliation and healing, and calling on all concerned States to 
</p>
<p>assume their moral obligation to halt and reverse the lasting and cascading 
</p>
<p>consequences of these practices prior to the convening of the 2009 Durban Review 
</p>
<p>Conference, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the efforts of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action since its inception 
</p>
<p>in 2002, by upholding and promoting the spirit of Durban, and registering some 
</p>
<p>progress in spite of the obvious challenges, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides </i>to realign the work and name of the Anti-Discrimination Unit in 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights consistent with 
</p>
<p>its mandate and that henceforth, this Unit shall be known as &#8220;The Anti-Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination Unit&#8221;, and that its operational activities shall focus exclusively on 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as defined in 
</p>
<p>paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Durban Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages </i>closer collaboration between the Intergovernmental Working 
</p>
<p>Group and the Independent Eminent Experts on ways and means of achieving enhanced 
</p>
<p>political will and commitment to combating all the contemporary manifestations of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance of demonstrating goodwill to humanity and 
</p>
<p>the primacy of reconciliation, by taking concrete steps towards the implementation of 
</p>
<p>key issues of concern to the victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance, which relate to the restoration of their dignity and equality as 
</p>
<p>envisaged in paragraphs 98 to 106 of the Durban Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Regrets </i>that the commitments made in paragraphs 157 and 158 of the 
</p>
<p>Durban Programme of Action remain unfulfilled; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides </i>to remain seized of this important issue.
